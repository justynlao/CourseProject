"Do you watch nets games? Bruce brown literally comes off the bench solely for defense. And he’s one of our best defensive players. We just signed iman shumpert for defense. Harris provides spacing for our team that *no one* aside from KD, Harden, and Irving provide. He is very very important to our team. But I’m not shocked after he makes a boneheaded pass in the wizards game everyone says “TrAdE hArRiS”  In no world can we let TLC, Iman, Bruce Brown, etc play on the wing as a catch and shoot guard. Nevermind the fact that none of them can drive into the paint like Harris."
Shamet can’t even do anything but shoot and he barely does that anymore. Just bench him and play Bruce Brown
that’s why we love bruce brown and are keen for shump to come in
Bruce Brown deserves more love
"Put in Jordan for rebounding, put in Bruce Brown for defense, put in Shamet for shooting..."
"i genuinely have no clue how he got the reputation of a player developer because of 6 young guys hes had with the pistons before this season, only bruce brown has shown significant development. its mind-boggling"
"You know what's interesting. One of the other 9 guards was Bruce Brown who accomplished the same feat on Jan 13, 2021. You already have your josh hart!"
I would’ve put Bruce Brown. He’s been decent lately
"Bruce Brown is by far their best defender, but he's really too small to be THAT impactful, especially against teams that don't really run their offense trought their guards, and no matter how good he can be, he can be screened of and then it's over when the screener's man is Deandre Jordan  Overall the ""anchor"" should be KD if he wanted to, he's the guy that has proved (the 2016 Playoffs, his first year in GS) that he can be an elite help defender but he also just came back from 18 months without playing and he's (understandably) more eager to reestablish himself as an elite scorer/mvp level player offensively"
"It's nice to see Westbrook look something other than totally cooked.   But man, remember how KD complained about all the Warriors ""beautiful basketball"" and just wanted to get the ball in the post and go to work? Part of the *point* of all the off-ball movement and shifting offensive sets is that it makes it easier to make entry passes.   On this possession, it's incredibly obvious exactly what the Nets want to do. Watch the replay and notice how Beal is able to cheat completely over off his man in the weak side corner, taking away the backdoor cut from KD. Without that, it's be trivially easy to make the over-the-top entry pass to KD going to the basket for an easy dunk.  But with the Warriors' type of offense, where KD complained about all the passing and off-ball movement, you'd have Joe Harris and Bruce Brown running a little two man game on the weak side, or maybe Joe coming up off staggered screens from Brown and Green.   So Beal couldn't cheat to the center of the lane. So Russ couldn't front that hard.   Or once the entry pass was denied, KD would pop and set a screen for the ball handler, with the goal of attacking Beal as the help defender to kick out to Harris.   Instead the team is so static, so focused on getting the ball to KD, that once that's taken away, that the play devolves into a drive from Harris, who is one of the best spot-up shooters in the league but not a particularly good driver.  People get upset about Kerr's coaching because he doesn't run enough straight pick and roll, and KD complained about it because he just wanted to get the ball in the post and go to work, but this play is a perfect example of why KD was wrong. The ""give KD what he wants"" offense resulted here in a late-shot-clock iso from a guy who is not a good iso player."
"Eh, it's honestly Bruce Brown that's their best defender. Though KD has looked good so far, but who knows how things will go as wear and tear piles up."

The only guy on regular rotation that is capable of holding down some ground is Bruce Brown.
Bruce brown: fine I’ll do it myself
"Kemba can cover Kyrie decently for stretches, we've seen that before. It's not a terrible matchup for him. JJ probably doesn't play as much against them or the Pacers or the Bucks as against ya'll or the Heat, but you can definitely put Kemba on Kyrie and JJ on Harris for stretches. There's also Shamet getting his 15-20 minutes. So, two decent matchups for JJ, and I wouldn't be too worried about putting him on Bruce Brown or Cabarrot for stretches either.   I'm not saying JJ will be in our crunch time lineup against the Nets, but him getting between 15-22 minutes definitely has value. He'd be taking minutes from players like Teague, Pritchard, Langford, and pushing Smart up to wing more often, reducing some minutes from players like Grant, Semi, Green and the like.   All that said, my position for the Celtics has been to hold tight onto assets and young players this year, stay under the tax threshold, and use the TPE next offseason to jump back into tax range (while avoiding the repeater). So while I think JJ would be a really useful player for us, I'd prefer to pass on him unless the price is extremely low and it would be possible for us to sign him for cheap this next year."
Kyrie/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris/Jeff Green/DeAndre Jordan is honestly kinda good in this scenario
"It’s embarrassing that people think Jonathan Clay Redick would be useless on the Brooklyn Nets. He would for sure get ~20mpg in the playoffs off the bench.   There’s currently only one player on the bench that I trust to be part of the playoff rotation in Jeff Green and he’s going to get most his minutes at the 5 in the playoffs. Bruce Brown is decent, but Jonathan Clay Redick would be an upgrade.   If all it took was Spencer Dinwiddie and a second round pick... I’d do it instantly. The Brooklyn Nets need a power forward, wing or guard more than a center. The center position is overrated in 2021. Not worried at all when they have 5.7M to offer to two players (each) in the buyout market.   The Brooklyn Nets have only one open roster spot left? I didn’t know you couldn’t waive players on teams anymore...."
Bruce brown is the best center on the Nets
"No, Bruce Brown is easily above average"
Bruce Brown on the Nets.
"I have nothing to add here other than that [wholesome Kyrie and Harden pic](https://i.redd.it/ocqtlpsghee61.jpg)  On a more serious note our bench finally played well, not a single bad performer last night. Harden and Kyrie were efficient as always and the likes of TLC, Shamet and Perry were finally hitting their shots. Loved the ball movement as well, both Harden and Kyrie kept involving everyone. Bruce Brown is a stud. The soft doubles the Thunder tried didn’t work at all, Kyrie just dribbled out of them and Harden kept finding an open shooter. A couple of good additions from the buyout market and this team can be really, really good."
Bruce Brown
We gave Bruce Brown away for free lol
Thank Bruce Brown
And the underrate Bruce Brown speed things along nicely
Bruce Brown is the MVP.  Also Harden had 10 assists and 1 turnover. He's getting that chemistry. I love it.
Bruce Brown
"Ok, Bruce Brown is MVP"
Bruce brown.
Really only deep teams play 10 or more   9 is extremely common in close games.   The real problem is their center is only playing 22m and he’s the only big. If one Bruce brown or TLC was a big then they would be fine I think
"hey we have Joe, Jeff and Bruce Brown as well"
Trying to win games since they have 0 available depth aside from BRUCE GOAT BROWN.
Trae young defense makes Bruce brown look like a serviceable nba player lol
"Opponent PPG probably goes down a smidge if they stop turning the ball over so damn much.  But yeah, Bruce Brown needs more minutes and they need an athletic defensive big. This is all known."
"KD and Bruce Brown are positive, team can’t properly function when KD is benched tbh.    And Nash has yet to realize Brown is the best guard defender he has."
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown looks like he has a separate workout day for only lateral raises
Bruce Brown is god
"Nets played well when Kyrie was out and Bruce brown was at the point playing solid D, not to mention KD is a pretty good defender as well. But when kyrie and harden are both on the floor, at least when I was watching, they seemed to be a defensive liability at the guard spot. That being said it is a new team and hopefully they are capable of finding ways for the two to remain on the floor together and not sacrifice too much on the defensive end, that or find minutes for Defensively minded guys like Bruce brown. With their level of talent and the coaching staff that team has they’ll prolly figure something out."
"The money only works if you trade Dinwiddie(doable and slightly scummy) or DJ(not happening). Combining all tradeable role players (Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarot, Bruce Brown and Claxton) is still 400K short. If you wait another month, Tyler Johnson could be subbed in for Luwawu-Cabarot and make it work."
Bruce Brown good
"Honestly, I thought of that after I sent. Maybe give up Bruce brown or TLC + 2nd round pick (assuming that they have any left)"
Get a single positive perimeter defender that isn’t named Bruce Brown and a single positive rim protector.
Bruce Brown shooting the ball is a win for the Cavs defense
Did I forget to mention that I love Bruce Brown?
"Next time Steve Nash plays Bruce Brown less than 20mins, I'm gonna protest outside Barclay's Center"
BRUCE MFN BROWN
"Bruce Brown is definitely the Draymond of our team, in a good way"
Bruce Brown needed more arc on that floater
bruce brown starting wow
Harris seems like their clear 4th best player. Bruce Brown seems pretty good too. Deandre... we already know about him
"Reject TLC, embrace Bruce brown"
"TLC is ass man, embrace Bruce Brown. We also got Claxton in the hyperbolic time-chamber"
"Yeah, I agree. That’s why I think Nash should try and stagger Kyrie and Hardens minutes as much as possible, and have them play alongside someone that can make up for their defensive issues. Like in the Jazz game when Kyrie played a lot of his minutes with Bruce Brown, Bruce guarded Donovan most of the game and was just a pest on defense which took a big load off of Kyrie.   I really hope we’re able to snag someone like PJ Tucker in the buyout, someone that’s a lot more active on that side of the ball. Also helps that he already has that chemistry with D’Antoni, Harden and Green."
"Harden and KD can play average defense, Harden at the end of games is definitely above average (most of the time at least)   They’ll need to play Bruce Brown more and move Dinwiddie or Harris for a big. Or they can do nothing and hope that some people ring chasers this offseason which would definitely propel them and plug their holes next season   I don’t think they’ll ever be top 5 and maybe even top 10 will be a stretch but the offensive potential is literally through the roof.   So if can get to above average defensively, and have key defensive guys, I don’t believe it’ll be too much of a problem. It’s just whether they make a move right now, or wait"
"Nah I watched the game, Kyrie couldn’t keep up with Collin for most of the game. He’s not a good defender lol  Not taking anything away from Sexton, but Bruce brown would have made it a lot harder than Kyrie."
"Levert was redundant, he wasn't really good in the games Kyrie and KD both played. Guys like Bruce Brown, Shamet even TLC can replace those mins and while they are way worse players, the can fit better, and Levert shot creation isn't needed anymore (and really wasn't before the trade when everybody was there)  Taurean Prince is an absolutely terrible player  So really they lost Allen, and yeah that's a huge loss... but it's James Harden"
"Rotation is at least 8 deep. Starters + Joe Harris, Bruce Brown and TLC"
"It's really not an exaggeration. You're overvaluing those guys. Jeff Green hasn't been useful in two years. TLC sucks. Shamet isn't shooting like he was.   Bruce Brown I kind of like, but he was honestly just getting big minutes at the end of the season last year with Detroit because they were trying to lose."
Bruce Brown has really good defensive intangibles and he got 7 minutes last night.
"As a Hurricanes fan, the, like 6-7 games when Bruce Brown and Lonnie Walker we’re on the court together were the most excited I’ve been as a fan.   Of course, injuries ruined that season but I’m glad they’re both at least getting some run nowadays. Brown may be the best defender left on this team so not sure why he wouldn’t play more for a team that sorely needs it."
Isn’t Bruce Brown pretty good?
"Kyrie, kd, harden, green who’s been lights out, Harris who is shooting &gt;50% from three, dj, Bruce brown, tlc, shamet, perry, Claxton when healthy, plus three open spots. But yea nets don’t even have 6 nba players."
If only they had someone like Bruce Brown to defend players like Sexton
Nets badly need a big man and some bench pieces. Literally besides Bruce Brown their entire bench is useless. And DeAndre Jordan will get destroyed by any above average big man in the playoffs. Sean Marks is a pretty smart GM so he better have something planned up his sleeve or this won't turn out pretty.
"It's pretty odd to me that Bruce Brown only got 7 minutes in a game where the Nets clearly needed a stronger defensive presence. Dude's got a broken jump shot, but he's one of the best defenders on the team, and they played with 4 shooters on the floor for half the game anyway."
"They need KD to be 2016 playoffs/early 2017 Warriors KD on defense if they want to have a good defense.  I love Bruce Brown and he'd help a lot, but they need help defense at the rim, and they won't get it from their centers (unless the Claxton kid comes back and does it, IDK his game)"
You’re still expecting Bruce Brown to be your #1 defender
"I'll say more like 7, cause I'm counting Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown
We have an excellent on ball defender in Bruce Brown who Nash decided not to use for some reason.
TFW nash literally played 6 players 40+ minutes and didnt play TLC or bruce brown at all
They are bad bad bad on defense.  Very predictable considering Bruce Brown is there only good perimeter defender with Dinwiddie out.  KD isn’t very good on the perimeter anymore.  He’s basically a PF defensively and maybe he can switch on to bigger wings.
"claxton, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown is a star don't you dare
Don't sleep on Bruce Brown!
Im thinking Bruce Brown
"Im tired of people saying the Nets have no depth after the trade as if their own team has All Stars down to the 15th man. *Here's the Clippers top 9*  Kawhi/PG/Ibaka/Lou/Beverly/Kennard/Morris/Batum/Zubac   Very impressive top nine. Id say better than the Nets. Now here's the rest of their roster. Amir Coffey/Reggie Jackson/Kabengale/Terrance Man,/Daniel OToru/Patt Patterson/Jay Scrubb Im sorry if im the only one who doesn't think any of those guys are above Average NBA players. That looks like a pretty shite back of rotation.    *Now here's the Nets top 9* KD/Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Green/Deandre/Shamet/Bruce Brown/TLC  And the rest of the roster  Dinwddie/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton/Reggie Perry/3 open roster spots The Nets have the bi annual exception and a disabled player exception to use to fill those open spots. As i said imo the Clippers top 9 is better than the Nets top 9 even though its close. But the Clippers ""depth"" doesn't seem better than the Nets at all. And the Nets have money to improve their depth and all their 2nd round picks to trade."
"Bucks:  PG: Jrue / Augustin  SG: DiVincenzo / Forbes  SF: Middleton / Connaughton   PF: Giannis / Torrey Craig  C: Lopez / Portis   Nets:  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown  SG: Harden / Shamet  SF: Joe Harris / TLC  PF: KD / Jeff Green  C: DAJ / Claxton   Am I the only one who doesn't think that their benches are that terrible? I think both teams are in desperate need of a proper backup center, but if you wanted to reduce each team down to an 8-man rotation you could do that with ease.   I will admit though that I am kinda worried about the Bucks bench guys on the defense end; Augustin is a solid backup floor general but is undersized. Forbes and Portis have been known to be black holes on defense.  I get what you're saying about the weaknesses in both of their rotations but I'm decently high on the guys. Obviously the talent is top heavy but they aren't scrubs by any means."
"Pack the paint (Big + J. Green) against Giannis and cover Middleton with the best wing defender (Durant or Bruce Brown).   Force Giannis to take 35-50% TS shots on the perimeter and mid-range. Not afraid to Foul him if he attacks the rim.  Let Donte, Jrue and Brook (55% TS) beat you.  Done.  The question is how are you going to cover Durant, Harden, Irving, and Harris, all of whom can pour it on at 60-65% TS"
But still not quite as good as Bruce Brown
That was Bruce Brown twerking
KD and Harden aren’t horrible defensively. Bruce Brown ain’t bad either. Need more on the buyout market though
Yes. Joey Buckets and Bruce Brown are assasins.
I think din will be on the bench and Harris will be a starter. But din would still be our sixth man unless Bruce brown takes that job by force
"Can only speak for the Nets because I don't know the bucks roster that well, but the have kd, kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ, Jeff Green, TLC (luwawu cabbarot, no idea how to spell it lol), Bruce brown and Landry shamet as solid rotation pieces. However u slice it, they have 3 solid players coming off the bench imo. They're real weakness is bigs for defense and rebounding, which they desperately need. With how well they shot this game, it should not have come down to the last possession."
"True, but dude had an arm around the screener on 4 straight plays and got beat. Just shows that we don’t have a straight defender other than Bruce brown rn"
"The bench is actually good. Bruce Brown is excellent, Joe Harris is averging 15 a game in incredible efficacy, and guys like TLC and Shamet can get hot any game."
Bruce Brown with the phenomenal defense without fouling
"He called Bruce Brown, Sterling Brown. Sterling Brown is on the Rockets"
Phenomenal defense by Bruce Brown
"Fully healed we have a decent bench. Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, TLC."
Wasn’t too familiar with Bruce Brown but I am now
i forgive Sean Marks getting that scrub Shamet since he also got us this beautiful Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown was such a good pickup damn
Bruce Brown is the man
Bruce Brown was such a lowkey good acquisition. They got him for basically norhing
Baby shark Bruce brown baby
Bruce Brown just outmuscling fools
I love Bruce Brown
&gt; He's like wayyyy better Bruce Brown for them on offense.  Bruce Brown cuts off-ball. Blake just stands there and has shot 28% 3pt the last 2 seasons - barely better than Brown's 27% 3pt this year.   I'll take Brown.
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
"Iguodala played with 3 of the best shooter of all time, it was a very specific set up for Draymond, Iggy and Livingston just like for a guy like Bruce Brown now in Brooklyn for example.  But on most teams, a role player that can't shoot is a problem come playoff time."
Imagine Blake being told he's the backup to DAJ and Bruce Brown.
I don’t think you fully understand what is going to happen if playoff Embiid sees Bruce Brown at center for even 10 minutes a night.
&gt; He's like wayyyy better Bruce Brown for them on offense.  Questionable
Bruce Brown gets spoonfed baskets too. They don't need Griffin to convert open layups.
"Offense is not Brookyln's problem, Bruce Brown gets spoonfeed and he is their only good defender right now  Bruce Brown is a much better fit for them lol"
"He's like wayyyy better Bruce Brown for them on offense.   Dude is going to get spoonfed baskets from Harden and Kyrie, no wonder he wanted to go there."
"plus he’s good friends with Kyrie, and can reunite with former Pistons Blake Griffin and Bruce Brown"
"We'll need to start rotating our lines like in hockey.  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ is the first line.  Shamet, Blake, Drummond, Jeff Green, Clax is the second line.  Then we need a roster expansion and our third line can be: Roberson, Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC.  Our 3rd line is defense and hustle guys.   We should do line changes after made baskets or during fast breaks.  Shamet probably drops to third line and it becomes a big deal that Bruce Brown or TLC make top 10."
With everyone playing it has been and will be Harris-KD at the forward spots.   With KD out it's been Bruce Brown I guess. They play a really small lineup. There's also Jeff Green who plays either at the 4 or small ball 5.
Finally Bruce Brown gets some help
"He could be useful doing what Bruce Brown does offensively, being a short roll guy who can benefit from Harden being trapped/double to make a play.  But honestly at this point idk if he's playable defensively, he's so so so slow and with his short wing span he can't protect the rim or close out"
"Yea, how could they forget about bruce brown smfh"
"They had Green, Harden and Bruce Brown at center. Blake at center makes more sense than those."
"Bruce Brown and Jeff Green will out-avg BG, calling it now"
"Yeah I don't think he's not gonna start. I feel like Bruce Brown or Jeff Green are probably gonna be the ones left out. It'll be Harden, Kyrie, KD, DJ, and Harris starting.  But then again I became a Nets fan like 6 weeks ago so what do I know."
"The supporting cast beside the Big 3 is better than you think. Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Claxton have been solid. Joe Harris is putting up some of the best shooting numbers in the league. Bruce Brown plays great defense and picks up a lot of easy buckets off cuts. Small sample size for Claxton so I won't speak on him. With the big three, Jordan, and I guess Griffin if he can still move, that's still 8-9 deep which is all you should run in playoffs. Very few teams run 10+ players every night during playoffs."
Bruce Brown* /s
"You just gunna shade our man Bruce Brown like that, huh?"
"Bruh you’re just in denial. I’ve been saying why they’re better this whole time. The three stars are way better, we have the best 3 point shooter in the league, we have Bruce Brown and Jeff Green playing better than any of your role players, Claxton is emerging as another great role player, we’re going to get Blake Griffin. Are you really unable to see that? Have you even watched the games? Or do you just think the Lakers are good because the won last year? News flash: Last year is irrelevant now since the Nets created a super team"
What’s crazy is guys like Bruce brown and Jeff green are also at like 62% true shooting.  I think Nash and dantoni deserve a lot of credit this offense is truly ridiculous
"Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton isnt really a roleplayer but he kinda fits the bill"
? You said good role players. Bruce Brown is one
Bruce Brown
"Re-signing both Dinwiddie and Bruce Brown would lead to an unbelievable tax bill.   Dinwiddie is also kind of redundant with Harden and Kyrie on the team, while Brown is the much better fit."
Bruce Brown and Joe Harris underrated i guess
"Not really. Jeff Green is solid and proven. Claxton is actually talented, same as Bruce Brown. It's the little shooting guards who are inconsistent and that's our strongest position. A bigman addition for insurance in the front count and we are an ok bench."
Bruce Brown!
"I'm amazed at their ability to just produce these guys. I thought it was pretty much going to be the big 3, and then Joe Harris...and the rest would be trash.  I happily admit I was wrong. Bruce Brown and Nicolas Claxton have really showed up."
Blazers inability to find a Dray/Bruce Brown 4 vs 3 killer still a problem
It's not like Bruce Brown is just standing around waiting for Harden to do something. He has been unbelievable finding the pockets in the defense and he's extremely efficient finishing around the basket.
"Oh ok, that makes sense, kinda funny he ended up in Houston anyway, who I think will definitely be worse than Detroit if he had have stayed, but yeah, Bruce has been great. None of us have crystal balls but a lineup of Wright/Ellington/Brown/Grant/Wood has playoff potential imo."
The development of Bruce brown is a big silver lining of KD being out. This team is going to be god damn great when they just slate him in with the rest.
Harden gives him open dimes off the double team. It's free money for Bruce Brown.
"Kyrie has been playing a lot more quietly these days since he became more of a shooting guard next to Harden, but he's still insanely good. With guys like Joe Harris and Bruce Brown, this team is looking really scary."
The effect that Harden's gravity has on Bruce Brown is insane.
Why did Detroit trade Bruce Brown?
Is Bruce Brown gonna regress or what? Dude is playing out of his mind these last few weeks.
Bruce Brown&gt;Caruso this season?
That was an ugly back and forth.   Btw Bruce Brown
Bruce brown is god and you cannot convince me  otherwise
Bruce Brown &gt; Michael Jordan if we’re being honest
kyrie has been atrocious lately  bruce brown has been better than him for like the last 5-6 games
Where is Bruce Brown in the MVP conversation ?
Except Bruce Brown is like a 40% shooter from the corners
"&gt; In real-time, James Harden can't really tell whether it's Kyrie (41% 3pt) on his right and Bruce Brown (26% 3pt) on his left, or vice versa.  lol what   i'm going to give mvp-level players the benefit of the doubt on this one, telling people apart from 10 feet away is not very difficult"
"That only really works in videogames and hindsight, though. In real life you have a drill a system so that players will know if their teammates on the wings are going to cut to the hoop or spot up at the arc. In real-time, James Harden can't really tell whether it's Kyrie (41% 3pt) on his right and Bruce Brown (26% 3pt) on his left, or vice versa. Obviously Kyrie is more likely to spot up for 3 than Brown is, but all Harden sees is 2 BK-colored jerseys through his peripheral vision.   Option routes might work in football, but football teams have an entire week to practice between games, and it still takes a long time to build up that connection to where QBs and receivers know how the other is reading the defensive keys. And they still mess it up regularly."
Bruce Brown?
"I don’t even know if Bruce Brown should be grouped with those guys, he will absolutely get minutes. The dude is a  dog. Out of the rest though yea it’s tough, I would prolly say that  TLC gets the minutes if his shooting isn’t trash lol."
"He’s the reason why.   Bruce brown, joe Harris ,kyrie of course when he’s played, have all been good but harden is the life of this team"
Bruce Brown vs Alex Caruso in the finals. The fated matchup.
I haven't watch a ton of the Nets this season. Is Bruce Brown always this good?
Who was your fourth best defender and was he really that much better than Bruce Brown? I think you're exaggerating it
Who the fuck is Bruce Brown and how is he so good
Idk exactly but Bruce Brown was barely in the rotation before the Harden trade. Harden's facilitating is making previous benchwarmers like Brown and Tyler Johnson seem elite and just bringing out their hidden talent. Not everyone has someone like Harden thats able to do this
"&gt; Would have preferred to try and keep him but I get the idea of him being a bit redundant behind Kyrie, Harden, and Durant since Harden spends a bunch of time with the 2nd unit. &gt;  &gt;   There's also the issue that both he and Bruce Brown are free agents this summer.   If the Nets re-sign both, they're going to be looking at an insane tax bill.  Even though Dinwiddie is the better player, Bruce Brown fits a much bigger need (Dinwiddie becomes redundant with Kyrie and Harden) especially if he continues playing the way he has been."
I don’t think you’re wrong. Johnson and shamet are just decent player. But if you compare them to like a Wesley Matthew it’s not that different. Johnson in particular has been consistently solid.   Besides we have 7 players that are gonna see mins in the playoffs who have been solid all year. Big 3 - joe Harris - Jeff green - dj - tlc.  Tlc and dj are obviously weaker players but they’ve shown they can at least 10-15 against top teams   The rest of the guys will play 30+. We also have Bruce brown who has been fantastic for us.   We are deeper than we seem right now
"As someone who's all aboard this Nets train. Some of these criticisms are valid. But the Nets have too much talent for it to really matter.  The depth thing... The starting 5 + Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are a solid first 7.  But let's not pretend Claxton is a sure thing. We've seen absolutely nothing from him in his first year and a half because of injury and he's thin as a rail. The Nets depth issue is another strong interior player not guard play and it affects the teams issue to get defensive boards and end possession.  It's a legit concern, but I mean KD/Harden/Kyrie makes it almost irrelevant."
So has big boi Bruce brown
"It’s hard to say who is underrated on the Nets because there’s such a spotlight on the team. A year ago I would have said Joe Harris, but now people are watching him he’s probably properly rated. Bruce Brown just had that monster game.  I guess I’d probably say TLC as his defense has been pretty good, but gets overshadowed by the poor team defense this team has.  Overrated was probably Dinwiddie when he was healthy. Great box score if you just box score watched, but consistently had so many wasteful possessions"
Why do we help off of shooters.  Bruce Brown is the clear liability shooting wise and yet we play off of Joe Harris for some reason.  So stupid.
"Magic Johnson, Pj Tucker, Draymond Green, Bruce Brown (he played center for us last game), Wilt.   Game over."
"3 to Kyrie, Harden, KD and 2 to Bruce Brown. Seems like the only logical outcome to me."
"Tbh yes I did see the potential in Bruce Brown, Shamet is still playing worse than he has in past seasons, and Jeff Green was really good this year without Harden too. This is not to say Harden isn't one of the best floor raisers, but those are kind of poor examples. The example I would've used is DeAndre Jordan who was a bona fide scrub this season before Harden and has turned into a passable starting center with Harden."
"Bruce Brown just scored 29 points, I think that's all that needs to be said"
"If AD &amp; Schroder come back 100%, it's theirs to lose, even with Brooklyn in the mix.  The Lakers have as many bodies as anyone to throw at KD &amp; Harden and the tools to expose &amp; punish the Nets weakness.  If any of Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan or Bruce Brown are seeing significant playing time as the Nets nominal 5, AD &amp; LeBron will eat them alive inside.  Without AD at 100% the Lakers don't have the firepower to compete and you could see them losing to Utah or the Clippers."
"Luckily Harden is easily the 2nd best floor raiser in the league. Look at how much better the role players are playing post Harden trade. No hate to any of these guys but a month ago would u really believe Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and a 300 year old Jeff Green who looked like a shell of himself were gonna play important playoff and probably even finals minutes?"
"I honestly have him even with KD right now. Harden is making guys like Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Ty Johnson get so many open looks and they are cashing in."
"Jokic has Murray, Embiid has Simmons, Kawhi has PG..Lillard has no one but still has better team/bench..Harden made Bruce Brown have a career night...Kyrie alone without KD were ass"
"People focus so much on the Big 3 and seem to forget about Joe Harris (averaging 70% TS), Bruce Brown (one of the best wing defenders in the league, also putting up a 60%+ TS) and Jeff Green ( 64% TS, one of the most versatile and switchable bigs)."
"Yeah wtf? Harden is the jazz killer lol, except this time their Gobert centered defense might end up worse. He’s gonna have to cover Bruce Brown when they go centerless. Harden in this scheme could dominate them even more"
Durant is part of the Nets big 3? I thought that spot belonged to Bruce Brown
"Lmao, Harden literally woulda won it all if an older CP3, the only good star he ever had in Houston, doesn't get injured when they're up 3-2 on the greatest team ever. He beats GSW, then easily beats Cleveland... and they weren't even a stacked team, most of those role players had career years because of Harden  You guys are undoubtedly better with Harden instead of Brown and Kemba. Harden has made Bruce Brown, TLC and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan into good role players now that he's in Brooklyn in games without KD or Kyrie. Harden with Tatum, Smart (when healthy) and role players? They're a Top 5 team already"
"It's really tough to say because like I said, it's a real lost art. If you sort by cutting action frequency, everyone ahead of Bruce Brown is a PF/C (which means their cuts are usually just coming from the paint area while Brown has to time his cuts from way further out usually). Juan Toscano-Anderson caught my eye from watching random Warriors games but I haven't seen enough to know if he's consistently great at it and I have similar observations about Brandon Clarke and Jae'Sean Tate but Warriors, Grizzlies, and Rockets fans can probably really tell it better than I can from watching the occasional League Pass games of each team."
"How though? I hope you don’t mean doubling,You do know Kyrie is a solid playmaker too right?? Teams, including even the Clippers tried this method and got set on fire especially with Bruce brown cutting under the rim, and making elite passes as well"
I'm now a Bruce Brown fan
"Guys like this are genuinely more helpful than you can imagine. Their impact goes beyond the court as they are genuine, encouraging, and friendly people that can fit with anyone. I’d much rather have a Bruce Brown than a KPJ or MPJ."
"Fax bro everyone says big 3 this big 3 that but Bruce Brown scored 29 more points than KD last night. Big 3 is Ky, Harden, Bruce"
&gt; bruce brown is actually insanely good at finishing at the rim.  I actually had to do a double take at this statement lol. I love Bruce and hope he continues to ball out for yall but dude couldn't finish to save his life the whole time he was with Detroit lol. I knew playing with KD and Kyrie would help him big time but sheeeesh
"Regular season games in February cant really answer those questions. If you believe in Bruce Brown/Jeff Green, great. But many people wont and we wont really know who is right until the playoffs."
Bruce Brown dropping 27 yesterday I think answers the question of the Nets depth. He has really proved himself this year. Along with Jeff Green
"definitely some PTSD. Trust me, nothing is sweeter than looking at our current roster and record then doing the same with the Celtics. There's one player on our team that we actually drafted, the rest have come through free agency and trades. Basically got Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and TLC for free, picked up Jeff Green and Tyler Johnson for next to nothing, traded a G leagues and a second rounder for Bruce Brown, then of course signed Kyrie KD and Jordan and traded for Harden. Only semi-questionable move was trading a mid first for Shamet but he has turned it around lately and that's technically part of the Bruce Brown trade so it was a net positive.  Celtics on the other hand have had a million draft picks over the last 6 years and are under 500"
Bruce brown barely played over 20 minutes a game his rookie year
Bruce Brown has been balling out this year with the Nets.

Bruce Brown 😡
I’d be mad too if I just watched my team get clapped by Bruce Brown.
"He would’ve been a RFA for us soon. Weaver decided it would be better to be part of a three way trade between the Nets and Clippers and got Bey out of the deal - who looks solid so far.   I love Bruce Brown but it’s different playing with all-star level players compared to what he had to play with here. It doesn’t make sense for Pistons, who are rebuilding, to pay him.   Musa was on a cheaper contract than Brown and we had no plans to extend him so that clears some money and a roster spot.   As for Dinwiddie we never sent him to you guys lol. We traded him to the Bulls, who waived him, and then Nets picked him up."
"Cutting to the rim intelligently is a lost art in today's NBA. So many offenses have screen and roll action with 2 or 3 guys just camped out at the 3 PT line, spacing because that's the meta right now but Bruce Brown has a real knack for cutting to the rim at the right time."
Yep Saddiq has been balling. I'm still kinda annoyed that we traded Shamet for Bey because a stretch 4 that can play D was exactly what we needed. But Shamet's been picking it up lately and we got Bruce Brown so that makes up for it.
#Bruce Brown night
bruce brown
How much help does Bruce Brown need?
Obviously this team could never compete with the Nets who have both Bruce Brown and Tyler Cook
how much help does bruce brown need
Rest Kyrie too. Harden and Bruce brown will take care of business
wdym bruce brown clearly &gt; KD
bruce brown is actually insanely good at finishing at the rim. with the shooters we have its very difficult to stop his cuts.
That was Bruce Brown lol.
I made some OC a couple of weeks ago that hit the front page. Check out the video if you want:  4 ways the James Harden - Bruce Brown pick &amp; roll can beat teams https://youtu.be/5vMrF8DuF_c
Pistons did give us Bruce Brown and Blake
"He was a zero on offense.  You couldn’t hide him at the dunker’s spot, or use him as the pick man in a pick -and-roll.  Finishing at the rim was terrible.  If he could somehow manage to be 50% of what Bruce brown is on offense he would have a lot more teams interested."
But who’s gonna stop Bruce brown

"Brown, not Bowen. Bruce Brown."
"I wouldn’t say “from nothing.”  The Nets clearly have the advantage of being Kyrie’s boyhood team, being from New York City, and not being owned by James Dolan.    But Marks did build something.  He scooped up LeVert who was the 20 pick and picked Jarrett Allen at 22.  If those late first round picks don’t work out they don’t have the pieces to get Indy and Cleveland involved to make the Harden trade happen.  He picks up Joe Harris, who looked like a bust but is now nearly 50% from 3.  And the Nets wouldn’t be in first place without guys like Nick Claxton and Bruce Brown.  Marks has been lucky, but he’s been adept at playing the hands he was dealt."
"People actually convinced themselves KD couldn't play. Nets fans have been saying all along KD is the best player on the team. Harden himself has said he's there to make KD the best KD he can be. Harden dazzled people, but Harden elevating guys like Bruce Brown and Claxton is a good regular season thing in a pinch, but KD is an outright destroyer of worlds. He exerts so much pressure and is just such a sure thing."
"i didnt say theyre not good players, just that theyre role players. and its really easy to look good next to harden, durant and kyrie offensively. theyve made bruce brown look like an offensive force at times."
"OP listed Bruce Brown, Nicolas Claxton and Landry Shamet for the nets lol  Rambis was a solid enough role player"
"its a lot easier to look good when you're playing alongside kyrie, durant, and harden. the nets have made nicholasa claxton, bruce brown, tyler johnson all look great on the offensive end."
Should the Nets's very existence warrant Adam Silver to tried at the Hague ? Arguble  But... My god was the Pelicans defence absolute garbage. It wasnt just elite scorers like KD and Kyrie feasting. Mf'ing Bruce Brown was hitting 3's
I know we're all caught up in the moment but you gotta admit how bad pelicans defence is being   They're lettinf Bruce Brown score 3's lmao
Why is Bruce brown the face of hustle basketball to you
Pistons lost Bruce Brown too 😭
Bruce Brown kinda reminds me of Alex Caruso in how he does a ton of little things that contribute to winning basketball and make him better than you'd think
"The formula isn't created to set a standard. The website is a tool to allow laymen to play with stats to make their own formulas. The default formulas provided isn't random guesswork, but it isn't peer-reviewed science either. The fact that bruce brown isnt in the top 100 of the defualt formula can be an example of why the default formula is flawed.   And there's probably multiple reasons for that: like the creators weighed the stats wrongly, or the website doesn't have enough stats to put in the formula. Or bruce brown isn't as much of a hustler as you think he is.  The main reason why I think this website is cool is because it allows ordinary people to create their own advanced stat as opposed to LEBRON or RAPTOR which are hard to understand. There's also the issue of ESPN's QBR where only a select people know how its calculated."
Tweak all you want Bruce Brown still going to be on the bench 😆  In seriousness you can move the sliders to adjust the weights of different metrics on the linked page
"Very cool, but a sanity check would have told you you can't have a hustle meter if Bruce Brown is not in the top-100. Gotta tweak that formula!"
And Bruce Brown.
"You're right, but this is about Bruce Brown."
Bruce Brown ain't no spot up shooter he ain't gonna run to the corner and shoot like he's some 3rd option bitch this ain't jj Redick this is a fucking God human steph curry again only this time he's not a fucking pussy pull up from the fucking logo and take a charge from zion at the same time
LMA and Blake are giga washed but Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are better than anyone on the Celtics outside their top 4
"To be fair, I look at the players that played last night. Joe Harris, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot...who the fuck are these players??? I've never heard of them."
I mean Bruce Brown being relied upon to make shots as your 3rd best player is much different than Bruce Brown wrecking ball free safety 6th best player.
"if we're talking RIGHT now... dort, bruce brown, draymond green or duncan robinson  thru history... steve kerr, robert horry, dennis rodman"
"Dude we’re playing 4 rookies, a ten-day contract, a 32 year old, 2 second year guys, and Cory freaking Joseph. We have ONE very good player right now. We also traded away two former MVPs and another All-star, didn’t re-sign Christian Wood, and traded Luke Kennard and Bruce brown. How are we trying to make the playoffs? 😂"
Six if you count Joe Harris and maybe Bruce Brown at times
"Great win, but holy shit Bruce Brown with the -20 in a two point win"
"Bruce Brown had some feel good moments this season, but Alize looks like a better player that should get Brown's minutes"
"My point is more that those secondary Warriors get more time to shine because of how Klay + Draymond (and curry to an extent) didn't play their best consistently on ball, so a guy like Ian Clark could come in and drive on Deron Williams knowing the help defense won't be there. On the Nets they have 3 + Harris that should have the ball basically at all times. The Warriors having Klay + Dray as part of their big 4 allowed other guys to shine because they do all the other things + excel off-ball. Harden has shown he can play off-ball but you seriously are wasting time if you're letting Bruce Brown drive instead of Harden in minutes where Harden is leading the bench. This specific big 3 + Harris is so unique because they really all are best with the ball in their hands. The Warriors only had 2 guys like that, and even with Steph Curry a lot of his stuff was running off screens."
"So I was listening to the Lowe Post and Zach Lowe was talking about how the Nets have all these great role players. Bruce Brown etc.   The same thing used to happen in Houston where the role players would all be pumped up for being great complements to Harden.   But honestly, it's just playing with Harden. He allows every other player on offense to do what they are best at and never have to do anything else. He makes pretty much any kind of role player look better because his offensive game is so versatile. Like PJ Tucker (as much as I love him) is a garbage offensive player and yet he seemed valuable just because he was not terrible at corner 3s and never had to do anything else.   Harden's impacts on role players is similar to Nash and Lebron IMO."
"Nobody in the NBA as currently constructed has a chance against a fully healthy Nets team. Idk why we’re even pretending lmao.  Starting Kyrie-Harris-Harden-KD-Claxton(?) and THEN having Blake, LMA, Shamet, DJ, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green coming off the bench is stupid deep and talented.   All of those guys listed on the bench are at MINIMUM above league average players."
Bruce Brown and Terrance Brown*
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
"He didn't need to set screens, Harden was being doubles and passed to Russ one pass away which basically created the exact same plays that Bruce Brown have now going downhill on a 4 on 3"
"Kyrie and Harris in the starting 5 are massive holes on defence. Joel has feasted on DeAndre Jordan (In 7 appearances he’s 6-1. In 2 games this season Joel has combined 53 pts vs Jordan’s 8). Griffin and Aldridge have looked washed defensively this season, but we have no idea if they will show up for the playoffs now on this team.  The biggest issue is they don’t have plus level defenders than can close down their matchup. Harden and KD could show up or go missing, but I’m inclined to think in the playoffs they will step up a notch and at the very least be average.   Dinwiddie is another guard who is eh defensively. Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson and Shamet won’t get heavy minutes but again are all lacklustre defensively.  The only way they can put a team out there who can play defence is if one of Jordan/Griffin/Aldridge shows up and Harden/KD take massive strides to make up for Irving and Harris. Honestly if I’m Nash I’d run Dinwiddie with Harden as much as possible and try and rotate Harris/Irving, as Dinwiddie/Harden/Irving/KD/+Big or Dinwiddie/Harden/Harris/KD/+Big is good enough to not be exposed consistently."
bruce brown is terrible
Fuck I mean bruce brown on the nets
"Possibly, but watching them play you can see there's some creative non-obvious stuff going on - like who would have predicted the role they found for Bruce Brown? I don't know if Nash specifically is the one implementing those kind of things, but they definitely have some cool stuff going on beyond the individual talent of their stars"
bruce brown as well smh
"I’m not comparing to their teams stars. Let’s look at Nets non top 3 rotation players: Bruce Brown, LMA, Blake, Jordan, Green are comparable IMO better than your 4-7 and there’s no doubt the elite talent on the nets is better. Lakers have Harrell, Drummond, Kuzma, KCP which I think are better. Clippers now have Morris, Rondo, Batum, Zubac, which is comparable. The bucks used to have an advantage in that department and now it’s more of a concern"
terrible defense. you dont double aldridge when bridges is on him. then nobody rotates to tyler johnson. Then they just completely fall asleep on bruce brown cuts.   Aldridge was 2/7 on mid range jumpers. just let him shoot those all game dont double him.
"I still think the idea of trading him is fine largely because he's so valued in the NBA and hte injury concerns are very real. I'll still mock them for not including him in a Harden package or for the next star. He's kind of the piece if they trade in the right offer this goes from a really good team to a top 2 title contender potentially.   But yeah he's been better than I expected this early on. His offensive IQ and feel for the game is where I didnt see it coming. I think the idea that he's a ""good defender now"" is definitely overdone but he played probably the best defensive game last night Ive seen him play. Weak side help defender in the nail area is where he's best at why he works as a 4. I think long term he projects as a borderline all star if health permits which is a big if.   Playtype data [for cutting is weird](https://go.nba.com/3fjl) for the bigs alot of it is largely fake you kind of have to separate players into bigs/guys who spend tons of time in the paint off ball vs wings and guards. Amongst the more perimeter oriented players only Beal and Bruce Brown have more cuts this year(and Brown is different also) so I suspect your right."
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Harris  5. Dinwiddie  6. Aldridge  7. Claxton  8. Bruce Brown  9. Blake Griffin
"Underrated one: Detroit delivering Bruce Brown on a platter cause he’s been really solid in Brooklyn  Also in 20 years, the Kevin Porter Jr trade will probably go down as one of the worst as context will probably die out and the man has potential to be a perennial superstar"
Blake and Bruce Brown
The Bruce Brown disrespect smh
"Saying Nets have no defense is a bit much. Defense was bad, but has been closer to about average over the last 20 games. Rotations were shifted around. Nic Claxton is playing, Bruce Brown is playing, Harden actually helps our defense a little bit (it was that bad at the beginning of the season).   Defense ain't ever going to be good. But it can be average. And if the team is dropping 120 a night in the playoffs, then defense can be pretty bad and they will still win most games."
"&gt; Spurs fans and Piston fans are going to be biased because they watched them underperform.  He didn't really underperform, we had no expectations of him coming into the season after multiple surgeries and rehabs and everyone in our sub knew he was washed after game 3.  &gt; I strongly believe that they weren’t giving their full effort and nothings going to change that for me so of course what you watched is going to make you say their washed.  What has Griffin showed you on the Nets that shows he's not washed? His FG% is up because he's getting easy looks, just like our former Piston, Bruce Brown, but his stats are the same, his defense is the same, his passing is the same. Everything is the same, take Nets Griffin and put him back on Detroit playing 30 minutes at the point forward role and we start losing every game again.  &gt; You really trying to tell me you don’t think Blake couldn’t of gotten a SINGLE dunk if he wanted to on the Pistons  Maybe, I don't see a situation this year that he ever beats his man and doesn't get stuffed the shit out of at the rim. I remember one game it looked like he was going to dunk then he changed his mind because he was going to get mauled by the center and did some acrobatic layup that somehow went in for an and-1 earlier this year, but that's the only time I could have seen him attempt a dunk, think he attempted a putback also and missed. He barely dunked when he had arguably his best season as a pro in 2019 and frequently gets blocked driving to the rim because he has no lift so I'm not surprised that he went 25 games without dunking while having multiple rehabs/surgeries inbetween."
"Harden has also never had another superstar next to him and the one time he did you saw the results.   If Harden can make it work with Bruce Brown whos a worse shooter than both of those guys, he can make it work with them and Wiggins whos shooting really well this year. Draymond is interesting thought. I think Harden can hit Dray on the short roll and he would be excellent. Russ coulndt run anything on 4v3s, but Dray....yea, thatd be  nice."
" Harden has averaged 40 for long stretches on great efficiency  for long stretches yes and these have been with depleted rosters.  Just because you shoot a lot of threes, doesnt mean you are good at them. We were not good for our volume. Harden had to take so many threes a game just to up that percentage. We were also not great on open looks either by percentage. Bruce Brown doesnt do that with the Nets right now and he's looked great with Harden on the floor. Oubre or Wiggins would get great looks at the basket. Well...we have seen less talented heliocentric offenses get taken down in the playoffs, that's not the same thing as heliocentric offenses dont work."
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"You guys act like Harden has never played with garbage spacing before, he absolutely could carry this roster to the playoffs. Wiseman would get more lobs than he knows what to do with. The man plays with dude's like Bruce Brown and made him into an great finisher off the pick and roll."
"Yes.   Harden with a Top 10 defense with great wing defenders would be enough as his playmaking ability makes G-league players into key contributors. He's made Bruce Brown, TLC and Landry Shamet play some of the best ball in his career from the moment he's stepped on the team  No disrespect to Steph. Harden is just a better floor raiser while Curry is a better ceiling raiser. Not to imply that Harden isn't a great ceiling raiser and Curry isn't a great ceiling raiser; it's just that each of them have their own respective strengths, and this is Harden's."
Bruce Brown is not a scrub
"wtf bruce brown is an elite defender and uncle jeff is good at what he does. Then you got harris, claxton, and jordan. then you got johnson too. They got role players they just arent guys who can create their own shot"
Would he have played Bruce Brown in the unique role he's been cast in?
"As much as the Nets are easiest road shits for Harden, LMA, and Blake, you have to give them credit for pick ups like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and Jeff Green."
"Harden makes Bruce Brown and Claxton look way better on offense, both are still either raw or rough  LMA might still overall be a very bad defender but he looks like a big upgrade on Deandre just by at least trying"
"i will not accept any bruce brown slander. The guy has sick positioning, he is everywhere"
"Literally been carrying scrubs, sorry Bruce brown and Jeff Green couldn’t get more touches"
"Waiting till free agency and sign them , literally how Miami and most dynasties did it. Or you draft correctly and get their bird rights, another option is getting a player below value (Bruce brown Bruce Bowen Celtics Bill Walton). Even another option is winning a trade. Buyout markets are fine, literally you couldn’t name 5 players who played a big role in the playoffs"
"Its at a point where if I was given even odds on the Nets vs the field I would take the field. I was bullish on the Nets as favorites as soon as they got Harden (only one ball LMAO yeah right) but with their recent moves and the emergence of Claxton and Bruce Brown, I don't see any team really being able to compete with a fully healthy Nets team. It's not quite Durant warriors level, but it might as well be."
bruce brown and claxgod deserve a mention
"And??? You hopped in right? Damn right I was talking...to lakers fans who been popping shit all week.. what that got to do with you? Lmaoo. Since I got you here, let me remind you that you paying a player to come off our bench.. thanks for Bruce brown to btw. These guys will be great in helping us win our first chip(76 was aba)"
"And pull Joe harris and Spencer Dinwiddie out of midair   And use late 1st round picks on Allen and Levert  And trade Musa and a 2nd for Bruce Brown   And use a 2nd round pick on Claxton  Like put some respect where it's due, Nets FO has been much better than the Celtics over the past 5 years"
Chris Paul and Clint Capela were no Bruce Brown and Nick Claxton for sure.
"Blake can get those, and Bruce Brown gets layups as well on that. It's not that big of a deal."
"Speaks to how well Sean Marks has done, with half the roster traded you still have young guys like Claxton and Bruce Brown on the roster that give you quality minutes."
No he wasnt.  He’s now playing off Harden and Kyrie.    Look at Bruce Brown’s numbers with the Pistons last year vs this year.  Was Brown sandbagging it too?  If you play Griffin without Kyrie and Harden for a full game you dont think he would look lost?
"Kd, Lamarcus aldridge, blake griffin, nicholas claxton, bruce brown, Jeff green. I think our front office is smart enough to know we can beat the best bigs 1:1 on defense. But with enough front court depth, we can replenish stamina in shorter minutes and keep em on their toes."
"You know those guys that are pretty decent but one night they just go off. Like KCP, Bruce Brown, Josh Richardson, etc. That was the entire Clippers roster tonight. Every single guy played basically perfect. Insane."
BRUCE BROWN POINT GOD
"The nets always had depth. Not crazy enough but good role players for an 8 man rotation in the playoffs. Also, a big part of people thinking that was they forgot about claxton and didn't know about bruce brown yet. They got a closing lineup of goatden, kai, harris, kd, and claxton and then uncle jeff brown and jordan on the bench. Don't even need to mention lma or griff"
If the opponent has a dominant guard : Bruce Brown  If the team has a dominant big : ...probably Jordan by default  Claxton or Green if the other team is wing oriented
It says a rebounding guard from Detroit. I can't really think of many players who fit that description... maybe Bruce Brown?
We have Claxton who is a fan favourite. And Harris is pretty much a born again Net since he only average about 2 points on the cavs shooting 25% from 3.  Plus the rest of our guys like Bruce Brown were grown into what they are now by the Nets organisation.
Sounds like he's talking about Bruce Brown
"He played, and didn't dunk with Ish Smith, Derrick Rose,  Langston Galloway, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard. All guards who can throw a lob. Bruce does it frequently now. All that said the gravity the stars on the nets cause opens up alot of space. Blake just isn't good enough to outright beat guys anymore. He needs to be open and he wasn't for us. He's not a good first second or third option. But he can be a solid 5th or 6th on a stacked team. It's no conspiracy."
"So he's basically in the same role and contract as Jeff Green/Bruce Brown, but just a lot more outrage"
"Lol that won't prove anything. Did you actually watch any Pistons games this year or are you just assuming that not dunking = not trying?   BG played 25 games over that 1.5 year stretch of not dunking, between those games were multiple surgeries and rehabs and he was literally never healthy. It also includes 5 games in 2020 when he could barely move and was sidelined the rest of the season after.  He barely dunked in the 2019 season which is arguably his best year as a pro.  He's going to be playing an entirely different role on reduced minutes where he quite literally has no expectations and is playing with multiple superstars to maximize spacing. Do you think Bruce Brown was ""sandbagging"" on the Pistons because his efficiency is up 100 points and he's getting easy dunks/layups after leaving Detroit or do you think playing with someone like James Harden and being a 4th option gives someone easier opportunities to score compared to playing on a team with no other stars and being schemed out every night."
I will always hate the nets and now especially since Blake griffin is there but you got one of the good ones with Bruce Brown. I hated to see him leave Detroit but it worked out in the end because it let him go to a winner and we got saddiq bey.
"We refer to it as the Bruce Brown Effect. Because he's not necessarily expected to score points and shares the roster with the likes of Harden, Kyrie, and KD, A player like Griffin can demand less attention and get more open looks and scoring opportunities. At his current level, he was most certainly not worth the 39M he'd get next year on Detroit, but he's definitely still an NBA basketball player who has a history of playing well in past years."
"All of these things happened because of what Marks did last year. Marks didn't do any shrewd GM'ing this season. He threw the house at Harden and luckily Tillman decided he just wants to spite Morey. The Nets had the money to sign Blake and LMA, and they were both bought out and are ring chasing. Bruce Brown is nothing to flaunt, either."
"And he's made the best acquisitions this year, too. Harden, calling up Claxton, Blake and LMA on minimums, Bruce Brown for nothing, MDA as an assistant coach"
"Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton are some of our best talent and they are homegrown/Marks picked them up years ago cause he's a good GM  we traded for Bruce Brown because Marks is good at finding talent. We have had other players like TLC and Chiozza for years.   Our other homegrown talent we traded for James Harden because well, no shit. Marks deserves credit, calling this team artificial isn't accurate when the GM is just really good"
"we traded our homegrown assets for James Harden. We still have Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton as some of our best players, we forgetting how good Sean Marks is to get these talented players who have either been drafted or on the team for years?  We traded for Bruce Brown. Again Sean Marks being a genius. We made good signings to build roster and have other players like TLC, Chiozza, etc left over from previous years.   Blake and LMA are literally playing like 15 minutes a game max lol"
"Embiid ain't got nothing on Bruce Brown (the goat) at the center lmao... But for real though, he can get more boards than DJ so he's actually effective at the position"
"Since you’re a Pistons Fan, isn’t Bruce Brown a really good defender? I know he’s mainly a perimeter defender, but can he somewhat defend bigger players?"
"Clearly you don't watch games either, Joe is no slouch on defense, and if you want to call 48.7% from 3 icy hot then I guess you do you. The biggest sign you don't watch basketball is you forgot about Claxton, his defensive impact is crazy good. Jeff Green and Bruce Brown have been a thorn in the side of anyone we play against.   We hated Prince, we were glad to see him go."
And Griffin and Aldridge and Bruce brown and shamet
Bruce brown is pretty good
How do you Lip Sync and tell Bruce Brown you're getting LMA? Lol wtf
6'7 kyrie and bruce brown lol
bruce brown
"LOL trust me, earlier today I was on a pessimistic rant to my friends about how the media is taking away from the game. I got heated when Bruce Brown found out LMA was on his team via a reporter asking a question.   It says a lot about the league at large when fans know before the players. WTF are the Nets doing not telling their players about roster moves when they happen? Doesn't that qualify as need to know??   See I just got myself started again lol"
"I honestly don't get it too. I mean look at the Nets and they have Bruce Brown who doesn't shoot at all but has been getting good minutes.     There are others players who are similar but I can't think right now, but I honestly don't get it. TBH if I'm the Wolves I hope they sign him. He brings needed experience and could make a difference for the development of the young players there and help the culture."
"Two major things I think get overlooked by people who doubt the Nets.   Number One is that James Harden is an offense all by himself.. The idea there is no chemistry is a little overstated because Harden has the ability to just say I got everything and I'll get everyone their shots. And while the big 3 havent played much together, all the role players have with each guy, and there's no visible case of anyone not understanding their role, which brings me to number 2, their role players are kinda underrated.  Joe Harris you all already know and recognize what he brings  Blake Griffin is averaging 10/5/3 on 51/40/78 shooting. He serves as an additional playmaker and veteran presence that can knock down his shot.   Nicolas Claxton has been great. He's a very versatile big defensively and has really good on/off splits this season.   Bruce Brown is also a solid guy off the bench. Plays hard and solid defense and is a tremendous rebounder for a guard."
Because Bruce brown and deandre jordan classify as a superteam
"The only reason I'm not picking Nets out of the East is because of their defense.  Durant being one of their main helpside rim protectors might hurt down the stretch, especially if he picks up a couple fouls early.  Jeff Green and Bruce Brown have been helping them out doing the dirty work, but I'm really interested to see what the rotation is with Harden Kyrie and Durant all healthy."
"They got a #1 overall and a #3 overall pick and hit on both of them. they just havent done anything with the rest of the roster. Meanwhile everyone is shitting on the nets for getting lucky meanwhile marks has consistently pulled good players out of thin air. He drafted caris levert and jarrett allen with mid to late first rounders. He developed harris and dinwiddie off the scrap heap. Even this season hes getting solid contributors from a second round pick in claxton, Tyler johnson, and bruce brown who was a virtual nobody that we've turned into a good player.  Boston is sitting with 3 all star players and then complaining about super teams with the nets give me a break."
"Oh yeah Bruce Brown is a dog, he'll fight for every single ball and he's the energy that sometimes the team lacks. But Griffin is close in effort, of course he lacks the agility at this point but he always looks to find opporunities, mostly in the form of taking charges or diving for loose balls."
Obviously you’ve seen the nets play more than me but more than Bruce Brown? Everytime I see y’all he seems like the only guy that gives a fuck about rebounding and is often grabbing a board in between 3 guys.
I remember thinking that him and Bruce Brown will make the Pistons muuuch better back when they had Drummond.
"Dinwiddie could definitely play with either of those guys on the floor.  There’s minutes there for him, and he’d likely take Bruce Brown, Shamet and the other bench guards minutes  Now if he’s the best fit to run with is a different question. But the Nets probably would have traded him already if they didn’t believe it could work"
Bruce Brown is Jeff van Gundy's and Zach Lowe's favorite player because of the clips in that vid.
Harden and Bruce Brown
Claxton is the Nets best defender &amp; has an unstoppable partnership with Harden. Same thing with Bruce Brown. One of the Brooklyn's better defenders &amp; plays really well with Harden.  Shamet has shot 41% from 3 since the beginning of February. You could easily play him down the stretch especially if he's on fire. Gives you a reliable shooter to kick out to &amp; he's a better defender than Harris.

"He's on the last year of his second-rounder contract. We traded Dzanan Musa (virtually the same salary, currently out of the league) and a second for him this summer. Bruce is incredible, and according to ESPN, members of the Pistons' staff joke about how Harden requested a trade to the Nets just so he wouldn't ever be guarded by Bruce. I believe Harden went 2-11 against Brown last season."
Who is Bruce Brown and how tf did the nets find cap space for him.
"Bruce Brown with the casual Center statline, 14pts 11reb"
Bruce Brown is the definition of someone who always gives 110%

Bruce Brown is currently the highest scorer going into the halftime  why does wearing masks make players better lol
"The other guards averaging about the same number of OREBs are Simmons, Bruce Brown and Oubre. All of those guys are over 6'7."
"Having another star and basically minimum players is not stacked. Without all 3 stars their depth is really bad. They have to start guys like DeAndre Jordan who is washed up, minimum player Jeff Green, minimum player Bruce Brown, TLC, Tyler Johnson. Joe Harris is a great spot up shooter but his defense is terrible and can’t do much else. With only 2 Stars the Nets are not stacked at all"
Also TLC’s and Bruce Brown reverse gravity
"My point was just that many superstars get easy rebounds as teammates cede them.  James Harden (8 REB/game), Bruce Brown (5 REB/game), and Malik Beasley (4 REB/game) all average about 1.5 contested rebounds a game. Some rookie like Okoro is averaging 1.1 contested rebounds, but is totaling under 3. Josh Okogie is similar (1.3 contested but 2.9 total)."
"this whole season Blake, Bruce Brown and Clax have had games where they’ve been responsible for shifting the momentum for us. They play with that energy and hustle that we sometimes lack."
weird foul by bruce brown
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"Bruce Brown should be eligible as a guard, forward and center."
"Are we just not gonna talk about Steph's fewer assists and greater turnovers? Or the fact that Harden can make TLC, Claxton, and Bruce Brown look like gods? Lmao. Im sorry but if steph drives to the rim that corner and slot isn't opening up the same. Not saying Steph isn't a great playmaker, but this is ridiculous. Trae young and dame are both better playmakers than steph too"
"Well you make it seem like better efficiency= better scorer which is fine if u think so, you also underrate harden's playmaking and how he makes any big look elite, hell even got bruce brown 28 points. Agree to disagree but u cant say u cleared anything up for me."
Bruce Brown 👁👁♥️
It's frustrating that 6'4 bruce brown seems to be their best rebounder
"GG Mavs. Defense on KD was nice. Everyone but Kyrie was ass, especially Claxton and Bruce Brown. Fuck.    Dorian Finney Smith with a +23. Wtf lmao"
"Answering my own question earlier, the last point not involving Irving/Durant iso was a Bruce Brown layup at 10:45 in the 4th"
Bruce Brown is the only dude that rebounds for the nets.
What is wrong with this commentator?? Idk what his name is but he just called Dorian Finney Smith Josh Richardson and then claimed Claxton got the tip in on an earlier play when it was Bruce Brown lol
In the past 10 game min Dorian Finney Smith has   Badly gotten beat allowing an offensive rebound to Bruce brown   Screwed up a 4 on 1 fumbling it out   Had a drive even he kind of surprised himself with   Had a great putback on some absurd hustle   Most entertaining player in this game.....exactly what TNT signed up for
bruce brown puts in so much effort it's crazy
Bro why is Bruce Brown so good of a offensive rebounder
&gt; Harris DJ Bruce brown Clayton shamed will get their dunks/open jumpers as is.   No they won't and they pretty clearly don't. Joe Harris with James Harden as the primary facilitator is a much bigger offensive threat compared to Joe Harris with KD/Kyrie as the primary facilitator.  The same is true for Claxton and Brown as well. Harden is flat out a much better pick and roll player than KD/Kyrie and that's where those two thrive.
KD and kyrie will garner more than enuf attention. Ofc harden playmaking is a level or two above but Harris DJ Bruce brown Clayton shamed will get their dunks/open jumpers as is. Harden will take it to a near unbeatable level  tho in terms of how to stop their 3 offensive super stats AND some solid “others”
"""geroge bush mention for some reason"" he's a former president and the camera went to him lol   he did call bruce brown ""bobby brown"" tho"
"I was like ""who tf is that guy zooming back on defense??"" and then realized that Bruce Brown checked in without me noticing.  The ultimate hustle player"
"wrong, but then again the bucks proved that.  The nets offensive efficiency near the end of a close game is much better with harden distributing the ball.  And kyrie is much more dangerous when he can concentrate on what he does best, breaking down his man on the wing.  PG an be very physical, Id rather have Jrue holliday trying to guard harden as that wil wear holiday down instead of holliday wearing down Kyrie.  Ask KD, you dont think he knows that?  He knows more than any of us how the pieces fit.  Kyrie has never averaged more than 7 assists a game in 10 seasons.  What he does do is score with tremendous efficiency.  What harden does do is run the most efficient offense, the nets get lots of production out of guys like claxton, joe harris, and bruce brown.  What kyrie does best is breaking down his man in the clutch, better he has energy in the 4th quarter."
"yes, I agree, when you look at productivity and efficiency of guys like bruce brown, Nic claxton, jeff green and joe harris with harden running the offense its notably better.  Harden distorts the defense from the point, and finds these guys for easy shots.  Kyrie and KD score regardless of harden being on the floor, but even they are more efficient when harden runs the offense.  And opponents have to double harden, guys like Jrue Holiday do well against a smaller less physical Kyrie, but harden is a beast physically so holliday has his hands full, leaving a better mismatch for kyrie in that one case.  If harden doesnt come back healthy, I dont like the nets chances against the 76ers or Bucks.  You really want simmons and Jrue Holiday guarding harden, not kyrie.  this forces thybulle or others to guard Kyrie and I really like that matchup a lot better."
"Having Harden changes our whole offense. Without Harden it’s pretty obvious that the bulk of the scoring is coming from KD, Kyrie then either Joe or Jeff Green. The thing with Joe is that he can’t or sometimes refuses to shoot if he has a guy glued to him. Having Harden back frees up guys like Joe, and other role players like a Clax, or a Bruce Brown to get easy looks. That makes it harder for the opposing teams to get stops. If you have the Big 3, Joe at the 3 point line and a big around the basket who are you gonna help off of?  In terms of defense, yes Harden isn’t a great defender. But I absolutely think his communication and IQ helps us big time. I just like how he keeps his team mates accountable."
I would imagine the horrendous Bruce Brown/DJ lineups that Nash puts out are the main reason for this
trash? joe harris is trash? blake is trash? jeff green is trash? bruce brown trash?
Milwaukee Bruce Brown
1.	Jokic 2.	Embiid 3.	Bruce Brown 4.	Gobert 5.	Beef Stew
Thinking he Bruce Brown out there
"Claxton, Bruce Brown and honestly even Joe Harris all need Harden to come back. They are a noticeable step down without him. And Jeff Green is still good but but damn he really stretches teams when Harden is out there, their chemistry is fantastic.   People were claiming the Nets role players were elite and acting like Marks built the greatest depth in NBA history. Marks is great, I love him, and I like this team, but a lot of these players were getting elevated heavily by Harden. If we still had LMA that isn't even as important because that's a guy that can do it himself too, but without him it's really tough because Clax is obviously our best 5 and he badly needs Harden out there."
"And also how tf can you put kyrie, Bruce brown and Mike James on the floor together and say we have to move the ball more!!"
Him and Bruce Brown are just creating their own kind of play.
"Bucks shot really well.   Claxton and Brown need more mins.   KD, Kyrie and Giannis did their thing.   Jrue Holiday had a night.   It'll be interesting to see how Harden affects the dynamics and matchups.    Refs let a lot more contact go than a normal Tuesday night game or regular season in general. Brooklyn will have to find some functional way to guard Giannis and not sacrifice scoring on the other end.    DiVincenzo gave a lot of effort on D and extended plays through just plain effort. I think Bruce Brown brings that but Nash would need to play him more."
"Not quite sure why Steve Nash didn't call a timeout during the run in the 4th. Also a lineup of Mike James, Kyrie, Bruce Brown just doesn't seem that great of an idea."
get bruce brown some help
7’5 Bruce brown
"I don't know a ton about the Nets. But a lineup of Kyrie, Bruce Brown, and Mike James at the same time doesn't seem ideal."
Bruce Brown isn't good in this matchup
I think Bruce Brown Jr. could annoy him but he’s out rn
DeAndre Jordan: 13 minutes   Nic Claxton: 5 minutes   Bruce Brown: 0 minutes   just why
Where's Bruce Brown?
Where is my man Bruce Brown?
"This is not a jab at the Grizz        But there is so much bitching about calls now, i dont wanna sound like an old man but it sucks         Like i saw bruce brown miss a wide open layup and complained he got fouled, then later he somehow air balled another layup and was chirping again       Like just play        Maybe we should bring in euro league refs"
Alize Johnson &amp; Bruce Brown
&gt;They rely on too much hero ball.  Casual alert  Didn't see Bruce Brown putting up 29pts with the Harden pick and roll  Doesn't account for the fact that Joe Harris shot like ASS today (1/5 3pt) - He's a 49% 3pt shooter.  Doesn't credit that one of our best defensive players in Claxton didn't see the floor today
Bruce Brown injured?
"Blake, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarot, Claxton are all solid rotational pieces.   Steph/Draymond will show up but if that Nets team caught us on a day when Oubre/Wiggins aren't having good games then I can legitimately see us losing"
"As long as Bruce Brown is playing him, Giannis will have a hard time"
&gt; Interesting inclusions are Bruce Brown for Brooklyn  I'm assuming that minutes played are taken into account? Because KD is obviously extremely impactful when he's on the floor.
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"This was my first time playing fantasy, long time gambling addict and degenerate so I knew a lot but I had some growing pains, especially in an 18 man league. I took KAT, he went down with his wrist, then covid, traded him and Lavine (rip), and Lamarcus Aldridge (dodged a bullet) for Beal, De'Andre Hunter (went down for the entire season pretty much for me) Divencenzo.. eventually I ended up with Giannis and Sabonis which has been huge for me; I've lucked out on a lot of waiver wire players, Moses Brown, Bruce Brown, Diallo had a hot streak for me, etc.  The easiest way to win in fantasy is to punt 4 categories. I try to go for FG%, rebounds, blocks, steals, and then the last one is usually a toss up for assists or t/o's (I have Draymond.. Dray+Sabonis+Giannis has given me so many assists this season)  Next time I'll be able to hone in on that fifth category lol. Sometimes I win ft% even."
"The line-ups have been a product of a sensible rotation of Kyrie/Harden/KD (they've only played four games without any of these), and three players (Harden/Griffin/LaMarcus) who've come into the starting rotation, and finding better options than DeAndre Jordan. Not all line-up changes are born equal. The core outside of the big three (I'm saying Jeff Green/Joel Harris/Bruce Brown) have missed a combined 10 games out of 189.  I am not saying Nash is a bad coach. I am saying that he has a core of self-coaching superstars during his first year coaching in any capacity, during a unusual season. I am saying that Nash hasn't yet had the opportunity to prove much at all."
If those stats are good enough for Alex Len then goddammit they're good enough for Bruce Brown
"To be fair, most 5’s need to hustle back to protect the paint.   Bruce Brown gets to crash the offensive boards way more without it leading to easy basket the way it would for actual bigs"
"im bringing up the warriors as an example of how having one star on the court just doesnt magically make you win games. TLC has played more minutes this year than duarnt for us. Bruce brown and jeff green have played more minutes than harden. Again you're seriously overselling how much our big 3 have played and how  little salary we have tied up outside of them. We basically have ran a one star with minimum salary players or no star lineups for half the season.   and I never said marks was the best executive in the league. plenty of guys who have won EOTY and arent best executives in the league. Im just saying what marks did with no picks was a historic rebuild, there was nobody who thought that team could exit that disaster as well as it did and was actually asset rich at the end of it with a bunch of good tradeable assets and young players.   Toronto and Denver also have some of the best front offices in the league. you saying theyre better isnt a knock against marks for EOTY. also look at recent winners. i mean clippers won it last year and the year and the warriors won it in 2017. getting big free agents is cledarly a big part of the award."
PG: Bradley Beal   SG: Bruce Brown   SF: Bogdan Bogdanovic   PF: Bojan Bodganovic   C: Bismack Biyombo
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.   Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining. If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"How about shamet, Bruce brown, claxton , Jeff green, Tyler Johnson ? Marks got all these guys for virtually nothing and they’ve all been exceptionally good for us.   EOTY is always a bit of a lifetime achievement award. How about developing levert,Allen, joe Harris, dlo, dinwiddie?  Like we haven’t had our stars together for most of the year. Look who was on the court yesterday for us. We’ve been picking up wins all year with our top guys out. When you’re as top heavy as us and you’re missing guys you usually end up sucking but we’ve still been exceptionally good."
"When you consider that Durant missed over half the year, harden is going to miss about half the year, and kyrie will probably end up missing around 20 games I think we did absolutely surpass expectations. I mean I’m guessing you don’t watch us much. Guys like Tyler Johnson, claxton, Bruce brown, shamet, now Alize Johnson, blake, also now mike James have been huge rotation players for us the entire season and he got all of those guys for virtually nothing.   Like we’ve literally been playing backups and random g/league guys for most of the year and they’ve been playing heavy minutes. We’re currently like 11-5 when only one of our stars play. We’ve had 34 different starting lineups.  This teams been making due with random guys all year"
He’s not that slow in the wing he’s just not a great jump shooter. Tbh I think he works with us because we have a lot of shooting so his shooting weakness is covered up and he can play more like a big. Kinda like Bruce brown was for us
"Sean Marks did the following:  * Signed Joe Harris, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Magic and had gone 7 months without being picked up by another team * Signed Spencer Dinwiddie, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Bulls and was playing in the D league * Traded for Bruce Brown and Laundry Shamet by giving up a 2020 mid first round pick, a 2020 late second round pick, a player picked late second in 2019, and a player picked super late first round in 2018. The 2020 mid first round pick is the only player currently on an NBA team, Brown and Shamet are staples in the Nets rotation and will see significant playoff time while possibly even starting in a few games. * Signed Tyler Johnson, a player previously waived by the Suns that had gone 4 months without being picked up by another team"
can’t speak for the rest of this list but bruce brown isn’t even the best role player on the nets
Marcus Smart  Bruce Brown  Jae Crowder  OG Anunoby  Robert Covington
Bruce brown up there. Him and Joey probably tier 2. Bruce just got a weird smile to me
What about Bruce Brown?
Musa for Bruce Brown should be hung on the rafters.
Anytime our god Bruce Brown is out is a shitty situation
Bruce Brown Jr.
I just want the world to know this is a BRUCE BROWN stan account and everyone shall be aware of this dude come playoff time.
"A lot of guys on the Nets honestly.   Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Nicolas Claxton...  I can see any one of them stepping and making a big contribution."
It’s so obvious you guys don’t watch harden. He literally is averaging the most assists per game this year. He’s literally turned Bruce brown and claxton into good offensive players on the court who then struggle mightily without him on offense.
"The same thing is happening with the Nets though.   People are talking about “overpowered role players” like... Jeff Green, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin."
"I’m pretty sure nuts also got Bruce brown in the deal, it came out Separate at first but then became one big trade."
What happened to Bruce Brown during the game? Did he not play well?
Bruce Brown and Jeff Green always blow into their hands before shooting a free throw  Not sure who started it and whose copying who
Harden and literally anyone. Harden/Bruce brown was the most efficient pnr for a while. Harden/Jeff green the same.
It’s kinda sad that often times he’s the guy on on our team making the most hustle plays for rebounds and steals. Him and Bruce brown mostly
damn u really scared of the Bruce Brown lead nets.
They shat on Bruce brown for taking those.
Rich man’s Bruce Brown
Russ is better and to be quite Frank he offers so much more it’s not close. Simmons defense is unreal but he’s like Bruce brown without the threes on offense
"There were at least 3 plays last game where the ball was at the perimeter, Lopez was under the basket and being guarded by Bruce brown. Those are mismatches where he needs to be fed in the post."
The Bruce Brown PnR
The series would had been 3-0 if it wasn't for Bruce brown trying to be a hero. For the bucks  I would say it hurts more to lose a close game then to get blown out by 40
I'd rather have him than Bruce Brown or Mike James coming off the bench. He's WAAAAAY better.
"The problem with the ""injuries were caused because the players played too much"" argument is who is getting hurt.   Kawhi sat out 20 games. Anthony Davis only played 36. Harden played 36, too. And Kyrie sat out, what, 19?  Conley missed around 20 and had regular rest during the season. Murray's injury came after he had not played for several games, so it clearly wasn't an overuse injury.   CP3's loss is obviously not related to over-use.   So basically you've got only a couple of star injuries which could plausibly be connected to playing too much and the schedule. Mitchell, maybe. Luka, maybe. Embiid, maybe. But it's quite common to see some star players battling injuries in the playoffs (Kyrie in 2015, Steph in 2016, CP3 in 2018, KD in 2019).   The thing about shortening the schedule - and this is the tough part - is that the players it hurts the most are the younger, non-star players. The money lost wouldn't have had any impact on the lives of LeBron or CP3's grandchildren, but it would make a huge difference to guys like Juan Toscano Anderson and Bruce Brown.   This rash of injuries sucks, big time - but the cause-and-effect is murky, at best."
You put Giannis on him and you blitz the PnR. Give Bruce Brown all the floaters he wants in the paint.
"I think the whole idea is that you have Giannis be the help side defender, but if you are losing a game because 1 specific guy keeps cooking you, and your beat defender is standing in the corner defending Bruce Brown than maybe you should try and switch up your strategy"
The Nets are starting Bruce Brown.
This explains why he won’t post up Lopez against Bruce Brown
Bruce brown thinks he’s d rose so he’s 5th
This series is a Bruce brown layup away from being over in 5.  If KD and Harden are going to stay on the floor the entire game Milwaukee is finished. They can't game plan around the 2 of them never leaving the floor because it would be idiotic to throw your bench in against them.
Cam Johnson/Bruce Brown Finals showdown... INCOMING!!
And y’all needed KD and Kyrie to play like dogshit in Game 3 and barely beat them (Nets beat themselves with those Bruce Brown decisions) 😂
Its a hard question part of why it worked last night was because MKE actually guarded him  like he was 100% Harden. If they do that yeah its worth it especially if they are also stupidly gonna go at him in the post instead of attacking his lateral quickness.  If he still looks like that and MKE adjusts I guess they can go back to Bruce Brown but it gives Bropez a hiding place
"They should give Chuck his own 'Hall of Faim' segment, just for him to rant about whom he would not feed.  The series also feels weird because it is going against what was expected. The super team has been playing with gallons of heart - KD giving it all, Harden forcing an early comeback, Blake Griffin jumping around like his vintage self and Bruce Brown being everything that people expected from PJ Tucker... And the Bucks just feel too passive/vanilla once again..."
The Bruce Brown PnR with KD
"but he reinvented bruce brown, uses jeff green beautifully as a small ball 5, and helped create our defensive switching scheme which honestly gives a lot of teams trouble."
"Leadership, pull 1 defender out to guard him at the 3 so KD had more room to operate, and minimal ball handling while they try to get KD open  You right tho, he had no business being out there but just the fact that he had Harden on the back of his jersey forced the bucks to guard him closer than say a Bruce Brown or Mike James"
"Bruce Brown didn’t even play from the early 2nd until the last possession of the 3rd bc we needed offense and couldn’t have a non-shooter out there. Same reason Claxton basically did not play. The Nets had a dreadful defensive lineup out there with Harden on one leg, KD exerting all his energy carrying the offense, and 3 of Blake/Green/Harris/Shamet. Now I do give all of those last four guys credit because when needed they made some huge stops.   For as bad as Harris struggled offensively, he made back to back massive defensive plays in the 3rd where he forced a travel on Giannis by stepping in front and then locked up Holiday to force a rushed pass to Lopez who took and missed a wild floater at the end of the shot clock. Green made two key stops on Giannis after switching screens. Blake was just around the ball for rebounds, he didn’t look great on defense (I think he’s hurt). Shamet was overall solid, he had one nice play on Middleton iirc"
"Joe Harris has been major cheeks. It’s been one game of Jeff Green, one game of Bruce Brown and one game of Blake Griffin"
There were multiple possessions of fucking Mike James and Bruce Brown covering Brook Lopez at the 3 point line. Why the hell weren't the Bucks eating them up on the inside? I would be infuriated and Coach Bud needs to be launched to the moon.
"Look some people are saying giannis couldn’t have guarded KD and that he’s better as a help defender.  Fair point! But,  1. He was on joe harris, bruce brown a lot or the time, is he gonna sag to help? No.   2. When he did sag off griffin, griff hit his shots.  3. Brook lopez on drop coverage was not the better option.  4. Its not like teams havent bothered KD before. They did it by guarding him with different players, doubling him, none of which happened today.  5. Sure you can’t expect Giannis to guard him all game but a couple of possessions here and there would have been good to try in the middle of all the eviscerating Durant was doing."
"Not just that but knowing Harden was pushing himself to play on the same injury he missed so much time for when he was listed out just yesterday def helped motivate KD. He said something similar post game  If he saw Joe Harris and Bruce Brown brick shots the way they did and he's the only guy really out there, I think he woulda given up"
You guys give him shit but then who's gonna guard Bruce Brown??
Mike james and Bruce brown played good when Nets are leading and they dont have pressure. But when its a close game and there is pressure both of them are very bad specially on game 4.
"He drew way more attention than Bruce brown would’ve, and that alone made him valuable. Pretty baffling coaching to not constantly attack him on defense though"
Don't disregard the gravity that Bruce Brown and the corpse of James Harden bring
Series would be over rn if it weren’t for Bruce brown in game 4 lmao
"James Semi barely had anything on the floor, but still better than Bruce Brown jacking up 10 shots"
please don't forget that 2pt Bruce Brown took the last shot of Game 3
Bruce brown post up?
Nets players points total/shooting %  Jeff Green 24 points - 7/9 shooting   Blake Griffin 17 points - 7/11 shooting  Landry Shamet 7 points - 3/5 shooting   Joe Harris **5 points - 2/11 shooting**  **James Harden 3 points - 1/10 shooting**   Bruce Brown 2 points - **1/5 shooting**  KD almost has half of his teams points lmaoooooo
DPOY on Bruce Brown
We get Harden back but we still have to play Bruce Brown fuck
"Man, the Nets if they even had Dinwittie instead of Bruce Brown out there. Those traps on KD would be costly"
Bruce Brown is a fucking idiot. He thought he can shot over Giannis? Cant wait till this bum is gone next season
"Bruce Brown seems to have low Basketball IQ, trying to force that shot in the paint against Giannis."
Bruce Brown fuckin stinks man
Bruce Brown as roll guy was cute in the regular season. Dem floaters ain't hittin in the yoffs.
If I see one more Bruce Brown floater
Bruce Brown really said “yeah I think I’ll make this shot”
"Bruce brown is a fucking enigma, idk what goes on in that dude’s head"
Nets don't do this Bruce Brown shit again
fuck OFF bruce brown. You fucking imbecile
"That Bruce Brown guy is fucking terrible, lord have mercy."
Bruce Brown gotta realise he isn't that guy
bruce brown what the fuck are you doing bro please
Bruce Brown and 4th quarter don’t go together
Bruce Brown is playing awful
Who has lower offensive IQ Giannis or Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown will be solid after he cleans up his decision making
Bruce Brown legit looks clueless ever time on offense.
Bruce brown is a dummy in the 4th
Bruce Brown floaters kill me now
Bruce brown needs to stop with his floaters
No more Bruce brown floaters please
Bruce Brown learned his lesson I see
It's almost Bruce Brown time!
Must be nice to be Bruce brown &amp; flex knowing you’d be in the G league without the 2 of the greatest scorers of all time on your team. Loser needs to humble himself
"Unlike Joe Harris, Bruce Brown isn't scared of the big stage."
Bruce brown still sore from that ass whooping in the locker room after game 4
Bruce Brown playin himself out the league
Ah Bruce Brown the hero of game 3.
Bruce Brown playing the role of center on offense is great haha
Bruce brown making an immediate impact lmao
i’m smelling a bruce brown game winning layup today
He's having a lot of trouble and is clearly still injured but it's probably better having a 50% Harden out there than asking guys like Mike James and Bruce Brown to make plays.
What happened to Bruce brown ?
I'd rather have Harden hoist up 20 threes than watch Harris drive and Bruce Brown making awful decisions.
Bruce Brown playing so bad he became Bruce Bowen
What is Harden giving you that Bruce Brown is not
Damn and to think the nets could've been 3-0 up if Bruce Brown passed it to KD
Bruce Brown is probably a better player for the Nets than Harden rn
he literally isn't even as good as Bruce Brown imo
Their 4th best player is like Bruce Brown rn
so Bruce Brown is that bad at taking an open shot huh? hes in the nba and guys are sagging off him like he has the Delta variant.
"Bruce Brown is one of the most interesting players to me, dude is 6'4"" but plays like a center"
Ive had enough bruce brown for the series Mr Steve Nash
I want him to choke Bruce brown
Bruce Brown taking a shot when Durant is on defence putting his shoe on is peak Bruce Brown
Nets have been loving a Bruce Brown contested layup the last few games
Bruce Brown really passed on an open 3 for a contested shot in the paint. This guy must be smoking before these games
so bruce brown can’t even take like mid range jumpers?
"He can just pass the rock to any open 3 point shooter, (Harris or durant, maybe blake) not that big of a deal in offense, he has shown to be a top tier facilitator, on defense, he needs to take things easier than he would without an injury, if they wanna target him and take it inside, Kd and bruce brown are gonna have to step up to double and force a pass outside to giannis or someone who can’t shoot. It’s definitely doable for the nets."
Bruce Brown is all you need
Yea Bruce Brown and Joe Harris are better than Middleton and Jrue
"Nets starters tonight: Harden, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, KD, Blake."
Bruce Brown is enough if you’re not a pussy
Tonight is a legacy game for Bruce Brown.
Replace KD with Bruce Brown and I’ll take the first one
"Yes but I wonder if Philly is also using him a bit wrong. At this point, even if he starts shooting 35% from 3, defenses are still going to let him shoot a la Giannis. I'd like to see him tried in the Bruce Brown role, be the screen setter and roll. Then he just has to make a quick decision on pass vs. finish drive once he catches at the FT line.  At the same time, he's a 6'10 guard. He's a walking mismatch and should be getting 15/8/5 just on pure hustle with the occasional 25/12/10"
"The Nets don't have anyone wearing number 2, but a sharp 1 or sharp 13 would be basically a flat 2nd... looks like either Bruce Brown needs to pull through or they need Harden back"
Nobody cares what you think b. There’s no player thats winning a playoff series with Joe Harris and Bruce Brown as their best players
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
Was Bruce Brown a smart and experienced player the other night?
Bruce brown would agree with this statement.
"He really needs to forget about shooting and try and develop a post game. He’s a walking mismatch every time down the floor and combined with his ball-handling and play making he’d be unstoppable if he became a threat there. People obsess about him shooting 3s etc, but if he even had a floater game like Bruce Brown it’d open so much for him and his team."
"https://www.nbadraft.net/2018-nba-draft-combine-measurements/   https://www.nbadraft.net/2019-nba-draft-combine-measurements/  Oh wow, look at all those percentages in the 4-6% range from the 2018 NBA COMBINE.  Oh, and the 2019 Combine.  Wow.  Bruce Brown 3.75  Grayson Allen 5.5  Kostas Antetok~~~ 5.0  Shai Gilchrist Alexander - 3.0  Landry Shamat 4.8  Nic Claxton 4.5  Cam Reddish 4.7  &gt;**Tako Fall 6.8**  Trae Young 5.4"
"What other players? Bruce Brown? Lmao. Because Kyrie, like KD, also doesn't need a PG to set him up. These 3 guys can do it by themselves, playing ISO. Harden's passing ability is almost useless on a team with 3 of the best ISO scorers ever."
He had the corpse of James Harden playing full games. The next best player was Bruce Brown lmao
Nets receive: Damian Lillard  Blazers receive : Kyrie Irving and Landry Shamet/Bruce Brown  Dame can guarantee himself a championship IMO if this is done
"It's possible Love was tanking his value with the olympic team, but honestly, he just might be cooked.  And even if Love isn't cooked, he's a player who's primary value is offensive, and would be (at best) the 4th-best offensive player on the Nets (and that's assuming her returns somewhat to a form we haven't seen in a few years). The Nets don't really need or want him on offense.   The Nets will have the taxpayer MLE, but will need to use that to re-sign guys like Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin, who will probably get offers for more than the non-bird raise the Nets can offer."
"If they re-sign Dinwiddie at his desired price, the Nets would pay $122 million in luxury tax next season. And that’s WITHOUT bringing back Griffin, Green, and Bruce Brown."
Bruce brown saved us lol
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."
"Aside from the obvious 23…  0 gives you Lillard/DiVincenzo/Miles Bridges/Tatum/Love. D’lo is also there but that defence is already pretty rough so I’d have him off the bench to slaughter worse lineups with DiVincenzo starting.  00 could give you Lonnie Walker/Devin Booker/Anthony Edwards/Zion. Centre sucks, it’d be Mike Scott by default but Zion might actually be the best option there, but you’ve got guys like Malik Monk and TJ Warren and Bruce Brown to fill in the gaps."
"All the people complaining about Keldon Johnson being added can suck it.  Seriously though, his situation reminds me of Bruce Brown on the Nets. Keldon does a lot of the small things and also benefits from the attention of the other stars."
He’s the Bruce Brown of team USA
"If they are fully healthy, I think they go 16-0.  By fully healthy that means LMA and Dinwiddie are also healthy right?   I really don't think most teams have a good shot at beating Kyrie-Harden-KD-Blake-LMA with Dinwiddie-Harris-Shamet-Tyler Johnson-Bruce Brown as the backups. And considering it's the playoffs where you run 7 man rotations late in the series, and with them sweeping through probably, it's really going to be limited to that top 5 and then Dinwiddie-Harris in the main rotation with maybe Bruce Brown sometimes.   Seriously nobody was beating that top 5. Blake was an excellent contributor and LMA as your friggin 4th or 5th option is just beyond stupid, and helps with interior defense even if he isn't known as great at it. It's still enough with everything else. Those 6th and 7th guys off the bench are easily starters on every other playoff team as well if healthy."
"Yeah he's obviously wrong on that, but Game 3 was super close and the Nets kind of choked it away/Jrue had an amazing shot while Bruce Brown had many bad ones. 3-0 is a different series, probably the Bucks do win Game 4 but nobody's ever come back down from 0-3 so probably the Nets would have won that series then.  Of course, I don't know the point of those hypotheticals. The Bucks did win Game 3 and then did win the series. Injuries did happen too. Facts are facts all the way around, speculation is just pointless."
"The Nets don’t operate effectively with all (3) playing together. If so they sweep an empty Celtics team. Bucks likely win regardless, keep in mind with all (3) there’s virtually never going to be key offensive contributions from the bench and role players given they’re so ball dominant and they don’t seek out setting up teammates as a priority. Hence Joe Harris, Mike James, Bruce Brown, Shamet, and further a Jeff Green 27 points (7/8 from 3) in game 5 wouldn’t happen with all (3). Brown and Griffin were the only two who could exist off of lose balls and put backs. That team wasn’t setup for all 3 but did best with 2 stars. Don’t discount Harden as a facilitator in game 5 either. But as he looked more for his offense it hurt the team when he didn’t make or get to the line.   And for once understand that a team assembled of (3) health question marks is gonna be risky. Kyrie injury history is very lengthy, Harden was so out of shape to begin the year and never recovered. And they had a plan for Durant but had to sacrifice at the end of the regular season just keep the #2 seed due to Kyrie (8) game sabbatical, was great to him finish how he did."
"Crazy how you look at this world so black and white that you tried to over simplify my comment.   The nets were going to win that series till they were left with literally Durant and Bruce brown trying to sneak in bunnies around the rim. Please don't compare that to the Raptors team that was literally a 9 man deep team lol. Yes I said Giannis shrinks against a top player like that but you also need a playoff capable team to make that comparison against. Giannis can eat against any 6-15 in the playoffs. Frankly, I was even shocked the nets made that series only a difference of shoe size being too big.  And no, don't try to count Harden playing on a practically amputated leg either.   Friggin hell, fans these days."
"Pretty much. Even in 2k there’s no way you beat them, take out their starting 5 and the reserves are Dinwiddie (to be replaced by a ring chaser vet point guard next season), Bruce Brown, Claxton, Jeff Green, Shamet (who isn’t in the game for some reason), and we can just expect some ring chasers next season to be replacements and there’s no way they win if healthy."
"A team with KD, playoff Joe Harris, half leg Harden, Buyout Blake, and Bruce Brown should not be a coin flip game 7 series, it’s because your team played awfully and made poor adjustments"
Bruce Brown and Al Horford? McCollum is their secondary play maker and a critical role in how they function... I don't see them making that trade imo
Floor: explosive Bruce Brown  Ceiling: elite two-way guard

what did people around the organization say to Bruce brown when he took that layup in game 3?
"Why? Why would the Suns want to trade away cp3 the fucking FINALS MVP.   1st Finals in the suns franchise and they trade him for spencer, Joe(can't shoot in the playoffs) harris, Bruce(takes big shots in the playoffs and misses them when you have kd and kyrie) brown."
"LeBron was facing a much more difficult team than the Suns   Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, Horry, Bruce Bowen and a few others im forgetting  Meanwhile lets take a look at Lebron's team -   - Larry Hughes - Ilgauskas - Drew Gooden - Daniel Booby Gibson - Shannon Brown - Donyell Marshall - Ira Newble - Sasha Pavlociv - Scot Pollard - Eric Snow - David Wesley - Dwayne Jones  What kind of trash-ass roster is that?  Larry Hughes (14 ppg) and Ilgauskas (11 ppg) and Drew Gooden (11 ppg) - were the only three players besides LeBron to average more than 10 pts.  Team is hot garbage playing against an all time great Spurs team with all three players in their primes. That year the Spurs only lost 4 games the entire playoffs.  But yeh definitely a similar comparison here."
KD second best player was….. Bruce Brown? Hell no
Bruce brown tho haha jkjk
"Wouldn’t the Nets have Jarrett Allen in this case? I feel like a healthy team of Kyrie, Caris Levert, Joe Harris, KD, and Jarrett Allen (or put Bruce brown as PG and let Levert play 6th man) would be able to take it, even have a guy like Jeff Green who wouldn’t have to play as major of a role on defense if Allen was there.  Dunno, i guess i might still take the Cavs in that series but it’s a little closer than i thought."
"Yeah, he was somebody you had to account for defensively. Kevin Love absolutely abused CJ Miles in the post on repeated possessions that one year. The Cavs were not afraid to exploit his mismatches.  Meanwhile, you've got teams hiding guys like Bruce Brown on Lopez for extended stretches and getting away with it. Some of it can be blamed on coaching, or lack of aggression from Brook, or the continued evolution of the game away from postups (i.e., refs let you hack Brook in the post but will reward Khris for jumping into his defender at the 3pt line)... but you've also got to give Kevin Love some respect.   He can dribble the ball while backing down (and pass out of the post if it's not there) much better than Brook."
"As a Nets fan, the Bucks are the dumbest team you'll ever see play basketball IQ-wise. They didn't punish Bruce Brown/Blake Griffin/Jeff Green at center down low the whole series, the Suns will be fine"
"If the Nets got Bruce Brown in double digits by giving him floaters involving Lopez add Trae got a lot of points off of floaters, CP3 and Book should feast until the Bucks figure something out."
"Nash did pretty well considering the big 3 hardly played together this season. He got a lot out of their role players - Bruce Brown, Claxton, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, and even Mike James looked pretty good.   And yea Stevens maybe lost the locker room a bit and maybe that's why he's stepping down so maybe he wasn't a great example."
"Nah, only Bruce Brown scored for us"
"&gt; It would really mess up the system. Harden would massively conflict with Draymond and from there, a lot could happen. I don't think it'd work out and I'm glad we didn't do it.  Make Draymond play the Bruce Brown role.  It would be fine."
Bruce Brown also lost his mind at the end of game 3 and Jeff Green was injured for half of the series as well.
"KD, Joe Harris and ~~Bruce Brown~~ James Harden on one leg is a level playing field? Damn, the rest of the league is more trash than I thought"
"KD, Joe Harris and Bruce Brown is a level playing field? Damn, the rest of the league is more trash than I thought"
"What is Garuba's upside?  PJ Tucker?  Even Keon - like, I guess some super version of Bruce Brown?  Like, I don't think Giddey is gonna be a star, but I could see him being a guy with Boris Diaw/Nic Batum/Joe Ingles type value as a big playmaker that can stuff the stat sheet."
"Essentially Bobby couldn’t be trusted as his primary defensive assignment would have to be KD or Bruce Brown, and he isn’t good enough in one-on-one or drop defense to guard either in the role he’d be playing.  But he matched up really well to the Hawks, and he should have no issue playing against Saric."
"True, KAT isn’t much a dribbler as well but he can pass and read the court quite well.  Simmons was a much better defender in the regular season(IMO) than he was vs the Hawks, and I agree he got away with a lot of physicality. He was more controlled and poised than in the yoffs, he was just broke mentally it seemed unfortunately.  Hopefully Thybulle can learn to shoot better, and he’s been driving and dribbling better towards the end of the season. I agree about BKN, they’re a basketball cheat code. Even without their stars, role players like Joe Harris and Bruce Brown compliment them so well, if they stay healthy next season I don’t see how anyone can stop them.  Huerter was great the entire Sixers series, it seemed, not just that game. Does he not have the defensive and playmaking chops usually? Cuz he was making all the right plays that series, absolutely on fire"
Bruce brown in a available
A major reason the Bucks were able to come back in game 7 of the Nets series was Bud making the adjustment at halftime of having Giannis guard Bruce Brown.  Completely neutralized his floaters while keep Lopez on the floor.  Barely mention of the adjustment anywhere.  People choose not to see his adjustments
"I do not mean this as an insult, but you need to understand how the cap works in the NBA.   Hard caps are only triggered if you use the non tax payer MLE, sign and trade, or bi annual exception.   Otherwise, you can resign your own players and go over the cap. Your penalty is the luxury tax.   160m is a lot but they wouldn't even be the highest in the NBA.   Next season if the Warriors do not resign Kelly Oubre or Kent Bazemore, they are at 168m.   The Nets if they do not retain Spencer Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, they are at 150m with 7 players on their roster."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Bruce brown lol
Umm never heard of Bruce Brown before?
Bruce brown? Over kd?
"trading away luke kennard and bruce brown during the draft, then trading d rose for peanuts and buying Blake out of his contract"
"Honestly, as an absolute genius who still has a lot to learn. He walked into what quickly became an insanely unstable situation with a championship-or-bust organization. Created one system for KD/Kyrie, watched his entire roster get traded for Harden, then had to create a whole new system for Harden + new roster, just a complete revolving door of starters, new role players etc. He helped a lot of guys develop, showed no fear in experimenting with new lineups and concepts (Bruce Brown as your center on offense??), and kept calm under pressure in a crazy series against Milwaukee. We all know Nash is a basketball genius, but it's often hard to translate that into being a great coach. Seems like he's pulling it off well. I think he'll be coaching the Nets for a long time"
"I think he did a great job this year. I mean honestly, think about all the non basketball shit he had to navigate.   Throw in injury management, mid-season roster changes, and balancing a squad of three superstars all of which could dominate the ball on their own team, but I never saw any stories about there not being enough touches to go around.  Harden changed his style of play to fit the team, which he deserves plenty of credit for but so does the coaching staff as a whole. And Steve put them together.  Bruce Brown as a pick and role guy was a revelation for the league and something I think we're going to see way more of from other teams.  The balls and trust from everyone involved to play KD 48 minutes in a must win game is something no one saw coming.  And ultimately the team is an inch away from advancing to the conference finals.  I'm sure there's a lot that I missed not actively following the team all year and I'll be the first to admit I'm rooting against the team based on personal biases against super teams. But Nash as the head coach is something I don't see as a weakness to rely on if I'm the opponent."
He's a fine coach  His way of using Bruce Brown is genius
"The difference in quality between Durant and the rest of the team was massive. When an injured Harden who cant even run is clearly your 2nd best player, you know you’re in deep shit.  Bruce Brown and Joe Harris are decent role players, but you cant expect them to win you a playoff series. Joe Harris especially, was completely shut down because he’s such a one dimensional player (ala JJ Redick) that he will always struggle to make shots in the playoffs.  And Im pretty sure Jeff Green was injured too."
He can be like Bruce brown on a contender
Bruce Brown 6th man
"Serge Ibaka opts out and joins us on the MLE  Sign and trade Dinwiddie for a solid bench piece or a trade exception  Re-sign Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake  Kyrie, KD and Harden go on a vacation together and develop an ability to speak only with their minds"
Bruce Brown
"between Ayton, Trae, Mikal Bridges, Kevin Huerter, and Bruce Brown, and obviously Luka, the 2018 draft really showed up for this year's playoffs."
"I admire Bruce Brown... dude is making millions, setting screens, playing D and hitting 5ft floaters."
"He could play the Bruce Brown role, just at an allstar, all-D level."
"Brook was very good on defense vs. the nets too especially toward the end of the series. People were calling him unplayable but he spaces the floor for giannis and is a damn good rim protector. That Bruce brown missed winning layup that everyone dissed was actually probably the right offensive move as the paint was open, brook just recovered extremely well against a faster player and was able to alter the shot"
"&gt;Dame is out. Enjoy watching Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Yeah, I do agree generally. The Bucks/Nets series were a bit of an exception, in my opinion, for this series. KD struggled passing without turnovers and really there weren't many players around him who could shoot anywhere near well enough to win it. Bruce Brown only had a floater in his bag (which the Nets did feed him), Joe Harris was *rough*, Harden couldn't hit a shot outside of one game on very limited attempts. After Game 2 the only player they had that could be a little bit consistent outside of KD was Blake Griffin - and they did give him looks.  I interpreted Pippen's comments about being the quantity of shots taken - I think every player puts up shots they probably shouldn't. I think for the series KD shooting *less* might have taken them further away from a win, even if his 30 shots involved less-than-ideal looks."
"&gt; Joe Harris shot almost 50% from 3 in the regular season and all of a sudden it's KD's fault he chokes?  You're the one talking about Joe Harris- don't put words in my mouth just because they're easier for you to argue against.  It's not KD's *fault* that he's not as good as grooming role players for the playoffs as Lebron is, it's just a fact and why Lebron is widely considered the better player.    Joe Harris is just *one* role player of many- Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Mike James, DJ even Blake and Jeff Green at this point.  Why is it that none of them could reach the stratospheric heights of the All-NBA talents named, let me check my notes...Eddie House, Mario Chalmers, Dellavadova, and Varejao?  I hate this dumbass blame game fans like you play.  It's not KD's **fault** that he's not as good at certain aspects of leadership as Lebron, it's just a fact.  I don't hate the guy, I'm just not so far up his anus that I deny reality."
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
"I still can‘t get that TikTok out of my head with Bruce Brown telling KD “You’re not that guy, pal. You’re not that guy” before taking the ball on the last position and bricking the game-winning layup 😂"
"Bruce Brown, mothafucka."
At least jrue clutched up at the end  Giannis woulda gotten some blame too tho tbh. Woulda been nitpicking cuz he had a great game [but he had what should've been an easy rebound vs bruce brown but lost the ball](https://imgur.com/XNSRHTL). Gave KD another crack at it. Woulda been game
Okay but that's not what happened in Game 7 against the Bucks. Joe Harris had a ton of open shots in rhythm and just bricked them. Bruce Brown made his usual great cuts to the basket and was missing layups.
"How could have kd played smarter, Joe harris wasnt hitting anything, Harden was 50% at beat and wasnt willing to drive, his side kick that series was blake griffin/bruce brown... I dont see how he could have possibly played it better"
"Lol, hes so fucking far from the truth. KD couldn't trust his teammates because Harden was injured, Harris was ice cold, Bruce Brown is an average shooter and Jeff Green was on and off. KD SHOT 50% FROM THE FIELD. Prime Lebron couldn't have done better imo"
Bruce Brown actually
"Lol what??   There was only one team committing murder in that series.   PJ Tucker raking his fingers across the eyes of KD, and then Harden both multiple times.   Giannis throwing 1-2 hard spinning elbows every game, absolutely nailing Jeff Green, KD, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown in the face multiple times. That shit causes stone cold knockouts in MMA but for Giannis it's just a ""basketball play"".   Giannis undercutting and injuring Kyrie by ""boxing him out"" while he was in midair. And then doing the exact same thing to Harden in game 5, lucky for him he didn't get injured.   I cannot believe a Bucks fan is crying bloody murder. You have the most reckless, aggressive superstar the NBA has seen in decades."
"I think there's definitely a chance, but it's too soon to say they're better than 1984, 1996, and 2003. However there is a lot of top end talent and overall depth in the 2018 draft class that could push them to #1 some day. Luka, Trae, Ayton, SGA, Sexton, MPJ, both Bridges, Trent Jr, JJJ if he can stay healthy, Heurter, Donte, Carter Jr, Rob Williams, Graham, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Melton. It's a really loaded draft."
"Good pickup , I think he has the talent to be a really good 3/D guy with some playmaking. I was always salty that Bruce brown got all the minutes over him"
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don’t think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
"What amazes me is that they still had some depth after the trade. Jeff green, Blake griffin, even Bruce Brown and Claxton  stepped up this playoffs. You just can’t win when 2 of your starters are injured, especially when those 2 starters are also your second and third options.  But seriously, the depth they had before the trade was insane…"
"It’s insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I’m probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
"No no no it was far easier to double against the Nets than it would be the Hawks. The Nets usually have 2 maybe 3 knockdown shooters on the court and that's including KD. If you sag off Bruce Brown he can't really punish you that hard, but if you take a guy off John Collins or Bogdan, they're gonna punish you from the midrange or three all night long. Trae Young would happily pass it off to one of those two, whereas for the Nets a heavily contested KD midrange is probably still one of their better options.  Also the reason that the Bucks defense started to collapse at the end was because they had to go small. Can't do anything about that Trae and Collins were clubbing them all night. If anything they changed it up a bit too late."
Bruce brown type vibe LMAO
he thought he was Bruce Brown
Oh no Connoton with a bruce brown moment 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡
"He is basically Bruce Brown, except more athletic and maybe has a better mid range lane."
"I don’t know, all I do know is that Bruce Brown would take himself over an open corner 3 by KD"
"That series was also basically Giannis vs KD. Some nights Middleton showed up, some nights Jeff green, Blake or Bruce brown showed up."
Lol y’all just looking at the scores in those games.   Nobody realizes it was basically a Giannis vs KD series. Middleton stepped up every now and then just like Jeff Green and Blake did for them and even Bruce Brown at times.   I would be absolutely surprised if we continue to play that bad in this series and if we do we might as well not even think about the finals. The team that faced the Nets are not even close to what this team is capable of.   No offense to Trae but going from KD to Trae young will be a huge advantage for this team. Trae is more likely to have an off game than KD was.
BRETT BROWN. Former Spurs assistant &amp; 76ers Head Coach said this awhile back. NOT Bruce Bowen
"Trae/Shai/Doncic/Bridges/Ayton is actually a pretty ideal modern NBA lineup, damn. That easily wins the chip, especially if the bench has other 2018 guys like MPJ, Sexton, Donte, Huerter, JJJ, Robert Williams WCJ  Trae/Sexton/Donte   Shai/Huerter/Devonte Graham  Doncic/Gary Trent Jr/ Bruce Brown  Bridges/MPJ/JJJ  Ayton/Robert Williams/WCJ   Fuck that’s sexy"
"KD+Bruce Brown PnR was cooking the Bucks with Brown floaters,Trae Young could feast if Jrue does not do an amazing job on defense."
"Brown is a very useful player who's done a great and unique job, I know that, and that's the reason why I'm imagining how dangerous a superpowered version of him could be playing a similar role. And I'm not saying they should trade Kyrie, I agree elite versatile scoring is something you hold on to. All I'm saying is that it throws up some very interesting situations, it would be a huge risk but there is a universe where it could help Brooklyn. And I also think people are going way too far with the Simmons hate, he's incredible at a lot of different things and playing in the right system alongside the right players can mitigate his massive flaws. At the very least he's in a whole different universe to Bruce Brown."
Simmons could be the upgraded version of Bruce Brown.
"It's an interesting one. Look at the role Bruce Brown has played and how effective he's been playing off Harden and Durant - now imagine a stronger quicker bigger more intelligent and skillful Bruce Brown, who's also a much better defender."
But the post said Bruce Brown not Bowen actually
Now imagine my frustration at the existence of a Bruce Brown and a B Bowen Jr in the league at the same time lol
Payne is pulling a Bruce Brown.
Why the fuck is CAMERON PAYNE taking clutch time shots?! Thes motherfuckers watched too much bruce brown ffs
Bruce brown??? 😆 yea I'll forgive you.
Ah. My bad. I thought Bruce Brown lol. Corrected
Lol haven’t seen a single person say “bucks won oh well” instead it’s playing the what if game. Injuries are apart of every sport but I’ve never seen people act like it mattered more than y’all are with this series. Why y’all wanted a fucking superteam to advance is beyond me. Let’s not act like it was basically Giannis and Khris vs KD the entire series and some games Jeff Green or Bruce Brown. Hardly any role players stepped up at in this series on both teams.   But to your other point if you haven’t realized Bud isn’t a good playoff coach until now you’re blind.
Every time I read Bruce Brown it says Bruce Bowen.
You almost won game 3 because Bruce Brown was too aggressive
yeah they dumped guys of the previous regime like Kennard and Bruce Brown last yr.
The Nets leading rebounders in this game were Kyrie and Bruce Brown lol. Kyrie with 11 and Bruce with 7.
"The bucks played KD 1v1 even though his teammates were down. According to holiday they were not help defending and if the net got to beat them KD should score 60 and he nearly did.    We all knew KD is an elite scorer but that serie highlighted his great passing. In the second half of game 5 when he wasn't missing the bucks decided to double him and he found the open man everytime and that led to that Jeff green monster performance.they returned to playing him 1v1 afterwards.  I think a lot of credit should be given to Jeff green . Bruce brown and Blake Griffin, nobody was expecting that of them but they stepped up big and outplayed the bucks starters outside of Giannis khris offensively.   The analyst were hyping up the bucks because that what they always do against great teams. So many teams were supposed to be a great challenge to the Heatles. The nets are a better team Top down against the bucks . better starters and better bench even without this year's addition."
"Kd was creating shots for Teammates all series. He literally averaged 9 assists the last 4 games of the series. Why do you think Jeff green had 28 points? And Kd to Bruce brown in game 3 almost won theme the game with those short roll passers. I think you’re looking at the result, and framing a narrative based on the result. That’s like saying if lebron is such a good playmaker, why didn’t he make his players shoot better than 30% against the suns? If Jokic is such a good playmaker why did the Nuggets shoot poorly against the suns? No, they were just outmatched, same as Durant.   What Kd did vs the bucks is prime lebron level tbh. If he had kyrie they win the East"
"But you can play him at PF, especially if you’re going to play Bruce Brown there too. Dantley was a beast in the post at that size."
"Lol you aren’t even a Nets fan and I see you defending the Nets more than actual Nets fans.   Every one including bucks fans know if they were healthy we would have lost. Superteams are meant to win, that’s why they are formed. But when you have a super team you lose out on depth and even for a team like the Nets they has decent depth. Joe Harris was good during the regular season, Blake Griffin was having a pretty good year, Bruce BRown had his games where he did good, Mike James even had good games. You can discredit our run as much as you want and bitch at people who talk good about Giannis but it ain’t gonna change the fact Giannis has a ring and Harden doesn’t (which I assume is why you are always so bitchy towards anyone saying good things about Giannis)"
I don’t give a fuck what they were “called” giannis objectively had more help then KD did that series. Unless you want to argue that jrue and khris are worse then harden on one leg and Bruce brown.
6'2 Bruce Brown as the C
"Who Memphis just gave away for absolutely nothing for the sake of being cheap. Akin to Detroit donating Bruce Brown to BKN last year. All under the idea of ""we dont want to pay this guy!"""
Bruce Bowen - 3 and d  &amp;#x200B;  Robert Horry - Clutch shots  &amp;#x200B;  Rip Hamilton- off-ball movement  &amp;#x200B;  Kwame Brown- low post defense  &amp;#x200B;  Sam Cassell - Trash Talk  &amp;#x200B;  Michael Redd - Shooting  &amp;#x200B;  Steve Francis - handles
You literally won that game because Bruce brown took a dumb layup to win the game LOL. You weren’t doing shit if it weren’t for those injuries. It took you a nail biting overtime game 7 to barely beat a disabled team
"Yeah, I get no one likes us. Idc  But we took them to 7 with half our team hurt, joe harris shitting the bed, and bruce brown shooting the ball.  But injuries are a part of the game, it sucks we probably got bounced due to that but it's whatever"
"Yeah, I understand we are top heavy... but so is every other championship caliber team rn  But outside our ""top heavy team"" we have the best spot up shooter in the league, a ball handler we desperately needed last season, a young center who has some crazy fast mobility, blake griffin and bruce brown, both of whom played significant play off minutes in a seven game series to the champs.   This is just an outrageous take"
"Yeah, Durants playmaking was really good in the bucks series. The amount of times he found Bruce brown on the short roll, or kicked out to shooters was insane. They didn’t lose because of his playmaking. Kyrie and Kd win the East pretty easily and beat the suns without “hardens making guys better”. That dude is just a harden Stan lol. Like kd vs the bucks was one of the better series I’ve ever seen."
"Bruce brown is a 6'5"" center, skill set matters more than body type"
help defender  &amp;#x200B;  I guess Bud did switch Giannis onto Bruce Brown so that he could switch onto KD on ball screens during game 7
Enjoy the battle of Dwight Howard vs Bruce Brown while all the stars are injured
Bruce brown is the same player and much cheaper
Just thinking about it already triggered me a lol lol Them guys as well as Bruce Brown and Jevon Carter will be the most infuriating defensive duos in the league.
And it used to mean that the player can't do anything other than shooting on offense; like Bruce Brown and Shane Battier.
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown and or Nic Claxton
Bruce Brown would like a word (or 3 blown floaters)
"I feel like this happened to Zion to some extent too. When a prospect gets super-hyped up, people who really don't pay all that much to draft prospects become contrarians who want to be the first to point out that players' weaknesses. When Zion came into the league producing right away, way too many people were genuinely surprised because the ""super athlete but short and can't shoot"" narrative took on this life of its own where Zion was made out to sound like a fatter Bruce Brown or something.  Like you said same thing happened with Trae and people treated him like Jimmer Fredette because they thought it made them look more savvy"
"had bruce brown made the pass to kyrie/kd, that series would have finished in 6 imo. kd was making all the shots that game"
Bruce Brown thrived in a large role on a contender. It makes sense his stock rose since his Pistons tenure.

"Yup! Still somehow ahead of RJ who was our second best player, averaged 17.6/6/3 ,40% from 3, good defender, and played every game this year but didn’t make the list while guys like bruce brown and caruso did"

"saw bruce brown and noel ahead of him 🤨🤨 especially as a knicks fan i can tell people straight up on last years team noel was probably the 6th best player (randle, RJ, rose, mitch, quickley ahead of him in that order)  besides barrett tho this list is really bad"
"Lol I don’t understand what people like you wanted the bucks to do? Did you want us to injure Middleton to where he’s only 40-50% to make it fair? I mean it’s not our fault they went all in on 3 guys and have a bad supporting cast, and honestly they really don’t have a bad supporting cast. Griffin, Green and Harris are all decent players and even Bruce Brown and Mike James had their games where they looked pretty good."
"It's not broad at all, he wasn't crashing boards, wasn't a rim runner, he operated in the mid and from distance , handled the ball a lot, that's not the profile of a big   It's a bout Skill set, not body type   Bruce brown is a 6'5"" center, Ben Simmons runs the point at 6'10"""
Bruce Brown? Jevon Carter? Jacque Vaughn? Ime Udoka last season?
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should’ve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that’s been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we’ve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He’d make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I’m a strong believer in him. I think he’ll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that’s still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who’s proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn’t playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn’t decide between. They’re the same price but I’m not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I’d honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
It'd be hilarious if the one to win practice shootouts was DeAndre or Bruce Brown
"5.6 AST w/ 3.4 TO per game is not really a great ratio for a lead offensive player... His scoring was amazing, but so was the scoring of plenty other guys...  1.Steph: 32 ppg on 65%TS 2.Jokic: 26.5 ppg on 65%TS 3.Giannis 28 ppg om 63%TS  Steph and Joker much better playmakers than Durant. Giannis similar-ish playmaker, but better defender...  Then we have Bron who put up 27.5 ppg on 65%TS in the 2020 Playoffs. When he's healthy he can be close enough as a scorer to Durant but clearly superior in other areas...  Harden ditto. He's just in a different role now. His Playoff struggles qre overblown. Dude carried biggest offensive load in the league in Houston and got eliminated by much better teams, mostly Golden State dynasty... Durant has been hiding on elite offensive teams his whole career almost...  Bucks series first time since like 2013/14 that KD had mediocre offensive support, and still Blake, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Shamet were hitting their shots. Kyrie played  half the series too...  Durant was 35 ppg 59%TS... He volume scored like a mf. Playmaking was mediocre, defense was actually better than expected, i will give him that.  Overall great series, but nothing we haven't seen from all the top 10 guys in recent years... Giannis had a better series in the Finals..."
Bruce Brown shooting 40% from 3 next year?
Bruce Brown going 40% from 3 next year?
I think that'd probably look like Mills-Cam Thomas/Duke-Bruce Brown-Blake-Deandre right?
"I like players that hustle and/or can play in the post, I played as a center all my life and mainly played off hustle with a couple post moves and hook shots so I like to see players that have a similar playstyle. Currently my fav player is Jokic but I fell in love with Bruce Brown this playoffs, he plays almost like a center at 6'4"" and I love that."
"He needs to go to a good team where his only job is to come off the bench and play great D for 10 minutes while keeping the ball moving.  Frank actually shoots 43% on corner 3s, but when playing him as a PG he obviously doesn't get to spend much time at all in the corner.  I think the Nets would be able to do a Bruce Brown-esque revival of Frank. Portland or Milwaukee would be good spots too."
"Us nets fans have been conditioned to view the start of free agency as our championship.   I think people havnt fully accepted that we have the players we need and there wasn’t much we could do in the off-season.  Resigning Blake and Bruce Brown was huge, our new signings were exactly what we needed, patty mills just puts it over the top."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"I mean ye but we were still on the way up without KD Kyrie and Harden. Also Sean has always managed to find good role players to contribute like Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Claxton, etc"
If Bruce Brown didn’t choke in Game 3 the Nets win in 5 against the Bucks
and to think Bruce Brown is the best one of em all smh Detroit
Bruce Brown is a great example here due was literally playing the 5
Him and Bruce Brown locking it down for BK last year
"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Bruce Brown and Porzingis should switch bodies"
Bruce brown plays like he’s 7’-8”
Bruce Brown is the undisputed King of a player playing bigger than his size
"Uhm some of these players were good without the spurs and  I'd argue the spurs played little part in their success not all of them though   Speedy Claxton played 30 games for the spurs and averaged 5 points   His best years were on the warriors and Hornets   He averaged 11/3/5/2 his first year in golden state and 13/3/6/2 his second year there   George Hill spent 3 years on the spurs and was had a down year his first year on the pacers but then had a 5 years stretch of 14/4/4    Stephon Jackson played 101 games on the spurs and averaged 10 points the following 9 seasons he averaged 19/4/4 on the warriors, pacers and Bobcats    Bruce bowen was the exact same player the 2years before going to the spurs    Devin brown also had his best years playing next to lebron and cp3"
"Drastic swing? Didn’t y’all win 3 barely after Bruce brown missed the game winner and then in 4 Ky went out before the half? Unless I’m misremembering, maybe that was 4?  Also why do you assume you would have won 4? No disrespect, bucks are world champs and they earned it, but you don’t just go, “oh we were winning when Kyrie went out” and assume a victory"
&gt; no matter how many cripples they have Bruce Brown should not be taking that shot.  Narrator: Bruce Brown took the shot.
"I mean hypothetically speaking no version of that Nets team should be relying on Bruce Brown lol, no matter how many cripples they have Bruce Brown should not be taking that shot."
him being 2/10 in the first half i imagine was also the reason they had to be kept in the game in the second half   Bruce Brown in the second quarter making like 5 straight floaters is what erased the huge lead and made it a game
Hypothetically speaking a healthy Nets team wouldn’t wouldn’t be relying on Bruce Brown to hit shots. It would be blowout after blowout.
Pass to KD for game winner ❌  Pass to Kyrie for game winner ❌  Is it Bruce Brown time baby ✅✅✅✅
Wasn't Bruce Brown the guy who missed an open layup to take a 3-0 lead against the Bucks
"- The roster?  - We traded for Brown with Boston and signed Brown and Reggie.  - Jaylen Brown, Bruce Brown and Reggie Jackson?  - Not quite ...."
I understand your view. It was a very different Net's offense though and one that was vastly less efficient. One that needed any slight boost outside of random Jeff Green 3's and Bruce Brown short rolls. Good discussion though I enjoyed.
Bruce brown would have been the third best player on your team this past post season lol.
Bruce Brown is still looking for that pass
okay we got another bruce brown
How much help does Bruce Brown need?!?!?!??!
I thought if he takes the QO (like Bruce Brown Jr did) you can't trade him during the season without his permission?
Demar took 3.7 shots in the restricted are per game last year. That's the same as like a Bruce Brown
"&gt; Nets - Mills **Harris** Brown Claxton  Joe Harris? He's not coming off the bench.  Right now the only guys who seem to have guaranteed rotation minutes off the bench are Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton.   I would not put the Nets in the top 5."
And 6’3 center Bruce brown
"I’m high on Lonnie Walker and Bruce Brown because both were great at Miami (my alma mater) and I want to see a Cane succeed in the league.  I don’t know if there’s anyone I’m super low on at the moment that others are high on, so I’ll keep this a positive post."
"Depth. Patty Mills is a 6th man who only plays around 20 minutes anyways and is about to turn 33 years old. Everything that happened to the Nets this year is why they need a serviceable backup PG  Irving missed 20 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  Harden missed 30 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  They thought they didnt need a back up PG and it ended up biting them in the ass severely. Then they had to sign Mike James and play PG by committee.  This signing can take the work load off of Kyrie who has missed significant time the last 2 years and now they have Harden who is battling a hamstring. That type of injury tends to stay with athletes.  They just got rid of Shamet. Bruce Brown and Tyler Johnson are FAs.  Plus even if push came to shove and you needed to play all 3, that can easily be done in a small ball line up. Shit there are lineups that get thrown out there where KD could play the 5 or even BG against other teams."
"Nets are likely above the Lakers. Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton, Blake Griffin."
We need Bruce Brown!
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"im really not scared of nunn/monk/ellington/melo/dwight. none of them will survive on the floor against the nets once harden/durant/kyrie start taking turns on them. Those players sound good in theory but theyre not gonna be able to stay on the floor in serious playoff situations against the nets firepower. The nets have 6-7 guys i know we can trust in the playoffs, big 3, blake, mills, harris, and to some extent bruce brown.  Lakers talent wise will be mcuh easier to defend and your defense got worse with the moves u made. the more bad defenders you throw out there for shooting to compensate for brook's terrible spacing the easier it will be for harden/durant/kyrie to break them down."
Bruce Brown has KAT's voice and KAT has Bruce Brown's voice lol
I think they meant to say Former Miami Hurricane Bruce Brown
"It's all wrong... maybe Bruce Brown, maybe?"
Joe Harris or Bruce brown?
Bruce Brown I believe it was.
"The real question is who will be brave enough to put Marcus Smart, Bruce Brown, and PJ Tucker together on the same team."
"I think Monk is an outlier situation though  Likewise with Nunn, unless there were some serious personality fits or disagreements with money I cannot rationalize why either dude was let off the QO...  We saw this morning Bruce Brown take his QO and I fully expected that to be the ""worst case scenario"" for Nunn and Monk  Not complaining personally, but yeah, a weird day as someone who has always wished the lakers actually played the RFA game some time"
"Never seen a team playing Claxton, James Johnson and Bruce Brown major minutes get overhyped this much."

"Not really. Blake was huge. KD was solid. Despite what r/nba thinks Harden is actually a really good defender when he’s not playing lazy through the regular season. Kyrie stepped up huge defensively when he needed to. Claxton and Bruce Brown are both really good. Jeff Green was probably as good as KD. Fine, but Definitely not the corner stone of our defense by any means."
Bruce Brown baby!
bruce brown is solid as hell
Bruce Brown is not the worst.
Someone like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson or Bruce Brown.
"Bruce Brown at 4.7 is highway robbery. Unless there was some contractual situation preventing him from getting more, either his agent or 20+ teams simultaneously fumbled the bag."
Bruce Brown is our 4th star.
Giannis for Bruce brown who says no?
I wish he would start hitting three’s so Ian Eagle can start calling him Downtown Bruce Brown.
Bruce Brown on big brother now?
there's no team that would value a guy like bruce brown more than the nets rn. he don't got too many suitors
The timeline where the Nets trade for a 4th star but Bruce Brown ruins it due to his veto powers being involved in it(yes I know the Nets have no assets to make such a trade anyway)
not gonna lie i thought bruce brown was the one who got signed earlier. it was sterling brown. lol
"JJ for DAJ may not have been a bad move all things considered.  Especially considering that this past offseason they had to give Detroit 4 second rounders and like 6 million dollars to take his contract. At the trade deadline DAJ was completely out of Nash's rotation in favor of giving C minutes to Bruce fucking Brown lmao, I'd have pulled the trigger on even washed JJ over DeAndre Jordan if I was brooklyn"
"They re-signed Bruce Brown on his QO.  Simmons is on a max deal already.  Of course everyone would pick Simmons.  But Brown at the QO is more valuable to the Nets IF it means they can use that money to retain Durant, Harden and Irving no?  Especially if Simmons comes at the expense of not being able to keep those 3."
"They can plug him in like they did Bruce Brown in the playoff's, he would kill teams in that scheme."
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"How I’ve felt with some of the former pistons  Happy for Blake, Reggie, the Morris Twins, Bobi and Tobi, the ghost of Luke Kennard, DRose, along with Bruce Bruce Brown and Christian wood  Except Andre, fuck andre"
"His support cast relatively intact and playing like shit. Yeah on paper they should have washed the has-beens and scrubs surrounding KD but I swear it’s like nobody even looked at the box scores for that series let alone watched it, for the most part they were ass. Jrue couldn’t hit a layup, Khris disappeared every time we played in Brooklyn, Lopez got smacked around by *Bruce Brown* multiple times, and we had two of our top three bench guys play themselves out of the rotation (and one of them never came back). This wasn’t a complete team vs. one guy carrying, it was one guy carrying vs. one guy carrying but slightly less."
Lmao stop and be objective for a minute man. When people say he didn’t have help we mean relative to the competition. Having Kyrie half the series is not the same as having Khris Middleton for the whole series. Blake Griffin is not comparable to Jrue Holiday. Bruce Brown and fucking Jeff Green going off in one of the four games he was healthy enough to play in is not comparable to Brook or PJ lol. They were so desperate they let Harden play absolutely terribly on one leg for 4 games for crying out loud. Like try and be objective for a second. That is not a good supporting cast.
Jeff Green played well in 1/4 games and was not much of a factor at all really. Blake and Bruce Brown were probably KD’s second and third best players throughout that series. Maybe Kyrie over Brown in the 4 games he got to play in. If he or Harden were even sort of healthy the entire series it’s really unlikely you win. I’m not sure what to tell you if you think otherwise. I hate the Nets but you gotta be realistic.
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
We have Mo Bamba.  If they are interested.  I'll take Bruce Brown. Don't need Kyrie.
"But that’s Brown cutting to Draymond, I’d trust draymond to make the right play and I’d live w Bruce Brown’s decision making as long as the ball is out of one of the big 3s hands.   Once the Nets run this action, I’d assume a good defensive team like GSW would force the Nets to get the ball to Bruce Brown, instead of sitting and reacting   to what the Nets do. We see it a lot when teams recognize sets, they cut off specific options to force the action they “want”"
"Yeah, overall he did very well, way better than I expected. Also Kyrie and Harden both got pretty decent defensive effort in the regular season. The whole ""Bruce Brown is a center now"" thing was pretty nice."
"I think  despite AD wants they are going to put him at center a lot so they can put more shooters on the floor.  There is going to have to be a lot of creativity happening in order to create spacing for WB, Lebron and AD.  Even if it’s just two of the 3 on the floor do you really want DJ clogging the paint?  Despite the nets need for a defensive center they benched him in favor of Bruce brown who is 6’4."
That’s terrible lol  He was so bad Nets opted to put 6’4 Bruce Brown at C instead. Think i’d rather have kept gasol
Go traditional Brooklyn... Big 3. James Johnson. Nicolas Claxton. Save the bodies of Blake and LaMarcus for the playoffs. Bruce Brown starting is laughable. Save Joe Harris and the Big 3 for end of games.
"i don't know it's a fake on timothy luwawu cabaret, jeff green is not a defensive player and bruce brown comes in to help.  you got do down vote it just off that."
"Nets have Blake, LMA, Claxton, and Millsap with Sekou and even Bruce Brown as other options  Meanwhile DJ never played a single minute for the Nets in the playoffs, even in garbage time"
"Surprised nobody has said Bruce Brown. I can’t remember any 6”4 player ever who is used as a roll man with good floaters that can crash the boards, especially for a title favorite like Brooklyn."
Bro don’t you think of Bruce Brown as like 6’1” also?? Dudes listed at 6’4”. It’s wild to me lol for some reason I always thought he was real small.
"I couldn’t really any comparison to my game to until Bruce brown came along Lmaoo. I’m 5’9 dude that does the dirty work, rebound, make cuts, floaters, and guards the best and biggest players"
"&gt; However, things are expected to be fluid and matchup based.  For the C spot, I totally buy this, you're not going to leave Blake out to dry against Embiid/Jokic/KAT, that's the situation where LMA will start.   As far as Bruce Brown vs. Harris, I don't really see that being fluid, Harris will probably be a key reserve, but Brown should start given that his skill set is more valuable alongside the Big 3, especially specifically with Harden."
"Also I think Bruce Brown would help cover for some problems Griffin might have playing C, and gives the starting line-up a better rebounding edge. Teams are going to have to be extremely diligent boxing out with Griffin/Brown playing together at those positions."
"Hopefully they both stay healthy because that would be a finals for the ages (no pun intended).  But I think Brooklyn has too many weapons that are more in their primes.  Even if you could imagine KD and Lebron equalizing each other, there’s still a match up issue with either harden (who can go off for 50 at any given moment) or kyrie (who can go off for like 40 at any given moment).    I think who is going to be really important - Claxton his defense is pretty good and necessary.   And the Lakers just aren’t that deep.  Idk if LMA signed with the nets yet, but if they get him, that’s a guy who can get his own bucket.   Patty mills is a tough stop.  Blake showed that he can play solid defense on bigger bodies and make smart plays.  Teams have a hard time figuring out the Bruce brown plays and then you have a consistent floor stretcher in Harris.  And I liked the Carter pickup, he’s a dog.  I never like to count Lebron out, but that nets team, if healthy, is pretty damn tough even if Westbrook averages a triple double."
"&gt; The narrative is just untrue.  How is it not true?  They finished 23rd in Defensive Rating. They gave up a 118 Offensive Rating to the Celtics in the 1st round, without Jaylen Brown and without Kemba+Rob Williams for half the series.  The only evidence of the Nets being somewhat competent on defense is the 7-game series against the Bucks, of which there is a major asterisk on that, due to the fact that their Big 3 wasn't healthy. Everybody ignores this point about the Nets health, Kyrie/Harden getting injured made their defense *better*.   Obviously, it made their offense worse and they were a worse team overall than they would have otherwise been if they were healthy. But they were definitely a better defensive team with those minutes going to Bruce Brown.   Also let's not forget that Milwaukee is a team offensively that isn't set up to take advantage of Brooklyn's warts defensively, they don't have a guard that can abuse Kyrie/Harden in switches. A team like Atlanta or even Washington is so much more threatening to Brooklyn's defense than Milwaukee is.  There's a definitive ceiling as to how good your defense can be with a Kyrie/Harden backcourt."
"I think the wings suck.   Looking at their playoff bench, it's probably   PG: Mills  SG: Bruce Brown or MAYBE Cam Thomas if he breaks out  SF: James Johnson  PF: Paul Millsap  C: Whichever big is appropriate for the matchup (either LMA or Claxton)  Losing Jeff Green was a big blow. I like Brown and Johnson but neither of those guys are shooters. But hopefully if you're running a bunch of other sharp shooters on the floor the gravity will be too much to ignore.  Overall, the bench is a bit deeper than I expected but if they have to cut down to an 8-man group it may be rough."
They kinda played Bruce Brown as a wing/big last year so i think theyre looking at that again.
Did you know Bruce Brown once shot worse from the FT line than he did from the three-point line?
"I'll go with Wilt! Not the heaviest to ever play, but the strongest. Is in the conversation with Jim Thorpe, Bo Jackson, Jim Brown, and maybe Bruce Jenner, as the greatest American Athlete of all-time. Final Answer"
"I’d say Bruce Brown, Patty Mills and maybe Millsap could start on some teams. Cam Thomas could start on bad teams"
You're going to have to explain that Bruce Brown one for me
"Nets Big Man Depth:  KD  Griffin  Claxton  Aldridge  Millsap  Bruce Brown (he’s used as a PG/C)  James Johnson  Sekou Doumbouya  De’Andre Bembry  Jahlil Okafor  Day’Ron Sharpe  That’s arguably 6 starting caliber bigs and 8 overall rotational bigs on the roster (Sekou, Bembry, Sharpe, and Okafor combine to be 1 rotational big). Sounds pretty good to me."
Bruce brown is a real wildcard. If he can improve on his breakout year last year the nets will have the edge
lmao Bruce Brown is better than Kendrick Nunn.
&gt;	idk who Bruce Brown even is.  Lmaoooo the average basketball knowledge of lakers fans on here ladies and gents
"if you dont know who Bruce brown is that says a lot about how much basketball games you actually watch,  because he's not some garbage time minute player who doesn't see the floor"
"I'll give you Party BG and Harris, but LMA literally just came out of medical retirement, Millsap looks like he's about to enter medical retirement and idk who Bruce Brown even is. Claxton and Carter could be good pieces in a few years, and James Johnson has his moments for sure, but JAH is worse than DJ imo  I'm not saying their bench is all time bad or anything, but compared to Melo, Rondo, Dwight, Blazemore, Ellington, Ariza, Monk, Nunn, ect the Lakers easily win the bench comparison on paper."
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
It wouldn't be the first time a player the Pistons dumped ended up being a good pick up for the Nets. See Spencer Dinwiddie and Bruce Brown.
People said the same about Bruce Brown and he played plenty.
"I think it's good value for him but I really don't have that much faith that we assessed him correctly. We've given away a lot of good players for cheap over the last decade, including Bruce Brown last year."
Also keep passing to an injured Bruce Brown over and over near the end of a crucial playoff game
I mean... You can be semi-serious considering what Brooklyn did with Bruce Brown.
Bruh the Nets didn’t want him  Bruce Brown was a better center than this guy. Y’all should be lucky you have Gasol much less Dwight and AD
"In DaAndre's defence he had to compete for minutes with future hall of famer Claxton and Bruce "" the floater"" Brown"
People will say he's washed up but he can still really help us with his size and skill.   Allows playing someone like Bruce Brown more with Aldridge's shooting.
"Nah. Bruce Brown was solid in detroit. Was debatably starter level at SG with Kennard on the 8th seed level pistons at the time. Sekou was a project player who never developed, as well as the only player on detroit picked by the old gm."
Satisfaction of getting trade raped I guess. Chasing the high from when we gave them Bruce Brown last year.
they gave away Bruce Brown to the Nets too XD
Detroit moves on from the previous #15 pick after only 2 seasons. This feels like another W for the Nets; they're probably hoping it's another Bruce Brown discovery. Gets some younger bodies to help get you through the season and offloads a bad contract and a player who is essentially done.
Bruce Brown is that dude
Leaving in Bruce Brown after his injury cost the Nets a pivotal game against the Bucks.
considering the injuries he did pretty well. Using bruce brown as a screener and acting like a big is not something anyone expected and was a smart innovation. he had a bunch of good adjustments like that. Everyone says we have a superteam but ignored that we basically played with only 1.5 all stars every game on average and still ended up with the second seed. He did very well with all the injuries.
"Not to mention Harris, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Patty Mills, Blake..."
"Blake, not Bruce Brown"
"I think he meant Bruce Brown, used to play for the Spurs back in the day"
"I’m gonna guess Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, and Patty Mills"
How about taking shots from joe Harris mike James Jeff green and Bruce brown ?  This argument by bucks fans is hilarious. I get that you wanna believe in the team but acting like somehow harden being there would take shots from Durant is bad is crazy. He creates easy shots for everyone and he was actually still playing and taking shots he just couldn’t drive at all or shoot so he sucked. He’d be taking shots from himself basically and being a lot better on offense and defense e
Blake Griffin Joe Harris Bruce Brown big three better imo. Offensive rating of 133 in 19 games
Durant joe Harris Blake Bruce brown and Jeff green is definitely amazing. That’s the team the bucks beat. The best team they beat was the suns who only got there cuz of injrueisb
"I think you guys would be better off trying to find the next Bruce Brown, a young guy who's decent but the team he's on doesnt want to take on their next contract. I don't know who it is but there has to be a young guy out there worth more than KLove. KLove is a bench player and has been pretty toxic recently so its really not worth it. He's just stretch Drummond at this point"
And bruce brown still gonna be their center
"Bruce Brown, Dwight Howard, Dwayne Dedmond."
"/thread  The ultimate eye test versus box score. I also love how much more impactful he is in the playoffs, one of the rare non-top 10 players whose game is elevated in a playoff setting.  Some other candidates:  * Bruce Brown and Jeff Green for the Nets last year  * DFS  * Richaun Holmes  * Nerlens Noel"
I watched a lot of nets games.  He takes up space.  He can still catch a lob.  On occasion he will tap out an offensive rebound.  He gives high fives.    He’s unplayable on defense.  He plays very deep drop coverage when the nets’ scheme is to switch.  When he does get on a switch he might as well be a traffic cone.  Due to his lack of mobility he is very rarely in position to be a rim protector and even then he’s mediocre at best.  On defensive rebounds he will grab anything in his immediate vicinity but he doesn’t box out so gives up a lot of offensive rebounds.  He has ‘good’ stats because all he does is Catch lobs because every team’s game plan is to ignore him on the offensive end and everyone on the nets is allergic to rebounding except Bruce brown.
No cause the big 3 of Cam Thomas Bruce Brown and Nicholas Claxton is young
"KD, Harden, Kyrie, Harris, Claxton. I’d be bummed if Bruce Brown left tho."
Bruce brown is the same player for cheaper the contract isn’t ridiculous at all
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."
"Dude the only reason I started counting when the series was 2-2 was because you said Bud should have swept the remaining games once KD was the sole healthy superstar. So if we are going to apply **your** logic to the 2015 finals, we need to look at the games where Lebron was the sole healthy superstar (I.e games 1 - 5). So using **your** logic, Kerr and the Warriors should’ve swept the Cavs but instead they went 3-2 and since he couldn’t he must be a poor coach too right?  And I ignored your “coincidences” because they were a lazy argument. You can do what-if’s for any series. What if KD’s feet were an inch smaller? What if Jeff Green doesn’t have the best game of his career? What if Bruce Brown throw Game 3? What if Middleton and Jrue don’t shoot 30% from the field Game 1?"
"We drafted Claxton and traded for Bruce Brown, how does that make sense lol"
"Decent depth?  Be honest, had you even heard of Bruce Brown or Nicolas Claxton a year ago? Them being on the Nets makes them seem better than they are. Just like overrated ass Caruso and Kuzma on the Lakers"
"They're not any more 'top heavy' than you guys are.   They actually have an equal/better supporting cast based on how well they were playing until 2 of their 3 stars went down (and even after). Blake, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris &amp; company &gt;&gt; old Lopez, Portis.  The Nets bench was up 50 pts on yall in Game 2 as Blake was outplayin Giannis, lmaoo. They just lost on a game winner as they were put in a historically impossible positions.  If the Bucks top-heavy roster had their stars get injured, they would get swept, so your point is moot."
Game 3 Bruce Brown
why is everyone forgetting Bruce Brown?
Bruce Brown
Bagley playing as well as Luka or Trae Young  Fox elevating to that next tier of superstar  Haliburton improving to a legit full time starter (not that hes not close already)   This would give you elite roleplayers in Hali/Holmes/Hield/Barnes.  This would pretty closely mimic Blake/Claxton/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris.    Bagley/Fox would give you your Harden/Durant type stack.
Probably DRose or Bruce Brown
No because healthy Harden rn &gt; 2013 Harden  KD is still dominant  Obviously Kyrie is better than his 2013 self  Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are on the team  Patty Mills still does what he needs to do
"The Aldridge part is on Marks IMO, because like this is 2021, you DONT need to have Lamarcus, Millsap, Blake, Claxton, James Johnson on the same roster, especially because one of your best role players (Bruce Brown) is defacto a big on offense"
"Raptors trading both of their picks in the 2018 Draft to Brooklyn in order get rid of DeMarre Carroll's contract.   Carroll played his ass off for the Nets. The picks turned into Dzanan Musa &amp; Rodions Kurucs.  Musa did not play much for Brooklyn,but they were able to flip him to Detroit for Bruce Brown who is a major contributor for them now.  Kurucs became a Starter for the Nets, but the Superstars coming in really changed his trajectory he was traded to Houston in the Harden trade to a team that did not value him as much as the Nets did.   He is playing overseas but by all accounts should still be in the league."
"Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, LMA, and Claxton is more than good enough to win a title with KD and Harden."
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"&gt; harden is playing terribly  Which is the reason for why the offense is struggling, when Harden plays better, the Nets offense will get better, KD doesn't really affect his team's ORating, he gets his points regardless, but he doesn't create opportunities for others like Harden does.   Harden is the guy who gets Joe Harris easy 3s, who makes Bruce Brown look useful etc."
"if we drafted him (I wish we did) he probably still would’ve left in the harden trade, at least we got a free bruce brown out of it"
i love bruce brown and i'm not ashamed to say it
Bruce Brown is the Nets best C
"Bruce Brown was and still is their best role guy by far, but Nash wasn't playing him and now is playing him in lineups with Claxton or LMA (I know LMA can shoot, but when it's not a pick and pop he rarely spaces out actually)"
This is why no one should get too down on the Lakers yet. It’s gonna be really hard to stop them if Russ starts playing like a supercharged Bruce Brown with AD in the dunker’s spot or short corner.
Bruce Brown moves well off ball. Claxton too if Harden's playing. But those guys have a lot of pnr synergy.
"We definitely look off but a lot of it is because it’s a different team.   Bruce Brown still looks great but Nash is trying a bunch of new lineups so he hasn’t been playing. (Looked great tonight)  Claxton just hasn’t picked up like we hoped yet but unless Harden was getting him lobs he always looked like this.   Harris looks really bad, that’s probably the main person who I’m worried about legit falling off.   LMA only played a handful of games for us last year but he and BG look more or less the same.   Losing Uncle Jeff sucks But Patty Mills has been really strong and getting stronger.   And obviously missing 35 mil in cap space doesn’t help, I’m sure you feel me there.   A big thing is Harden was responsible for getting our role players involved and in sync. And so far he’s been off. I’d say after the first 15 ish games we’ll have it ironed out. We have the personnel it’s getting the new pieces to gel."
"Miles gonna earn himself a max contract  2018 class wildin'   Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, MPJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Sexton   also plenty of really good role players like Donte, Huerter, Rob Williams, Brunson, Gary Trent, Shamet, Graham, Bruce Brown...  also some guys that had trouble with injuries like Bagley, Bamba, Wendell who can still get better and some guys like Grayson Allen and Lonnie that can still improve and become very good role players"
"2018  Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, MPJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Sexton  also plenty of really good role players like Donte, Huerter, Rob Williams, Brunson, Gary Trent, Shamet, Graham, Bruce Brown..."
Start Bruce Brown
Why the hell is Bruce Brown playing so little? He was great in the playoffs last season. He surely deserves a starting spot more than Jevon Carter.
Nash giving Bruce Brown DNPs the first two games of the season is weird asf to me
Bruce Brown hit his first 3. The game is now blessed.
Ducking Bruce Brown
"Nets just need to get KD and harden in a good groove together, they’re both incredibly smart and will figure it out. They also need to play Bruce brown to shore up some of those rebounding deficiencies, hopefully Nash is just experimenting rather than legit freezing Brown out because he’s one of their most valuable pieces"
Is Bruce Brown injured?
"Tactically you're going to have a tough time separating coaches unless you do some serious film study.   Philosophically, he had plenty of strengths last year. Really emphasized spacing. He was willing to experiment and be flexible. Rotations, game plans, etc changed a lot throughout the year until the team had a defined identity. Happened organically - it wasn't some set thing the coaches had in mind.   Players had very defined roles but there was a lot of freedom and he encouraged players to do more than the average coach. Like when we had injuries, he had Shamet running backup PG and got him a lot of reps in that role. Bruce Brown started a potentially backup guard and ended up turning into a hybrid small ball 5 roll man. Claxton ended up switching more than almost any big in history."
Sorry didn't realize i came across a Bruce Brown stan
Bruce Brown had sex with Nash’s wife or something.  There’s no reason he’s not playing after he was so great last season.
where the hell has bruce brown been?
not playing Bruce Brown is absolutely boneheaded bullshit from Nash
Is Bruce brown hurt? I don’t think I’ve seen him play these last 2 games
Does Bruce Brown have dirt on Steve Nash or something?
Bruce Brown must've fucked Steve Nash's wife cos wtf is this man
**FREE BRUCE BROWN**
"I got you.  But the problem is that most of the role players we got can't shoot, so they don't fit exactly well with Bruce.    The lineup he probably thrives in (Harden Brown Harris KD Blake) was already seen last year.   If he's not playing by like game 5, I'll be concerned."
I'd go with this. he has been creative with his lineups and used a lot to maximize certain players skills. claxton is a great switching big and was very effective at it. using bruce brown as a short roller was great. You saw the clippers using bledsoe for that last night and it worked pretty well too. might catch on in the league to use non shooting guards as short rollers.  outside of that he also realized blakes best position will be the 5 and he thrived last year at that.
He figured out Bruce Brown thrives as a roller (then proceeded to not play him last game)
"He’s done a really great job of creating different lineups out of nothing, believe the Nets had the most lineups of any team in the league last year. The ability to put together a good lineup helps them adjust to the absences of the stars, maximize role players and bench guys (and not just “good” bench pieces, guys like Claxton who aren’t that talented or guys like Bruce Brown who have a unique skillset), and adjust on an opponent-by-opponent basis."
"Love those type of players, Alex Caruso, Bruce Brown, De'Anthony Melton etc."
"Nobody on the Bucks was either you're just saying shit to say shit lol.  Dude was going the hell off, and Giannis barely guarded him at all, it was a major talking point throughout the series. Besides, you think Bruce brown and Landry Shamet are gonna lock up Trae Young? Lol."
"Ahh ok. I do like the idea of using Okogie in a small ball lineup similar to the way the Nets use Bruce Brown, but McDaniels just seems like a more natural fit at PF. Should be an interesting lineup"
We’ve got enough we only need a few to be useful. Aldridge can be useful against a team like the sixers. James Johnson is a decent Giannis defender over his career. My main gripe was Bruce brown not getting any chances. Millsap definitely looks washed I will say.   Joe Harris still needs to be covered as a threat he’s always useful even if he’s not hitting shots.
"I watched Bruce Brown clamp Harden, Beal, and Kyrie as a rookie, I think he could make it difficult for Middleton at the very least."
Big Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown is gonna be a key part of the rotation anyway. We all know what he's capable of  If you noticed Nash played end of bench guys like Jevon Carter who will likely never see the floor in a playoff setting heavy minutes. He's experimenting with lineups and strategies   Also a big reason Harden was so passive and just forcing lobs to Claxton that obviously didn't work. We all know Harden could have gone out there like Giannis and KD and dropped 30/10 himself but they were trying to get Claxton acclimated to his role as a rim runner and giving him reps to establish chemistry
"I like Bruce Brown because he’s a good ball handler. Other than Harden and KD they don’t have one in the starting five. I’d definitely start him over Harris, just alone for defensive purposes"
The Nets played 7 new players last night (6 if you don’t want to count LMA who played 5 midseason games for them last year). Nets entire bench turned over besides Bruce Brown.
"I’m surprised Bruce Brown only played four minutes. He’s a switchable defender that doesn’t hurt you too much on offense. Surely he provides more than Jevon Carter or an absolutely cooked LMA. I know it’s just the regular season and Nash may want to just try some different lineups, but it really seems like the Nets gave up on any remotely defense-focused lineups."
"Wtf, wasn't Bruce Brown on that Nets ticket sales email advertisement picturing Harden, KD, and him?"
Westbrook had the 2nd most offensive rebounds last season for a guard tho after Bruce Brown
So weird they didn’t play Bruce brown!! He was good last year.
"Gave Bruce brown a cool 0 mins, Dunno why harden kept forcing that claxton PNR, and joe looks like he lost all confidence out there"
"They should also divert some of those to Bruce Brown, thought it was odd he didn't get any run tonight"
Bruce Brown needs to be in the Nets rotation heavy. They were successful with him. He should be a no brainer starter.  Nash just dicking around to start.
"Bruce Brown was an end of bench guy today why? Our bigs' rotation is fucked, Clax is too raw and Aldridge/Millsap are not good. Blake still our best big."
Help Bruce brown is one of my favorite players.  Is he ded for the year or early season toying
I think the thought is Bruce Brown got dommed by the taller bucks defense and his usual pick and rolls didnt work last season against them.   But obviously in hindsight nothing could’ve been worse than what we just saw
Where the fuck was Bruce Brown tonight? Was he injured?  In no world should you be down 20+ points and playing James Johnson/Jevon Carter over Bruce Brown
Why is Bruce Brown a bench warmer now??
Bruce Brown coming in for garbage time.  uhh?
Wait why is Bruce Brown an end of bench garbage time guy now
wait bruce brown just now coming into the game???
WHERE IS BRUCE BROWN
Why isn't Bruce Brown playing? Thought he was good for the Nets last year.
gimme bruce brown
 It sure would be great if we put in Bruce brown who was a fucking rotation player last year Steve.
Wtf I thought Bruce Brown is injured but he's not. Mr. Nash what seems to be the problem?
Get Jevon Carter’s shiny head outta here and free Bruce Brown!!
Nets haven’t been the same since Bruce Brown thought he got possessed by MJ in game 3 of the ECSF.
"Lol I totally forgot about Bruce brown. Put him in, Nash"
How is Bruce Brown not seeing 25+ minutes? Fuck you Steve Nash
Where is Bruce brown
Did Bruce Brown fuck Steve Nash's wife?
The other option is going small with Blake at center and Bruce brown. I think that might be the better option it worked extremely well last year
Is Bruce brown not available tonight?
Bruce “Nic Claxton” Brown
Bruce brown got plastic surgery to look like Nic
"Damn OP, Bruce Brown looks a lot like Nic Claxton these days."
Why did you write Bruce Brown when that's Nic Claxton in the photo
"&gt; They're the 2nd best team in the East but I'd put 2-3 teams in the West above them without Kyrie.  Just out of curiosity, who? Utah and Phoenix I can get behind, but I can't see anybody else.   Also, I think the Nets got better this offseason, they added Mills, Millsap, LMA, and get a full season of Blake Griffin, and a full season of playing time for Luke Walton All-Star role player Bruce Brown.   Plus their defense gets better any time you remove one of the Big 3 from the lineup."
"Oh clutch numbers? That’s what we’re talking here? Sorry, I forgot the first three quarters don’t count.  Giannis in the 4th/OT: 9 points, 4/5 shooting.  KD in the 4th/OT: 15 points, 6/17 shooting.  Who you taking?  Middleton was good in the 4th/OT, shot 5/10 and along with Giannis and known clutch god Bruce Brown was one of only three players to actually score a point in OT. Jrue was fine I guess, 3/7. Did a job. Of course if he and Middleton had been any thing even resembling average, let alone good, prior to that it would have been a blowout, but as we’ve already established games don’t actually start until the 37th minute.  Lopez was good overall but did basically nothing in the clutch, shot 0/1 through the 4th/OT and didn’t have a lot to do defensively with KD just spamming jumpers, but I imagine the fantasy game that played out in your head was much more interesting than the game that actually happened in real life.  Look up who lead the team in 4th quarter scoring throughout the playoffs for us though, it might help you cope harder."
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
Game 3 pissed me off the most. Both teams played horribly. Thought it was in the bag when KD hit the 3 to make it 83-80 with a minute or so left  bumbling ass goons joe harris and bruce brown
Bruce Brown.
"Bruce Brown, Jaylen Brown, Moses Brown, Sterling Brown, Greg Brown III, Troy Brown Jr: they are all actually uh wait a second never mind, I pass, pay no heed to my flair"
"Both guys have hardly played.   And look at previous years...   Terrance Mann, Horton-Tucker, Eric Paschell, Bruce Brown, Diallo, Svi Mykhailluk, Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Dillon Brooks, Thomas Bryant...   These guys are actually playing minutes and were drafted in the 40s/50s. Its not that unusual."
"Did you see what your coaches developed Greg Monroe into? How about Austin Daye? Stanley Johnson? Henry Ellenson? Sekou? How many high potential guys have to flop before you can admit that maybe Detroit was the problem?   Drummond was your only self grown all-star since Mehmet Okur, who was let's be honest even more fringe. Even your few good draft picks, Dinwiddie, Middleton, KCP, they have all only flourished since escaping your coaching and your system. I'd say the same of Bruce Brown from the little we've seen of him in NY.   Hopefully things are on the right path, and yall don't waste Beef Stew, Cade, and Killian's potential the way I worry you may."
Bruce Brown epitomizes this
No shot he starts. It’ll be Bruce brown at the 2.
Please. No. Not after Middleton. And Dinwiddie. And Bruce Brown. No mas.
"KD is a way better defender than he gets credit for, and Harden can be too. Bruce Brown is good at D. Blake... Takes charges lol. I think their defense can be good enough."
"Yeah, why sign Wendell when we could sign Kelly Olynyk &amp; Mason Plumlee back to back offseasons for the same price and dump a Bruce Brown type for literally nothing?"
"The Super Weird player, Bruce Brown Jr. Duh."
Start Harden - Bruce Brown - Harris - KD - Blake  I keep Patty on bench to run 2nd unit and use him in closing lineup over Brown
Start Bruce Brown let Harden run point.
"bruce brown, he’ll throw spacing off tho a little bit cuz he can’t shoot the 3 ball for shit fr, but when you got harden harris durant and blake that shit ah be alright. and i believe in his defense a lot personally and he can cut hard and w a playmaker like harden it ah work out"
"Simmons, Bruce Brown, Zion, Giannis and Gobert.  63 win season and a 45% chance at being the champs."
"These are the players I can't remember hearing a bad thing about all summer long. When a person says any of these names come up on a podcast, the other person immediately falls all over themselves to agree so emphatically that they might also take some credit for bringing him up. Saying you expect big things from these players is like saying the password to enter the sports media hootch parlor.   ...and if you have a 100% approval rating from group-thinky NBA podcasters, I'm sorry but you are probably overrated.  1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  2. Deandre Hunter  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Bruce Brown, Jr  5. Isaiah Stewart  6. RJ Barrett  7. Matisse Thybulle  8. Aaron Holliday  9. Luke Kennard"
Damn you want Bruce Brown that bad?
"Nets are so far over the cap that Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills and Bruce Brown could all be vaporized by a Martian space laser tomorrow and they still wouldn't have any room to sign anybody above the minimum."
Harden KD and *BRUCE BROWN trio is favourites easily without Kyrie
Bruce Brown for Ben Simmons straight up who says no
"Wow almost like former multiple time DPOY Dwight is a better defender than ""Benched for 6'4 Bruce Brown at C"" DJ.  Love to see it."
Is Bembry a slightly better Bruce Brown?   and I love Bruce Brown.
I'd like to see more Bruce Brown in the 2nd half  We look much better defensively with him in the lineup

He's strong as hell and can get up to contest shots. Have you seen Bruce Brown play for the Nets? Or GP2 with the Warriors? They're practically playing the 5.
Bruce Brown is actually kind of useful on defense and as a glue guy. I feel like the nets have too many old vets jacking up shots.
The big 3 + Bruce Brown &amp; Joe Harris line up was used for 28 minutes in the playoffs last year (would have been more if not for injuries). It was good.
He's a better Bruce Brown
Patty's great. it's just troubling that other guys who will sop up Joe's minutes are guys who can't shoot (i.e. Bembry and Bruce Brown)
"&gt; And that's why people don't take their current record as proof they're the best.  One thing I don't see mentioned here is that the Nets are returning a surprisingly small number of players from last season.  That would be: Bruce Brown, Durant, Griffin and Harden.  Meanwhile, Irving isn't playing, Harris &amp; Claxton have been injured or dealing with illness, and Aldridge played only five games last season, so is effectively 'new.'  It's kind of a miracle they're winning this many games so early, especially with Beard struggling with the new rules and getting his NBA legs back."
"&gt;  Cam Thomas is the 12th man.  And he's meh at best?  &gt; Bembry has been a revelation.  Yeah, revealed himself as a scrub.  &gt; Jevon is finally finding his shot.  He found the glory of heaving the ball at the basket hoping it magically lands in the hoop.  &gt; Bruce Brown just returned.  No BB slender here, but let's see how rusty he is.  &gt; Clax will be back soon.  Didn't play like 20 games already, so how helpful is that.  &gt; Blake, though he is having a bad season, doesn’t get minutes anymore.  You mention someone who isn't playing because he sucks... as proof they're aren't shallow depth wise?"
"This is just false. Cam Thomas is the 12th man. Bembry has been a revelation. Jevon is finally finding his shot. Bruce Brown just returned. Clax will be back soon. Blake, though he is having a bad season, doesn’t get minutes anymore."
Right now it would likely come by reducing some of our forwards minutes. We’re playing big with forwards like James Johnson because we hve virtually no guards left.  Bruce brown or bembry would also see less minutes.
He's Bruce Brown with better defense.
First Bruce Brown and now the Mitten - I'm totally ready for the rim-running guard revolution
Why did Bruce Brown play so little?
Bruce Brown just lost his job as the starting midget center
"They’re definitely missing youth and energy on their team. Guys like Caruso are scrappy and go hard on every single play. You need a guy like that when you have a Veteran team. That’s why guys like Bruce Brown and Bembry are so valuable to the Nets, it’s because they do all the little things that Vets don’t typically like to do"
I think Bruce brown might return. But yeah if he doesn’t play our guard rotation becomes super thin and without Harris our spacing can quickly become cramped
I agree with your points but Bruce Brown halfway plays like a center for the Nets
"32% is way better than 24%, if Luka was in that range I wouldn’t clown him. At least he’s among wings and bigs there, not guards like Luka.  Horford has never been a great rebounder, Hawks fans know this intimately and that’s the main reason we signed Dwight and caused Horford to go to the Celtics.  Jrue and Bruce Brown are guards and they are still fighting for more boards than Luka so it seems to me you’re just proving my point.  &gt;	If anything you could argue otherwise - they are picking their fights at the right places.  …meaning they’re not going for difficult rebounds? Again, aren’t you proving my point?"
"Giannis is also only 32%, we going to call him a bad rebounder now?  Horrors 28%, Jrue 26%, Bruce Brown 25%. Just because someone is selective with when they rebound against other people doesn’t make them a bad rebounder. If anything you could argue otherwise - they are picking their fights at the right places."
"Because we lost to the warriors, down joe Harris Bruce brown claxton and millsap ? Or losing to the bulls on a back to back away on the 5th game of a road trip ?   The difference beteeen the nets and the jazz is that the nets have a legitimate superstar they can turn to in the playoffs. You saw that last year that Durant can carry us pretty far. Also if kyrie is indeed not coming back we will likely be active in the trade and buyout markets. This team isn’t close to being finished."
bruce brown jr
"Lebron   Bruce Bowen   Shane Battier / Pj Tucker   Draymond   Rodman / Ben Wallace  Just imagine the switch ability of that lineup and the crazy shit they would do on defense. Assuming we are taking the players in their prime shooting wouldn't even be a problem as Brown was a 40+ shooter, Lebron in Maimi could knock it down Shane or Pj can hit at a good clip and Dray in 2016 I think was a pretty good shooter. Lebron drives and kicks all game and the defense carries the team, I think they'd have a pretty good shot at going all the way on the back of the D and Lebron's drive game being crazy"
"Bruce Brown was 7/9 that game, Blake was 7/12. Maybe running a play instead of just another KD ISO was the better decision."
"Nets also have no kyrie, claxton , blake , harris, bruce brown … shall I continue…."
"Looked into it LMA , milsap , bembry, blake , bruce brown all great on the wing   Lma not wing but hes got size    Claxton is their best big man and he hasnt played injured  Theyre offense is the problem"
"Siakam didn't develop until Casey was gone. Casey himself said that Siakam was like Bruce Brown for him. Would come in and guard and would never shoot unless it was the last option.  The time Siakam spent w Casey he was a rebounder and didn't even bring the ball up the floor and we didn't see anything that made him a menace in transition.  Casey can be credited for: developing DeRozan, JV, Norman Powell, Terrence Ross, and a few select others.  When Nurse got here we saw the development of OG, Siakam, and others.  With that said, credit for these guys should go to the 905 and not Casey."
If it’s any consolation we’re down joe Harris Bruce brown and claxton. If Jaylen brown plays I think it’ll be a decent matchup.
lol Joe Harris and Bruce Brown?
"It's all shit and giggles until ratings start to drop because the casual folks won't tune in TNT to see the Bruce Brown led Nets face the Bogdan led Hawks because Trae, Harden and KD fouled out. The NBA only exists because of money, and the big portion of the revenue streams comes from having stars on the spotlight as much as possible. Silver, the owners and the players doesn't give a pair of shits from equality when a superstar driven league makes even the worst player in the league get a 100k/month check just by sitting on the bench and giving Gatorades."
"Their second-winningest coach ever? Kings aren't exactly a young team.  I feel a little bad for Luke Walton. He spent half a season running the Warriors on the bench - using Steve Kerr's system, Steve Kerr's lineups, and Steve Kerr's ongoing advice, just, Steve wasn't on the floor for *games* - and the Warriors had an outstanding record, so the Lakers offered him his dream job.  He wasn't ready for it. You could see the difference even when Kerr took over. Walton got very nervous a lot and relied on playing the starters *way* more than Kerr did that season when he got back.  And, I cannot emphasise enough, the Warriors were still playing with Kerr's system. Walton didn't coach them to becoming the team they were. Kerr did.  Walton wasn't ready to be the head coach of any NBA team, never mind the Lakers, but how was he going to say no? It's not like the Lakers would come back later.  And then he got fired, but the Kangz picked him up immediately, and I don't get the sense that they even gave him the kind of carte blanche Steve Kerr has for hiring all the good assistants he can find.  Luke Walton's assistants listed on the nba.com roster: Alan Gentry, Mike Longabardi, Jonah Herscu.  Steve Kerr's assistants I know of: Ron Adams, Kenny Atkinson, Mike Brown, Chris DeMarco, Bruce Fraser, DeJan Milojevic.  While, again, I don't think Luke Walton is a great coach, I think Sacramento's coaching problems run deeper than just him."
Bruce brown..?
Bruce Brown too
No KD  No Joe Harris  No Bruce Brown  No Problem!
"harden had 36. not 33. free throw god is back. its a 2 point win against the magic but we're down harris, claxton, bruce brown, durant, millsap, kyrie. I'll take a win anyway we can get it when we're down that many.   james johnson was the guy who stepped up and got it done for us."
"Bruh, we really saw how well Harden could do with just a bunch of shooters and lob threats in Houston and then brought him to Brooklyn just so we can run him out there with DeAndre Bembry, Blake Griffin, Jevon Carter, and Bruce Brown."
Nets one has to be a joke right lol? Our best dunker is Claxton or Bruce Brown
"Yeah I think it would work because the Nets would try to turn him into mega Bruce Brown, defending, cutting to the rim, rebounding. Imagine Simmons getting all those open looks in the paint that Brown currently gets?  But I bet Simmons wants the ball in his hands all the time still. I doubt he'd want to be a Brooklyn role player."
Bruce Brown is 6’4(?) and plays PF.   Ben Simmons is 6’10 that guards and plays PG.
"still, pretty unique. And Bruce Brown is actually listed as a power forward in starting lineups which is actually hilarious when he’s technically matched up against Giannis or something."
"Manu Ginobili and White Chocolate really just played their own game out there, Manu was obviously more effective though.   Manu even got Pop to admit that the best way to use Manu was basically just to let him freestyle out there  Guys like Bruce Brown and Draymond really stand out in the modern game as well"
"Another weird one, Bruce Brown is a 6’3 Power Forward."
The Nets already have spacing issues and that's with Joe Harris Harden KD and Patty.  But outside those guys the Nets have terrible spacing.  They cant afford another non shooter when they play Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin as well.  Unless he takes the Bruce Brown role.

"Griffin and Millsap aren't exactly great so far this season, I'll give you that. But Aldridge has literally been their best bench player, with Patty Mills not too far behind. And I should remind you that Blake was probably one of—maybe even the only—consistently positive player KD had for support on the court. Things change and this year is not last year, but still.  Harris on defense is true, he's had A LOT of yikes on that side of the ball.  Harden is hampered by the free throws, but should not and does not need them to be a superstar or the like.   Kyrie is an unfortunate blow because it gets rid of our most explosive piece of versatile offense. Mills somewhat replicates that, but he has too many cold  nights and lacks the complete arsenal. Bruce Brown is a similar story, though he can play some D to make up with it. I just wish we had even a third of the cap Kyrie is taking to just get a decent compliment shooter. I'm tired of seeing 40 ""almost"" assists a night. I'm tired of not having a second unit that can hold a lead.  But Nets gotta ride above. KD is KD and can do whatever he wants if he plays smart and to his ability. Harden gotta get straight. Those two alone should have gotten us at least one win out of those losses, but it's just not completely clicking yet, though it gets a little better every game.  A little off subject and long winded, but you are underestimating what the Nets have in their arsenal. It's not fantastic beyond KD and Harden, some could argue just beyond KD, but it's not terrible. At the same time, I get that some people outside of Nets fandom are grossly overestimating how the Nets as they are should be performing. Either way, they should be a little better than what they are now."
It's kinda crazy that we have only 5 players in the whole rotation who are a positive on offense and one of them is injured.Blake is shooting 17% for 3 and Bruce Brown is at 30% as well so if 2 of Harden/Mills/LMA/KD are sitting we look rough on the offensive end.
"As they play the warriors who’s second best player is Andrew Wiggins. Their rotation  is a team full of G leaguers   ‘No help’ is an unfortunate side effect of the anomaly that was Lebron in Cleveland (the first time around). That was a very unique situation.   Since then, and in today’s game, it’s damn near impossible to really have ‘no help’. But Stephen A’s clown ass and others have helped create an environment where stars get passes and role players get blamed. Which is ass backwards.    This man has James gotdamn Harden. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters…EVER. Lamarcus Aldridge is contributing. Bruce brown is the same guy who was lauded as a glue guy just months ago . Like get this out of here   Not only that, they’re 10-5! Get Stephen A off the air man. He has too much power and he really effects the culture of how people talk basketball"
"This no help thing is so confusing. Like, ignoring that Harden was the best player on the Nets last night, the Nets have Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, LMA, and a few other solid role players. Their roster is the most talented in the league."
Yea something like that. If I remember bruce brown hit a corner 3 to put them up 10 so I just assumed a team with durant and harden could hold on to a double digit lead so I changed it to seton hall vs michigan
"Kd doesn’t open up things for his teammates? Warriors are literally playing a box and one on him. Nets just couldn’t take advantage of all the open shots he created aside from Bruce brown. And kds rim protection this year is in the 94th percentile, he’s a way better defender than both players. All go fox advanced stats on offense and defense are better than stephs this year"
"As a Nets fan I’m just glad KD locked in that extension until 2026. Hope that Harden does the same with his extension. That way the Nets can recover some assets if they want to move on.    Sean Marks needs to do a better job to fill out the roster. Right now 1/3 of their roster is useless the majority of the time. Griffin, Milsap, Carter, Johnson, and Brembry have been trash outside of a few moments.    Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe are Rookies. Meanwhile Claxton can never stay healthy and when he is healthy it’s obvious that he hasn’t grown his game and is still mediocre. Now you’re at 1/2 the roster.    Mills, Aldridge, and Harris are all streaky and Bruce Brown is 6’4” with the offensive skill set of a 90’s Center.   This Nets decided to go extra small building their roster and the worst part is how slow their “Bigs” are even going small. Their wing defenders are Brown, Carter, and Brembry and they’re all like 6ft to 6ft5 and provide no shooting threat. Their only taller defender was James Johnson who has been straight up terrible so far.    These weaknesses would have been covered up by Kyrie but now these players have to play out of their minds to cover the 25pts + that Kyrie would provide on the court. Nets have a legitimate need in Rebounding, Playmaking, and Shooting which is terrible.   Hopefully after December 15th the Nets will be able to make some moves with limited resources once the majority of the NBA offseason signings become trade eligible."
I dont know but Bruce brown says he knows when to call timeouts now
The worst part is they didn’t challenge that Bruce Brown foul a couple possessions earlier that very well could have been successful and might have gotten them a little momentum at a time when the game wasn’t completely over yet.
Dat draymond foul was devious trying to get the ball over Bruce brown 😭
Bruce Brown can't win with these cats
"Curry...I mean, he's good I guess. Lol  - Bruce Brown"
Nash 100% should have challenged the Bruce Brown foul.  Would have been Draymond’s 4th.   Instead Draymond’s lead the Warriors on a scoring run
Bruce Brown chill fam
Bruce brown got 14 points warriors come on you’re better than this
bruce brown has been the 2nd best player on the Nets this season once you factor in defense
Battle of the Centers: Bruce Brown vs Gary Payton II
Bruce “UPS” Brown  What can Brown do for you?
"Bruce ""Banner"" Brown"
Gary Payton and Bruce Brown are so similar
Bruce Brown has my respect
Bruce Brown hustles like a 14th man off the bench
Bruce Brown and Gary Payton is basically the Spiderman pointing meme
Bruce Brown is jacked for a basketball player.
Bruce brown looks like he was grown in a lab
Bruce Brown best 6'4 center in the NBA
Bruce Brown also made some weird ass comment about Steph. Curious if Steph saw it.
Or Bruce Brown 🤷‍♂️
That will most likely be Bruce Brown and Bembry primary assignment.
The Bruce Brown PnR is devastating
"Playing Bruce Brown over Kyrie certainly helps our defense a lot as well. Obviously makes our team worse, but helps the D"
"Bruce Brown knows when to call timeouts though?  I think nobody does, it's just a thing we do because it's a thing we do, there's scant evidence that you can stop a run or come up with a more efficient play.  I welcome anybody with a new take instead of just calling timeout after the other team makes a big bucket like usual."
"This is true. What Harden has done for guys like Bruce Brown is uncanny, something I don't think Curry could've or would've done."
Bruce Brown best rim protector in the league
"Underrated hallmark is ability to find minutes for lesser role players and have those guys excel in their role. It’s why teams uncovered gems like Bruce Brown, GP2, Juan Toscano Anderson.. the role players that probably would not shine for other teams in other situation but coaching and that situation just works.   Billy Donovan and his 3 guards line up, from OKC to Chicago gets some credit here along this line too, you just gotta make it work and find minutes for guys. Brad Stevens able to make jt work with Evan Turner and that got ET paid. Miami under Spoelstra got the likes of Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow look kinda good. Those guys production just drop off the moment they move on from Miami."
"I think the big questions for both teams are that how they’ll defend the opposing superstars.   The Nets are giving slow footed bigs like Millsap and especially LMA significant minutes, but doing it against Steph Curry is a huge risk. Will they adapt or stick with it? Plus, is Bruce Brown gonna primarily defend Curry? That’s gonna result in a couple of very out-of-position defensive scheme.   KD has barely been stoppable this season, how will the Warriors try to stop him? More Iguodala means better defense but risking a decline in offensive production, Porter/Wiggins are okay matchups, maybe even Draymond who was the primary defender on KD in their last meeting? Heck, will they even try to get Kuminga some reps against KD?   As for Harden, does this mean more GP2 and less Bjelica (since he’s not mobile enough)? Will they stick to Wiggins defending him just like their last meeting? A whole lot of key questions here."
I never said anything about box and one. But teams will just ignore Bruce brown on defense and Blake. They’ve been doing it all year and it’s fucked our offense a lot of times
"KD is the best player in the world. Him and Harden are going to put the Warriors in their place on Tuesday. Lakers x Nets gonna be an epic final. Russ x Harden, Bron x KD, AD x BG gonna be the show of the century. Can’t forget guys like Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Melo, Ariza and Bazemore."
bruce brown is good but not that good i think patty’s better personally
Nah last year his finishing/athleticism/timing/handle a lot of stuff was a little off   This year his finishing looks almost like peak KD he’s taken on the Jeff Greene roll with Bruce brown as ppl dunking more
"yeah the main thing that blew me away watching kyrie when he joined the nets was his hustle. he’s often times the only one crashing for an offensive rebound (besides Bruce Brown), and it’s truly incredible to see because most casuals imagine him as the least likely guy to do such a thing. but he’s always muscling in there"
Patty Mills  Bruce Brown  DeAndre Bembry  Paul Millsap  Lamarcus Aldridge
yeah pretty much. only way i see us winning this game is blake has to hit some 3s. otherwise our offense will jsut completely stifled. or bruce brown hsa to be on his bunny floater game hard.
"Gp2’s game works because the warrior’s offense allows him to work with his strengths like cutting, slashing, dunking. He has great offensive instincts as a 4 man. They way bruce brown played last year for the nets is a good comp. it’s a testament to how good he is now as a shooter and as a cutter that he is getting minutes. Do not disrespect the scouts and coaches and even the players that work their hardest to make things work. If Gp2 didn’t improve and didn’t fall to a great system he would simply be  toiling on the bench right now or worse, not playing in the NBA at all. He was already regarded as a top defensive talent for years (Zach Lowe has been hyping him up way way back) but his improvement on the offensive end (moving without the ball, shooting) made him playable. And his success is further magnified because he is playing in a system that encourages ball and player movement. An iso or pick and roll heavy system won’t do him any good. Steph does wonders to a team and its players."
Position doesn’t matter about height anymore we got some weird things like Bruce brown playing center
"Harden still draws the attention of a top 10 player and they have Joe Harris, Patty Mills, LMA balling, Griffin, Millsap, Bruce Brown, and Claxton.  Idk, I just think that's better than the Warriors."
"Clippers Nets is accurate, even Terance Mann and Bruce Brown are best friends"
"how good would the all-color team be  Jaylen Brown  Jeff Green  Draymond Green  Derrick White  Bruce Brown  Bench:  Danny Green  Cam Reddish  Derrick Rose   What if you added LeBrown James, Kelly Ochre Jr. and Bradley Teal"
That guy Bruce Brown at #4
The Bruce Brown special
If this guy ever gets a Floater like Bruce Brown he be the most coveted non shooting pointguard ever
"Bruce Brown did it first, the opposite of a point center haha"
Bruce Brown the 6’3 Center
Patty Mills is the second best player on the team. I'm talking about Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown is just laughing because he knows he’s starting at center over LMA in the playoffs.
6th man probably Bruce Brown
"Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Bruce Brown, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Reggie Bullock are all in NY now"
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Blake  6. TLC 7. LMA 8. Deandre  9. Bruce Brown  10. Claxton   The bottom 4 is completely interchangeable though.
Funny. The Celtics can’t even beat the Grizzlies. No way you make it out of the first round if you even make the playoffs. Bruce Brown could go to the Celtics and drop more points than Jalen/Tatum.
"Claxton, bruce brown, griffin, LMA, shamet will all come off the bench most likely unless we cut jordan’s minutes all together. That’s deeper than most if not all nba teams. Plus dinwiddie if he wasn’t hurt all season"
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
"Lakers : signed a center that's worse than the 2 centers they already had (better fit than Harrell tho), knowing that AD will be at center in most match ups in the playoffs  Nets : signed two bigs who can't move, and can't play defense, they already had the most talented offensive team of all time, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and Claxton are all better fit than those 2  Haven't watched enough Rondo this season, but at some point being bad in the regular season may not just be because he waits for the playoffs, great for him for doing it last year, but shall we expect a 34years old injured undersize point guard to do it every year ?"
1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Harris  5. Claxton  6. Blake  7. Green  8. LMA  9. Bruce Brown  10. Shamet
I don’t even like the Griffin and LMA signings as someone who roots for the Nets.  I feel like it’s important for team culture (and the team’s likability) to have spunky young guys like Bruce Brown and Clayton and I don’t want to see them lose minutes.
The Nets have not triggered the hard cap.   No player is on the bi-annual exception contract.   No player was received via sign and trade.   And they are below the non-taxpayer midlevel exception threshold in contracts which I believe is around $5.7M (Bruce Brown is taking up $1.66M of midlevel money).
Bruce Brown can defend 1-5 and so can Nic Clampton
Finally a comment with some sense. Aldridge and Griffin are 6-8th men on this roster which might impact a game or two in the playoffs but realistically will have little bearing on whether they win the championship or not. Hilarious that no one seems to understand how good Bruce Brown is for this team. People should be terrified of this man
Usually people consider the best player. That's Bruce Brown
"4th option is Joe Harris, a top 5 shooter in the league.   5th is LMA (maybe?), a borderline hall of famer who, while a shell of his former self, still puts up 10pts/5rebs in his sleep who can get a quality shot off of anybody in the league. 6th option is Blake, another borderline hall of famer who is still a very good passer, decent finisher at the rim, and has developed a very respectable 3 pt shot.  This doesn’t include guys like Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green, or Bruce Brown, who are literally 7/8/9 off the bench. I don’t think I’m overrating the talent on the Nets whatsoever."
Maybe even Bruce Brown lol
Yep. Harris is good (he would start anywhere). Claxton looks good and might in fact just be good (kind of too soon to say). Landry Shamet and Bruce Brown ain’t bad either.
bruce brown goat. next question
"He had Bruce Brown doing the same shit.   They didn’t pursue other stars. They pursued role players. Are they supposed to NOT pursue role players?   Were the Lakers wrong in trying to get Trez, Dennis, and Gasol?"
"fuuuuudge, bruce brown was the player i kept forgetting!"
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
"The nets have Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Nic Claxton looking like top tier role players when they play next to Harden alone. Sure the experience of a vet is nice from a leadership perspective, but it doesn’t mean all that much when the player’s body is broken down a la Blake and Aldridge. In big games down the stretch when Kyrie Harden and KD are all playing, the Blake and Aldridge duo are gonna be splitting what 18-20 minutes combined? Vets in the buyout market going to the nets is hardly the parity altering move that people in this thread are pretending it is"
"So where does this roster stand all-time?    LA and Blake are but peripheral pieces ffs.   They still got Harris, Jordan, and a resurgent Jeff green. Bruce Brown. Dinwiddie chillin on the mend. Roberson too I think?  Shamet and Tyler Johnson have been disappointments but still.   This is ridiculous."
Yeah Bruce Brown does it with these guys too. Almost as though it’s easier to score while playing with good players and moving without the ball
I feel like everyone is really overrating this signing for Brooklyn. He’s gonna have to play center for them and he sucks on defense and they don’t have the defensive personnel to put around him at all other than Bruce Brown.
How much help does Bruce Brown need???
facts. how the hell adam silver allowed this bull to happen again smfh.  i mean come on... how much help does bruce brown need??! its already unfair with just him!!
"You don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about lmfao.   Bruce brown was sent in one big trade with Luke kennard. that’s how we got Bey. They were just announced separately.   And Wood just did not want to stay in Detroit for a reasonable price - hell, we don’t even know if he wanted to stay for any price at all. Wood is a fantastic player but for a team that needs to dump everything and tank, we definitely made the right move by not dumping salary into Wood (if he would’ve even taken it), and doing what we could in a sign and trade  There’s a reason this sub sucks sometimes Bc huge casuals like you who talk about stuff they literally know nothing about"
"I don’t want to hype ourselves up too much, but our starting four is unguardable. Harris is looking like he’s gonna have a GOAT shooting year which makes it impossible to double or switch because we have lob threats for bigs. Add to that, Bruce brown looks great, Jeff green is a great bench player and DJ and Clax are looking serviceable. I hope we get McGee or Drummond because Embiid scares the shit out of me, but I really don’t think anyone is gonna match out offensive output"
Bruce Brown is giving us all the blueprint
Bruce Brown or Joe Harris
"It's clutch time. Kyrie brings the ball up the court.  KD and Harden are standing at the wings.  Jeff Green and Bruce Brown in the corners.  Ben Simmons, accepting the defensive challenge: *oh fuck yeah spread it*"
Lmao Bruce Brown trying to steal the ball there is so petty
"What a complete fucking shitshow of an ending. What the fuck was that? What's with Joe Harris and choking in these late game inbounds situations?   Also, did I miss news or something, why is Bruce Brown like not playing anymore? He didn't get many minutes the last two games and then barely played in this one."
"They would still make it. Don't forget, they have Bruce Brown."
Give us bruce brown and/or Spencer dinwiddie   I miss them
"Nets have DJ, Claxton, Green, and now Blake (plus even Bruce Brown kind of) who will play at the 5.  I think Drummond goes to the Lakers if he's able to choose because he could get more playing time."
"Sure, but how are you going to stop Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet?"
Bruce Brown. Needs to prove that he can lead this team
"you're right man my fault. guess joe harris &gt; klay thompson and deandre jordan &gt; draymond green eh? don't forget about hall of famer nick claxton and bruce brown. not even the 96 bulls could beat them! don't forget KD's telepathic powers, being able to contribute to this hot streak right now while even on the bench in a hoodie!"
"KD has been out for most of the games and Kyrie and Joe have been fantastic. But that alone wouldn't have been enough for the Nets to go 2nd in the East, if you watch the games you'd see how much he elevates his teammates. He makes DAJ look like a decent center, he's got Bruce Brown playing the best ball of his career, same goes for Shamet and TLC. I've watched games where even Kyrie was out and it was just Harden and bench players and he just wins them games. That to me is the definition of MVP."
"Do you consider Bruce brown, DAJ, Shamet, Claxton, Jeff Green to be starting caliber on a contending team?"
Bruce Browns playstyle isn't very relevant to shooting 3s and  his attempts make that difference in percentage useless (same case if it was a little higher with Harden playing). The difference is clear when you see the amounts of spoon fed passes to a cutting Brown which makes him a threat.   As opposed to a playmaking style of Lebrons/Westbrook where he spreads the floor out for shooters to kick to after driving/posting up.  Also you make a valid point about Harris however averaging 50% from 3 for 10 games as opposed to nearly 40 is a very different task to complete.
&gt;he makes players like Bruce Brown a consistent threat  I mean he's shooting 32% from 3 on 1 3PA/g since Harden joined BKN. Last year he was 34% on 1.7 3PA...
Forreal his playmaking is so elite that he makes players like Bruce Brown a consistent threat and Harris get so open he can hit 50% from 3.
"People have picked up on Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown is getting recognition too.  Claxton will get buzz soon but some people are still sleeping on him. Deandre has been pretty good lately too for all the shit people (me included) have said about him."
"Bruce Brown, Caruso, Bazemore"
"Yeah if you start small you can put him on DJ and still let him operate as he does. But Bud isnt going to do that. And if you roll out their regular lineup there's nobody else they can put Brook on. Whenever Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, TLC, Claxton any of those guys are in the game though that's whom they are putting Giannis on"
"Yeah that's definitely not the case, however, he should be guarding KD when it counts, I'd like to see how KD would try and score on him, it'd be very difficult for him.   Though the Nets don't even need to run KD in any of their actions, they just pick on whomever your weakest defender is on, if that player is on Harris, then he screens and pops for an open 3, if that player is Bruce Brown (or soon to be Blake Griffin) than he short rolls and has a 4-on-3. It's really not fair."
What are you talking about? Frank Kaminsky never played with Bruce Brown.
"I watched the game that happened, and I was really upset for him when I saw he went down non-contact. he was looking like a really exciting player and I'm still blown away the dudes been out there hooping for the rockets all season. he's the kind of guy who if he were still on the nets, he'd be getting that Bruce Brown treatment where everyone loves him for his hustle, effort, and just being a good basketball player."
"Yeah he was awesome for those few weeks before the Achilles injury. Basically like last year's version of Bruce Brown (not as good as Bruce Brown has been, but not too far off)."
There are more 20 ppg scorers in this league then there are elite wing defenders and winning is the ultimate value. You insult my examples but offer none of your own but there’s a reason Jae Crowder saw his value sky rocket in half a season and there is a reason everyone wants Bruce Brown now and no one can believe he was so easily available
Yeah you’re not gonna win by doubling off Harris. You need to double off Jeff green or Bruce brown. You can’t seriously tel me the game plan is to double a 50% 3pt shooter and a 40% career 3pt shooter
Bruce brown
Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are going to be more impactful than Blake
"Bruce brown rn, probably KD in the playoffs when in matters"
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown you cowards
Jeff Green or Bruce Brown easily
Ben simmons   Bruce brown   Draymond   PJ  Skillsets are more important than body type
"I love watching the nets man. Harden's passing, kyrie's finesse, Joe Harris shooting lights out and players like Bruce Brown, Claxton and shamet randomly popping off. It's such a fun team. They make their opponents play to their style and hence the games are usually high tempo."
"&gt;Durant - 29/7.3/5.3 on 65.2%TS (5.4 BPM)  Durant has played 18 games this season. James Harden has played more games as a Net than Kevin Durant.  &gt;Harden also has Harris who is averaging 15ppg on 70%TS and shooting the three at a 50% clip  I mean, you can look at the stats of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson before and after the Harden trade. All of those players have had an insane jump in offensive production. In fact, Nick Claxton has more than doubled his production with only 3 additional minutes played compared to last season.   Everyone thought the Nets depleted their depth for Harden but anyone who watches the game can see Harden is getting the most out of everyone. Guys that were 3rd string are now quality contributors. That's a pretty clear definition of an MVP."
Yeah but we’ve been missing guys all year. What I look at is he’s consistently put guys like Bruce brown and Jeff green in positions to succeed even in unconventional ways. He’s been pretty good
All this to beat Bruce Brown
"KD is on the beach dude?  Unless you mean Bruce Brown, in which case I agree."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"Zion, Lebron, Steve Adams, Kawhi, and Dwight Howard  Also Bruce Brown is low key swole"
Bruce Brown and Bruce Bowen
Bruce Brown played wdym
Kyrie Morris and JT were all good friends. Kyrie didn't get along with Rozier and Brown from what was apparent. Ofc you can't know for sure  Also I think the guys just didn't fit together as a team. Everyone had to sacrifice and noone was lifted up. Look at Brooklyn and see how Bruce brown Jeff green and Joe Harris benefit from the stars. They play better than they would without them. With the Boston team they were all so good that they're all putting up great numbers this year but did not fit together at all. If Hayward was healthy a lot of those issues wouldn't have mattered because we would not lose as much and the fit would be better with an additional playmaker but he was recovering.
Plot twist. He was talking about Bruce Brown.
"A big 3 that has all the D focused on them all they need about role players is some Scrubs that can hit shots, and they got them ( TLC shamet Bruce brown tyler Johnson )"
"Landry Shamet, Meth Curry, Bruce Brown and Jeff Green like Voltron  right now providing the offense that KD will provide when he returns. Ridiculous."
Should’ve got Bruce Brown instead smh
Brown vs Brown violence  Jaylen vs Bruce
Bruce Brown
"It’s easy to check. Harris is basically the equivalent of Gordon. Jeff Green is producing like Ariza was. DJ and Claxton are giving you similar numbers to Capela and Nene. Bruce Brown is basically their Gerald Green. And now we’ve added Blake, with the potential to add another buyout guy as well"
"The nets did that without any picks and no free agents. What they did was above basic competence. You might not like it but the nets have actually developed plenty of great players without any top draft picks.  Compare that to the Celtics who outside of their top 10 picks haven’t produced any players that they could retain for value.   The nets were attractive because they were able to win 42 games and open up two max slots without losing any key contributors.  The only reason this was possible was because marks found gems and put them on cheap value contracts. This super team isn’t possible without the culmination of all those moves. Because we retained bird rights on Harris levert we were able to go significantly over the cap and trade for harden.   And again this was all done without any picks whatsoever. I can’t even get into all the moves marks made prior to get levert Allen etc and the moves he’s done with Bruce brown/tlc/Tyler Johnson.   If you wanna talk about a low bar it’s the Lakers. Suck for 3 years ,have lebron join your team and then trade a bunch of picks for a player forcing his way to your team.   I know everyone is crying about the nets now but you can’t act like Sean marks didn’t pull of miracle work in creating this team and he always did it with an eye to pull off big moves like this. This is why he signed guys like prince to those deals to have salary filler and extended guys like dinwiddie and levert to contracts that were team friendly and betting on their growths"
"Obviously Blake is the bigger name base on his history (and I guess DeAndre too), but each of Joe Harris and Bruce Brown &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each of Blake and DeAndre."
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown just doesn’t want to play center any more and he’s going to do whatever he has to save himself.
"Forget about the Nets, Bruce Brown is on his way to becoming the face of the league at this pace. Step aside Zion and Luka, Bruce is our future savior!"
"I think he means Bruce Brown for the Nets this year, he is a 6'4"" ""guard"" who dives to the basket at a .650 shot percentage like he's a dwarf version of Artis Gilmore"
Well other than Bruce Brown KD is the best
Why’d you trade Bruce brown for a bunch of a lint in the crack between the back seats then
I wouldn't say all moves. Selling Bruce Brown for free wasn't a great move
Bruce Brown has invented a new position &amp; no one is talking about it.
Is Bruce Brown starting caliber?
It’s Bruce. Blake left the Pistons to join up with Bruce. In fact don’t be surprised if Drummond leaves Cavs for Brown too. These guys know Bruce Brown’s worth.
"Bruce Brown? Come on man, it’s easily Nic Claxton."
Damn Bruce Brown took the time to call him? Nice
It’s funny that you think Joe Harris the star of the Nets. We all know it’s Bruce Brown
"The nets use bruce brown as a center, he's 6'4""  KP is effectively a wing, he's 7'3""  Positions don't always matter as much as your skillset"
"You're forgetting that they can also trade Jordan for Steph Curry, then trade Bruce Brown for Giannis, Roberson for Jokic, Dinwiddie for Embiid, and Claxton for Doncic!"
"Have you watched him in Detroit?   Now, maybe he gets more mobile over the next few months. Maybe being wide open really helps him.  But honestly? I don't think he's better than Bruce Brown or Jeff Green right now. I don't think he's better than DeAndre. He's very obviously behind the Big Three and Harris. That's 7. I *guess* you might like him better than TLC and Shamet...maybe? I kinda like Claxton though."
"You don’t play gasol in this situation, he’s not gonna survive in the pnr against harden anyway. You play Davis at the 5 and then almost anyone can pick up anyone. Schroeder on harden isn’t a terrible mismatch then you have Davis looking to help off his man and the Lakers are good at scrambling on rotations. It’s not easy with the shooting the nets have but that’d be my strategy. Harden is just too good in the pnr. If he’s feeding buckets to Bruce brown you’re just fucked as a team"
"Nets don’t really have “scraps” though. They basically gave a six man and their starting big and a tonne of picks. Before the harden trade they were arguably the deepest team in the league. Outside of the big 3 they still have one of the best shooters in the nba (Joe Harris), a decent veteran forward (Jeff Green), Bruce Brown who’s been a really good two way do it all player, a very promising young big who can switch onto guards in Claxton and the washed up corpse of Deandre and Landry Shamet who kinda sucks now.   And this is all with the extremely untimely injury of Dinwiddie.   The only thing they lack is a big body inside for AD and Embiid every other team they can smoke pretty easily."
"He played with him, he should know Bruce Brown is the GOAT"
Pulling players who were absolutely on fire. Playing Shamet constantly even though he was terrible. Conversely not playing Bruce Brown when he’s been our best defensive asset. Same with DJ and JA. Not calling time outs almost ever at the beginning of the season. Not fouling the Wizards or Cavs on those come back wins. The beginning of the season was riddled with little things like that.
Who's that Durant dude again? Eh doesn't matter we got Bruce Brown.
"I hope everyone finds someone who looks at you, like how every Nets fan looks at Bruce Brown."
Brooklyn Borough Bresident Big Bad Bruce Brown Buries Bagley's Bunch By Brigading Bevy of Bunny Baskets
"Force Harden to score. I know that sounds dumb for the scoring champion of the last few years, but it's a better gameplan than letting Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris get in a rhythm with scoring. I don't think any team has a chance when the ball is flying around and everyone is super hyped and full of energy. It's just human nature if you're getting involved on offense to play harder D and move around on offense, and when that happens it becomes all but impossible to stop that wave of momentum.   These guys are NBA players. If you're in the NBA, you can get hot and put up 30 if the opposing defense doesn't want to match your energy or really get in and guard you."
The Bruce Brown disrespect
Bruce Brown gonna get Mozgov money playing on this team
We have Bruce Brown

I’m starting to think we should trade KD Harden and Kyrie for depth and just roll with Bruce Brown and Joe Harris.
Bruce Brown
"Brick city tonight, but thank god we have the big 3 compliment on ~~Kevin Durant~~ BRUCE BROWN"
"ESPN: Who's the most important player on the Nets; KD, Kyrie, or Harden?  me: Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown is just built different
Trading away nets legend Dzanan Musa was tough but we got Bruce Brown from it so I'm happy
Bruce brown is my god damn hero
Haliburton is scary. He kept them in the game in the first half. Shoutout to Bruce Brown. What a great fit

Bruce Brown is a fucking dog.
James Harden throwing lobs to Bruce Brown is not what I expected in 2021
SMH how are the nets gonna make it out of the east if they have to rely on Bruce Brown to bail these bums out
Thank you Bruce Brown helping nets cover
I LOVE THE BRUCE BROWN EXPERIENCE
They better update my boy Bruce Brown 2k rating after this
Where were you when Bruce Brown won the 2021 MVP
Bruce Brown is so fucking good
Ayo Bruce Brown goin crazy
"Defense was really good in the first. All the effort seems to be gone on that end of the floor. Also, Bruce brown is literally god"
"&gt;Just like Kawhi?  Kawhi just wanted to play in LA, not in another country. It's a pure geographical reason as to why. I don't think Harden loved living in Brooklyn more than he did in Houston, so I doubt that's why he wanted to get traded  &gt;Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year.   Cool? Siakam was All NBA 2nd team last year, was he a superstar? Or anything close to it? Lmao  &gt;It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks.   No, there were also rumors that you didn't need to throw in Smart too; the focal point was Brown and throwing in Kemba with some of your bad bench players (who aren't fucking helping you anyway, as most Celtics fans even admit) and picks (which you've miffed on for a while now) woulda been a better offer than Brookyln's. Just depends on if Ainge is willing to give up his war chest  &gt;So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away.   Still worth it, even if you gave up Brown. You're trying to tack on accolades to make it seem like you're giving up an insane amount but you're really not. DeAndre Jordan was 1st Team All NBA in 2016 or 17 I believe but he's nowhere near superstar level even in his peak.  &gt;Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  Harden *alone* is capable of taking a bunch of bum role players to the 2nd round at least, and in the East that would be the Conference Finals, which has been your ceiling with the Jays. Do you fucking realize what he's doing with the corpse of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and other forgotten role players like Bruce Brown, TLC and Tyler Johnson?  Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (assuming you added him as a solid vet rotational piece at the wing position who works well with Harden) and any Center who knows how to catch lobs is much better than you have now. It's also arguably better than the Nets pre Harden trade  &gt;Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24.  Lmao, this is what's wrong with fanbases of this sub. Everyone says ""THEY'RE ONLY 24, THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR PRIME"" when defending their coveted young prospects as an excuse not to take the necessary risks to win when in reality being 24 means you're already in your prime.   This is about as good as Brown is going to be, especially considering his super hot shooting numbers are arguably statistically unsustainable and will continue to fall by the end of the year into the playoffs. That'll be the case pretty soon with Tatum. You need to realize you're in win now mode, and if you haven't made the Finals in the next couple years they'll want out  I get it; you're attached to your guys. Jaylen Brown is a stand up guy and great player. However, if your goal is to win a Championship, then you'll take the risks you have to in order to make it work."
"they were getting eaten alive by the Clippers on the glass, regardless of where Brown plays/guards on defense it means the Nets are going to be small out there.  Who is protecting the rim on defense and getting rebounds?  Jeff Green? Bruce Brown? KD?"
If AD comes back healthy to the Lakers this whole cute thing of playing Bruce Brown at center isn't going to work.  AD &amp; LeBron will eat him alive
"Because I don't like KD for going to Golden State when the NBA could've been as awesome as the 2016 seasons for the next few years, I don't like James Harden's game and the fact that he thinks it's okay to go to the club during covid while his teammates and coach had to answer for him to the media. And I don't like that Deandre Jordan is getting paid that much just because he's friends with KD and Kyrie.  Lot of love for Bruce Brown and Dre Roberson tho, hopefully those guys succeed"
They’re the most unlikeable collection of players in the history of the NBA.  They’re also 10x more arrogant and cocky than the Clippers ever were. Just look at Kyrie and Bruce Brown running their mouths like they’re already a dynasty.
It is very well because of it.  Their big rotation is basically a mix off Jeff Green DAJ Bruce Brown KD and Harden.  None of those is a true PF and only one true big man in Jordan.  Joe Harris and Harden have to guard bigs loads of time and get switched onto bigs.  If youre arguing its by design he guards bigs sure but the only reason is because their big men rotation is awful not because hes an insane defender down low or anything.
"Got really confused for a second.  Was just previously browsing in the Nets sub, then hit the bookmark for r/nba.  Was like woo Bruce Brown ain't no All Star.  Yeah, I am the fool."
"But why? The Nets get did nothing to nobody. Durant didn't leave to make a championship team with Irving, he left because Golden State  trainers and medical staff didn't properly find an injury that should've sidelined him for half a year at most and that neglect caused KD to aggravate it into an almost 2-year recovery and the Nets, despite their history of bad coaching staff, bad scouting staff and just bad staff, have always had the best medical staff in the league, bar none.  I get the Kyrie hate though. He's what happens when an intelligent person refuses up get educated. Like he knows just enough to have facts that he thinks back up his terrible points, when in reality, those same exact facts are what disproves it if he bothered to read just a little bit more about it. I'm clearly taking about the flat earth thing, but I think it can be applied to him more generically.  As for Harden, I didn't really like him much before he became a Net, but I also only watched him play when it was against my team or in playoffs. I didn't like his beard and thought he was sort of a shot chucker. He's proven me wrong, I absolutely love him now. I love pass-first point guards that make everyone around them look like superstars à la Jason Kidd in the New Jersey Nets golden age. And Harden is actually out there looking like Jason Kidd with a nuclear jumpshot. He's my favorite of the big 3 now and I used to hate him... KD is still the best player on the team obviously, but I love me some ball distributers.  And the rest of the Nets, Jeff Green, Joey fist pumps, Dinwiddie, TLC, Bruce Brown, they're all likeable guys, every one of them.  I'm conclusion, I sort of get the Kyrie hate."
Not sure how replacing a 6’4 Bruce Brown in the starting line up with KD makes our defense worse? He’s a good pesky defender but KD is still better at locking down wings while providing some rim protection.

You mean Miami Hurricane Bruce Brown?
Bruce Brown Sr.
Bruce Brown is just that typa guy. Sort of like Pat Bev just a lot less talented.
"They aren’t gonna play hero ball for 48 minutes. When it comes down to closing time in a tight playoff game or when the nets offense has gone cold, they have arguably three of the top iso players in the league to get the team a bucket and keep them in it. And plus they clearly showed they’re able to play defense tonight as it wasn’t a shootout and both teams ended the game around 110 points. Their defensive rotations are pretty suspect now but in the Phoenix and Clippers game tonight, they’ve shown flashes of defensive effort and that’s all they need as their all time great offence will win them a lot of games, reg season or playoffs.   And who is a “total ball stopper”? All three have shown the ability to share the ball, get others involved such as TLC, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet... etc. This isn’t the OKC KD and Russ show. Harden and KD are willing to defer to Kyrie if he’s hot, Harden will undoubtedly play like a pure PG come playoff time and depending who’s hot that night will get the ball in closing time."
I don’t know but it’s kinda uncalled for. When you see dudes that have literally done nothing like Devin Booker or Bruce Brown calling him soft and a bitch that must mean a lot of dudes in the league not respect PG. I’ve never seen guys go at a star player like that ever
"Uh, DJ was asking him how he fouled him in the game and PG explained it and it ended his argument. When PG and Bruce Brown were about to get into it, all the Nets players pulled Bruce aside while telling PG he was good.  He may nit have respect from fans/users of this sub, but he has the respect of his peers. Outside of “Future Coach and GM” Jared Dudley, he’s liked, especially with how he has battled injuries and never made a big deal of them."
Bruce Brown been a good player for us all season.
"Bruce brown, Jeff green, Joe Harris are good players then the rest of our bench is shooters"
Bruh it's Bruce Brown... He's on a 10 day contract as Flight would say.
"Even aside from that last call there was some weird calls throughout the game and players were getting visibly annoyed   Off the top of my head there was one where PG looked really mad after a call, one where it looked like PG traveled but got FTs, one early where Kawhi spun around and seemed pretty upset at no call, Bruce Brown got upset at a call and got into it with PG, etc. So it was a recurring issue with the consistency of calls"
"It's a game winning flop from your star player that's averaging a 20 pt triple double on 50-40-90 shooting. How can you not appreciate a player like that as a basketball fan. If some random Nets role player like Bruce Brown or Joe Harris made that play, people would be begrudgingly respecting it, but since it's Harden its full on hate. If Pat Bev did this for you guys, Clippers fans would be pumped as hell, same as Celtics and Smart, Raptors and Lowry, Lakers Caruso... etc. I could go down the entire 30 NBA teams and list at least 1 player who falls a little too easy on contact trying to bait calls, and usually that guy is a fan favorite of that team, while fans of other teams fucking hate him, but accept they'd like him on their own team."
i want bruce brown driving into traffic and flipping up some bullshit
"GGs Nets.   Even shorthanded without KD and our sleeper espionage agent Shamet's sabotage didn't stop yall. Capitalizing on the turnovers in the first half made some good buckets, DJ's best game I've seen this year, Bruce brown with some tough looks as well."
Bruce Brown called him names and hurt his feelings
"The Clippers wasted their challenge on the Beverley foul, so costly, especially because it such an obvious foul.  Bruce Brown is very good, he's got so much hustle. If the supporting players continue to step up when KD (And Dinwiddie) return this team will be nigh impossible to beat.  Fingers crossed for Jeff Green too."
Bruce Brown is my father
In this house we stan Bruce Brown
Nothing is gonna stop people from saying Paul George is ducking Bruce Brown
Bruce brown needs to suplex pat bev lmfao
"Right now MVP is Bruce Brown  Too bad they wont give it to him because he has too many allstars on his team, even tho he's the best of them"
Is he Bruce Brown but with a 3?
Bruce Brown is our Draymond dammit lol
Bruce Brown isn't a rookie
Lmao Bruce Brown called PG a pussy. Dude gets no respect in the league anymore. Even rooks call you a pussy tough
I love Bruce Brown
PG better settle down before Bruce Brown power bombs him
rebounding is 50% effort and the nets coast a lot. bruce brown has been getting a lot of them this game just through effort
Bruce brown just that kinda role player a team like the nets need
Bruce Brown that trash player that absolutely infuriated you when he randomly has a big game.
bruce brown definitely showed out tonight on national television
bruce brown is out-hustling our entire team. that and turnovers explains this
Bruce Brown has j00cy shoulders
Imagine trading Bruce brown for Musa lmao
"I'll say this:  Unlike Bruce Brown (or Jodie Meeks for the older fans out here), Jerami Grant does NOT look good just because he's a decent player on a bad roster.  He looks legit, period!"
"Nah we’re just better when Bruce Brown gets minutes, Green/Allen start, and our bench isn’t just Caris LeVert bricks for 20 minutes.  Harris off the bench has really helped a lot of the flow.  I’d like to finally see a Kyrie/Brown/KD/Green/Allen full strength lineup with LeVert+Harris as 6th/7th men"
Throwing Bruce Brown into the starting lineup has helped; he played 13 minutes total in the 7 games prior to last game and started the past 2.  But also generally I've seen better effort all around.
We’ve been good defensively tonight and the last game we played against the Jazz. Starting Allen and giving Green and Bruce Brown more playtime is a big factor
Bruce Brown being a non threat from 3 should be an iszue for BKN if Philly are smart
Bruce Brown is breaking out tonight
Bruce Brown could be our poor mans Jrue holiday from what I saw tonight and the fact that he’s good makes the loss of Dinwiddie so much easier to stomach. Why tf was he not playing before
"We traded Kennard, 4 second round picks, and Bruce Brown for a 1st and second round pick"
Do you watch basketball? Did you watch the game yesterday? He couldn’t stop *Bruce Brown* from scoring on him at will
"I agree with this take and I’m a Nets fan.  I also really like Allen.  With Kyrie and Durant the rest of the guys on the court loses touches.  Look how Joe Harris has done with his minutes on the court with them.  Jordan isnt the same player he was when he was making All NBA teams but him getting less touches is good.  You don’t need to point to the Spurs/Manu.  What about Levert on Allen’s team?  Is it disrespectful for TLC to start before him?  Or is it disrespectful to Levert and Harris that Bruce Brown, Prince and Green started before them last night?"
Bruce Brown is the Glue Guy
"So did Bruce Brown and Jeff Green, all for the first time (including Allen). Don’t think tonight is reflective of anything. That said, Allen should start every night but KD wouldn’t like it"
Steve Nash's secrit play : start Bruce Brown
"Good team win! Kyrie was on fire, Allen is a stud, Bruce brown deserves more minutes. Very stoked on this win!"
JA and Bruce Brown need to start after this
this was a blessing in disguise for the Nets imo. Having Durant out made Nash experiment with new lineups and reap the success of guys like Bruce Brown.
KD  Kyrie  Caris  Spencer  JA  Joe Harris  Bruce Brown  Shamet
Bruce Brown is nice tbh he makes smart decisions when hes on the floor
"Wow, close to a perfect quarter as you can get from the Nets. LOVE the changes Nash has made. Fans were clamoring for mins for JA starting, Bruce Brown and TJ and so far, it looks like these moves are paying off.  Need to keep this intensity up. Also Kyrie might go for 60 lmaoo"
he needed the bruce brown defense more
Bruce Brown needs to take Taurean Prince's spot in the rotation when Durant is back. See what happens when you finally play him.
And leave open Nets dynamo Bruce Brown?
So why didn't Bruce brown play again
Bruce Brown getting his chance finally!!! So happy for him
Bruce Brown proving he deserves to get consistent rotation minutes on this team.
"Bruce Brown already showing he's a rotation player, playing all around smart basketball. And guess what else? He plays Defense. If Nets are smart they'll play him way more often."
Plus letting Bruce Brown have any minutes is new
If you replace Bruce Brown and Taurean Prince with Bruce Bowen and Tayshaun Prince are the Nets favorites this year?
Bruce Brown lowkey brings the clamps
"The positives:    Bruce Brown finally getting minutes   Jarrett Allen starting over DJ    The Negatives:    Joe Harris coming off the bench? No idea why Prince would start over him when he is worse at literally every facet of basketball   Regardless, i’m intrigued to see how it works"
So sad but so true. Him and Barry Brown are the reason KState is gonna be stuck with Bruce for a while
"Doubt it, we have Bruce Brown on the roster and he isn't even getting playing time. No way RHJ would have a serious spot in the rotation.  Plus RHJ isn't even worth the minimum, he won't be getting our dpe lol"
"We already have a great defender in Bruce Brown, our best defender outside of Allen yet he only gets on in garbage time"
"I like Bruce Brown a lot, and was surprised the Pistons let him go, but he's not stopping anyone in the playoffs either. We was a good role player on a horrendous team last year that got extra usage.   We'll see. I'm not saying you're bad. You're a contender.   I just really have legit concerns about your defense. Prince sucks. Shamet is a great shooter but is also not stopping anyone offensively.   I just have concerns about your ability to defend good teams in a seven game series. I have no doubt you'll have blowouts in your favor, but I think you have serious defensive holes.   Not trying to shit on y'all. I just don't think the Heat comparison is a good one. You're not that good."
"TLC is consistant offensively not defensively which is one of the big concerns and eventually there will be a change in which Bruce Brown comes in. We lost to Memphis because of no Kyrie and Kd, and held Charlotte to 106 points and lost that game because of Shamet and Prince shooting 0/15 which i doubt will happen again. The only game where the Nets lost this season when they played great offense was yesterday."
"I'd make a trade of LeVert, Prince and a 2nd to the Magic for Aaron Gordon and Khem Birch. Try to trade Dinwiddie first instead of LeVert even though Dinwiddie is a better fit with higher IQ it sucks he's injured, but if not LeVert. Then DeAndre is gone for literally anything we'd even pay picks for team to take him free. Actually play Bruce Brown at PG, call back Claxton from reserve purgatory and tell Nash to draw some plays for once"
"I hate how the nets never play fucking Bruce brown, he might be their best defender. I think he could help them at least if a smaller player is taking over  And his offensive game is weak but he improved on it a lot last year and I’m sure he did again this year although we will never know"
Real question is why did they trade for Bruce Brown and now refuse to play him?
Bruce Brown has been so good for us
Bruce brown really good role player
God I love Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown 6MOTY tbh IMO
Bruce Brown was a good pickup for the Nets
God I miss Bruce Brown.
BRUCE BROWN IS A BULLY
Donte and Bruce Brown are mirror images. Play the same role
Bruce brown 🔥
Bruce Brown was an unreal pickup
"BRUCE ""BABY SHARK"" BROWN"
"Bruce brown proving his worth. Nets bench is nowhere near as bas as people say (with 3 open spots, too)"
Bruce Brown is good and the Pistons traded him for nothing. What is the story there?
BRUCE FUCKING BROWN
Bruce brown and Jeff green aren’t bad
Y’all’s DPOY is standing in the corner guarding Bruce brown
Ish Smith  Bruce Brown  Issac Bonga  Tony Snell  Felicio
"I agree he wont, he's a bench guy.  Like I also think the Lakers have an edge in this series, but it's weird that everyone is talking about the mismatches the Lakers will have (they'll have a bunch) but kinda glossing over all the mismatches the Nets will have as well. Yea the Nets have poor interior D and Bruce Brown will not do well vs LeBron (in fact every defender doesn't do well on LeBron). But KCP wont do well on KD either, no?"
"You can slander our superstars but I wont tolerate any Bruce Brown slander. He's been a premier guard defender and is shooting like 80% on floaters, he also tries extraordinary hard every possession and deserves respect."
"Bruce Bowen would had been nice in his prime, Bruce Brown, probably has no chance."
"I think our post defense is rightly criticized as terrible but I think the bench thing isn't completely accurate and honestly sounds a lot like how people criticized the Lakers bench last year.  Our starting line-up fully healthy (physically and mentally) against the Lakers will probably be Kyrie-Harden-KD-Jeff Green-DJ (assuming no more additions to the team). The bench consists of Bruce Brown, Shamet, Joe Harris, TLC, Reggie Perry. Joe Harris is obviously a very good role player, and players like Brown, TLC, and Shamet are actually solid (Shamet started the year terribly, but since some random Nets fan called him bad on Twitter a week ago he's been shooting like 45% from 3). Reggie Perry looks aight in the 2 games so far, but he's a rookie who knows. Also, Harden and KD are some of the best floor raisers in the league. Surround those 2 with just mediocre players, and they draw so much attention it makes those average players look extremely competent."
"Shamet has had a tough start to the year but I'd trust him to shoot a catch and shoot 3 over Rivers over the course of a season. And Bruce Brown has been a god damned revelation for the Nets. I'm guessing you're a Rockets fan, so for comparison Brown is our PJ Tucker. He's a really solid guard defender, and while his 3 is not quite there, his floater is at like 80% it's crazy.  Maybe I'm lower on Noel that I should be, but we played the Knicks last Wednesday and Noel was the worst Center out there. Obviously 1 game samples are nothing, but DJ was a monster vs Robinson, and Perry outplayed Noel. Seems silly to trade Dinwiddie for another guard who might not break the rotation and a Center that looked worse than the 2 currently healthy ones we have."
"Probably DJ, KD, and a revolving third player. Maybe Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown has been stepping up big time in his absence.  Its whatever to me. Go KD and BEARD
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
"TLC is pretty solid for a a backup, hes shooting 37% from three and shot 39% last year. Shamet is a proven 3pt shooter and bruce brown again is another solid bench guy, hes shooting 57% from the field so far and is a legitimately good defender who locked up mitchell and jamal murray. Jeff green is a decent role player, hes shooting 45% from 3 and has decent size. He thrived last year with harden.  Its just our bigs are horrendous. we're gonna rely on claxton/perry to step up which is asking a lot. DJ is one of the worst players in the league right now. we just have zero bigs."
"Solid write-up and solid recommendations on players to target.  I wouldn't be surprised if a Dinwiddie trade does happen for some more frontcourt depth. I'm in the minority here, but I'm kinda high on Bruce Brown as a perimeter stopper.  There's definitely a major need for some frontcourt depth though; Jeff Green had a resurgence in Houston last season but some more bigs are needed. Opposing teams will feast on DAJ in the playoffs."
I can see that you don’t watch Net games that often.   Nets don’t have 0 Defense they have Bruce Brown. He’s worth like 1-5% Defense.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Bruce Brown"
"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"
"Teams with depth don’t beat teams with superstars in the playoffs in the NBA. It’s not football where the 53rd man muffing a punt or unable to be a good long snapper can lose the game.   Even if we play your game and pretend the 6th man matters as much as Tatum vs KD, you’re severely underrating the Nets depth. No team has a fourth option as good as Joe Harris and Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet are productive solid NBA options as well. TLC and Chiozza are no different from DiVincenzo/Nunn. You just started with the conclusion the Nets suck, and are grasping at straws to figure out why."
"Let's also not forget that our depth before the Harden trade and Dinwiddie injury was by far the best in the league. After, we still have some depth. Joe Harris is lethal, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown are productive on offense and valuable defenders, Landry Shamet hasn't been great so far but can shoot the lights out at times, and Nic Claxton will be getting minutes when he gets healthy and I'm fairly certain he will be surprising a lot of people with his play."
"Dude isiah Stewart is a future starter. The guy hustles and can switch up on defense and play the pick and roll well. This is key in the new nba. He also has a jump shot, but the coaching staff wants to bring him along slowly. Saddiq Bey is averaging around 10 pts a game  and shooting over 40% from 3 pt range, and can guard multiple positions at 6’9. These guys aren’t superstars but cmon man this was a weak draft. Pistons trade Bruce brown and kennard because they were going to be free agents next year and they don’t want to pay players during a rebuild. That future first is top 15 protected with even more protections after the CWood trade. It can end up turning into a second rd pick."
"1. You were talking about **draft class**  2. The 4 2nds are overrated value since you can get good undrafted players (many examples to point to), the future first was extremely heavily protected, Bruce Brown is hardly playing minutes, and Luke Kennard got a huge extension.  Like of all the things you could have mentioned, you didn't mention Christian Wood..."
"Killian over Hali or Deni is already a mistake. He’s playing a G-League level— he can’t be counted on to be the PG of the future. Could’ve taken Maxey, Pritchard or Quickley later and been better off.  They traded a lot to get their next 2 picks. Including Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard 4 2nds and a future first. Stewart at 16 is just a waste. He’s a good culture guy but he’ll never be anything other than a back up C. Bey is great but you can’t build around him. You could’ve taken him at 16 and Quickley at 19 or a high ceiling guy like Hampton or Poku.  3 FRPs and the Pistons still barely have a “young core”."
"Lebron, Wade, and Chris bosh played with an old Ray Allen, an old Birdman, an old Shane Battier, and Mario Chalmers.  &amp;#x200B;  Joe Harris is better than all of those players, they have Dinwiddie next year, and Jeff Green/Tyler Johnson/Bruce Brown/Shamet/TLC are all fine, too, right?  &amp;#x200B;  I've never understood why people are so worried about BK's depth."
"Their bench is already pretty decent though, Bruce brown, shamet, possibly Joe Harris. All they really need is another big"
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
Bruce Brown is basically current Westbrook anyways
"never been an offense with this kind of fire power either. 3 dudes that have averaged over 25 ppg, 2 of them over 30 ppg before. They can all shoot 3’s at high percentages, create shots for themselves, finish at the rim and they can all play make with shooters around them. Bruce brown is a solid defender as well. Not saying they’re a lock but to count them out would be crazy. KD is playing out of his mind"
I'd disagree on the plays. We actually do have some very nice sets with kd and kyrie. But yeah his rotations have been horrific at times liike not playing Bruce brown and keeping in dj.
"He's getting better. His timeouts were bad to start the season. He also has questionable endgame line ups like having dj instead of allen in at times.   I like the fact that he's willing to change things up, like add bruce brown to the rotation. I also like the fact that every game, the first play is usually drawn up to get joe harris a shot."
"Defence isn't something you just figure out, you gotta have the personnel for it. No one other than Bruce Brown on the Nets is an above average defender"
How u suppose to beat joe harris and bruce brown? Tf?
"True, can’t sleep on Bruce Brown lol"
"3 Superstars is just too much man  KD, Harden and Bruce Brown. Unfair"
bruce brown the new bobby brown GOAT
Seriously why the fuck didn't the nets play Bruce brown at all from beginning of the season?
Bruce Brown for a second round pick. Thank you Sean Marks
Not Kevin Durant or James Harden but Bruce Brown with the dagger 3 lol
I wanna be Bruce Brown when I grow up
Bruce Brown was a real good pickup for the Nets
all my homies LOVE Bruce Brown
TELL THEM YOUR NAME BRUCE BROWN.   That man is a starter on most teams.
Bruce Brown. The closer.
They will have to play Bruce Brown 48 minutes because they can't defend
"Yeah and the Nets are deeper than most people realize and are clearly not done making moves. TLC, Bruce Brown, Chiozza and Jeff Green are not as trash tier as people like you make them out to be"
"I do hope people take note of this. Your example of Boston vs 76ers is something I was guilty of parroting where I saw no way the Celtics were stopping Embiid. Then reality hit and I watched a good coach scheme up a good defensive plan to counter their ""weakness""   Its why the Nets are iffy. I think people underestimate the coaching of Vaughn as an assistant, but also can they implement a system that limits their defensive weakness and uses good defenders like Bruce Brown and TLC to offset their lack of good post defense? I have no idea  On the flip side, what would teams do vs the Nets? A lot that I as a layman can't think of off the top of my head because I'm not experienced nor smart enough in basketball defense to make an efficient game plan"
No. Bruce Brown is a much better defender than Harris.
"It's a problem for now, but I have full faith in Marks to make good use of those 3 open roster spots  Our defense isn't all terrible atm though. KD has been stellar on defense so far, and Bruce Brown has been good as well. We also have quite a few defenders that aren't good, but also aren't negatives either. Guys like Joe Harris, Jeff Green, TLC, and even Kyrie at times this season. Hoping Harden falls into that category as well.  I think as long as well can get a decent center from the buyout/trade market then our defense won't be as much of a problem. Our biggest issue is just that we have to give DJ heavy minutes now, and he's just not good enough for that"
I'd put Bruce Brown on that list.
"How in the world in the playoffs would the Nets be even worried about their bench? Between those 3 players, one can be on the court at all times with even just a tiny bit of staggering. Not only that, Bruce Brown, and TLC are way better bench players than you or any non Nets fans want to give them credit for  And the Nets roster isn't even finished either"
manu ginobili  tony battie  bruce brown jr  wayne ellington  travis knight
"Both the Boston and Heat big 3 were in a relatively weak eastern conference (this East is very hard for the Nets), and both Celtics and Heat had defensive superweapons (Garnett/prime Bron) whereas the best defender on the Nets is... KD? Bruce Brown?    Like no, a track record of 2/2 teams making the finals with a big 3 is not a guarantee, and the Nets are going to struggle against a team like Boston in the playoffs."
"Okay let's see: They have Bruce Brown who was unjustly out of rotation for a while. He is really good for his potential role. They have Joe Harris who is one of the best shooters in the league. They have TLC, I think he is really underrated as well. And I completely forgot about Shamet, he isn't as good as advertised but still another shooter wouldn't hurt.  They'll miss Allen more than Levert, so Durant will have to play at C more. Other than that, I think they have a deep roster."
We have Bruce Brown to defend guys like Kemba
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"I think losing Allen for us was the biggest hit, Bruce brown is playing well so agree RHJ and a big would be pretty good. Unless marks waits for the buyout market"
"We still got a solid bench. Harris, Meth Curry, Shamet, Bruce Brown, and 3 more buyout spots with $6 mil contracts each"
guys guys guys he’s talking about bruce brown
"The bench is Bruce Brown,TLC,Shamet,Jeff Green and an as of yet unsigned Vet big.(Nets have 3 open roster spots atm)   Thats 3 dudes who were starters last year and TLC. That doesn't sound like a bench thats a problem to me. And that's before you factor in Spence possibly coming back for the playoffs"
Bruce Brown era.
But the quality of the players on the bench doesn't change. Do you not think playing Bruce Brown for 20 -25 minutes a game against some of the top teams is not a problem?
"They still have Jeff Green, Shamet, Bruce Brown, and Dwinwiddie when he comes back next year. Will also be a buyout / vet min destination and have the TP-MLE"
Defense is actually been good with Bruce Brown
"Starting 5: Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/DJ  Bench: Bruce Brown/Shamet/TLC/Jeff Green  Closing 5: Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/Jeff Green (LOL) &lt;-- this lineup is hilariously unstoppable and hilariously bad on defense  Nash and MDA really are the perfect coaches for this team, they always like to test the limits of how far offense and small-ball can go."
So is Bruce Brown their sixth man or does he have to start lmao
Their bench is still better than 60% of the leagues benches. If yiu bring Joe Harris off the bench along with Bruce Brown and TLC its a more than adequate bench
"Their depth isn’t that bad though.  Kyrie/Harden/KD/Green/Jordan is an outstanding starting 5.  Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan are weaker starters, but decent vet role players, and the big 3 is insane.  Joe Harris is a good 6th man.  And then other guys like Shamet, TLC, Bruce Brown, etc. are decent bench players.  Also, I’m sure they get the odd buyout ring chaser as the season goes on.  Off-court stuff is a big risk.  Kyrie is a complete wildcard, and KD and Harden are both primadonnas.  But if they can keep the locker room functional, and stay healthy, I think they’re strong championship contenders this year, and even stronger next year, with an offseason to stock up on ring chasers."
Our depth is fine it's our big man rotation that's ass. We still have Joe Harris Jeff green tlc Bruce brown shamet. Those are decent players to have around 3 stars.
"He has worn 23, 20 and 1 before  Bruce Brown wears 1  23 is Retired  So maybe he goes back to 20"
Bruce Brown lowkey underrated. Nets D lowkey nice after he joined starters. Mans is gonna bring the clamps
I think u forgot that Bruce brown is on the nets
"It’s really not that bad, I know it’s the Knicks but guys like Bruce Brown, Reggie Perry have really been stepping up. Buyout market should be great for us. Shamet is starting to get confidence again. Tyler Johnson is a good player who will be back soon. We have high hopes for Claxton."
"I don't even think their bench is that bad honestly except at the 5 spot.  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown / Chris Chiozza   SG: Harden / Shamet / Tyler Johnson   SF: Harris / TLC  PF: Durant / Jeff Green   C: DeAndre Jordan / Nic Claxton  With Kyrie being out, they have a bit of backcourt flexibility which is nice. Their center depth is atrocious though. Get Whiteside for a second rounder or something."
"I love how everyone now just assumes Kai is coming back, or that if he does come back, he won't just leave again.   You're dealing with an actual idiot.   Bruh their third star may actually be Bruce Brown lmao"
Don’t worry Bruce brown will turn into Bruce bowen and guard every player on the court for us
DJ did well today.  He still has a playoff or 2 run in him..  Bruce Brown is good &amp; Jeff Green can hold his own.  Would like to see a Kyrie/Harden/Green/KD/DJ lineup.    Nets also have some exceptions where they can sign a big or veteran SF.    Marks isn’t oblivious to their roster.  He’s a top 5 GM in the league. They’re not done making moves yet...
Bruce Brown KD
Bruce Brown got clamps. He a summer league legend
Bruce brown tlc KD are plus defenders. Harden is an elite post defender.
Jeff Green and Bruce Brown
"At wing/guard I’m still ok with our depth. After our big 3 we have Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Jeff Green, plus Shamet and Tyler Johnson that are playable, and Chiozza who is decent but severely limited by his size.   Unless Perry (and Claxton when he comes back from injury) seriously surprise us though, our center situation is FUCKED. Nets will probably be looking to find a starting caliber center somehow before the deadline if they wanna contend this year.   Next year a FA or two, plus getting Dinwiddie back (I think we’ll have to re-sign him but with bird rights), will be the year we really go all in."
Bruce Brown is one of the premier wing defenders in the league
our bench wont even be that bad   Joe Harris or Bruce Brown/Shamet/Jeff Green/TLC/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton (when healthy)/Reggie Perry/Chiozza   will probably sign a few more players to fill it out
"Not only traded him for Bruce Brown, but in that same deal, got us Shamet and...would ya look at that...Reggie Perry."
Bruce Brown with 2 games (back to back at that) of being a killer   Now if we can get a big man
"You know who he is.  Jordan surprisingly not a negative this time. Reggie Perry is thiccc.  Anyway, Bruce Brown with 14 rebounds. Let's goooo"
But he somehow traded him for Bruce brown who killed it for us today
"Bruce Brown is good player. The Nets still have plenty of depth after trading for Harden.   They'll also for sure pick up another piece or 2 in the buyout market.  And the future draft picks? Who cares. The window to win is now, draft picks 7 years from now don't matter"
"Not pretty but winning without our best two players and with one of kyries worst nights in a while is good.   Nash is doing a great job, getting the bench to contribute like that is so nice. Bruce brown is the goat"
Bruce Wayne Brown!
Damn bruce brown has 5 fouls?!
Bruce Brown is the real mvp
People were freaking out about signing Blake to a vet min meanwhile Jeff Green and Bruce Brown are absolute steals making the minimum that nobody cried about
i want to marry Bruce Brown

Lonzo didn’t box out Bruce Brown
Bruce brown goated
I love Bruce Brown.
This ain’t over. Bruce Brown ain’t a sure thing at the line but great rebound
"Against what kind of competition? And can he avoid being targeted relentlessly vs a team like the lakers?   Hes a pretty bad defender and isnt exactly a knockdown shooter. They can try and post him up but id argue that exactly what teams would want.   Truth be told, i think bruce brown will have more value"
"The Sixers needed to put in their starters the last 5 minutes of the game to close out Landry Shamet, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown and Tlc. That's quite pathetic and embrassing. You aren't winning anything when your second best player can't hit a jumpshot and your second best offensive weapon is a marginal 20 ppg scorer. The 76ers realistically aren't a threat to the Nets, EVERY nets fan knows that and see the Bucks as a bigger adversery. The 76ers are the most fraudulent team in recent memory."
My god. Bruce Brown does not need this much help.
"Bruh they had to put their starters in for the last 6 minutes and the Nets still cut the lead down to 6 with Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown and Tlc. The Sixers aren't a realistic threat to the Nets."

"It's so nice to see past Detroit players doing so well. Bullock, Bruce Brown, Reggie Jackson, The Nard Dog, Blake Superior, Morris Bros, D Rose, KCP, Bobi, Svi, etc etc"
"Allen and levert are not better than Shamet (who had 30 pts today)/Claxton (whose a lot better defensively than Allen) and brown. Remember, Bruce brown didn’t even get playing time until harden was in Brooklyn. Harden had some of the best role guys in the league like Blake griffin/Bruce brown/shamet.   Even if you filter for Durant without Levert/Harden, His team impact still trumps Hardens.   Just as an exercise I filtered for Durant without Allen and Levert &amp; in 400 minutes his net rating is +9 with a 120 offensive rating, still higher than Hardens. What’s your new excuse for Durant having higher team impact?  https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935,1628386,1627747  Cmon Kd when healthy is the most impactful on the Nets by every metric."
There was a play where Kyrie and Bruce Brown were both guarding Bam in the post. Kyrie waved off Brown so he could guard Bam 1 on 1. They immediately have to double and Bam just kicks it out for an easy 3 for Duncan 🤦‍♂️
Griffin isn't even better than Bruce Brown lol
"Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet isn't insane depth if luckily 2-3 of them even get  a chance to play in the playoffs for over 5 minutes"
"dinwiddie is gone after this year in 95% of scenarios for this tax reason. retaining him is gonna cost us 50-60 million dollars which we just arent going to do. Also if we keep the big 3 after the next 2 years its also entirely possible that shamet/claxton are gone. we have them under contract for another two years but theyre going to want bigger contracts. if we keep joe harris just him and the big 3 will be over the tax line. so we're just going to be so deep in the tax and in the repeater tax it seems impossible. if after the next 2 years we do drop the big 3 then we can keep those guys minus kyrie, i think its difficult to predict what he actually chooses to do.  And if we lose the big 3, harris, claxton, shamet, bruce brown is probably one of the worst teams in the league if not the worst"
Harden has played like 10 games with KD and roughly 20with Irving.  The reason people think he should be in the MVP race is because he won games for the nets with a lineup of Harden - Tyler Johnson- Harris - DJ - Bruce Brown. Which is objectively worse than the lineups he had in Houston.
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"&gt;Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  He won the MVP in La Liga that year.  You've zero idea what you are talking about.  &gt; Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all   He was a prospect, who had just been drafted #19 overall.  Like I said.  &gt; First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams   Harden was just traded for them, among many other players.  &gt;It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry.   No, it's not like that at all -- and Orlando didn't get much more than that anyway,"
"Nobody knew how good Marc Gasol would’ve been, he was basically a throw in  Crittenton was solid but nothing spectacular at all, and his career blew up due to a multitude of things  First rounders don’t mean much for contending teams  Kwame sucked and actively held the team back when they had to play him for a couple games   It’s basically if Vucevic was traded to the Nets for Bruce Brown, DeAndre Jordan, two first rounders, and Reggie perry. That’s an awful deal for Orlando"
Is he even better than Claxton or Bruce Brown at this point?
Bruce Brown. I love that guy
"Lol nah. Warriors got bailed out in 2018 and kd carried in 2019, 2018 too. Harden is better. You’re so mad the nets are going to win and harden will hold the finals mvp, something steph can’t do   Imagine harden losing FMVP to Bruce brown or some shit like Steph lost to iggy"
"Bruce Brown will lock any of those guys up.  0 Pts, 10 TO - book it."
"How the fuck is it different? Both are built around attracting star talent in free agency and via trade, putting vets around them, and mixing in a few younger/homegrown pieces (Caruso, Kuzma vs Claxton, Bruce Brown, Harris)"
People have to start talking about how great the nets bench is. Claxson is a monster and Bruce Brown is just good. Jeff Green also is a great offensive player. With all their guys missing yeah they dangerous
Yeah you aren’t doing it for defense the foul problem stuff is definitely true though   Real question is whom do you put as your 5th guy if BKN with those 3 and Joe Harris. Pretend to still care about defense with like Bruce brown or just say fuck this and put in Landry Shamet and go all in on offense and spacing. Think at that point I would probably do the latter. Dont give Joel Embiid a natural matchup defensively

Bruce Brown + Landry Shamet
"I’m sure there’s at least one guy in the Nets rotation that Bryn can hide on: Shamet, Johnson, or Bruce Brown"
"You obviously haven’t watched the Bucks defensive schemes this season. Also, he’s going to absolutely horrible things to Bruce Brown"
I’m not sure you understand what’s going to happen when Bruce Brown is guarding him lmao
I still think the Nets will win but it'll be much more interesting since we don't have Green. His spacing is enormous and we sorely missed it last night. They will adjust though. I hope we see more Bruce Brown.
"And having KD do whatever he wants to defenders on offense while somehow getting fouls in his favor…  Also that one on Bruce Brown pissed me tf off, Matrix-level dodge from Jay, Brown pulls his arm back for some reason, and it’s still a fucking foul"
"Don’t forget the phantom Tatum foul where he LITERALLY did not make contact with Bruce Brown. Brown swung HIS arm up into Tatum and we got the foul. Fuckin refs, man."
"I don’t think their roster is shallow at all. They have great roll players  Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Nick Claxton, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet  Hard to ask for more than that"
"We made the adjustment of putting Bruce Brown on Kemba and switching him onto Tatum too late,that slowed Tatum down somewhat  but he still made some tough shots."
Bruce Brown should get more minutes
"Because everyone knows the real big 3 is Claxton, Green, and Bruce-muthafucking-Brown"
The role players are just straight bad this game. Claxton has been straight negative and bruce brown only contributes effort. It's basically Harden and KD vs the Celtics rn.
What is Bruce Brown doing out there man
Bruce Brown is a delight!
"i knew bruce brown after he transferred to vermont academy to play there instead of in mass, and i think a huge reason he came here is because there is next to 0 racist remarks or anything like that ever made here during sports outings, obviously they had to travel some places and it was still a possibility but just another reason I love Vermont"
"Appreciate that bro. That 1 year was just a ridiculous season for Mass high school sports. We played Jake Layman, Bruce Brown, and Jalen Adams all in one season.   That felt like the last year before the heavy migration to prep schools, where any kid with a shred of D1 talent will never put on a public school uniform."
"I grew up in Boston and played against Bruce Brown my senior year in the playoffs (he was a freshman at the time for Wakefield High).  I was 1 of the 3 Asian kids starting on our team. We showed up 3 hours early for shoot around, and their entire student section was there, about 100 deep.   The amount of racial slurs and Asian jokes I heard was crazy. The only reason why we weren’t rattled was because it was the same theme across every gym we played at outside of our home gym.  Anyone from Boston who is denying the inherent racism that exists is just being blind. Does that mean all Bostonians are racist? Of course not. But the city (and state) still has a lot of work to do.   Side note, we ended up losing the game by 1. We were up 11 with 4 minutes left in the 4th. I threw a bad pass that got picked off by Bruce Brown for a breakaway dunk. Our team collapsed over the final 3 minutes. Fucking Bruce Brown lol...."
Bruce also didn't stay in BPS which is like 70%-80% Black or Brown. Not saying much here besides it's very segregated around here.
Bruce Brown
"Yea. His shot isn’t like quite as bad as like a tony Allen or Roberson, and it looks decent, but it’s still pretty bad (career 33% on 4.2 3pa per 36, and most of those shots are wide open). Then in addition to that he’s pretty clueless on what to do on offense, you can often see him just sort of running and looking around like he doesn’t really know where to be (not that he’s dumber than all other players but it’s sort of hard to be in a good position and not get in the way when you’re limited.) Not much of a dribbler/creator either. Plus doesn’t help he’s on a team with a post guy and a non shooting PG.   There’s some hope that his shot can get like pretty decent on open shots, since like I said the numbers aren’t completely awful and the form is decent. Also I’m hoping that playing with Green has helped him, because Greens positioning and movement is absolutely top notch for someone who has exactly one offensive skill. And some sixers writers have discussed how maybe they could try and use him a bit like the nets use Bruce brown, with a lot of screening and cutting, although that would require an improvement in the ball skills category."
"You dont watch basketball if youre saying Thybulle has had no improvements in his game.  Philly has copied what Brooklyn has done with Bruce Brown, with solid success.  Philly doesnt need him to score. If he was on the thunder, he might be able to crank out some high scoring games too."
I remember being upset we got Bruce Brown instead of Kennard...
Gotta be smoking to take bruce brown over caruso
Bruce Brown ain't no spot up shooter
Bruce Brown -11 lmfao
"Bruce Brown -11 lol, it doesn't even feel like he's played all THAT bad"
I keep referring to Bruce Brown as Bruce Bowen. Needs more elbows tho
"Joe Harris,Uncle Jeff, Bruce Brown, they got the other Tyler somewhere and Bitcoin dinwiddie"
I hope a team would pay Bruce Brown big bucks this summer. Really like the guy.
Bruce Brown with that godly IQ pass
Can't believe the nba let Joe Harris team up with Jeff Green and Bruce Brown.
Bruce Brown and getting open looks for the 4 foot floater
You forgot Bruce Brown babe
I’d just like to chime in that we also got Bruce brown out of that trade. I’d say pistons and nets probably both got what they wanted out of that
"All teams involved in that trade got a decent return. Detroit got Saddiq Bey and cash considerations, Nets got Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet, Clippers got Luke Kennard and 4 second round picks."
Nets got Shamet and Bruce Brown out of that deal
Claxton and possibly Alize Johnson as well.  Bruce Brown was pretty much another find - traded Rodions Kurucs for him and also got some cap relief.  Fans of opposing contenders want to pin it on luck because the alternative reality is harder to deal with - that Brooklyn’s success is repeatable for a long time to come.
"Bruce Brown crying for a goaltend is hilarious. The ball barely left his hands, he has no argument"
Bruce Brown
Coulda called him Bruce Banner instead of Wayne. BB for Bruce Brown and Bruce Banner
I think it is very amusing how much Bruce brown ends up in the 5 position and how many rebounds he gets
that was bruce brown
bruce brown playing that Draymond role
If Bruce Brown had a wet jumper he’d be a max player.  He’s basically Simmons without height.
Bruce brown
Lmao Bruce Brown Block
DPOY Bruce Brown (no bias whatsoever)
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown will lead the Nets in scoring at least once.
Marcus Morris. Michael Porter Jr. Facundo Campazzo. Bruce Brown. Shake Milton.
Bruce Brown. His hustle and energy always sparks something in the team
"We have a lot   Joe Harris - 33rd pick   Spencer Dinwiddie 38th pick   Bruce Brown - 42nd pick   Nic Claxton - 31st pick    (if we're talking about only players we drafted specifically, then Claxton is the only answer)"
Bruce Brown on the Nets
Wes Matthews on the Lakers      Seth Curry on the 76ers      Bruce Brown on the Nets      OG on the raptors
"I was just messing around and it seems to mess up when players have identical names. I tried Kareem - Bruce Brown and  it took two seperate ""Ken Johnson"" players as the same people and two seperate ""Mike James"" as the same people so it skipped a ton of links."
So Bruce Brown is Charles Barkley?
"I mean, it'd be okay if he wasn't a tremendous shooter or lockdown defender. He could still cut to the basket and set screens for teammates. I would point to Bruce Brown as an example of a guy who really makes the most of every possession without the ball. But he didn't like doing that in Houston and went back to his usual style of play in the playoffs."
"Claxton, Bruce Brown, Shamet have all had solid years."
"And I want Blake to fail, and the Nets to fail, but Bruce Brown to succeed :)"
"I was so confused reading. I was like Kyrie and Bruce Brown got injured, since when. You meant Jaylen Brown. Lol"

bruce brown plays on a team with the greatest spacing ever. his efficiency won’t be as good in other situations
bruce brown is better on D
"Caruso’s started and won a championship, played at the highest levels, plus Caruso has actually been consistent, this is the 1st year Brown has ever looked this solid, plus Caruso’s a much better defender and flashy dunker so he’s more valuable than Bruce as a role player"
Is that delusional to take Caruso over Bruce fucking Brown? RINGZZZZZ ERNIE
12 Million for Bruce Brown is fucking crazy lmao
Oooh Bruce brown. I read the OP too fast and was confused why anyone is paying Bruce Bowen 12 mil. He ain’t playing no more!
That is a crazy claim that tho lol...Bruce brown over Caruso yikes
Gotta be smoking to take bruce brown over caruso
Caruso is a much better player than Bruce Brown
Paying Bruce Brown over 12 million a season should get you fired.
"If someone gives Bruce Brown $12 million, you should try to also have James Harden because he's not a $12 million guy without a player like Harden setting him up on offense"
You keep your dirty hands off Bruce Brown
man i love bruce brown but if you pay that dude 12million youre a dumbass. Hope he proves me wrong tho
"The Bruce Brown part is weird because he's excelled in such a niche role.  Actually not even just niche, but a role that literally hasn't existed before."
"&gt;League executives also mentioned Bruce Brown, Alex Caruso, Talen Horton-Tucker and Nerlens Noel as players who could be in for significant raises averaging above $12 million per season.  Shit! I am afraid to see what Tim Hardaway is going these guys are getting above $12 million."
"Hey Joe, re-sign Bruce Brown and Spencer Dinwiddie. Keep doing what you're doing.  &gt;(10-sentence minimum)   no"
So much disrespect to Bruce Brown
"Doesn't matter, they still have KD, Kyrie and Bruce Brown"
"1 all nba level guy and scrubs doesnt make you a good team, especially when you dont have a great defense. We would be much worse if marks didnt pull bruce brown, claxton, shamet, and jeff green from the scrap heap.  But its fine, like i said i dont expect credit from anyone especially knicks fans who have even more big market advantages than us yet still struggle to attract free agents."
Because Bruce Brown was holding down the fort
"still can’t believe that bruce brown trade. made no sense even when it happened especially since they cut Musa.  Musa was atrocious his entire career up to that point, Brown was at least playable. WTF man"
perimeter D is fine. We just don't have any aggressive rebounders outside of Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown is just on the Qualifying Offer this offseason right? I can’t see him taking that. He’d probably easily pull $10 million per in the open market.
LeVert and Allen were late 1st round picks   Claxton is a 2nd rounder   We got Bruce Brown for Musa and a 2nd   We got Harris and Dinwiddie OFF THE WAIVER WIRE   Jeff Green's on a Vet Minimum    Thinking they did nothing to get here is Bullshit
I always get Sterling and Bruce Brown confused lol

Bruce Brown doesnt average that....
"I'm going to hop on the T-Wolves Bandwagon if we lose because Bruce Brown and Jeff Green go off on us.      I can accept KD toasting us, but if Ben and Joel shut the superstars down and we lose to....Jeff.....freaking......Green.....please no"
Well the Bucks dont have an answer to Bruce Brown either so tbat cancels out.
Kyrie has been amazing to watch.  But imagine having Bruce Brown and Uncle Jeff Claxton to carry KD while Harden plays beautiful basketball.
Bruce Brown is a fucking dog.
"That Nets-Bucks series had a good chance of being a sweep if Bruce Brown didn't literally lose his mind and take the potential game-winner while on the floor with Kyrie and KD, and then if Kyrie didn't proceed to get hurt the next game."
And Bruce Brown got slandered for taking the shot that he did.
"Bro that’s not even the only ones. Tobias Harris, Bruce brown, Spencer dinwiddie, Middleton (kinda). There’s a bunch more in the playoffs who were former pistons haha"
*bruce brown
he should have asked bruce brown how to pull a carlton and go for a hero shot
tell that to bruce FUCKING brown
the Bruce Brown
"Kevin Huerter, Donte, Wendell, Simons, Shamet, ROBERT WILLIAMS, Mitch rob, Gary Trent jr, Devonte Graham, Brunson, Jevon Carter, Bruce Brown, Melton, Shake, Holiday, Allen and Walker arent busts"
Bruce Brown wouldn’t be good on any team without superstars. He costed them game 3 too. That showed me he’s still a scrub
"Please. if he did pull up and brick it, all of r/NBA would have shit on him like they did Bruce Brown."
I didnt watch that game but people keepy saying Bruce Brown. Anyone got a clip?
Set play for Curry. He didn't want to end up like Bruce Brown from the other night lol
"He played the entire 3rd quarter.....and was shooting 50% in the series from the floor with kyrie Irving in the lineup. No one, even lebron James is winning or staying efficient with Mike James/Bruce brown and 99 million salary on the bench"
"Yeah, had Bruce brown not made a bone headed play at the end we would be shitting on him for  being 1-8 from 3 and 4-9 from FT as well as using 31 shots for 33 points. It’s not a playoff p 4 point game level performance but he’s also held to a higher standard as a mvp and main star of the team with championship aspirations."
Or Bruce Brown cost them a title… The Bucks probably lay down in game 4 if they’re down 3-0… Nets sweep and their stars get rest…
"Being blown out is losing by 40 in game two, game one wasn't really close either after Brooklyn got that lead after the Bucks initial run. Game three they got lucky as hell, the Nets played their worst basketball of the year and still barely lost with Bruce Brown taking crunch time shots."
Did Bruce Brown save the Nets from blowing a 3-0 lead in the playoffs? It's entirely possible.
"As a Bucks fan, you're telling me you don't see anything wrong with Coach Bud and his lack of adjustments? They went from a switching defense to not switching against these Nets at all. He's not abusing the fact that he has a 7'1"" center that used to make his pay cheque in the paint, who definitely still has the touch, he's not taking advantage of any of the matchups that he can exploit playing against a team running a 6'5"" Bruce Brown at center—no disrespect to him, he was one of my fantasy breadwinners, but fuck man. Year in year out, the Bucks make no adjustments in the Playoffs because of the coaching staff and bow out early.   Management doesn't owe Bud shit. He's a great floor raiser, great regular season coach, but he's not a championship pedigree coach."
“It’s Bruce Brown time for sure this one baby”
Doesn’t matter as long as the nets still have Bruce Brown
"Which Rockets team are you talking about specifically?  The 2016-17 team was basically comprised of Harden-Pat Beverley-Trevor Ariza-Ryan Anderson-Clint Capela-Eric Gordon as its main rotation.   I don’t think a lineup of KD-Joe Harris-Bruce Brown-Blake Griffin-Nick Claxton any less talented.  Citing their PPG during a season in which they played with three guys that averaged 25+ doesn’t make much sense because of course their scoring burden was lessened. I’m talking talent and tools.  Claxton is in his second season to Clint’s third at the time, Joe Harris is the best shooter on either team, Blake’s passing out of the short role would have been huge for that Rockets team (as would Jeff Green’s ability to attack the rim or dish to shooters)."
"You wrote up a great explanation of why Giannis shouldn't put at center for 36-40 against Embiid and the Sixers. Problem is, they are playing the Nets and he's already guarding the biggest, most physical player on the opposing team.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ1xUsMet30  Pay close attention to who is on the floor for the Nets and who Giannis is matching up with. I'll let you in on a little secret: it's Blake Griffin. Brook Lopez is guarding Bruce Brown. They take Lopez out and Giannis is still guarding Griffin. Only when Giannis goes out does Lopez take that assignment. During that run with Giannis at center, he is also guarding Griffin.  The role change you are talking about is way more theoretical than actual. Gotta adjust the theory to the situation, you know?"
*Bruce Brown has entered the chat.*
"Bruce Brown has such a deep calm voice for someone whose body language is so ""jumpy""/ ""active"""
Those giannis jrue pick and rolls are deadly everytime idk why we dont do them more. And your totally right brook has practically shot nothing but 3s which boggles my mind when I see bruce brown or joe harris switch on him. Even claxton or blake I dont think are big enough to really stop a good post up from him. But hey thats bud for ya.
"KD has carried worst teams against better opponents?  He has always had an MVP next to him in all of his past playoff series except for 2 i think due to Russ having an injury, and they lost to Grizzlies one year and beat Houston one year that started players like Omer Asik, Chandler Parsons and Francisco Garcia with a 2013 James Harden.   If KD can win this series against Milwaukee without Kyrie and James harden this could arguably be his crowning achievement.  No ring is involved with winning this series, but carrying guys like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Blake Griffin, Mike James etc is way more then he had to do in the past."
"Hell No !! The Nets team is pretty well constructed even without Kyrie and Harden. Joe Harris is a legit - might’ve made the all-star team in another universe. Blake Griffin is playing like it’s 2017. Mike James, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, all solid players. This Nets team is atleast better than a few of the James Cavaliers that ran through the East Post Kyrie."
Bruce brown 48 minutes
"Cam Payne.  Luke kennard. Saric.  Grayson Allen.    Campazzo. Austin rivers.   I haven't watched much eastern ball but maybe bruce brown, shamet, blake Griffin"
"Shake Milton or Kevin Huerter, Landry Shamet &amp; Bruce Brown probably, Mikal Bridges"
Yes I have watched the series I remember when brooks great rim protection led to 8 straight points on like 4 ft floaters by Bruce fucking brown that forced a time out. Just because he isn’t a worse shooter then giannis doesn’t mean that he isn’t bad that like saying well atleast giannis isn’t Ben from the ft line he’s still ass chief you will not have a good offense if you are cool with a 30% three point shooter jacking them up and teams are more then likely going to allow Brook to shoot that shot then let giannis get to the rim so giannis now has to go through his man plus a helper or give it to Brook who in these playoffs is shooting 23% but hey I’ll agree to disagree at this point it’s like arguing with a brick wall not wasting any more time on it
"uhh, the lakers don't have anyone as good as bruce brown?  that's a fairly ridiculous take, even before he almost single-handedly cost them game 3.  off the top of my head, KCP and caruso are significantly better.  he's a short player who can't space the floor and exclusively takes 5 foot floaters when he's wide open.  joe harris just went like 3-18 the last 2 games and provides very little defense (the lakers role players suck at offense but are a huge part of how the lakers ended up #1 in defense, even with AD missing a lot of time).  harris is OP when he plays with the big 3 because he's always open, not nearly as valuable when you are down to 1 star and need harris to actually do something on his own."
Dinwiddie is out of the picture. Bruce Brown is what the Nets are working with.
Not just that… Late game 2 KD was on fire. If Bruce Brown doesn’t take that shot Nets could have won that game up 3-0 it’s over
I mean dudes so good he carried Curry Klay and Draymond. I’m sure carrying Mike James and Bruce Brown should be nothing to him.
"It would be Mike Brown and Joe Harris with Bruce Brown at the 3, no?"
They have one top 3 player and 1 top 15 player in that team and yet you blame Bruce fcking brown?
"i think it's more that the Nets are thin beyond their absurdly good big 3 and Harris, because, well, of course they would be, so if you're counting on bruce brown to sub for kyrie and, i dunno, reggie perry or somebody to replace Harden, then you're gonna have a bad time. Nets will have the best player on the floor but the Bucks will have more overall talent."
Blaming the game three loss on Bruce Brown is dumb as hell. The dude did more than he was asked to do playing the center on offense. Harris literally has 3 points.
They came Bcus of Bruce brown and his clutch shooting
"if kyrie and harden are out for 5, i think nash should start griffin and deandre along with kd, joe, and bruce brown"
"How can he prove himself when he has a skeleton team around him? The Nets traded away all their assets for Harden.  Joe Harris is probably their best starter, elite 3pt shooter, not a black hole on defense. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are decent, but average for a starter. Deandre Jordan is just ok, efficient offensively, and catches lobs but he's easily exploited on defense. Everyone else is below average or terrible.  Bruce Brown is actually decent offensively, but as a PG he's pretty shit, can't facilitate worth a damn despite playing significant minutes. Mike James is a much better facilitator as a PG, average 3pt shooter, but absolutely trash in the paint, not a threat running to the rim so defenders just guard him at the key. Claxton is too inexperienced and has no idea what's going on half the time. TLC been trash at the perimeter this season, isn't great on either end of the floor. Shamet is a good volume 3pt shooter, isn't great at the rim, shit defense, a decent player off the bench actually but not starting caliber on any team. Chiozza is like 5'9, can't shoot, gets shit on in the paint, but is a good facilitator.  With KD, Kyrie, and Harden, this is an blowout championship team, with KD and either Kyrie or Harden, this is a legitimate contender. With just KD, this is a play-in team at best lol. Wayyy too top heavy to be able to afford 2 of their 3 stars out."
"Can you imagine how bad Giannis would be in a lineup with Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton, Joe Harris and Mike James?"
Nets hardcore screwed by refs   Giannis injuring Kyrie    Joe Harris going 3pt brick for brick with Giannis   Bruce Brown pulling a Carlton    Nets can still win this series without Kyrie/Harden if refs stop allowing hand checking against KD
Nash is actually fucking brain dead. He actually played mike James over Bruce brown.
"It went from ""Bruce Brown cost the nets the game"" to ""KD can't win."" Didn't KD score 16 in 3rd quarter? Didn't KD score the last 8 points for the nets in game 3? It's like y'all throw away context to make these shit takes and jokes."
"sure, you can take bruce brown"
When your next 2 best performing are Jeff Green and Bruce Brown I’d think you deserve at least a little slack
Bruce Brown is straight garbage
The only reason they were still in the game is cause Bruce Brown went off.
If KD was mad Steph and klay were taking his shots Imagine how made he is that Bruce brown and Jeff green are freezing him out lmao
bruce brown 3 sighting
You mean the game that came down to a Bruce brown throwing the game away to secure the bucks win? Lol
"Bruce Brown at the free throw line, just fast forward the game"
Think of the butterfly effect created by Bruce Brown. He makes that shot in game 4 and the Nets are up 3-0 entering this game. Bux are demoralize. Likely brick everything. Irving doesn't get injured. We end up with the Denver Nuggets as NBA champions. This is Bruce Browns fault.
Bruce Brown thinking “Nows my chance”
Durant flopped into Bruce Brown lmaoooo god that was too good
"Bruce ""superstar"" Brown"
Give it to Bruce Brown and get out of the way you cowards.
bruce brown gets to stare down players
god i love bruce brown
bruce brown looks like a dude they picked up from LA Fitness
Make Bruce Brown and Joe Harris walk back to NY. Goddamn idiots.
why is that bum bruce brown still in the league???? i wouldve assumed he'd be kicked out of the team after last game.
Looks at Bruce Brown.  You aint Harden.  Looks at Tyler Johnson.  When my contract comes up.
Bruce Brown might've won the series for the Bucks
Bruce Brown and missed floaters. Name a more iconic duo.
 bruce brown really sucks
Bruce brown is trash
does bruce brown know how to do anything besides shoot floaters holy shit he sucks. who tf is this guy?
that bruce brown game winner attempt in game 3 is aging horribly
At least put in deandre Jordan and Bruce brown instead of taking it in the ass. Holy shit lmao
crazy how different this series would be if bruce brown and Harris weren't ass in game 3
BRUCE BROWN FLOATER
Bruce Brown has one move I swear
"Bruce Brown sometimes looks 6'7"" and sometimes he looks 5'10"""
Not really. Joe Harris shoots it at 50% from deep and Shamet at above 40%. Both Blake and Jeff Green are good small ball 5 players. Bruce Brown is a very solid defender
And of course Bruce Brown comes in to end the run lol
KD getting pupated by Bruce Brown
"Man why tf is Bruce Brown not playing anymore? I betted on him for over 2,5 assists, he got 2 and didnt play anymore after…."
Unless Joe Harris &amp; Bruce Brown can morph into Steph Curry &amp; Draymond Green. Then no it isn't too early.  They have no secondary scorer or playmakers on the floor.   The Bucks already smell blood &amp; will end this in 6.
Put Bruce brown in. Try something else Nash. Kd with another cold one.
If the same play happened to bruce brown no one would say a word
Why no Bruce Brown this game?
"&gt; Bryce Brown,  They sign Bruce Brown's brother? He's getting the Giannis' brother treatment"
The disrespect to Bruce Brown.
Is it really a surprise that someone on BK gets injured when the refs are letting the Bucks play UFC out there? If Bruce Brown did what Giannis just did the Tony Brothers would be reviewing whether to execute him before the next timeout.
You can call moving screens on the Nets all game… Bruce Brown is never set…
The unstoppable Bruce Brown haha
Bruce Brown has taken no shots yet.  Guess he got screamed at in the locker room ha
Bruce brown ? Griffin ? Kyrie still averages 4 free throws a game for his career he’s shot legit 2 all series.
Lol Bruce brown fouled Middleton twice in 5 seconds and nothing. The nets have been on the positive side of officiating for 80% of the series lmao
The Nets offense getting off to a terrible start again...  This set with Bruce Brown initiating the offense at the top of the key should stop.
they are giving bruce brown 20 feet of space lmaooo
This is career defining game for Bruce Brown
This game could be scary for Brooklyn. If they don't win this Milwaukee could have crazy momentum heading back to Brooklyn.   But I still think KD goes off today. Kyrie will also step up. Bruce Brown won't be in the way like last game.   Nets 115 Bucks 97
By having 35+ mins of Bruce Brown on the court instead of 35+  Mins From James Harden.
Nah he’s done very well with rotations and optimizing his role players like Mike James and Bruce Brown. Playing him as a big man was an incredible move  Also it’s likely MDA behind the scenes doing a lot of these things for Nash so it’s really both of them
Bruce Brown &gt; Harden
"Nice breakdown. I agree with everything you said. The sixers offense is humming rn, so Simmons doesn’t need to score, but the time will come where he has to. It might be vs the nets, and the series legit could swing if Simmons can eat up kyrie or Bruce brown on the low block"
"I’m not even a huge KD fan, but you mean the stacked roster of an obviously hobbled Harden, a shell of his former self (due to injuries) Griffin, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown and 34 year old Jeff Green?"
Bruce Brown literally gave his all but wasn't enough.
I love watching Bruce Brown and PJ Tucker. Those guys are amazing on Defense!
Bruce Brown the only points (2) for Nets in OT of a game 7.   That's bizarre.
Bruce Brown really scored the Nets only bucket in OT
You CANNOT play BRUCE BROWN for 52 MINUTES. You have OTHER COMPETENT PLAYERS. It went to OT and you LOST because of your rotations
"Too many injuries. Joe Harris turned to crap. We had nothing but Durant and Bruce Brown. Good series Bucks. We'll retool and try to plug our weaknesses, show up healthy and get the job done next year."
&gt; The Nets are going to need a lot of help for next season.  Bruce brown played 52 minutes. If kyrie is playing nets win easy. Hell if harden isn't injured nets win easy.
"Who would they have doubled off of, Bruce Brown? He's shown that he can consistently drive and hit floaters in this series and everyone else (harden, Harris and Blake) could knock down threes."
"Definitely a tough loss. KD played his heart out. The game was close, but let's be honest we got a lot of BS calls, and Bruce Brown (Maybe Blake?) was the only other net that showed up. The bucks were the better team today, and deserved the win. As for the nets, I think you could pretty clearly see in this series that some players on the roster aren't up to the big moments."
I actually love these sloppy tired af OTs. For 3 whole minutes only Bruce Brown scored and he was the only one to score for the Nets.
What are your other options? Let Griffin shoots? Bruce Brown?
Bruce Brown scored 100% of the Nets' field goals in OT
Their two points were off a missed call that lead to an open Bruce Brown layup too lol
Bruce Brown can't win with these cats.
It wasn’t him it was a Bruce brown put back
"Shout out to Bruce Brown with all the solid hustle plays, man played his heart out"
Did I miss something? Only points the Nets scored were by Bruce Brown putback
Brooklyn literally only scored 2 points in OT off a Bruce Brown offensive rebound put back. SMH
Bruce Brown was nets 2nd best player all series
Joe Harris better donate his check to Bruce Brown lmao
Bruce Brown playing more minutes than Giannis lol
bruce brown awesome too!
"Now that we've positioned ourselves to win, let's see what creative way we fuck it up this time. My money is on a 3/4 court heave from Bruce Brown to win on an and 1 free throw because he lands on Harden's foot."
Nets have to get it tot heir best player. Bruce Brown has to get involved
Bucks really need to get the defensive board. Bruce brown is fucking them up
Bruce Brown really played more minutes than Giannis
Bruce Brown with 51 minutes???
Marv Albert really just glossed over Bruce Brown getting 50+ minutes with KD &amp; Harden smh...
how the fuck are the Bucks gassed they're not even hustling lmao Bruce Brown outhustling all 5 Bucks
I hope it ends with only Bruce Brown having scored
In OT in game 7  Giannis is guarding Bruce Brown even with PJ Tucker out  lol
That one bruce brown bucket is going to win the whole thing isn't it
Where were you when Bruce Brown was the only person to score in game 7 OT
He's been hoed all game. Bruce Brown &amp; Blake movin screens have fucked him
"Harden is a pussy ass bitch, Kevin Durant is the softest basketball player in the history of the sport, Bruce brown is a bum who is riding coattails of 3 all stars just to be irrelevant again in 2 seasons, &amp; Jrue holiday sucks at basketball"
3 mins in and only Bruce Brown has scored lmao
Is it just me or does everyone besides bruce brown and KD look gassed?
Everyone looks gassed in OT except Bruce Brown lol
How the fuck are you gonna get outhustled by Bruce Brown and Blake with 1 knee? Fucking embarrassing. What the fuck is Giannis doing playing 3rd fiddle in OT?
He just got outboarded in OT by Bruce Brown. Series over.
Bruce Brown lives in your walls
BRUCE BROWN IS PURE GRIT
Bruce Brown is a super other.
Bruce Brown Nets Legend
Bruce Brown &gt; all Lakers not named LeBron or AD
I assume they love Bruce Brown in BK. Has to be a fan favorite. Has to be.
LMAO Bucks getting out rebounded by Bruce Brown and Joe Harris
Bruce brown a better rebounder than everyone on Milwaukee
Bruce Brown is a cool dude.
Bruce Brown is 6’4
"""What a play by Bruce Brown!""  Two nearest defenders literally lying down lmfao"
Bruce Brown = Bruce Bowen lite
bruce brown made some huge plays last few minutes
Bruce brown is everywhere
Bruh send three people to KD. Let Bruce Brown beat you not Kevin “you know who I am” Durant.
"Lopez legit pulled a JR, imagine he shot that then Giannis gets an offensive rebound cause Bruce brown was on him. Fuck man."
Bruce brown game winner incoming
Bruce Brown redemption arc right here
Bruce Brown game winner
Game 7 in the playoffs really decided by Khris Middleton vs Bruce Brown and Jrue Holiday vs Blake Griffin
Bruce Brown is so good in his role. Kudos to the Nets for figuring a point guard could be your roll man and offensive rebounder.
Bruce brown is the definition of a winning player. absolutely comical that detroit gave him up. he was good last year!
How does Bruce Brown even get a hand on that ball SMH box him out
How this Bruce Brown guy keeps getting these rebounds?
"Is Bruce Brown unable to shoot, he’s always like wide open and just passes"
Bruce Brown best center in the league and it ain't close
Kris got to watch out for Bruce Brown behind him on those fast breaks.  Also good guy Kris Middelton  helping out on KD unlike his teammates when he guards him.
bruce brown +40 minutes
"Nah Middleton and Holiday selling hard, look at how Bruce Brown stepped up this game for the Nets"
The Bucks got to go small.  The Bruce Brown screen is killing them.
Man bruce brown is a little bitch ain't he lol
Bruce Brown is a walking moving screen
Bruce Brown is pretty good
Bruce brown loves an illegal screen lol
Bruce Brown sets a moving pick almost everytime but gets away with it cuz he's small
Get Bruce brown out of the lineup. He’s not even rolling to the basket on the pick man and he can’t shoot so idk what the point is of him doing the screen. Brook ain’t gunna switch on to KD
Nets either think Bruce Brown is a nice asset or total liability on the floor.
"bruce brown man, i defended his shit late game decision since he played well. but wtf you canno go 0/2 as non ben simmons/giannis level shooter."
What is Bruce brown even good at
Bruce brown  Bruh….
7 footer Bruce brown with the tip out
"Him and Shamet, either one of those dudes instead of Bruce Brown. On offense you got KD and Blake rn and that’s it."
Bruce brown has been a liability more often than not this season
same but the tech call on bruce brown
This was right after the Bruce Brown tech
I would really appreciate if the refs start calling moving picks this half so that Bruce Brown or Griffin can't do one on every single possession
"Everyone’s talking about Giannis’ teammates playing like trash, but KD’s been dragging this Nets team pretty much solo tonight   (Bruce Brown and Blake haven’t been terrible though)"
lmao I do not want to see Bruce Brown shooting mid rangers ever
I’m more confused about Bruce Brown. Dudes entire offense is floaters.
Joe Harris is on Bertans level this series. Bruce Brown seriously need to learn to shoot mid range jumpers this offseason. Is there a reason why Jeff Green played only 2 mins?
Damn Bruce Brown has almost played 24 minutes.  Harden and KD both have.
Is Bruce Brown that bad of a shooter? They're leaving him wide open
Bruce Brown is embarrassing out there refusing to shoot
"Can bruce brown shoot anything but a floater, hes wide open whole game"
Bruce Brown coming out for 3rd quarter in a MF DOOM mask
KD and Bruce Brown the only players doing well right now
Bruce Brown has more points than Jrue Holliday and Khris Middleton combined. That's fucking embarrassing.
Bruce Brown
Vermont Academy legend Bruce Brown Jr.
"Thank you, it was driving me mad ""Bruce Bowen? Wtf? Oh, he said Bruce Brown"". Every time the Nets played."
I swear to fucking god whenever it says Bruce Brown I read Bowen and whenever it says Bruce Bowen I read Brown.
Bruce Brown taking time out of the eastern semis to mess with the Sixers across the bracket
"Seriously like I hadn't even thought of Bowen in years. When I first saw the headline I was thinking Bruce Brown and was like ""how does he know Pop?"""
I had to read this comment to realize it wasn’t Bruce Brown
I can’t stop reading Bruce Brown and it upsets me
"Because KD had one of the best playoff games in history, which is the entire point lmao.  If you think Middleton/Jrue/Lopez is evenly matched with washed Blake/Bruce Brown/injured Harden I don't know what to tell you.   And it's really unsurprising that you couldn't come up with even a single game 7 where Lebron won with a worse roster."
"Tired of the Harris talk honestly. I mean for better or worse that's kind of the Bucks' defensive scheme, give up open shots to not great shooters which mostly was Jeff Green, Blake, Bruce Brown. They all had their moments hitting shots still but they aren't statistically above average shooters. Harris definitely should have hit more but it's not like he was just bricking 30 open threes, he had a lot of focus on him from the Bucks. The handful of wide open looks he got were broken down loose ball plays and he generally shrunk in the moment. Playoffs are a different game and he got in his own head, oh well.  Hawks have more shooters but the Bucks have been helping much less on defense and giving up less open threes from simple ball movement. Sure Hawks will get hot but making the Bucks pay? Wouldn't worry about it for the length of the series, their defense is way too strong."
We lost G3 because Bruce Brown was too aggressive.
Mike james and bruce brown are not the guys
"It's called ""touch"" and you build it up by just shooting as many shots as you can, the caveat being that you have to practice perfectly, or rather have good shooting form, or a repeatable form(shout out kevin martin). If you practice with bad form you won't have good touch. There's also the Bruce Brown mould where he has great touch on floaters, just be good from somewhere on the court, find your spot."
brooklyn especially. Dinwiddie bruce brown melo claxton and someone like trevor ariza or andre iguodala is a winning bench unit
"&gt; Bruce Brown is a 6’5” PF/C   He played 98% of his minutes at one of the guard spots according to BBREF. This narrative that he was playing the 5 is just a narrative. He played the dunker's spot offensively at times, but he wasn't the rim protector on defense.  Of his 1450 minutes, almost 900 were with a traditional center. 800 were with Blake or Jeff Green. 1500 minutes total between Durant, TLC, and Harris (all forwards). There were another nearly 300 minutes with random F/C types.   You get into the data, and he played with 3 other forwards/centers at pretty much all times."
Bruce Brown is a 6’5” PF/C who had a great year because he was surrounded by multiple super stars.   Brown doesn’t have nearly the same production on any other team since he wouldn’t be able to operate like he did in Brooklyn. Not even like he’s this amazing Defender who makes All Defensive teams.    Jeff Green will be 35yrs old in August. He was solid but he’s also getting old and nearing retirement with every game. Who knows what his market is.   Blake obviously doesn’t have it in him to be a top 3 player day in and day out for a team competing for a Championship. He’s a serviceable role player at this point of his career who can have a few big games.    Nets this Offseason should have the Bi-Annual and Tax MLE (which can be split in 2) to attempt to sign Free Agents.   Bi-Annual (2y/$7.4m)   Tax MLE (3y/$18m)   Plus if Dinwiddie agrees to a Sign and Trade the Nets can then fill out their roster with a Trade Exception like Boston did with Hayward when they helped him get to Charlotte which led to the Fournier trade.
I think it’s clear next season they’ll win (assuming health which isn’t always a great assumption). When you have three max players your window just gets smaller because guys get paid and you have to figure out how to keep filling in guys as vet mins.   Guys like Bruce Brown and even Jeff Green will want to get paid. Who knows what Blake decides on. Blake gave up $13 million to come to the Nets and could probably command $7-$10 million in the open market. Ask KD/Harden/Kyrie despite the massive amount of money they have made if they’d take a $20 million discount. Doubt it.   So realistically all this season did is take a year of dominance off the table. I assume their window is probably another 2-3 years before they’d need to make some tough decisions as to whether this big three is viable going forward. Anything less than 2 titles is a disappointment.
"The only good players there are Jeff Green and Blake + like you said Jeff Green was injured. Harris is a constant playoff underperformer and Harden makes Bruce Brown look good, other than that he's an average role players. The Bucks are an overrated ass team who've been lucky with their opponents having shit injury luck. They'll get beat by the hawks in 6."
Blake was good. Bruce Brown is good. Harris is good (despite having a bad series). Jeff Green would’ve contributed if he weren’t injured as well. The Nets are not the 2011 Heat. They just had really bad injury luck.  You don’t need 10 good players. The Nets had an elite starting 5 with everyone healthy and at least 3 good bench players (with a couple just ok bench guys as well). That’s more than good enough to win.
&gt; well-rounded supporting cast  Yeah gonna have to disagree here. Joe Harris was a walking brick all series. Bruce Brown single handedly choked game 3. Blake Griffin was alright. Jeff Green was playing on 1 leg and only played like 4/7 games. Everyone else on the team was a nobody + Harden is not built for the playoffs.
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
why would he go smaller vs Clint Capela over bruce brown and blake griffin
"In a vacuum, is Ben Simmons better than Tony Allen and Boris Diaw? 100%, no shit wtf, absolutely, of course, yes.  But this is real life, and bruh has to get his shit together soon if he wants to ever be half the contributor to a team's deep playoff runs like Allen and Diaw were.   If Bruce Brown played for the 76ers in place of Ben Simmons, I truly believe the 76ers win that series in 5 or 6(and I'm a Trae fan rooting for them to meet the Suns in the Finals).   As limited as Brown is, at least he has heart, hustles his ass off on D, and is willing to shoot that floater off the PnR consistently. He doesn't just sit in the dunker's spot avoiding the ball, and he even takes the occasional 3 when he's wide open, which Simmons won't even consider."
Bruce Brown and Tyler Johnson maybe but def not KD
Yeah nets are really gonna pay 40m a year for a guy who can only set screens and play defense  If simmons plays a bruce brown role he should get paid bruce brown money
All Ben Simmons have to do is master a floater/push shot like Bruce Brown and Richaun Holmes
"Check out that draft's performance in the playoffs. Ayton, Doncic, JJJ, Trae, Mikal, MPJ, DiVincenzo (hurt but would be starting on ECF team), Huerter (greatest player of all time, apparently), Bruce Brown, Shake Milton"
"I dont want him in Milwaukee, that’s for sure. Look, the NBA is changing so rapidly and the league is a wild wild west boom town of crazy new strategies right now. Suddenly 45 foot threes have become high percentage shots (for certain guys.) Many teams have simply axed the center position altogether. And some teams are starting guys who cant shoot the ball.  Im lukewarm on this whole idea that teams can start guys who cant shoot. Just look at how much the D can sag when playing a Bruce Brown or a Ben Simmons or a Giannis… they can essentially give those guys 20 feet of space because they’re literally not a threat. That’s 20% of your squad that the opponent has deemed “non threatening.”  If you’re gonna be a professional basketball player *and* be objectively terrible at shooting hoops, youd better figure out a way to score consistently without shooting. Giannis is only getting a pass right now because A. he’s winning (albeit narrowly so) and B. he’s scoring (a lot.) But we all know that wont continue forever. As guys get older, they gotta adapt. Kobe became a lights out shooter. Vince Carter became a lights out shooter. Giannis/Ben/Bruce Brown better get in the gym and start practicing shooting the basketball. The order of operations should *never* be “lemme get this mvp and a title quick *then* i’ll learn to shoot a basketball."
Decent but I think he made some big mistakes not calling timeouts late in game 3 (Bruce Brown misses) and game 7 (KD tired airball). They might’ve won the series if he drew something up instead of just letting them run it out.
He did good  Really unlocked the potential of Bruce Brown
"Does he still have Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or do we mean literally *these* nets?   Lebron, Harris, Green, Griffin, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Mike James, and Deandre Jordan doesn't seem like it could possibly make the finals."
KD was producing enough for two players that's how good he was. Joe Harris was terrible but how's that the bucks fault. Harden looked serviceable but definitely was far from 100%. Bruce brown made some plays along with griffin looking solid.
"I dont see him being unplayable if he is being used in the right role and surrounded by the right guys - and I specifically used Bruce Brown as an example of a role he should be playing.  It is also clear that the FT problems in the playoffs are mostly mental (at least for them to be this bad), and I think that improves a lot if you just take all the pressure off his offensive game: KD and Harden will do all your scoring - Ben just set screens, and when the opportunity is there, role to the ring. Would barely need to touch the ball in a half court set, but can still lead your fast break when in transition."
"Everyone is hating on Ben right now - but this is not actually a bad idea IMO.  Ben needs to be in a position where he is not your primary playmaker, and is not required to do much in a half court offense. Just let him be a screen-and-roll guy from the high post/pnr, and have shooters everywhere else on the court. Offensively he should at least be a better version of Bruce Brown - but defensively he is that elite guy that Brooklyn just dont have.  And Philly have been desperate for that type of scorer/playmaker from the backcourt."
"Bruce Brown to KD, after his Game 7 airball at the buzzer"
Bruce Brown  Surprisingly good glue guy.
simmons for bruce brown and blake griffin
"Despite being the worse player, Bruce brown is far more effective in the half court on offense than Ben Simmons. This is altho he is smaller w a similar skill set"
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
"You don't have to attack him for no reason man, your guy won the award lol   Nets did an insane job adding Harden, Blake, Aldridge (unfortunate), Bruce Brown this year. If their team was healthy this playoffs is a wrap"
"I'd rather have Reggie Jackson or Mann in the playoffs. Shit, give me Bruce Brown over Simmons b/c at least he can run PnR and do his push shot floater."
"It's not just him. I don't get how people use this loss as a knock against KD when it was him against Giannis, Jrue, and Middleton. KD had what? A Harden who couldn't even run, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and old man Blake who was fuming on hustle lol."
"Oh yes, what a super team with James Harden unable to move, Kyrie on the bench and Bruce Brown playing 52 minutes of a Game 7.  If you watched this game and all you can take is ""thank god a superteam lost"" you clearly didn't see KD going 1 on 5 on offense all game, they had nothing. Watching a team lose because of injuries is never good for the NBA, the league and the players greed fucked this playoff up, half of the best players in the league are either sidelined or playing with injured squads.  Kyrie out, Harden unable to move, Kawhi out, CP3 out, AD out, but it's good that a small market team ""won"", fuck that."
Seeing Bruce Brown become a primary facilitator brought home how important it is to have your starting guards healthy in the playoffs.
Bruce brown destroyed the Celtics playing center
"Your roster wasn't paper thin though? Blake Griffin was great for you guys, Jeff Green was solid and had that huge game, Bruce Brown was solid, you guys would've had Dinwiddie if he hadn't gotten a season-ending injury at the start of the year, Aldridge retired midseason, Joe Harris randomly forgot how to shoot, Landry Shamet's a quality bench player.  You guys just got unlucky, I really don't think the answer was keeping additional bench players instead of Harden."
Yep and they relied on a Blake Griffin or Bruce Brown put-back way too much.
"Indeed its amazing, but that just make KD more of a hell of a player since he carried them. NOT saying he didnt had help (jeff green, blake Griffin) but i wouldnt say the same for Harris or even Bruce brown they were horrible at key moments"
"Ok, lol. Harden was playing at about half speed so his 53 minutes aren’t even remotely comparable. Middleton was effective in OT but hadn’t done shit the first 40 or so minutes of the game - unlike KD he had the luxury of playing next to someone who put up 40 points and had carried them to that point. KD carried that entire Nets team and you want to say his minutes required equal effort as Middleton or Bruce fucking Brown? Lmao."
If you had even swapped joe Harris and Bruce brown’s minutes throughout the course of the series it would have been beneficial to the nets.  Do I really have to break it down to that level to appease you people? It’s not that hard to decipher what I’m trying to say.   Brown played 4 minutes in game 6 ffs
"Nash just didn’t sub.  All of their starters played 40 + minutes, and even Bruce Brown played 53 MINUTES.    Insanity"
"When you build a team around 3 max players you're going to have trouble when only 1 of those is truly healthy. Harden couldn't even drive. Realistically it's a strong positive that they even got to game 7.   You can blame Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, whatever but in my eyes they're getting forced into roles they were never meant for. Not in terms of what they're actually doing, but the pressure on them. You can sustain a Joe Harris off night, even off series when he's your fourth most important offensive player. But nobody is saying Joe Harris is built to be your second best player in a playoff series."
"why was Bruce Brown the main guy setting screens for Brooklyn? He's small compared to some of the guys he was screening, seems like he's not much of an impediment to the defender.  Bodies were hitting the floor all 4th quarter. Brooklyn seemed to run out of steam. I can't believe Harden played the whole game, and so much of the previous game, right after his injury.  Also feel that some of the Nets possessions were wasted. Harden or KD seemed to let the shot clock wind down a little too much before deciding to make a move. They're able to create and good shooters so I give them the benefit of the doubt, same with just letting them do their own thing for the last shot in OT. Fatigue certainly was a factor but maybe if in regulation some of those possessions went better, they would've won."
How do I get a Bruce Brown flair? Dude was hustling all game even through overtime
"Issues like Bruce Brown missing free throws only mattered because of injuries. Injuries were the root cause of every single one of these minor issues.  These are problems, but inconsequential ones, and not ones you go out of your way to ""fix"". You do not replace Bruce Brown because he couldn't make free throws. The fact that the Nets' season hinged on him making FTs is the problem, not him missing the FTs."
"Yeah , call me akon and put the blame on me.    &gt;Bruce Brown was great   He missed several FT, it was at homecourt so it did took a part on the lost"
"Bruce brown was healthly and missed ft, i mean injuries took a large part of it but still we had others things"
Bro look how close this series was. The bucks are title favourites right now. Nets almost beat them with giannis averaging 31 and Middleton averaging 24. Now imagine that a healthy kyrie was playing instead of Bruce brown. That's easily 15 or 16 extra points for the nets. And it's not like kyrie was a defensive liability in the first 3 games either. He was playing ok defense. A healthy kyrie could've won this series in 5 or 6. That's what I'm trying to say man that a healthy nets is not going to get outscored 4 times by anyone.
What’s really been great about these playoffs is seeing some non-superstars step up and really contribute. Bruce Brown has shown out. Terance Mann just went nuts. Tyrese Maxey saved the Sixers from elimination.
"Please the nets didn’t actually DO anything to make it happen they had superstars basically fall into their lap.   This is barely a team as much as it is a collection of 3 talented players and a bunch of scrubs (yes Blake you are a scrub now, same with you Bruce brown)   Most of the fans are just people who will leave with the superstars they have no loyalty to the team whatsoever   I’m not saying the nets shouldn’t capitalize on the opportunity, I’m saying they don’t deserve much credit for something that was pretty out of their control   This isn’t really a nets team"
If course everyone in the league flops but nobody does it as egregiously as harden. He bitches to the same refs that are helping him after   EVERY   FUCKING    SHOT  He intentionally hooks his arm around whoever is guarding him trying to both drag them down and get the foul  I’m not quite sure he should be playing basketball if he goes into anaphylactic shock every time he shoots the ball. He might be allergic to it.    whenever Giannis shoots a free throw he puts on a little show like 11 seconds (Brooklyn has a fast count and you know it) which is just UNBEARABLE  In game 6 (which I attended btw) he bullied Steve Nash into using his challenge on an obvious foul and was only stoped after the fouler (I don’t remember who it was it might have been Bruce brown) said “hey man I fouled him”   How could you ever defend this man child for anything?
I blame you!  But fr its Joe Harris. Harden was hurt and Bruce Brown was great   Nash can't do anything with this hospital team
"Well all these guys had plenty of rest. Harden maybe should have rested even more to prevent that hamstring injury coming back. Kyrie was stepped on to roll his ankle. That not a conditioning fault on his part. And KD was clearly fine after his rest.  Look at the minutes played on the bench...ya 3 max contract guys getting enough rest and staying healthy is absolutely all you need for the playoffs. Not to mention the bench for the Nets was quite good, Jeff green, Claxton, Shamet, Bruce Brown, hell the nets should’ve had Lamarcus Aldridge if he didn’t have medical complications."
"Bruce brown, Harden &amp; Joe Harris all played a few too many minutes."
"Also, watch the Bruce Brown on the glass. He was just blatantly shoving dudes out of the way and getting away with it because he’s undersized and we weren’t flailing.  The one where the commentator was like “Giannis has to grab that one with both hands there”…he would have if he hadn’t been shoved multiple feet by Brown lol"
"I 100% agree with you. But Nash could have given Mike James some -- not a lot, maybe just 5 to 10 -- minutes to give KD a blow and have another playmaker out there.  Could have rested KD for the first 2-3 minutes of the 4th quarter and have Mike James and no-penetration-James-Harden handle the offense. Harden could also have had his 2-3 minute break with Mike James running the point and KD being a threat as a spot up shooter and Bruce Brown as the designated cutter."
Bruce brown in any other system other than the nets is bound to be disappointing. The only reason he is working so well is his hustle and he plays beside 3 HOFs
"You realize Bruce Brown played over 50 minutes last night, right?"
He was definitely being asked to do more than he was capable of. They would have been better off with Bruce Brown in all of his minutes
3 bs calls on him lol. That Bruce Brown 'screen' actually worked two times and Bucks got called for fouls
And it’s crazier because Bruce Brown only scored an open layup that was a result of a no call by the refs.
"KD didn't score in OT. It was Bruce Brown, Khris and Giannis, then Brook's FTs"
"Well the Nets had a ""switch everything"" defensive strategy in the season, but usually KD or Bruce Brown will guard the best wing player on the opposing team. Many times Kyrie and even Claxton as well. Rotations do shorten in the playoffs though and Milwaukee has more versatility in terms of talent compared to other teams so it led to Harris taking a lot of the load there  Yeah this is only Harris's 2nd year as a Net in the playoffs in front of a live crowd...I think the relative inexperience and lack of continuity got to him, he was also shaky in the 2019 series vs Philadelphia. Hopefully this became another learning experience for him for next year"
"You say that as if Jrue Holiday isn't on the team and that it's a big two in Milwaukee and not a big three.  Yeah Nets were a super team when all three of them were healthy. But this series was over once Kyrie went down and it was obvious by Harden not being able to even run that he was rushed back.   But yeah totally dude. Giannis beating KD, Bruce Brown, old man Blake, Joe Harris, and crippled Harden encapsulates the greatest and most impressive run since Dirk."
"Meh their depth is still way more than what heatles woulda had. Nets have: Joe Harris, TLC, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Blake and Claxton. Those are pretty serviceable role players."
I call him 6’ 10 Bruce brown
"Watched him very closely, this dude gets away with so many fouls it's crazy the refs don't catch it. First play of overtime, giannis has an easy defensive rebound and he literally pulls him go the ground which lead to a Bruce brown putback."
"Green was injured for the first 3 games, went nuclear in game 5, shot badly in game 6 and game 7 didnt have a point let alone a shot.  However yes Blake Griffin and Bruce Brown were very solid. Bruce Brown although he made that horrid play in game 3 looks like he could be a great role player, especially if he develops a 3 point shot."
Bruce Brown played 52 minutes of -7 basketball tonight while Mike James and DeAndre Jordan played a combined 0:00.
Move Bruce brown to his role put Blake at the 3 put claxton at the 5. Literally a 12 year old on 2k could have coached that game better once giannis say kd should have been sitting too. Steve Nash coaching from the Tom thibbitheau school of thought
??? We watching the same series? Nets were unstoppable game 1 and 2. Nearly had game 3 and then Kyrie goes down. Harris is throwing up bricks. Bruce Brown can't shoot outside the paint. Then it's the two 5s in Griff and Jeff.
"Watching Bruce Brown hustle on every defensive play gives me life tbh, I hope this man stays :’)"
"A super team Nets team needed an injured Jaylen Brown, an injured Kemba, an injured Robert Williams, and the refs in order to beat the Celtics. We can come up with hypotheticals all day long. Nets are going to probably lose Bruce Brown, Dinwiddie, and possibly Blake Griffin and Jeff Green in the off season. Also Kyrie Durant and Harden are getting up there in age and it’s no guarantee they will stay healthy. I think this was the Nets year to win it"
"I was told by u/byRockets that there is no way bruce brown will win fmvp over harden, technically thats true. Hahahahahhahaha poor u dumb harden stans"
He should have adjusted to running more plays for Bruce Brown and Joe Harris or he should have been playing Tyler Johnson more?
just play bruce brown bro u see those floaters he was hitting who needs a top 15 player all time
Bruce Brown too.  Despite the miscues at the end of game 3.
"they didn't pay much this season because of the covid discount (since league revenue is down).  with just 9 guys under contract (deandre jordon is gauranteed for 2 more years btw) they're already $38M over the luxury tax threshold, this includes dinwiddie's $12M option which he says he'll refuse, but even if they don't keep him you'd think blake gets the mle, bruce brown gets his cap hold of $4.7M, min guys for the rest, they've got to be $40M over at least.  so that's like $177M for the roster itself+$160M luxury tax."
Oh wow some Bruce Brown respect woo! But no they’re not two of the “best” role players in the league. That’s just so unbelievably false. They’re solid for who we thought they’d be entering the season but not elite. Nets are a shallow roster because they sacrificed depth in acquiring stars.
"Come on, stop.  LeBron would've killed for Joe Harris over JR, or injured Harden over George Hill, or for ANYBODY on the Cavs to have put in as much effort as Bruce Brown tonight. And the Warriors were much better than the Bucks.  Not everything has to be the best ever or close to it. KD had a legendary game, leave it at that."
OR or.......if Bruce Brown didn't brick 4 straight layups in game 5
"Lebron is an all time great playmaker who needs shooters around him lol. Look at the players starting for the nets tonight. Bruce brown, blake griffin, Joe "" bricking every open 3"" Harris and harden with one leg. This nets is not a lebron team."
"Bruce Brown helped with rebounding, gave vertical spacing with good PnR action and did a decent job defensively against Middleton. Stuff that a player with the size of Shamet can't do."
"Yeah, it was basically Harris's money, Blake who shouldn't be on a minimum, harden on one leg and Bruce brown and Jeff green as kd's supporting cast."
He’d be a bigger Bruce Brown at least.
Shit what team couldn’t use Bruce Brown? This dude is *the* hustle guy in the NBA right now. He leaves it all on the court every game.
Bruce Brown seems like a good dude
"To all the Nets haters. There ain’t no reason to hate on that team. Two guys deserve the blame. Joe Harris and Nash. KD left it all out there and no one can say otherwise. Dude put up two, not one, TWO all time career playoff games to keep his team in it. Harden gave it all he could too. Everyone’s going to talk about his shooting percentage and how he shouldn’t have been out there. Man, if Harden says he wants to play there is no way you wouldn’t want him on the floor, bad leg or not. Dude played 52 minutes with a leg that’s not even 50% and still put 22. Donovan played on a bad leg the other night with a lesser injury and basically put up the same kind of performance and everyone was proud of him and said “he played it heart out” but since it’s Harden everyone wants to give him a hard time. Joe Harris and Nash lost this game in my eyes. Joe not only missed the game winning 3 with quite literally no one even near him; the dude shot 3-10 (3-9 from 3pt) and yet he still played 46 minutes. Why?!? Jeff Green just put up huge numbers the other night and he sat the damn bench the whole game. He had 12 minutes and this game went to OT. Nash didn’t pull him. Bruce Brown played well early on but I don’t understand why you play him over Shamet. Bruce Brown gets the Ben Simmons treatment when he’s on offense. No one even guards him bc he’s got nothing but floaters in his game. Not to mention the play calling by the Nets down there at the end. It was just pass it to KD and see what happens.   To the Bucks fans, congrats. I don’t know how long it will last to be honest. Some will argue the 76ers might not even beat the Hawks but if they do y’all better be ready. Embiid is a whole other animal. Brook is going to have his hands full. Not to mention Seth Curry has been lighting it up from deep. I think you matchup a little bit better against the 76ers (especially with Hack a Ben still in the lineup). Otherwise if the Hawks win, we might see y’all in the finals. Suns/Clippers will be waiting on y’all and man will it be a fun Finals this year."
Blake and Bruce Brown shot well. No one else though.
"Maybe.   But KD, Harden, and Kyrie will be a year older. THere's no guarantee that they'll keep Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or Spencer Dinwiddie.   They're deep into the tax without spending a dime on any of those guys or their replacements."
"Blake Griffin is already getting paid by the Pistons, and Bruce Brown is a hustle guy who not much more than that."
I assume he means the superstars. I hope no one is randomly hating Jeff Green and Bruce Brown
"Of everyone on Brooklyn, open shot, fate of the universe on the line and the martians have the death beam pointed at earth you better hit it, I want BRUCE BROWN"
It’s Bruce Brown time
I love Bruce Brown
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
"&gt; Bruce Brown  Did not realize he was an FA. He was a more than serviceable fill-in for Kyrie during injuries last year, just doesn't know how to shoot from 3 at all. 56/29/74 shooting splits for a PG are bizarre, but he still managed a very impressive 60.4 TS%, and pretty good advanced stats overall (16.1 PER, 0.144 WS/48, 0.6 VORP, 1.0 RAPTOR). He's only 3 years into his career but at 24 he's already the same age as Booker, Turner, etc., so I don't know how much teams are willing to bet on him developing.  I'm pretty high on him, I think he'll be a budget deal wherever he ends up, but it'll be interesting to see how the league treats him"
It was such an iconic shot that Bruce Brown tried to replicate it a few weeks later
"Hardens a gifted playmaker, but you cannot deny his ISO habits either.  Also why is everyone shitting on Bruce Brown, dudes been good for a minute, he was already good, I don't think Harden made him what he is lol"
Nah Harden has fully embraced his role of pg for the Nets. He’s made guys like Bruce Brown and Clax so much better because he knows how to put them in the best position.
bout to have bruce brown on roids
"It matters a little bit.  Some of those periphery players around the Warriors and Lakers probably got paid a little more than they should have because they looked so much better next to some superstars.  Just look at Blake, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown.  Maybe they are better than what we thought they are, or maybe they look good because they're playing next to Durant, Harden and Kyrie.    The Mavs should be able to get players on short-term contracts who hope to maximize their statistical profiles to get paid again, but I'm not sure you want those type of players."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Unironically, it's Bruce Brown"
"I mean we're kinda limited. I hope the Nets re-sign Bruce Brown, keep one of Jeff Green or Blake, go after Forbes or JJ Redick (only for the minimum), and I guess sign and trade Dinwiddie to Washington since it seems like he wants to go there (for Kuz and Thomas Bryant not Trez).   Other than that we can really only go after ring chasers that will take the minimum. Hopefully we can add some decent defenders."
Is Russ willing to play the Bruce Brown role?
"No, the point is that even staggered all of them are individually ball dominant. Even when the Nets just go Harden+bench guys, they aren't going to be running isos for Cam.   Off-ball scoring will pretty much always be more useful than on-ball scoring for this team. Obviously, there will be some fringe cases that Cam will get on-ball reps, but it's not going to be often, and it'll be coming out of the already small Bruce Brown on-ball rep pie."
"They could’ve traded Oubre at the deadline, they didn’t iPad it’s a complete fuck up. Bruce Brown was one example, teams make trades on the margins for useful vets all the time. The Mavs got Moses Brown for free and dumped a bad contract in the process today. Moses Brown would be playing 20+ mins per game for the Warriors, he’s better than Wiseman."
Shamet wasn’t traded for 2nds and Fournier wouldn’t have fit into any of the TPE.   You are losing your mind of trades that were outright impossible and have nothing to do with Smiley. Who btw sucks but has zero impact on these moves.   You have the benefit of hindsight on Bruce Brown. Everything is easy when you look back at it after the fact.
They took a flyer because Lacob’s kid was doing their scouting. It says a lot about their scouting and Lacob’s influence. Wasting 3 2nd round picks is a big deal when they’re over the cap and don’t have a lot of assets. Those 2nd round picks could’ve been Bruce Brown or Landry Shamet or Evan Fournier.
They wasted 3 2nd round picks to draft Smailigic because Lacob’s son watch him workout in an empty gym. The Nets got Bruce Brown by trading 1 2nd round pick. Warriors could’ve used Smailigic’s roster spot when they played a 7 man rotation for 20+ games and the 7th man was Mughal Mulder.
"Disagree, since the Nets are much better at moving the ball and creating good offence. He can do catch and shoot stuff, the Nets spacing is much better than the Lakers so there’ll be much more potential for him to drive. You’re also forgetting Harden (2nd best playmaker in the league); if Kuz can cut effectively then he can have a Bruce Brown role with Harden spoonfeeding him buckets. I like the size he gives us at either forward spot, I haven’t watched him that much though. How’s his rebounding?"
"I don’t think so. He’s a guy who can’t stay on the floor defensively in the playoffs. On the other hand, Bruce brown was/is the best perimeter defender on the team. Kuz has a much more projectable role as a 3/4 who can ease KD’s defensive burden and be a secondary scorer in the harden bench units"
depends on Bruce Brown ---  Harrel is basically a bigger version of Brown's role
"He’s still only 25, so there’s a couple more years for him to try and carve out a role somewhere. He’s got some intriguing skills, but it’s just so tough to be a guard with no shot. Maybe he could be deployed by a team the way the Nets used Bruce Brown"
Hart is a rich man's Bruce brown but doubt he's getting paid wouldn't want to pay either him or lonzo much.
Bro what? He'll bee in the rotation. The best scorer in the draft and the nets bench has Bruce brown as the only guard and he plays bigger that his size. With injurys and load management he'll play alot
Bruce Brown in there?
Bruce brown on Lebron? AD will foul out Blake Griffin (Giannis played like shit that series). And Russ is eating Harden or Kyrie.
That's what Bruce Brown does if you watched the Nets. But Michell probably shoots better.
Losing KCP is gonna hurt this team more than people realise. There aren't many 3&amp;D players out there.  Lakers basically need to have a Brooklyn-like year in scouting minimum players who can contribute to playoffs basketball like Bruce Brown or it's doomed
"The Nets just made a great deal here, if they keep Carter/use him correctly on defense.   I still don't comprehend why the Suns didn't play him in the NBA Finals nor the WCF, to at least see if he could neutralize players who CP3 and Payne could not effectively guard. Him and Bruce Brown will be interesting to include with Dinwiddie."
Will Bruce Brown still be with them next season? Cause that would be the most annoying defensive pairing on the court. Both all up in your face defenders lol
"The Nets, maybe, as long as he realizes he's Bruce Brown on that team. But Brown tries to finish at the rim, and Ben needs to work on that.   Boston I feel like he's a downgrade from Timelord as a rim protecting big. He's a better defender on the perimeter, but they have a lot of that already. He's a clear upgrade over a Fournier on that end, but he's also a flat tire on O in a defense that looked regularly stagnant last year.   Miami? I can't see him working with Bam on O. Portland maybe, though you're right he's gutting the team and that creates new roster issues. I don't see him fitting in with Gobert, Jokic, or Ayton very well - his man is now in the way of Gobert and Ayton rolling, and Jokic will have a more crowded paint and the double would no longer open up a shooter."
"Andre was literally traded for a 2nd rounder. Blake was bought out. Bruce brown was traded for a 2nd. Kennard was actually traded for a 1st, so he was the most valuable asset. Sekou played like 5 good games"
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin were more important than Kennard a year ago. And if you’re talking about the best prospect than Sekou Doumbouya and Bruce Brown were better assets I’d say.
"I mean honestly I know there are plenty of good reasons it wouldn't happen but something resembling a Joe Harris + Bruce Brown for Simmons is fun to think about.  Simmons could play to his defensive and transition strengths while being one of the only non shooters on the floor, which would lessen the net effect he has on spacing.  Harris and Brown give Embiid room to work because Brown is serviceable in all parts of a pick and roll and Harris's shot always needs to be respected.  I don't think either side pulls the trigger because the Nets don't need any added uncertainty and Philly probably wants a playmaking guard plus picks but I also think both teams come out better off"
"Still got the big 3 of Kyrie, Harden, and Bruce Brown"
"How are players like Jeff Green, Bobby Portis, Nic Batum, and Bruce Brown 5th tier? All these guys are pretty good role players"
The game wouldn't have gotten to be close if it wasn't for Bruce Brown. He was the only one on the Nets who was at least consistent at putting the ball through the hoop.
"Maybe he can be used like a bigger, better passing Bruce brown, set a screen and roll to the rim. If the defense closes on him, he can pass it out to an open shooter."
"Point guard is #1.  Lowry makes a lot of sense, but he’s gonna be coveted by a lot of teams.    I wouldn’t even rule out a Dennis Schroeder return, but that seems very unlikely since there’s been reports of locker room tension with him.    I’m curious to see if Derrick Rose will re-sign in New York.  I also wanna know how much Spencer Dinwiddie will earn.  Similar for Goran Dragic.    Ish Smith and Bruce Brown are also good.  Bruce Brown is an RFA though.  Ish Smith could be a backup PG target."
"He could start on the Nets if he's willing to play like Bruce Brown, sure"
Damian Lillard is traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown
"(Flashback to Bruce Brown driving to the paint and ignoring Kyrie, KD, and Joe Harris in Game 6)"
"Oh fuck no they cant have demar, landry shamet, AND bruce brown"
"Because khris middleton and jrue holiday were trash for half the series. No one on the bucks was really helping Giannis consistently, KD had games where blake griffin, Jeff Green, bruce brown stepped up on top of having 2 games of healthy kyrie. Khris and jrue were hit or miss all playoffs."
All 3 are important but honestly Bruce Brown might command a lot to other contenders with money.
Bruce brown 🔥🔥
Guys like that make impacts sometimes. Look at like Bruce brown or PJ Tucker or Chuck Hayes or whatever. I dunno if LiAngelo has that motor but size doesn’t always mean everything
"Is that any better than KD surrounded by a 50% Harden, Harris, and Bruce Brown? If we're gonna bring up injuries then the Bucks honestly should have been eliminated by the Nets.   For what it's worth though, that Cavs team swept the 60-win Hawks. Mozgov and Delly are garbage names but they actually were decent in games 1-3 of that Finals series and a big reason they were up 2-1.  And you know your last sentence is disingenuous lol. You can't tell me the way the Cavs and Raptors guarded Steph is anything like how Giannis was guarded (dared to shoot jumpers, sometimes intentionally sent to the FT line). If Steph was guarded like that I'm sure he would have put up way more explosive performances too."
"rebounding guards Beverly, PJ Tucker and Bruce Brown ... all joking aside probably just need 3-D, with the 3 pointer being worth more. If you gonna allow me superstars KD/Kawhi/Tatum/Middleton  Maybe at the highest level fouls start to come into play.  It sounded like there was some weird rules when you got up there in team fouls getting 2 freethrows and ball etc. but they shouldn't be calling most fouls in the first place"
"The only time the phrase ""got taken to 6"" is used. I mean, the Bucks were a shoe size away from being eliminated by KD and Bruce Brown."
"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
"I feel like the Suns could've taken the hobbled Nets. Mikal, Crowder, Craig, all give KD different looks defensively. Booker would cook one-leg Harden, Mike Brown would get stomped, and Joe Harris would've vanished, and 6'4"" Bruce Brown is not getting boards over them   Claxton's still a little skinny to be guarding Ayton"
Umm. No they didn’t. They had joe harris and Bruce brown and a washed up Blake Griffin. Aka 6 guys. You need more than 6 guys to win a ring dude.
"Giannis wasn't ""guarded by Blake Griffin"". The Nets were running a soft wall in the paint with KD leaving the corner shooter open to clog the paint and another Nets player in there too. He was rarely 1v1 against Blake. I don't even remember how many times Bruce Brown and Harris and Green were helping off their player, while KD was right there too and Blake was his main defender.  The Bucks weren't doubling KD though, they were letting him get his. He was always going 1v1 except for some time in game 5 when they tried it and Jeff Green torched them, so they stopped.  Ayton did guard Giannis 1v1."
"Middelton, Bruce Brown, Drummond, Spencer Dinwidie, and Sekou starting lineup. Yikes"
"In a more reasonable sense, teams are going smaller, so you may not be guarding a traditional big if Bruce Brown is your 5."
"they have a good bench if they can keep it. Shamet, jeff green, bruce brown, claxton is a solid bench"
The world simply isn't ready for a Bruce Brown finals MVP
"The role players weren’t even that bad, Blake had a great series and Bruce Brown was up and down but a lot more good than bad. Jeff Green had the game of his life to help them win game 5. Joe Harris was absolutely atrocious after game 2 but just about everybody else was as good or better than you could expect them to be."
"Harder to build a great team around Giannis than KD because Giannis needs much more space to work with.  KD can thrive next to Bruce Brown, Nicolas Claxton, etc.  Giannis needs four shooters around him to do what he just did."
Fucking Bruce Brown jeez
And then Bruce Brown lost his mind and went for a tough layup attempt instead of passing it to KD
You’re comparing jrue and middleton to Bruce brown/one leg harden/mike James ?
If Bruce brown didn’t choke the Nets would’ve been up 3-0 and closed it at home in 5
Better question is why Bruce brown went for that layup instead of passing it to a red hot kd
You’ve probably confused Mike James for Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown thought he was Bruce Wayne. wtf was he thinking?!
"If Spencer was just playmaking and KD maintained his aggressive scoring, Nets. Bucks otherwise; taking KD’s scoring alongside his efficiency even the tiniest bit and giving it to Spencer shots changes a lot.   However, Spencer in place of Bruce Brown on that last play makes a better play in Game 3."
"Brother I’m a Bruce Brown truther myself. My only point is the man is objectively short compared to Ben Simmons. If you can be effective with a 6’4” center, Ben Simmons isn’t gonna be bullied at nearly 7’"
Fuck Kyrie and his smooth brained antics but I will not tolerate any Bruce Brown slander.
I mean right now they’re starting Bruce Brown as a 5 lol
I can’t believe we traded Bruce Brown for Musa. Ya fookin hosed us
"Ky, a few firsts, and bruce brown jr for Kevin Love. Make it happen K... Just kidding let him suffer."
"I couldn't understand why Giannis, the DPOY, wasn't guarding KD during the playoffs. Dude was guarding Bruce Brown."
"Bruce Brown won’t play any where near as many minutes as Ben would, in a healthy rotation"
"This was one of my favorite parts of last season:  &gt; On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, there’s Bruce Brown.4 Brown and childhood friend Terance Mann essentially invented a position last season, which I have elected to call the Biggie Small. At 6-foot-4 and 202 pounds, Brown is the size of a guard — which makes sense, because he played point guard and shooting guard growing up, at the University of Miami and in his first two NBA seasons. But the Nets decided he was going to play like a center on offense, and the results were awesome.  &gt; Defenses simply did not know what to do with this guy when he set a screen and rolled into the paint, or when he camped out in the dunker spot, or when he cut from an odd angle into the middle of the lane for an easy floater. It’s practically unheard of for a Brown-sized player to set 34 screens per 100 possessions, as Brown did during the playoffs, but when it keeps working, why not just keep going to it? Among the 277 instances of a player setting at least 100 ball-screens during a playoff run over the past eight years, Brown’s 2020-21 run ranked fourth in points per possession."
&gt; How do the Nets get better?  They get better because Ben Simmons is 100x better than Bruce Brown.
The Brown brace of Bruce and Bryce
Bruce Brown and Bryce Brown on one team… GG
"The thing is. The nets will still be amazing this year.  KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Griffin, Aldridge, Harris, Claxton, bruce brown, Cam Thomas (potential ROY candidate).   That’s a stacked squad already. Kyrie just makes that team the avengers. The real question is when playoff time comes and Kyrie can’t play home games, what do you do then?"
"Poole averaged 12ppg in 20mpg last season and he didnt even get any momentum for first half of the season bcs of Wanamaker. No reason to not believe he cant average 18ppg in 30+mins.  Nemanja has always been a solid stretch big just that he didnt get any playing time on the Heat. Iggy is old but his perimeter defense was still good last season with the heat. Agree with the OPJ injury issue which is why I said assuming everyone is healthy bcs if you want to take into account injury theres a high chance Porzingis will be out this season as well. Reggie Bullock is the only good addition. Isnt Bruce Brown with the Nets lol? And Moses Brown is only good if you look at the box score, hes basically Andre Drummond Jr, if you watched enough Thunder games last season you will understand, or maybe you can ask any Thunder fans"
Spurs legend Bruce Brown
"Modern day NBA doesn't really require PFs to be strong in the paint. I mean, the Nets were playing 6'4"" Bruce Brown at PF in the playoffs last year lol. Regardless, it's not like he would play heavy minutes at the 4. But if they wanted to for short stretches or against a certain matchup, they prolly could."
"Yes. Controversy aside, any team would rather have Kyrie playing in away games only than Bruce Brown or whoever as your starting SG for both home and away games."
Bruce Brown is miles ahead of everyone you mentioned
"To be fair Harden had to face KD, Steph, Draymond, and Klay  Giannis had to face KD, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown might be one of my favourite players.
"That’s not how he would function, he’d take on the Bruce brown role. Teams trap KD and Harden, he gets the ball going downhill to either playmake or finish   It’s the best role for him but it doesn’t make the nets better than if they had Kyrie IMO"
"Just because I was curious, this is the last team the Kings beat in a playoff series.  The last team the Kings beat in a playoff game had a starting line up of Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Bruce Brown, Tim Duncan and Rasho Nestrerovic.  The Kings started Mike Bibby, Bonzi Wells, Ron Artest, Kenny Thomas and Brad Miller. That game was played on April 30, 2006."
"It's pretty universal. It's a much better representation of scoring efficiency than any other stat. What it doesn't tell you is the difficulty of shots a player is taking. You'd expect someone like Bruce Brown or Seth Curry to have a high TS% because they're mostly finishing plays and don't really take shots outside of the flow of the offense.   If someone has a similar role but has a worse TS%, there's cause for concern. And then you get outliers like Curry who have insane efficiency on difficult shots"
Bruce Brown asking for the vax now
"at a minimum, Bruce Brown with 2 shots is eligible to play at Barclays this season."
Bruce Brown with a shot is a max player.  Don't @ me.
Yep makes complete sense to put Bruce Brown on something you’re trying to sell instead of Kyrie.
Bruce Brown &gt; Kyrie
Bruce Brown taking his place.
Bruce Brown asking for a max now
He’d be Bruce Brown on steroids
"This team is way more proven than that Clippers team.  KD, Patty Mills, and Kyrie have been there and shown up.  Harden, Millsap, LMA, Blake, and James Johnson all know how to play in the playoffs.  Even the young guys like Bruce Brown, Claxton, and Harris have experience in the playoffs."
"This. Nash literally played 6'4"" Bruce Brown at center last season and he was productive as a screen and roll guy off of Harden.   If you're seriously saying Ben can't do *that* then the reactionary take on him has gone too far on him and we need to go back and watch Ben Simmons' tape from last regular season. Playoffs aside, he is a superb athlete and a very talented/switchable defender. 2 things Brooklyn can very seriously use this upcoming season."
"I called it when they signed KD and Kyrie that they'd never win with those 2, mainly because of Kyrie. Signing Harden gave them a giant boost, as did signing all those veterans for small/min deals.   It's insane that they have Aldridge, Blake, Millsap, Patty Mills besides their big 3, plus a few other nice pieces in Joe Harris, Bruce Brown Jr, James Johnson (if he can still play ?)."
Ben Simmons in the Bruce Brown role would be amazing.  But I don't think you can really do that trade because of this players' trade value is just in a very weird place rn
"Harden/Joe Harris/KD/Blake/LMA  Bench : Patty Mills/Cam Thomas/Bruce Brown/Millsap/Claxton  With James Johnson/Jevon Carter/ Bembry/ Day'Ron Sharpe as end of bench  This team can win a ring 100%, not like they're favorite and are gonna smash teams left and right but on a good run they can"
Glad Doumbouya and Bruce Brown played well &lt;3
The bucks could have doubled kd every time bruce brown was on the floor he can't shoot but they didn't thats not effective. we're talking double teams not spacing and idk why you brought up Giannis his weakness is a wall because of his unique skillset he's irrelevant here.
I think future hall of famer Bruce Brown will be the Draymond of their dynasty
"Bruce Brown has more to him than just ""garbage buckets and defense"""
was that bruce brown?! jesus christ
Bruce Brown is way too good to be playing in this game
Bruce brown looks nice
If bruce brown can start hitting the 3 consistently the nets are unbeatable
Bruce brown mvp season incoming
Bruce Brown getting buckets against this Lakers team..  Nets championship confirmed
Bruce Brown bout to get paid
Bruce Brown gonna make the Nets a Big 4 😤  In all seriousness he looks way more comfortable on offense this year it’s cool to see
bruce brown stroking 3s now? lol
Bruce Brown hitting 3s?  Yeah Lakers defense is gonna get exposed real hard this season
Center Bruce Brown the rest doesnt matter
Jevon Carter-Bruce Brown-Sekou-LaMarcus Aldridge-Nicolas Claxton starting lineup lets go
"Bruce Brown, Jevon Carter and Sekou Doumbouya are the highest paid available players"
Cowards keep dodging Bruce Brown.
I think a big reason the defense improved on the bucks was   1. The bucks bricked a bunch of wide open shots again in the playoffs  2. They had to play Bruce brown with kyrie out who is a great defensive player.
"Great point about Blake and LMA damn. No team can run with 100% healthy Kyrie/Harden/KD/Blake/LMA with Joe Harris sixth man, plus Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Paul Millsap off the bench. Cam Thomas looks good too"
"Probably yes, their defense was great vs the Bucks, but it was partly because they replaced Harden and then Kyrie's mins with Bruce Brown who is a great defender.  Also the Bucks had their annual ""hey we are a great shooting team all year but we'll never ever make open shots in the playoffs"", and it's not out of the question that now that they've won a ring this mental block goes away.  Also having 0 rim protection and a best wing defender who is 6'3 would be a problem against the Lakers or Clippers in an eventual NBA finals.  The thing is it wouldn't be surprising if they had a 120 offensive rating even against a defense like the Bucks if their trio is healthy and if Joe Harris doesn't randomly can't make open shots, so it might not even matter"
Andre Roberson tbf was rly good at making the right reads via cutting and moving without the ball (like Bruce Brown on the nets).  In the playoffs too he'd regular shot 40% from 3! (Ignore his free throw percentage tho)
I could see him doing what Bruce brown did for us last year. But that’s a very low bar for KYRIE IRVING. I agree he should take the vax but if everyone else is vaccinated they’re gonna be fine. He’s only a risk to himself. Let the man do his job
"Yeah he'd just do what Bruce Brown does, but he's 6'10"" and an All-NBA defensive player, who's also a pretty good passer. Seems perfect tbh"
So he's a rich man's Bruce Brown?
Harden had an incredible connection with Bruce Brown last season. Having Simmons perform that role - someone who's vaguely similar while being bigger faster stronger and a better decision maker than Brown would be unstoppable.
We took an healthy Clippers team to 7 games while KP averaged 13pts and was shit on defense.  This Clippers team won against Jazz in 6 games without Kawhi in 2 games and then took Suns to 6 games without Kawhi all series. It may be safe to say that if Kawhi was healthy Clippers could have been in the finals.  With KP being himself averaging 22pts and putting good defense it does launch us into contention. Plus we've added Bullock and Bruce Brown 2 solid role players.   Mavs whole ceiling depends on KP thats why Mavs/Kidd should try and involve him from the 1st regular season game.
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
"Lowry and Rondo were mainly designated as chasers to shooters and Curry and Paul (among Lebron and Luka as well as handful of others) were mainly handling helper responsibilities in defense trying to avoid being involved in point of attack defense wherever possible.  Personally I'd be fine with how they are currently classified so I'd be happy to count Luka and Lebron as point guards just as I would counting Curry or Paul. If I would question any players that are currently defined as point guards it would probably have to be Ben Simmons and Bruce Brown due to their offensive roles, but even then I'm fine with it.  Personally I'm not quite sure how useful or meaningful the position label in itself is due to the fact that no matter how you slice it there will be players with various offensive and defensive roles included.  However as an example Luka Doncic, James Harden, Chris Paul and Lebron James all had exactly same offensive and defensive role. So at least personally I struggle to see what separates Paul from the 3 others as they were all classified as point guards last season. Harden is only one where I could see clear argument since he had dual position. But comparing Paul and Luka for example I just feel that all the arguments basically come down to the bias of Paul is short and Luka is not. Like neither of them is trying to guard the point of attack on defense if they have a choice and both of them generate their offensive value in a similar manner."
"Matisse Thybulle, Wes Matthews, Serge Ibaka, Bruce Brown"
"Bruce Brown, Claxton, Lillard"
Bruce Brown on the Nets  Ibaka for the Clippers  Jaylen Brown for the Celtics
Bruce brown from Brooklyn. Idk why i just love him
Bruce Brown with 0/1/0 in over 30 minutes
"Great game by the Bulls. Outstanding 2nd half. 67 to 38. Bradley played outstanding defense on LMA, ending his hot streak. Idk anything about Bruce Brown, but he was garbage all night."
"Eh, one of the original spreadsheet boys (Hollinger) literally had DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agents last year behind guys like Duncan Robinson and Danny Green. He had his value at 15.3 million a year, and by comparison, had Bruce Brown at 14.8 mill. They played each other head to head yesterday and Demar put up 28 on 20 shots, and Bruce Brown put up 0 points on 8.  The real question is why advanced stat heads looked at a guy shooting at a 59 TS% in high usage and not think he might do well on a team that he isn't the main scoring option all the time."
Bruce Brown and Kyrie Irving
Yeah Bruce Brown is out there fighting against 7ft dudes
Fuck what Blake did today.. lol Bruce Brown played absolutely terrible how you get 0 points in 30 minutes? 😂
"Bruce Brown isn’t out their to score though, he played good defence and set good picks,  bricked the few shots he took but idk what y’all expect from a guard playing the dunker spot"
Bruce brown out there running around for 30 minutes 💀
" They were turning to Bruce Brown to hit a clutch floater late in the game because the snake's too beta to take the final shot. KD loves his shooting percentages and he never takes last second shots. The snake needs completely stacked teams to get the dub, this just proves it LOL"
He passes it to Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin in the clutch  I remember him doing this with Houston in the playoffs as well
Bruce brown just set three straight illegal screens lol
"Man, Bruce Brown is really going for the headshots this quarter"
Bruce Brown just saved another negative Harden post from being on the front page
BRUCE BROWN DPOY!
GP2 and Bruce Brown ‘bout to revolutionize small ball Centers.
Starting centers will be Bruce Brown and Gary Payton II.
"Probably not top 10, but Bruce Brown has been solid"
Bembry has been really solid for the Nets.. pretty much a taller Bruce Brown
"Bruh did you watch the playoffs last year? He was unstoppable but it wasn’t like he was gonna score 60 points a game to carry the nets starting five of Blake Griffin, James Harden, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown."
Bruce Brown second best rim protector behind Trae Young
"He looked comfortable tonight. Bruce brown was all over him, but he really took advantage when mills was on him. Great game to start building fir him"
"Obviously a foul on Bruce Brown lmao, tugging Cade’s arm so he couldn’t retrieve the ball"
I’m thankful that my team never gave up dinwiddie or Bruce Brown for free because of front office ineptitude
"He shakes people plenty and those jogging pin downs are enough to cause open slips (look at Bruce brown).   Regardless, KD moves a lot off the ball in comparison to other stars. Just not a lot in comparison to … the greatest off ball player ever"
"Except it creates a lot of pressure on the defense. Every game Durant creates with the simple pin down. Last game we had whoever Trae was guarding set the screen so Trae can’t contest durants shot. Then they either double and Durant found joe Harris for a wide open 3, or Durant just rises over him.   It’s good consistent offense all the time. Also when we do it with Bruce brown he slips to the basket for layups all the time. Golden state did it as well like that. He’s not curry but he is one of the best off ball superstars in the league."
Yea. Also combine that timing of DJ getting phased out with Bruce Brown breaking out and the Nets eventually getting Blake and they actually became a decent defense
"He's got offensive ability, just isn't a great shooter. The Warriors have found a nice role for him just like the Nets have found a nice role for Bruce Brown. They were using GP2 like he was a center down the stretch of last night's game."
"Now that the Nets have popularized the Bruce Brown role, I feel like GP2 types will start sticking in the league more. The Warriors were using him in a similar role, he was setting a lot of screens in the fourth and crashing the boards when Rozier was guarding him and all that."
"GPII is playing that Bruce Brown role in Nets, the midget center, perfectly"
Bruce Brown as a 6'4 center
Bruce Brown had him working.
Bruce Brown has been hounding Hawks all night.
Champagnie a nice fucking player. Dude's like Bruce Brown. Beast on the boards.
"Nets are at their best when Harris is hitting corner threes, Bruce brown is attacking 4v3, LMA is getting the ball in pick and pop, etc. Entire team eating is better than one guy eating up shots. This nets team isn’t like the rockets where everyone was just a spot up shooter"
Didn't Bruce Brown go to HS in Vermont?
"The Nets when Kyrie went down weren’t trash at all. It’s just that key guys played like trash in the Bucks after Kyrie’s injury. The infamous Joe Harris choke, then Harden not even being able to run a fastbreak due to injury, and the fact that the bench put up 0 shots in Game 7. Not make 0 shots, they shot 0 times. Of course players like Blake and Bruce Brown played well, and Jeff Green popped off in Game 5, but Milwaukee were just deeper once Kyrie went down. The Bucks could play guys like Connaughton and he provided for them in Game 7. Their starting lineup of Middleton, Holiday, Giannis, Tucker, and Lopez were also more consistent than the Net’s starting lineup barring Kd."
"This is your reminder that John Hollinger had DeMar DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agent this year, valued less then 500k more per year then Andre Drummond and Bruce Brown, 4 mill a year less then Danny Green, and 8 million less a year then Duncan Robinson.  Thank you for your time, good night."
Yeah that's true too. Kyrie provided really good defence for you last year. I know people think he is not good at that end but last year he was. You are also missing his energy a lot. Now the defending is stagnant because the only player in your team that is high energy guy is Bruce Brown honestly. And energy is contagious
Can Nets can file a lawsuit or do some shit to get rid of or force kyrie? I know this is a player's league but getting paid without playing is insulting to their low wage colleagues. Bruce brown jr hustling like madman while kyrie posting some cryptic fck.
What role is he playing? He’s not a starter and isn’t a defender. He can be a stretch 4 but wouldn’t you rather play Bruce brown and slide kd over?  His best fit would be small ball center but other than the shooting he wouldn’t offer anything. His playmaking is his other strong suit but definitely takes a backseat to the big 3 and the lineups should be staggered so he’s at best their 3rd best playmaker on the floor.  I guess on the other hand he gets rejuvenated and becomes their 6th man?
Bruce brown hustling
I remember when Nets fans would spam “Give Bruce Brown more minutes” under every Nets social media platform lol
Bruce Brown is my dad
Bruce Brown is a god
Lol Bruce Brown is good  Nets have some good role players
Bruce brown game mvp
Bruce Brown season
I LOVE YOU BRUCE BROWN
"Bruce Brown has been so underrated for us this year, love his energy"
Bruce Brown has such a nice body. Long arms beautiful shoulders. you can tell he works hard.
I want a guy like bruce brown on my team
OMG BRUCE BROWN
Bruce Brown is so good
Lukewarm take Bruce brown is better than Jeff green and I would close games with him over jeff
Bruce Brown a great guy for the Nets
James Harden could not understand why Joe Harris threw the inbound pass to Bruce Brown lmao
"Yeah,    Bruce Brown   Mykhaliuk   Milton   Gary Trent Jr   Hamidou Diallo   Brunson   Graham   Mitchell Robinson     Nobody of Jokic's caliber tho"
"Their perimeter defense isn’t that bad tbh. KD, Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are all solid defenders on the perimeter. It’s their interior defense that is a huge problem."
Got Bron looking like Bruce Brown.
Lebron doesn't box out Bruce Brown and complains about the open TLC three lol
"Sucks KD and AD are out, but at least we get Bruce Brown vs Alex Caruso"
Is Bruce Brown matched up with Gasol?
He called bruce brown kyrie lol
why are we iso'ing kuzma against bruce brown lmao
"Nets are starting Bruce Brown and Jeff Green, if the Lakers can’t pummel these scrubs they should be ashamed...even without AD and DS. This should be a blowout."
"Yes, Bruce brown, Jeff green and Landry shamet are all playing"
"And??? They still were better constructed with the nets are now. If we had Lowry, Powell, FVV, Siakim, Ibaka and gasol as role players instead of Deandre Jordan, TLC, Jeff green, Tyler freaking Johnson and Bruce brown. We’d be the indisputable favorites lmaoooo.   In 2019 harden lost to the warriors in the second round. Same way he’s lose to the bucks/Sixers.  And then you say kawhi wasn’t the real FMVP.... yea this convo over lmaoo convo done"
"Bruce Brown Jr. about to drop 30, based on how the last couple Lakers games have gone (random dudes going off)"
No love for Joe Harris or Bruce Brown??
Weaver has made good moves but can’t forget that Bruce Brown for Musa trade was pretty bad
"Bruce Brown is like our only really good defensive player, and Book just gave CP the ball with 7 seconds left in the corner vs him and said good luck."
"This team just shot 57% from the field and 50% from 3, without KD and Kyrie... That's INSANE!   The next best players after Harden are Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet... LMAOOO   This team's offensive ability might go down in history as an all-time best"
"I think people misunderstand what is the logic behind a superteam. If you have 3 stars (or more), you can continue without missing a beat.   Take for example the Warriors in 2019, even without KD, they still managed to beat both Houston and sweep the Trailblazers. They had a little issue with Raptors but ultimately lost another star in Klay too.   Similarly, in the Nets situation right now, Kyrie and KD have both missed time this season for various reasons. Having Harden in there means that there is always an elite playmaker (would be better if Dinwiddie was around though) to create for the rest of the team. In comparison, having Jrue, Harris, Allen, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown/PJ Tucker would make a terrible offensive team."
Do not trade Bruce Brown he is also hustle you need that on a team with three superstars
but Bruce Brown plays defense
Or they can trade bruce brown and shamet for defense.
"I hate watch the Wizards because I like Russ but I wouldn't advice anyone to do this.  Love watching the Hornets this year, Lamelo and Bridges are fun, their announcers are really good.  And I'm the kind of weirdo that likes to watch Brooklyn...because of Bruce Brown lol"
"Not to be biased but Sean Marks track record of finding diamonds in the rough isn’t bad. Of course we barely still have any of them :(  Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Caris, Jarret Allen, Mason Plumlee ish, Bruce Brown"
Bruce Brown is the best B-ball dad in history
"What it says: “Bruce Brown”  What my brain sees, every time: “Bruce Bowen”"
Bruce Brown is a solid role player but outside of that there isn’t anyone else
Just letting Bruce Brown stand under the hoop and take uncontested layups.
"irving scored around his true shooting tonight, 64%. Harden was well above with his 3pt shooting, but durant was pretty bad for his normal standards. What killed you guys was the inability to stop penetration and dump offs to bruce brown and the harden jeff green pnr."
am I the only one who always reads Bruce Brown as Bruce Bowen and instantly recoil thinking it's the dirty spurs player?
"It's scary, that even if you managed to slow one of the big 3. It's either a Harris 3 or a Bruce brown lay-up"
"It's weird, the Warriors looked like they were expecting Rockets Harden where the pace is much slower and it's just iso iso iso, but Nets Harden is fast paced, push ahead for a ton of transition buckets, and constant back screens and cuts.  Also I'm not sure if they thought Bruce Brown was a ref or something, but they seemed to ignore him for the majority of the game."
I've said this a million times but Bruce Brown is just a huge amount of hustle and energy. He is all effort and it contributes all over the place.
Bruce Brown gonna get Mozgov money playing with these dudes
"When ALL 3 of them play it's damn near unstoppable, also love to see Bruce brown balling"
Bruce Brown is going to make winning plays for this nets team in the playoffs guaranteed
Harden got more assists than points lol and half of those were to Bruce Brown on the cut I think.
lmfao this nets big 3 gonna get bruce brown paid like jonathan simmons
"FUCK DEANDRE, BRUCE BROWN SZN"
Bruce Brown is filling in the DJ role
Bruce brown to a lifetime deal
AND 1 THE BRUCE BROWN SHOW
"Bruce Brown does not look 6’4”, then again he’s jacked so that might be why he doesn’t look that tall."
Bruce brown will not be out of the league soon lmfao
bruce brown and tyler johnson will be out of the league soon.
Bruce Brown is cutting whenever Curry doubles
bruce brown feasting in the paint he's Zion
Love bruce brown
Bruce Brown playing our his mind rn.
The Bruce Brown show
Who the hell is Bruce Brown??  Legit never heard his name before tonight
I love Bruce Brown so much
Bruce Brown is apparently the starting center for the Nets today lmao
"Leading FGA on each team  Bruce Brown, Juan Toscano-Anderson"
That was Bruce brown lmao  Even the ppl who watch the games on this sub have no clue what’s going on
"Ah yes, the scoring battle we all expected. Steph Curry and *checks notes* Bruce Brown?"
Maybe they'll put draymond on bruce brown so he can help and roam a lot more.  Some combination of Oubre/Wiggins/JTA on Kyrie/harden/KD.  Steph on Joe Harris.
"Nets starting Irving, Harden, Harris, Bruce Brown, KD tonight. Officially getting our first game of KD starting at the 5 lol"
"I usually like low videos a lot but this one was weak and Ik u think I’m just saying that cuz it’s the pistons.  Yes we picked badly in general during that stretch but I refuse to believe there wasn’t at least a few teams that picked worse than us  Drummond was a good pick, kcp, luke seem like ok picks  Middleton and spencer are amazing picks unfortunately we traded them for nothing which Ik basically means we just picked bad, fine.  I’m probably forgetting someone too since it was quite a bit ago when I watched the video  But he didn’t even mention the Bruce brown pick, that was very good.  We didn’t pick great no doubt but it was a lot of bad luck too w the lottery. Also many of those picks lead to the core that were building rn which is starting to look promising so if we do somehow start to become very good w this core it’s in large part due to some of these picks.  Ik I probably sound like a salty pistons fan but I honestly think this video was a stretch compared to the other ones he’s made."
What position does Bruce Brown play? Won't Kyrie Harden KD harris and DJ be the starters? Nobody out of these guys is gonna actively chase after Curry.
Could see them starting Bruce brown and picking curry up 94 feet like he did Brogdon last game.
"Does that make everyone on the team bad defenders? Is Bruce Brown, who has been known for his defense, suddenly horrible like KD too? They also are a league leader in pace.   He has a -4.9 on off defensively, and he’s ranked 1 in DFG%. You can think he’s not a great defender, but thinking he’s a horrible one is nonsensical.   Watch more games maybe lol"
Eh. Bruce Brown has an asterisk cause of how dirty he was
"Well Joe harris provides enourmous floor spacing. What they don't need is prob bruce brown, and other bench pieces for a serviceable big."
They don't need to do that. Jeff Green as a small ball 5 and Harden at the 4 is better than having Bruce Brown at the 2 and Harris at the 3.

"&gt; he definitely contributes to their struggles on that end  In that he cost them a bunch of players that were at least average on defense and all semblance of depth.  Harden himself isn't bad on defense, especially in the post. Kyrie is a worse defender than Harden. Bruce Brown and KD are their best defenders, I think.  Their bench unit being bad also makes it difficult. I think Warriors could be more competitive in their 2nd matchup against the Nets this Friday b/c a lot of the bench guys were starters last year."
Bruce brown was good for us last year on d
"Bruce Brown is their second best defender. Everyone else is average to below average, and the team defense is just really bad."
"Bruce brown unfortunately didn’t really have a place on our team. We had drose, and just drafted killian at the 1 so we wanted to give him plenty of minutes to develop. Our other guards are Josh Jackson (whose def an improvement of Bruce brown), svi who is intriguing and I believe still has room to develop, saddiq bey who we just drafted whose been playing minutes at multiple positions, and Wayne Ellington who is a great veteran to have and has been killing it this season. We had too many players at that position and while he was good on defense Bruce’s scoring did not have the same ceiling as the other guys. His playmaking is good, but seems like there just wasn’t enough for weaver to want to keep him as a point guard after drafting hayes"
Definitely the pistons. Their off season moves were that of an insane person.   I mean Bruce Brown for Dzanan Musa? Tank or insanity. Those are the only two options.
"My god, no one honestly. Bruce Brown has scored well around the basket and played good defense, if only he had a 3 pointer."
"When you talk about a player who just goes all out to give it his all, you look at a guy like Bruce Brown. Just pure effort today."
"Look at Bruce Brown, man. So inspirational"
Bruce Brown is going to be our savior
Bruce brown is the best player in the NBA and you can’t convince me otherwise
Bruce Brown is all we need
Bruce brown looks like he's gonna be a guy for us. Tenacious defender and good at attacking the rim.
Nobody can guard Bruce Brown?
"The Nets have a better bench than people are giving them credit for. Harris is an elite shooter, Jeff Green is still a versatile and solid role player, Shamat is decent, Bruce Brown is a decent young player, and DJ is at worst as good as Javale was last year. They will also be a popular buy out destination"
i fuckin love bruce brown
Bruce Brown is going to be so important this season
"People claim we have ""no depht"" yet Bruce Brown is incredible, Jeff Green is good and so is TLC. We need a backup center and our bench will be better than 60% of the leagues bench."
Perry can fill a big roll while they look for a buyout or FA. Also forgetting Bruce Brown. I still like the depth for having this big 3.
"Kyrie, Harden, Joe harris, durant, Jeff green..tell me a better starting five! Bench with shamet, TLC, Jordan, Bruce brown. Its a decent bench. The lack of defense is the problema i see."
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Cant wait for a lineup of Chiozza, Bruce Brown, Shemet, Luwawu, and Reggie Perry."
"No, defense is the only thing Nash should be worried about with this roster and Bruce brown is miles better than shamet on defense. In terms of people that benefit from open shots, it would be Joe Harris, a great 3-point shooter unlike Shamet. There's really not much use for him outside of garbage time if he doesn't improve drastically in one of those categories ASAP."
"Bruce Brown is an elite win defender, Jeff Green literally started for us for a lot of games, TLC is solid. The Nets bench is still better than the Celtics bench."
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Landry Shamet is mid, Bruce Brown tho 👀👀👀👀"
Landry Shamet sucks and shouldnt get playing time. Bruce Brown is way better
Lol come on of course they got better. Deandre Jordan is still a serviceable rim protector and they can always trade for someone like Nerlens Noel. And Bruce Brown is underrated. Of course Kyrie and Harden will be staggered too to help the bench out.
I think we're starting Kyrie (if he ever comes back) Harden KD Green and DJ.  Our bench would be Bruce Brown - Shamet - Joe Harris - TLC - Claxton which isn't terrible. It's gonna be the Joe Harris show.
They will add guys on the buyout market. TLC and Bruce Brown are serviceable bench pieces.
Bruce fucking Brown.
Double agent Bruce brown will exit sleeper mode and score on the nets’ own basket in the dying seconds of game 7 ECF to send the pistons back to the finals. We good.
No the team has no defense. Heat had great defense and Golden State had the defensive player of the year. This team is still bearable. What is Bruce Brown going to play center
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Nah they still got Bruce brown he’ll hold it down
Their bench isn’t that bad. They will have Bruce brown and shamet and Jeff green off the bench. It’s not great but those guys can play a role in the nba  Either way they do have 3 open spots to fill so we will see how they do that
"The Nets have 3 stars though. Harrell has yet to prove he’s playable in the playoffs. Gasol can be ran off the court. Kuzma can score but he’s inconsistent. KCP and Matthews has little worth if they can’t hit shots.  The Nets still have Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and although Jordan is a bit washed, he can still control the paint as the starting center. Jeff Green is pretty solid too."
"Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet and some dudes they are about to sign with the $15.7 million they have left"
"Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Claxton are all good bench players  If Shamet and TLC can get out of their funks they can be good contributors too"
Nets would abuse the ultra big lakers lineups. Lakers I think would have to play AD at the 5. I think montrez and gasol would be borderline unplayable for long stretches against the nets   Lakers have better chemistry but the nets do have some solid role guys still there in joe Harris Landry shamet and Bruce brown. I think they also still have Jeff green who can do some stuff
"Shamet, TLC, Ty Johnson, Bruce brown, and Dinwiddie if healthy, so all guards and wings lol"
Shamet and Bruce brown 😩😩
Joe will almost certainly be coming off the bench. We’ll probably have uncle Jeff or Bruce Brown in there for some semblance of Defense
"&gt; TLC, Shamet, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and I'm guessing Tyler Johnson  Out of those, only Cabarot has looked good. Can he lead the 2nd unit, or are they gonna have to stagger Kyrie/KD/Harden w/ bench players? Definitely need to get another center. Losing Allen is huge considering how well he's been playing this season. Probably need more bench players at least for regular season for injury and COVID insurance..."
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
Bruce brown has defense
"Ehh, they had the deepest team in the league.  They’ll be fine with TLC and Jeff Green and um, Bruce Brown.  Pretty solid bench guards/wings.  Joe Harris at the 3.  Backup Center and frankly starting center is the real problem.  Against most teams it doesn’t matter but against Milwaukee, Philly and the Lakers they need a better big man then Deandre Jordan."
Bruce brown DPOY
We keeping Bruce Brown babyyy
"Kurucs wasn't playing and Prince has been awful since we got him. Losing Levert and Allen is obviously a killer for our depth with Dinwiddie out too. Bench would be TLC, Shamet, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and I'm guessing Tyler Johnson might get some minutes. Claxton seems to be out long term so we need to get another center somehow."
"Shamet, Meth Curry, Jeff Green, TLC, Bruce Brown"
Don’t tell me they traded Bruce brown
"What’s the depth chart even looking like anymore?   On the wings and SG you got TLC, Joe Harris and Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green   Centre: DJ and Claxton?   This is looking really thin but I guess at all times one of the Big 3 will be on the floor and they’ll probably sign a few vet min guys"
Korkmaz and Thybulle = Shamet and Bruce Brown lmfao
bruce brown. crazy eyes
Stop spreading fake news. Jamal Murray got hot when Landry Shamet was guarding him. Bruce Brown put clamps on him.   Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. He will never be an all star or win a championship in his career.
No he isn’t. All his buckets were against Landry Shamet. Bruce Brown put clamps on him. I’d rather have Bruce Brown than Jamal Murray on a championship team.  Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. I predict he will never be an all star in his career or win a championship unless he plays 4th fiddle on a Kevin Durant team.
BRUCE BROWN 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️  cryknee nerveing 🗑️🗑️🤡🤡🤡
Except when Bruce Brown snatches a block with one hand
"The Bruce brown trade was so dumb we literally gave him away for nothing, happy to see he's balling out tho"
"You misspelled our new starter, Bruce Brown"
"Bruce brown is so good, deserves more minutes."
Who needs Kyrie when you have BRUCE FUCKING BROWN
Bench player who subs in once in a while for BRUCE FUCKING BROWN
so 2 main takeaways here:  1. Bruce Brown should never ever get another DNP-CD and needs 20+ minutes a game   2. Kevin Durant.
"KD was vintage for sure, but Bruce brown needs a lot of praise. He deserves minutes"
Who needs Kyrie when you have Bruce Brown
No excuses for not playing Bruce brown this whole time dude does all the little things and then some. They won all the games he started in I think
Bruce Brown is a key Net
KD really wanted to team up with Bruce Brown
"Nets starters today: Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green, Jarrett Allen   Nash either starts Bruce or doesnt play him at all, no in between lmfao"
"Could really use a win.  Would love to see Bruce Brown start again, and if Shamet found his shot that'd be nice too.  Prince has been improving, and KD &amp; Allen should keep doin' what they do.  *Let Go Nets!*  **BROOKLYN!!!!!**"
"We had great games with Bruce Brown in the starting lineup. He gave the starting unit energy, rebounding and defense and now for some reason he’s back to getting no minutes again."
Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet were indeed the pieces to elevate you guys to contender
"Nobody else was generating anything for him, the moment he got the ball in his hand another guy came to double him, after a week of Contact tracing layoff, dude tried his hardest to keep the team in the match somehow and Everytime he got Nets two points they gave up three on the other side.  Yes, he could have been slightly better, but don't for a second think this loss is on him. It's on Nash still trying to use DJ and TLC and Shamet, who are so ass that actual Ass would be embarrassed looking at them. Legit you are close and DJ gives a stupid Flagrant which gives them 4 points in one possesion. Shit like this kills the team's morale. We started Bruce Brown past 3 games and the team's effort was incredibly higher. Now Nash doesn't send him in for more than 4 mins.   This was very much winnable if there was defensive effort and Nash utilised proper rotations."
"Steve Nash : ""our defense suck, let's start Bruce Brown our only good perimeter defender""  Also Steve Nash :""our defense has been bettersince we've started him so let's bench Bruce Brown our only good perimeter defender"""
Bruce brown
"That’s going to be former Miami Hurricane Bruce Brown, thank you very much."
The fact that more stretch forwards have come into play actually helps the power guard. For example Bruce brown gets a lot of space to operate in the paint because Blake can spread the floor
How can u not like Bruce brown
I love Bruce brown
Bruce brown starting? Have mercy on them bulls.
"Kyrie and Bruce brown both with the hands on hips reaction. Like wtf! Wait, it’s Durant, can’t really say anything, just gonna stand here confused."
Bruce Brown is becoming one of my favorites.
To think instead of 21 minutes of Bruce brown that could be Aldridge with Durant at the 3
"&gt;He played his ass off for us when he could have just sulked and complained  Did he? He definitely sandbagged this season.  In previous seasons, he played hard when he had the ball, no question about that. His closeouts on three point shooters, in comparison, always looked like me getting out of bed in the morning.  Edit:  I couldn't care less about Blake. But I am happy for Detroit's own Bruce Brown."
"Joe Harris is actually good. Blake Griffin is washed but still ok. Shamet is alright. Bruce Brown is decent. Claxton isn't bad. That they get to play with Kyrie, Durant, and Harden amplifies their abilities a bunch. Not to mention Jeff Green who's day-to-day.  Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Luwawu-Cabarrot can all give you minutes and not get picked on or have to force dumb shit to make an impact. Their depth is actually completely ridiculous. Dinwiddie being out doesn't even seem to matter.  Meanwhile Bryn Forbes is playing 20 plus minutes. Yikes."
Their young guys are fine but it’s not like any of them are amazing. Everybody says every team has a young core that’s promising but it’s not like that. Shoutout Bruce Brown tho been a fan of his in Detroit glad to see everybody appreciate him
"Bruce Brown is such a confusing player. He is 6'4"" but plays like a center."
ah yes 7 footer Bruce Brown
"BRUCE BROWN, BEST CENTER IN THE LEAGUE"
"Now you're just putting words in my mouth lmao  I never brought up the Lakers. Just saying that Kyrie is much better than youre suggesting.   But if you must ask, in my opinion, 3 stars make a ""superteam"". That's 3/5 of a starting lineup, which is a majority of minutes played by all players on the court for that team.   Why aren't the Lakers a superteam? Well, much harder with only 2 star players. As we saw, once AD went out, LeBron was left with fuck all for consistent, real support. Schroeder and KCP both had goose eggs in two different games in the playoffs--that aint happening with KD or Kyrie.   With Brooklyn, losing 1 of the 3 still leaves you with 2 future hall of famers, so there's not a massive dropoff in talent in the grand scheme of things. Add in the fact that the Nets have very reliable role players in Bruce Brown, Blake, and Joe Harris, and you have yourself a ""superteam"" that's very well constructed."
"Just because their big 3 scores a lot doesn’t mean their depth sucks. Joe Harris, Bruce brown, Blake, Jeff green, Claxton and Shamet are all good players."
Never forget Bruce Brown!
"Bruce Brown should not be able to score as well as he does in the paint. Every time I think he can't keep getting away with this, he proves me wrong."
If Bruce Brown was 7 feet tall there wouldn’t be a goat debate
"Last year Bruce brown was a point guard, this year he’s basically a small ball 4 man. The versatility is crazy"
Bruce Brown and KAT look surprisingly similar
IF BRUCE BROWN MADE THAT
Bucks intentionally fucking up on defense to bait bruce brown into the 3.  Genius.
Did Marv just say Chris brown replaced harden instead of Bruce?
Bruce Brown going for 30ppg
Our small ball center will be Bruce Brown and that's only half a joke.
Lol Bruce Brown makes no sense to me as a player
"I think people are really discounting the damage Lopez himself is going to do if the Nets play no true Center.  They won’t have anyone who can guard Giannis or Brook on the inside.  And if you play Clayton and DJ, both those dudes make it easy to play Brook. Heck, even if Bruce Brown is on the court you can play Brook on him like he’s a center."
If you're taking those two solely yeah no question. But then you compare Claxton + Harris or Griffin + Harris to Jackson + Morris and the Clippers have the advantage there. The Clippers don't really play any non elite shooting guards like Bruce Brown either.

"2018 could be top 5 potentially, it's got quality and depth. Ayton, Luka, Trae all have HOF potential. MPJ, SGA, Sexton, JJR, Mitchell Robinson all have all star potential too. Then u got decent role players in both Bridges, Timelord, Divencenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr, Bruce Brown &amp; Shake Milton near the end of the draft. K Nunn and Duncan Robinson went undrafted this year too. Had so much fun with this class in 2kmygm."
"&gt; Some other notable stars who *arent in the playoffs*... Donte DiVenczeno, Bruce Brown,  Their teams are literally about to play each other lol (DiVincenzo is injured now but was starting for the Bucks and Brown has been getting legit minutes for the Nets)"
Bruce Brown should get lots of minutes in that series
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
"&gt; Everyone likes home run hitters, but watch out for the Bucks. SOLID team.  This is both the Nets and Bucks - the Bucks have the reigning 2x MVP. Let's not pretend like they're Pistons-ing their way to the Finals just because they don't have a Big 3.  And the Nets have very good complementary players in Joe Harris, Blake, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green"
I didn't know about Bruce Brown and I love him now
"Damn dude I just had that exact convo with one of my coworkers. I respect all these new nba guys, but not one of them hits like kobe, ai, bron, mj ... not even close. Same with music and movies, where is our james brown? Our Michael Jackson? Our prince? Our whitney houston? Bruce Willis? Denzel? This modern age moves to fast for anyone to have type of longevity.  I dont think its good."
Bruce Brown was only drafted in 2018?? Hes so good
"&gt; Bruce Brown, Trent Jr., Huerter, Lonnie Walker, DiVincenzo, Brunson  Let's be real, Bagley still goes over these guys"
"Luka, Ayton, SGA, Trae, JJJ, MPJ, Bridges, Mitchell Robinson feel like locks above him and Sexton, Bridges no. 2, Bruce Brown, Trent Jr., Huerter, Lonnie Walker, DiVincenzo, Brunson all have cases for being more valuable as NBA players so almost assuredly not. Rip Kangz."
i read bruce brown as bruce bowen and started to have vietnam flashbacks
"That would be true if the Harden trade was made last offseason vs during the season.   Nets lost Dinwiddie to injury and then gutted their depth for Harden.   Brooklyn had 3 open roster spots to fill with players that all 32 teams didn’t want to sign in Free Agency. Sure they got Blake but he’s nowhere near the player he was. Got lucky again with Aldridge and then he retires shortly after due to health reasons.   Nets had 3 open roster spots and they signed Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Alize Johnson. That’s not a plethora of riches once Aldridge retired.   Bucks had the advantage of putting their team together mostly in the offseason when the market still had quality talent in it to sign.   Nets this offseason have some options to build out their roster since they could have anywhere from 2-7 open roster spots.    Dinwiddie is most likely gone since he seems to want a larger role and his first real payday. Nets giving Dinwiddie around $18-20m per year (like he wants) would be like $35m a year when you add in the Luxury Tax.   Hopefully the Nets can work out a Sign and Trade so they can get a Trade Exception like the Celtics did with Hayward since Brooklyn is capped out.   Nets would also have the 2y/$7.4m Bi Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m Tax Mid Level Exception (which can be split I believe) to sign Free Agents this upcoming offseason.   Besides Dinwiddie the Nets also have Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC and Mike James as Free Agents.   I think Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are most likely to stay with Blake Griffin the next on the list. Mike James comes down to his Euro Team and if he’s released since I think Nets could re sign him because he’d be a cheaper backup PG option vs what Dinwiddie would want."
"I'm biased, but I'm with you. Management since Sean Marks and Joe Tsai took over has been top notch, even ignoring free agents wanting to play in NYC.  First off, they drafted Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert back-to-back years in the 20s, traded for players like D'lo and Bruce Brown without giving up assets, signed and developed Dinwiddie and Harris when they were almost out of the league. The reason the Nets had enough draft picks to trade for Harden and the Heat didn't was that the Heat had signed a lot of bad contracts and had to dump assets, something the Nets really never had to do (they did this with Crabbe, but that was only when they knew they were getting Kyrie/KD).  Do they have the advantage of being in NYC? Hell yeah they do. But the Nets had a pathetic reputation a few years after moving to Brooklyn. That only changed when management did."
Fuck it. We need weird shit. Start Bruce Brown as your Giannis stopper.
"Man, Bruce Brown has gotta be one of the best swiss army knives in this league. Dude is just what the doctor ordered for Brooklyn."
Bruce brown is so good man look at him changing the league
"yea, they kind of gutted a solid team to make this work. Like we didn't know Blake was gonna get released and sign there. We also didn't expect before this season that Bruce Brown and Claxton would be serviceable           I really like Jarret Allen and Lavert, I thought Dinwiddie was expendable before he tore his knee up as he is kind of a ball hog and can be inconsistent at times.       I mean it is clearly working but The Nets were a playoff team the last two years one year without both of them and one year without KD and barely any Kyrie"
"Bruce Brown. U might laugh but he’s been solid and the best “bigman” on the Nets besides being 6’4. The Bruce Brown pick and roll is one of the most efficient plays in the NBA. If he’s consistent and also plays good defense on Middleton/Jrue, it’s big for the Nets."
"I like Harden here too, I hope him and Bruce Brown score all the Nets points next series."
Bruce Brown &gt; Marcus Smart
Why do they keep lobbing Bruce Brown passes like he’s prime DeAndre
Bruce Brown vs Giannis is everything nba fans been asking for
kenyon martin jr will essentially become what bruce brown is right now
bruce brown is crazy good under the hoop
Yeah especially because defense takes it out of you on offense. Good luck holding the Big 3 down on the defensive end and then having the energy to do something on offense against guys like Claxton and Bruce Brown and the like going full tryhard.
"Joe Harris ,Bruce Brown, Shamet, and Blake can all score lol. And Jeff Green. Obviously they won’t be called upon a lot to do so but these guys aren’t scrubs. As previously mentioned the real problem will  be in the paint"
"While I get the point you’re trying to make, the nets have basically had zero draft picks.   Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, and Shamet were all either picked up for free or were traded for with minimal assets.   They’re essentially “drafted players” as they were acquired for essentially free as no one else really wanted them."
"Bruce Brown is such a valuable guy when he's a +1 to KD + 3 shooters. He has great touch in the paint and pretty impressive passing instincts for someone who wasn't really a ballhandler at the NBA level. Doesn't make many flubs in a 4v3 short court situation when KD/Harden get doubled up top  Moving forward for the Nets, I think the Bucks-Nets series might be the one between the 2 best teams in the league, or at least the 2 I trust most to eventually win the title. The 2 game series at the end of the year was quite competitive without Harden so we shall see what his addition will do, but I think the winner of that series should be the title favorite.  The Sixers are a really impressive team as well, but I don't think Ben Simmons is reliable enough to contribute offensively, and that team needs 3 out of 4 of Embiid, Harris, Simmons, bench to be cooking to keep pace with Bucks/Nets.  Defensively, I think the 2nd and most of the 3rd quarters show that the Nets can be a solid defense when they need to. The Kyrie 3 to put the Nets up 104-77 came with ~3 min left in the 3rd. Nets only gave up 43 in 21 minutes, which is definitely acceptable considering their offense. The last 50 (!) Celtics points were essentially garbage time after that"
The Bruce Brown switch made possible by Time Lord being hurt. He was swatting all of Bruce's shots early. Now Bruce is more effective
Pretty sure they weren't guarding Bruce Brown
"Biggest adjustment was playing Bruce Brown over Claxton. in G3 doubling Harden and putting the ball in Claxton’s hands to make a play was a great tactic and clearly worked in the Cs favor, this time with Bruce Brown facilitating he was able to burn the Cs.   Rough series man, put up 126 and still wasn’t particularly close, that offense is dummy. Even so I think just the fact that the Cs have made the Nets bleed would be pretty encouraging if I’m a Bucks/Sixers/Hox/whoever fan"
Did Bruce Brown die?
"As fun as the Nets are to watch I can’t help but feel like they might lose to the Bucks, especially with the way Milwaukee is playing right now. Jrue can make Kyrie uncomfortable, Giannis can do the same to KD, and Middleton won’t be completely lit up by Harden. On the other end the Nets have nobody that can match up with Giannis. Claxton isn’t strong enough, Jordan is too slow, Bruce Brown is too short. No clue how they stop Giannis"
"Our center, Bruce Brown, is 6'4""."
He’s no Bruce Brown
Boston is only like 1.5 additional Jayson Tatum’s away from making this a series.  Bruce Brown was the best Center in this game.
KD Kyrie and Harden have played like 7 games together they need to build chemistry. Also looks like he’s trying out Bruce Brown instead of Blake in this lineup
Bruce Brown length
Bruce Brown the god
Is Bruce Brown playing PF lmao?
Kyrie and Bruce Brown combined have one less rebound than the Celtics starting 5
Are.. are you thinking about bruce brown? Sterling Brown isnt even in this conference
thats bruce brown bro. sterling brown is on the rockets
Bruce Brown
Bruce brown having a field day in the middle
You leave Bruce Brown or Blake Griffin open
"Brown is boston native native lol. I can easily see Bruce going to play for the celtics if the Nets dont pay him what he wants, especially if they win the chip   I dont see nets keeping him after this season tbh"
looked like Bruce Brown and Tristan
Bruce Brown defies all logic by being this good of a screener lmao
man i love bruce brown. dude is a competitor.
"When Bruce Brown starts hitting skyhooks, you’re in trouble"
Your “second unit” rn has 2 starters out there lmao what  I’d love to see Shamet Tyler Johnson Bruce Brown and claxton hang with the worst starting lineup int he league lmao
"You're telling me Bruce ""Jordan"" Brown isnt gonna contuine taking 6 shots at the end of a game and go 0/6 again?"
"They should not be feeling good about game 3 despite the win. There are so much work for them to do. Their offense is abysmal, the Nets more specially Joe Harris missed a lot of open shots and Giannis didn’t exactly have a great closing quarter down the stretch. And fucking Bruce brown was killing them with floater for 5 straight possessions.."
I understand being cautious. But y’all came back in the game only lost because Bruce Brown made a boneheaded play.
"Its only ridiculous if harden was playing, but he's not.  Its 100% true otherwise... unless you think a backcourt of kyrie irving and bruce brown is better than booker and CP3.  And even if harden was playing, this statement isn't that crazy, you can always argue that they are *playing* better, even if the perception isn't that they are better."
"Did you see how Blake, Bruce Brown and Harris are playing rn? (Claxton included, but he's really young still and just too thin to guard Giannis) These guys are better than KCP and Kuzma, and Harris might be the best role player in the league. Don't mention Kuzma in the same breath as them, they actually do stuff in the playoffs. Bruce Brown played exceptionally well except for that one play down the stretch in game 3, but he's a very solid starter for them. (I don't hate Kuz bc he underperformed, he's just in a weird spot and still young, but it's obvious that he isn't on the level of these guys rn, just to make that clear)"
"As long as Bruce Brown has the ball during crunch time, yes."
"Yeah I figured there would be a few other really good candidates.  The Nets front office has made amazing moves even if we ignore the big 3 signings.  Guys like Mike James from euroleague, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, TLC, etc.  I just found out that Marks retired as a player only 10 years ago too.  This new generation of front office guys are killing it."
He did in the 4th I think and by giving Bruce brown the confidence in the 2nd he took some wild shots towards the end of the game. It was a strategy that was so bad it came all the way around and stopped in the ok range
"The casuals really come around this time of year. It was clearly a broken play my guy, no Nash did not intend for Bruce Brown, a guy who can't shoot, to take the last shot while having two of the best scorers in the world on the same team."
"I was about to say bruce bowen and mike jones, but i remembered the brown guy but couldn’t remember the mike guy’s name"
"&gt;Blake was a freebie, but Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Claxton, the guy who looks like Fred VanVleet are all good players that most capped out teams wouldn’t be able to have.  What do you mean other teams wouldn't be able to have them? The Nets didn't do anything illegal to acquire their team"
"Bruce Brown is going to dominate with them, new big 3. KD is such a good teammate, drove him to the airport right after last night's game."
Or Bruce Brown
Don't see Bruce brown on this list
"Bucks are beating a team with a starting lineup of Kyrie, Mike James, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin."
"fall back to normal. he had that 8 point run in the first half lmao, i was just watching like how tf is bruce brown the top option rn on a team with BG KD and kyrie"
"Idk why but I'm imagining that KD treats this guy like Chappelle as P. Diddy did in the making the band skit. Just has him around constantly to do the most menial shit. KD shooting at his home gym this dude sometimes getting the boards to pass back. Or if KD need a partner then he tying up his and KD's shoes and play that 1V1.   KD just be driving on him then say ""how the fuck you gonna protect me when you can't even protect the rim""  Watch the NBA come out and say he isn't allowed court side and has to wait in the tunnels. All of sudden Bruce Brown gonna be replaced in the lineup."
He pushed PJ Tucker and Bruce Brown
What about Bruce Brown? Elite big man
He shoved PJ all the way into Bruce brown what are you on lol
OP is clearly a KD hater and just covering his bases in case the nets win the finals without Harden. NO NO NO THIS ONE DOESN'T COUNT EITHER! CLOSE TO IDEAL SPACING. CAN'T LEAVE BRUCE BROWN OPEN.
He pushed PJ in order to get in between him and KD the same way that Bruce Brown and Jrue Holiday did. He was more aggressive about it but he also shut down the confrontation immediately. Once the bodyguard got there PJ immediately went into “hold me back” mode but directed at the guard instead of KD. Isn’t that the job?
Nets played the worst game they have all season according to the numbers and they still could've won if Bruce Brown didn't take all the shots down the stretch
"If you’re going to suspend KD and Nash you might as well suspend Kyrie, Harris, Bruce Brown and Harden (just to be safe). It only seems fair"
"Again, Bruce Brown has a higher TS% in this current series vs. the Bucks.  And just because they go in sometimes doesn't mean they aren't bad shots.  You can drink &amp; drive, if you made it home without killing anyone does that make it as good of a decision as calling an uber?"
"Kyrie actually has some of the worst shot selection in the league.  He's a great bad-shot maker but he still barfs up a lot of mid-range Js, early shot clock 3s and goes out of his way to avoid contact at the rim which frequently makes his finishes harder than they need to be.  Everyone is so enamored with his handles that they just ignore the misses &amp; poor decisions.  His TS% in this Bucks/Nets series is below Bruce Brown."
"No, Giannis can do so much more than Dwight.  And the fact is he did a lot of that last night.  He was the best player on the floor that game despite tons of fuck ups.  The biggest issue was the fact he's either completely clueless about the help defense on him, and/or he's not being coached in how to handle those situations.  How many times did he dribble into the lane and lose the ball/get stuck on a Bruce Brown double?  Why the fuck is the Bucks plan not to have Giannis dribble in and pass?  Like Middleton will be open like have the time is Giannis quick on that pass.  Either a nice 3P shot or scrambling roations."
Bruce Brown ate all the fully loaded nachos
I literally said “if this turns into a middleton vs kd 1v1 the bucks lose”  And then 3 of the final four shots went to harris and bruce brown
Bruce Brown is my new favorite player
"Bruce ""Brown Bruce"" Brown was pretty dope. Surprised to not see him on this list."
KD acted as a decoy both of those last possessions and wasn’t even active but people wanna blame Bruce Brown for missing a good looking floater doesn’t sit right with me
Bruce brown got the ball near the end because the bucks disrupted the inbounds play. Be glad that it didn’t turn out worse.
Durant didn't play well in the 1st half. Joe Harris is due for a 3-points made explosion. Bruce Brown had his most impactful playoff game yet. He made the bucks work. ... The Nets should feel really good going into Game 4.  &amp;#x200B;  There you go I fixed it!
"If Bruce Brown doesnt make two critical boneheaded plays, KD and the Nets probably win that game."
Bruce Brown gonna run on the court like a fan and miss a layup
Bruce brown is a beast and I wont let you slander him. Yea he made some bad decisions that ultimately costed us but he was excellent all game and kept us in it while also being a 6’4 paint presence lmao. If he’s a scrub then what are you? Holy cow don’t even answer
Bruce Brown was the MVP for the bucks
31 pts in 152 minutes for guys who aren't KD or Kyrie.  15 points in 114 minutes if include Bruce Brown (who probably should have a smaller role in the offense moving forward.
"So much Bruce Brown in the clutch.  He's really good at a lot of the little things, screening, help defense, boxing out, but he's at least as bad at creating offense with the ball in his hands.  This team getting Harden back is terrifying."
Bruce brown played like shit in the 4th
"Brooklyn also shot horribly and were deferring to Bruce Brown in clutch moments, so there's that."
Like I get that as a shooter your going to shoot that open shot but when they don’t fall drive damm it. I know that when joe drives he actually looks for contact unlike Bruce brown doing the only two floaters he has in his arsenal
Blame Bud. No reason for brook to be out at the 3 point line with Bruce brown at center.
"I usually never watch games, since the time difference is too big but for this game I decided to watch it, since the stakes were so high.  Needless to say, Milwaukee was ass. Giannis may have put up 30+ but some of the shots he was taking were just awful. Every time he pulled up for a three, I cringed. The only bright spot for them in this game was Middleton and god knows what's up with Jrue Holiday on offense. This is probably the luckiest win I have ever witnessed, and it basically took KD to have his worst game ever for the nets, alongside bruce brown and harris just bricking every shot imaginable."
"They were literally trapping Kyrie from 30 feet out, Bruce passing to Kyrie would just burn the clock and bog down the offense, the driving lane was there and it was the right play to try to beat Brook Lopez to the spot (ideally you would want Brown to kick it out to Harris but Brown is not that type of passer), if there is one person blame it is Steve Nash or Dantoni for not being able to make a good inbound play to get one of their stars a good shot, contrast to Bud who , drafted a really good ATO play to get Middleton open."
Bruce Brown rip. Lost my Benjamin on Nets ML in the worst way. Dude open pick and pop shots from 5 ft without a prayer of going in
Yeah for the last quarter he wasn't bad but for the first 3 quarters he was terrible. He got outplayed at the center by Bruce Brown.
Bruce Brown been watching too much Draymond Green with that last shot attempt.
I love how this one game single handedly made Bruce Brown the laughingstock of r/NBA for atleast the rest of the series
[What Bruce Brown was thinking.](https://i.imgur.com/CtnoY75.jpg)
"Bruce Brown is on the Nets, think you are mixing up the two games lol"
"This is what I was thinking.  I didn’t get to watch the game but Twitter was going nuts so I had to watch this play.  If this was drawn up out of a timeout that’s a really shitty inbound play.  The defensive pressure was close to Kyrie and he was virtually unreachable cause of his cut.  KD was standing in the corner and shifts a bit on the perimeter but Brown probably liked his chances on a layup more than a three given the score.  Plus that would be a risky pass too if he can’t gather quickly enough.    The finish was pretty bad but the whole narrative being pushed rn is that he ignored KD and Kyrie.  Like the top tweet on the topic is literally “Bruce Brown looked at KD and looked at Kyrie then bricked a layup”.  Reading that, I thought he was sizing up the defender and attempted iso.  Literally not what happened at all.  NBA twitter is so fucked."
"kawhi clearly was not solely intent on taking final shots. he just passed if someone was kinda open or if he was kinda maybe in trouble. was strange to me. either you're set on taking the clutch shots b/c you're clearly the best player out there, or you're probably running a play to get someone open or a clear look. but instead it just came down to Bruce Brown driving a bit recklessly and tossing contested floaters. Kawhi absolutely could've taken those shots if he was adamant about it. he never seems to call for the ball or seem to care much if the ball doesnt end up in his hands in the clutch."
Bruce Brown pulled a Carlton and tried to take the shine…
bruce brown iso
"bruce brown, you’re not that guy pal"
"To be fair Nets didn’t play in the first quarter, and Kyrie was missing from action all game long.  It was Kd and Bruce “kwame” brown vs the Bucks"
Durant was pretty bad tonight though.  Bruce Brown had a like a 5 minute stretch in the 4th where he took 5 or 6 bad shots or something along those lines.  Durant spent 3 whole quarters jacking up 19 shots and only making 6.  It's weird how Giannis is getting shit on for his game but very few people are saying much about Durant who played just as bad.
Yeah that’s cool &amp; all but Bruce Brown completely choked
"In the 2Q, Bruce Brown was hitting nearly every shot he took. I thought it was Harden out there"
Pat Bev feeling like Bruce Brown
Reggie “Bruce ‘Kevin Durant’ Brown” Jackson
Everyone knows because opponent coaching staffs made the officials aware of it then the media took off with it. If it was someone like Bruce Brown or Payton Pritchard then no one would have any idea it’s even happening. He’s been doing it for 3-4 months now and it’s only been a story for *maybe* half that time.
"Bruce ""Norman Powell/Bucks Killer"" Brown"
"17 players touched the floor, 12 of them scored a total of 33 points and the other five scored 136. I don’t know why this seems so odd to me.  I still don’t know who Bruce Brown is, but he’s one of the five."
Nah keep em rested Bruce Brown sold
Bruce Brown is the bucks sleeper agent
"You can take the brown out of Bruce, but not the Bruce out of Brown."
"My biggest problem isn't even us running ISO tbh. I understand it at least (almost) ensures you aren't gonna turn the ball over. What I don't get is  1. That zone he ran in game 2, during which we got torched - we gave up so many open threes to elite shooters 2. How many times does Bruce Brown need to make an uncontested floater / layup for him to call a timeout and ask Brook to stop giving these up and contest them. Happened like 5 times in a row and he made 4 or 5 of them 3. Why he doesn't call a timeout the moment Giannis takes a transition 3 and tell him to fucking stop this shit and only do it if we can't run a better play - after all, Giannis can take an open 3 anytime 4. Why don't we run Jrue - Giannis PnRs? I remember Jrue and AD PnR being deadly and Giannis can roll / catch a lob just as well 5. Why doesn't he play a Giannis - Tucker lineup that can double team KD and runs drop coverage with Lopez against a team with elite shooters 6. Why do Pat and Forbes look bored / gassed on offense? I miss Donte."
That was **two** Bruce Brown fuckups from going in.
"Yeah, he was very good in the second half. Makes me wonder why he didn't contest these floaters / layups in the first half. I mean, is it him playing bad defense or is our drop coverage supposed to actually give up even shots like these?  I wanted to run my head through the wall watching Bruce Brown destroy us."
"Bucks didn’t win, Nets lost. Complete garbage offense from what should be the most elite team. Also Bruce Brown? Wtf?"
Jalen with perfect Bruce brown analogy
He absolutely did not make the right play. Can’t tell if you legit believe what you’re typing or you’re trolling. You’re the Bruce brown of Reddit comments
Another amazing Bruce Brown 4th Q highlight.....
Bruce brown lived long enough to see himself become the villain
"I mean, we can discuss hypotheticals all day but when it's all said and done, Bruce Brown should not be tasked with the game winning shot when Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, or even Blake Griffin are on the floor.  Not discrediting the defense but this was not a smart play on offense."
Shooters will shoot though. Guys that were cold the whole game make important shots all the time. It was at least a better chance than a Bruce Brown contested layup.
"He was literally giving up open layups to Bruce fucking Brown without even contesting, which is what allowed them to turn the game around and get the lead.  He was very good in the 2nd half though."
The forgettable Bruce Brown floaters
Bruce Brown took way too many shots late in the 4th.  Not just the last one.  Unreal.
The Marcus Smart effect is alive tonight.   It is simply about the dangers of giving a role player confidence in his own abilities.   Bruce Brown thought he was elite after starting the game 6-10. Now Cousins thinks he is 23 years old because he has 6 points.
Bruce Brown and Boogie Cousins. Nothing says playoff basketball like these teo
"DeMarcus ""more irrationally confident than Bruce Brown"" Cousins"
Don't forget the shit Bruce Brown pulled near the end.
I disagree - both team played great defense. Other than Giannis taking three pointers and fucking Bruce Brown
1) Bruce  2) Brown
He was open in the corner on that drive but idk if Bruce brown has vision like that
"Bruce Brown nearly won them the game, but the stat early in the game on how many minutes he was playing turned out to be foreshadowing.  This was most obvious on a defensive rebound in the 4th where Brown very clearly cramped up in his thigh and promptly missed his first floater.  May have been what threw his rhythm off and ultimately what keeps us from talking about this as the ""Bruce Brown"" game."
Bruce Brown lmao
"To be fair, Bruce Brown got the Nets back in the game in the 2nd quarter with 12 straight points on floaters."
"We're living in a Bruce Brown world, and I am a material girl."
"This would have never happened if Harden was on floor. Also Bruce Brown may be an even worse shooter than Giannis, the guy never takes the open jumper."
And Bruce brown to take 2 of the last 3
"Way too much Bruce Brown slander, he was the only reason Nets even got back in the game in the 2nd qtr. dude was making huge hustle plays on D all night too"
"I only halfway follow the NBA and was only halfway watching the game until the end of the 4th, but I can firmly conclude Bruce Brown sucks."
Bucks legend Bruce Brown
the first bruce brown floater is at least his shot. that final drive was just crazy by him
"Bruce Brown right now is the living embodiment of ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain”  He's been scapegoated for the loss because he took the final shots when his 2nd quarter play is the only reason the Nets got back into it. Joe Harris selling is the main reason they lost &amp; KD/Kyrie didn't exactly have stellar games either."
I’m more scared of the Bruce Brown floater than a Kevin Durant 3 attempt
no disrespect but how is bruce brown in the league with that skillset at that height?
Game 7. Where the greats show up and create their legacys. Bruce Brown vs Pat Connaughton

"So he's a better Bruce Brown? Nice, Brown better drop 39 pts TN"
Is Bruce Brown in the league because of that push shot
Is this the Bruce Brown game part 2?
"Don’t mind the Bruce Brown slander though, all for that."
The post right below you shows an awful technical on Bruce brown. Enough with the 'rigged' nonsense.
Giannis looses Bruce brown on a simple cut. Come on that’s weak.
it's really hilarious how bruce brown is really the center for the nets
bruce brown attracting technical foul energy
Is it just me or is Bruce Brown really bad? Every time he has my attention he does something dumb. His basketball instincts are terrible

You never know how a Bruce Brown play is gonna end that’s what makes it fun
I can’t be the only one that doesn’t understand why Bruce Brown is still playing in this series.....
Tf is Bruce Brown doing. Just go up with it
Fuckin Bruce Brown
It really could have been avoided if the nets didn’t let Bruce brown didn’t do stupid stuff in the clutch and if joe Harris didn’t play ass in game 3
"Nah very different, Bruce brown ain't going 7/10 from three"
Yeah it was crazy. Bruce Brown dropped 40 and then at the end of the game took his mask off to reveal he was Kyrie the whole time.
Bruce Brown
"Yeah, unless Bruce Brown &amp; Shamet combine for 60+ points, theres no way it will be as embarrassing."
"How come Portland keeps missing on the players that fills the gap like: Terrence Mann, Bruce Brown, Juan Toscano Anderson, Jaesean Tate.. they’re out there!"
Ben Simmons is a 6 foot ten Bruce brown and I’m not afraid to say it
It's ok I'm already preparing for a Bruce brown floater from half court to be the game winning shot
"Nah, it won't be a KD game winner.  Bruce Brown will somehow redeem himself for his game 3 miss with some crazy kinda crazy fadeaway jump shot"
"Bruce Brown tocrhed us with Lopez playing twice. What have you been watching? Did you watch game 3? Bruce Brown TORCHED Lopez in the paint. And yeah, I'll take that all day if it means we can guard KD better.  The Nets are not winning the game if KD isn't efficient. The difference Portis on Brown instead of Lopez on Brown would make is so small, it's just laughable to argue it's preferable to play drop coverage against KD because of Bruce fucking Brown who is 6'4''."
"&gt;Now I have absolutely no clue why Lopez is starting since he doesn't even post up Bruce Brown and is used as a 3pt.  Lol you mean other than providing rim protection, because Portis is just open season to that and its not like Portis will provid any better defense on a player that conisittly makes contested 3 because of their shot release.  &gt;but the Nets are a jump shooting team, not a team that needs to score in the paint to beat you.  You do understand that a team that is able to penetrate and threatens the paint automatically opens up jump shooters right with the kick out right????  I mean congrats you realized Giannis is not the best at navigating picks, but thats pretty much the only thing you got right with your ""analysis""  TLDR: peek r/nba type post"
Backup at the 5 for Bruce Brown?
"Now I have absolutely no clue why Lopez is starting since he doesn't even post up Bruce Brown and is used as a 3pt. shooter while the Nets torch us from the perimeter. Portis is a better shooter who can switch / trap / help (not very good at any of these, but better than having to play Lopez) on that screen and didn't play a single minute last game. Lopez should play much less and should be used as a traditional center on offense - you can't let the Nets get away with Bruce Brown guarding your center.  This the only part I don't understand not only has Brown guarded him out of the Nets base defense but time after time Harden, Harris, even Kyrie early in the series would switch onto Lopez and it was like never even a thought to go to him.  I would've thought Lopez would play less with the starters and more with the bench and have the second unit play through him a lot knowing he's gonna have a favorable matchup but Bud is still mostly playing him with the starters, most notably Giannis.   Particularly with this matchup where the Nets don't have a big man they're gonna look to feed in the post themselves like an Embiid you'd think they'd play a smaller lineup that can switch and scramble more easily.   Maybe Bud is worried about his team panicking to a big change he makes but after getting killed last postseason for their lack of adjustments I would've thought it was something he would have prepared his team for."
"Kid Tony Parker, Bruce Brown and Old David Robinson were starters. Thats not remotely close to ""most carried superstars of all Time"" especially when people like KD that joined a 72 wins teams are out there."
"Man it's injured James Harden, Bruce Brown and *Blake Griffin* out there. You can't score on that."
"I still think you guys have a chance.  Bruce Brown has been completely useless. Joe Harris can't throw a rock into an ocean. Harden is playing on one leg.   But then I keep on remembering you guys completely botched game 5, and I cannot say you're the favorite unfortunately."
"Jeff Green was hurt until game 4 and was ok but blowout loss, insane in game 5 yea but terrible tn  Bruce Brown didn't really do much iirc other than that one open 3 he nailed  Claxton is just not ready he gets bodied too hard. Hopefully the Nets this offseason get a good defensive FA to help ease the load off him Green and Blake"
Shamet. Green. Bruce Brown. The ball movement in the first two games was so much better than today. It created a handful of shots for claxton and Griffin. Wtf happened to all that?
The only role player who is shooting poorly this series is Joe Harris. Jeff Green is doing bad this game and Bruce Brown had that one poor decision on game 3. Shamet needs to get more kick outs and corner 3 opportunities. Claxton should have been experimented with more.
"Why KD gotta look like that when he lose? Makes me think he's gonna tamper another star to be on his team. He's trading Bruce brown, shamet for kawhi or some shit."
Has Bruce Brown been that bad? He went from playing like 30 minutes to just 5 this game. Feel like that floater in the paint would still be there for him.
Try Bruce Brown again. Sit Harris
Bruce Brown as well who hasn’t been too bad. Too bad none of them still play for the Pistons
This is the game they will think of when Bruce Brown goes into Naismith
Even Bruce Brown shooting better than Harris.
Hiw is Bruce brown pushing holiday into hard a foul on holiday?
If Bruce brown is hitting threes nothing you can do lmao
Stretch 5 Bruce brown
Bruce Brown shootin 3’s?
"Aside from Harris bricks, Bruce brown floaters are the worst part of the Nets offense"
Why don't they play bruce brown instead of harris  harris isnt even shooting and at least bruce can get some shots in the paint
Another legacy game for Bruce Brown imo
"When playing KD you don't hope to contain him, this is impossible. Instead you hope that he gets the lowest % shot possible for him.  KD shooting a long 2 or a 3 with a hand on his face is a much better alternative than what the Bucks currently do, i.e. Tucker making late contests because in case he switches then Lopez is on KD , which means an open shot for KD (never contests in time, too slow).  Putting Giannis on Bruce Brown means that he does not get an easy two inside , so he is forced to shoot tough 2s or 3s outside. Currently he is having way too many easy looks from 15-20ft that's way too close for comfort if we are talking late contests or no contest (when Tucker completely loses him)  Everybody and his dog knew that once the refs stop allowing Tucker's rough play KD would feast on single coverage all the way through (no switches)... Which is exactly what he did. He is born to do that..."
Heres the point. If giannis is covering bruce brown and lopez is on harris then joe harris will set the screen and not bruce brown. IF thats the case they'll probabl also just have bruce brown set a screen for harris to get wide open 3s that way.
"Yes, they have to play Pat then instead of Donte (who really was an important piece) but it's still way better than letting KD shoot wide open jumpers with no one in front of him all game. The Nets just ran the Bruce Brown P&amp;R all game and abused drop coverage  Having Giannis at 5 allows them to be better at switching too, so even if the Nets try to get Pat onto KD the Bucks can trap KD up top and recover quickly  The Bucks have mad objectively bad decisions."
Bruce Brown.  But that’s probably just because he reminds me of Roald from Letterkenny sometimes.
"Honestly buds dumbass coaching really soured me in game 5; they deserve to lose for moronic decisions I.e not even trying to put giannis on KD, attacking harden, not posting Lopez when fucking BRUCE BROWN is guarding him. Just stupid"
As a Nets fan I’m already blessed but I can’t help but imagine a starting line up of Kyrie/harden/Durant/Allen w Bruce brown/joe Harris/Jeff green as the fifth man
"As a nets fan, I would take Bruce Brown any day of the week rather than Ben"
Gobert would stand no chance against bruce brown at center
"Lots of people thought this would be a competitive series, even the Nets being fully healthy. People thought the Bucks matched up very well, and they get proceed to get blown out against the Nets with no harden   Now the Nets are struggling to stay on the court, and they still dropped a game to them. It’s KD but the support casting is worlds apart  Literally Jrue, Middleton, Lopez, PJ vs Blake, Jeff green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown"
"???? His rep was ruined because Russ and the whole thunder seemed to take issue with him. Russ is 6886 times more popular, people mostly went with that.   On the pistons, he led the league in 4th quarter scoring one year and was a legit good player. The whole time, people shit on him for being a toxic ballhog that wanted “John wall money” even though he was playing excellently.   Then he got had a year or two heavily affected by injuries. Nobody watched the pistons, that’s why he, Marcus Morris, and Bruce brown were all pretty underrated immediately after leaving and are all performing well in the playoffs."
They have to pay both blake and bruce brown so probably not
For Nets Bruce Brown has technically been starting with Harden out. Started 2nd half of game 1 and game 2.
Bruce Brown has incredible touch around the hoop. At this point I expect almost every hook/push/floater shot of his to go in. I've been a big fan of his game this year
KD about to make some calls. Welcome to Brooklyn. Perfect roll man small ball. Bruce Brown/Blake minutes.
"Jrue and Middleton aren't doing nearly enough either  they have 5 free throw attempts combined in 2 games, that's the same number as Bruce Brown and Nic Claxton"
Inb4 Ben Taylor makes a 12 part series on the gravity of Bruce Brown
And Bruce Brown! Plus you have to assume DJ is doing his part inventing special handshakes for everyone on the bench.  The only thing that can stop them is a KD injury.
You can't not love Bruce Brown.
"&gt;less depth   Oh no!!! They only have Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Claxton, Jeff Green, and Shamet! How will they ever survive??  Harden has been injured for 2 games. If you wanna crown them for being up 2-0 on a perennially shit playoff team, go ahead. They haven’t done anything yet. 4 games with Harden, 2 without and y’all already want to say this is the hard road for Brooklyn lol."
"The depth roles of Mike James Harden, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Shamet, Claxton are too much for any team. The Nets are truly unmatched this year."
"Most of us fuckin' love Bruce Brown. I don't care what it says on the front of his jersey, that dude is pure Detroit."
Bruce Brown*
"We'll disagree on their overall passing ability, not that it matters that much.  I think you misunderstand my point, I'm not defending Bledsoe. But he didn't even play game 1 against the Heat and they still looked bad. Bledsoe going from good starting guard to trash in the playoffs was a problem for sure, Middleton going from legit all star to just good was a problem for sure : but IMO Giannis going from uncontested MVP to borderline all NBA level is a much bigger problem for me.  Like if you don't want Ariza and Bruce Brown take Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris : if those 2 have bad series, but Jimmy/KD underperform, I doubt you'd put the blame on the role players because yes Bledsoe was a role player, Middleton and Lopez were 2/3, and both of those guys were good enough against Miami for them to win if Giannis played like an MVP.  I didn't blame him one bit for the Toronto series, this was a nasty defensive team, one of the most underrated in history because of how the finals went, so if you want to exclude that one fine.  But that's now two years in a row in which Giannis isn't an MVP against two decent defenses, two years in a row when he doesn't look like the best player in a series, and yeah that Bucks team isn't a superteam, they need Giannis to be the best player in a series to win it"
What is interesting is who will get the finals MVP maybe Bruce Brown
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZn0M-c8cTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZn0M-c8cTA)  I've never seen Middleton pass like this. You're really wrong on this, Giannis is a really good passer. Rarely turns the ball over on passes unlike Middleton who can't even throw good lobs and is just above average.  Hindsight man, those Celtics were supposed to be better than us. The fact they lost doesn't change that.  Bledsoe was their #3, Ariza and Bruce Brown could barely play and nobody would care much, are you really comparing these cases? Come on man. Bledsoe had a NEGATIVE bpm in his 3 postseason with the Bucks LMAO. And a below average PER, below average WS/48, waaaay below average TS% (49%...). I remember watching the Bucks - Raptors ECF and Bledsoe's defender was doubling Giannis at the three point line!! You bet he's to blame more than Giannis. No team could possibly win with him as their starting PG and #3 option."
"Giannis wasnt a better passer no.he had crazy gravity and made easy reads one pass away he just added steam on his skip passes and more complicated reads this year and still isnt better. And no that Celtics team that was self destructing with Kyrie trying to pick up Giannis and Middleton on purpose for no reason wasnt an elite team at all.  And Im not saying Bledsoe wasnt to blame. Im saying its funny that he is to blame more than Giannis. Its like saying Ariza was more to blame than Jimmy when you lost to the Bucks. If the Nets loses a series and Kd undeperformed will you say ""well actually Bruce Brown was awful its his fault"" ?"
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
"This version of the Nets is not and they’re getting taken to the trash. Their top 5 players thus fair have been KD, Kyrie, Harris, Griffin, James. Mike James. Or Bruce brown depending on who you ask. Either way, the Bucks should not be losing by a total differential of 50+ to this team."
Bruce Brown has been a straight up revelation. That hustle is unbelievable.
Cmon man we got Bruce Brown too we ain't that bad
"Bruce brown is the prime example LMAO kyrie, kd and joe too   They don’t live and die on their 3’s, if anything it’s always been about rebounding"
Claxton and Bruce Brown were second round picks and Mike James came on a 10-day contract.  These are all good role players who contribute because of Nash's coaching. Even Kyrie and KD who people say are ball stoppers have bought in to his ball-sharing offense and playing great team defense.
"Look at Nets bench warmers that are torching the Bucks. Bruce Brown, Claxton etc. You can't tell me these guys are legit playoff caliber people. They're both sophmores."
His use of Bruce Brown is honestly pretty smart.  I don't know many coaches who would think to use a 6'4'' guard as a roll man.
"Their ball movement is beautiful, having superstars makes life easier but getting the most out of the Joe Harris, Mike James, Bruce Brown, BG, Claxton &amp; Jeff Greens of the world is impressive. And getting them to lock in defensively is worth noting. Even Kyrie is getting after it"
"The role players stay involved and are a huge part of the offense. Mike James, BG, Bruce Brown, Shamet and Harris all get tons of looks."
"Oh^(,) Donnie Nelson.  I get your comment now, my bad.  I thought you were referring to Bruce Brown instead of Sean Marks."
"Giannis also gave up an offensive board to Bruce Brown as he was actively boxing him out, which was really weird.  Brown just jumped over him and grabbed the board."
Bruce Brown is awesome
Bruce Brown for a 2nd and Musa too.
"I literally paid 300 bucks to watch Bruce fucking Brown outplay the 2-time reigning MVP, joke's on me I guess"
"KD, Blake, Bruce Brown, and TLC. Sorted."
"Bucks deserve some hate but let’s give the Nets SOME credit. Shout out to:  Kyrie Irving for showing everybody that next step he’s taken to a bonafide star.  Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James for being those role players off the bench playing great minutes and filling in on the offense without losing a step.  The bench unit for stomping on the Bucks bench unit in garbage time.  Steve Nash for having these guys all play up to their potentials and play good basketball. And good defense."
"No Harden. Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James all putting in good minutes. Defense has taken a 180 since the beginning of the season. Kyrie has taken a step forward and is playing the best basketball of his career. But y’all will say anything except give anybody on the team, including Nash, any credit at all."
"Shout out to:  Kyrie Irving for showing everybody that next step he’s taken to a bonafide star.

You can't play drop against the Nets with KD and Kyrie.  Bruce Brown is also destroying it with his floaters.
Playing giannis at 5 is probably the best but if brook must play then just have him switch and whoever is on Bruce brown can just sit in the paint basically. Brooks gonna get beat but that’s better than open middies and threes from kd and kyrie  Obviously who knows if it’s better but doing the same thing year after year is ridiculous
"yeah the Nets superteam of Blake, Bruce Brown, and a Deron Williams impersonator"
bruce brown just has that one floater in his arsenal but man does it go in every time lmao
Bucks getting clowned by Bruce Brown. Holy shit.
"Giannis is glorified Bruce Brown, don’t care what you say"
Nets fans bout to come in here and ask us   Have you considered Bruce Brown
Wild that Bruce brown can pass up wide open 3s because they’re guaranteed a good shot
That Bruce Brown rebound was such a defensive meltdown from the Bucks. You can't be doing that.
How does Bruce Brown get a rebound over a Giannis that is actively boxing him out?  Just seems lazy by Giannis.
Bruce Brown grabs his own rebound after missing a floater in the paint ...   Nets in 4
Bruce Brown is a more effective center than Porzingis
we'd be nowhere w/o bruce brown and blake
How Giannis lost a Box Out to Bruce Brown man
Lol Bruce Brown outjumping Giannis
Bruce brown just beat out Giannis on a rebound. Lmfao.
"Bruce Brown, Griffin, Jackson, D-Rose all eating this playoffs. Detroit in shambles"
I love Bruce Brown. When we had no frontcourt depth earlier in the year he reinvented his game into a role that didn't exist before (opposite of point forward?). Now he's so comfortable finishing around trees in the lane and is a much better passer out of the role than any big man. He deserves a ton of credit for changing his game up to fit the team
Isn't Bruce Brown a FA this year
don’t disrespect Bruce Brown like that
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown is the zone killer. He's so good in that in between area
"People talk about the Nets like they have an abysmal defense, it's just not true. Yeah, Bam is a much better defender than Blake, but the Nets as a whole play solid team defense and when they get out running it is really hard to keep up with them, which in turn makes their defense even stronger.   Kyrie is a negative defender, and Harden is at times at well, but KD is excellent on D, as are Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, and Nic Claxton. The Nets are ***NOT*** the ""Twice the offense, half the defense"" team that a lot of the media and casual fans have built them up to be."
Bruce Brown and Porzingis should switch bodies. They play like each other’s height
Nets would be worse with Harden playing. Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are much better fits.
Mike James and Bruce Brown torching this Bucks’ Zone D is quite a sight
"Can't blame Bud, Bucks just don't have the personnel to stop a Bruce Brown floater"
 Bruce Brown&gt;Bryn Forbes&gt;Jimmy Butler
BRUCE BROWN IS PLAYING CENTER BTW
we got bruce brown for nothing .. literally. we gave the pistons a guy that isnt even the nba anymore.   mike james ... found him somewhere in moscow.
Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown is outplaying the entire Bucks team lmfao
Bruce brown has never missed a floater
Bruce Brown and Mike James are just absurd roster finds for a team that really didn’t need any luck with finding roster gems 😂
I am once again asking how the Pistons gave up Bruce brown for nothing
I swear Bruce Brown shoots 100 percent from shots within 10 feet
"Yeah. Bruce Brown Matt James, and Blake Griffin should not be playing better than Middleton and Jrue"
"our gm is very very good. Obviously the stars joining us helps but his ability to find diamonds in the rough is crazy. Levert,allen were late rounders. Joe harris signed of the PS. Mike james getting signed from europe. Bruce brown.   Yep. We good"
"Not being able to stop KD and Kyrie is bad but understandable, not being able to stop Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin is taps."
Bruce Brown is like a poor man's Westbrook and I love it
BRUCE BROWN IS COOKING THIS BUCKS TEAM THATS ALL YOU GOTTA KNOW LOL
Who needs Harden when you have Bruce Brown
"Imagine you're the reigning MVP, and Bruce Brown is outscoring you...this is just embarrassing, I can't believe I'm paying to watch this at Barclay's LOL"
Bruce brown a dog
Sorry Jokic but Bruce Brown is the real MVP
This guy Bruce Brown is amazing1
Bruce brown hitting threes = it's over
Bruce Brown yappin every time
Bruce Brown isn’t a star but I’d fucking love him on my team
"Nah, I want to see who shines the most to win the finals MVP, KD or Bruce Brown"
Even Bruce Brown is raining 3s on the Bucks lmao. Fuckin frauds.
the funny thing is the bucks they'd still lose if KD and Kyrie got injured. Bruce Brown cooking them lmao
The Bucks got Bruce Brown and Mike James out there lookin like Igouadala and Livingston
"I love Bruce Brown, sexually too."
Why is Bruce brown playing so much? They nets should’ve just got Bradley Beal mid season
"Bruce ""6'27"" Brown"
Man how good is Bruce Brown? Have no idea how a guy his size can be so good inside
 Bruce Brown punking Giannis on a floater is the funniest thing. Dude looked at him and still floated it over.  Bruce fuckin Brown
Bruh how does a defender like Jrue let himself just get beat by Bruce Brown like that…
Replace any non LeBron/AD Laker with Bruce Brown and they're in the 2nd round
"Bruce Brown just took Giannis to the rim, its a wrap."
"Maybe the real Big 3 was Bruce Brown, Joe Harris and Blake"
Bruce brown really a 6’4” center
do you mean bruce brown??
Bruce Brown?
This is exactly why we won. Middleton is leagues above Bruce Brown when it comes to iso scoring.
Bruce Brown at the end was me at pick up
"Bruce ""Russell Westbrook"" Brown"
Bruce Brown got them back in the game when Nets were down 30-9. Not his fault everybody on the team couldnt make a shot
"I mean before that sequence in the end, Bruce Brown had the highest ts on the team, way better than Kyrie’s and slightly better than KD’s.  KD should’ve taken the shot but everything got out of control from the inbound and Kyrie should have called a timeout when he got trapped instead of throwing the ball to Brown."
Bruce Brown smacked the Nets for the bucks
bruce brown has gotta learn how to pump fake. he can't just keep doing the same move and hope the defense never figures it out
Well not starting 0/8 and Bruce Brown not being the main option in crunch time against a top tier defense would help
Bruce Brown thinking he’s MJ and Joe Harris selling out’s what cost us the game
"Bruce Brown  Bruce ""Bruce"" Brown  Bruce ""Brown"" Brown  Bruce ""Bruce Brown"" Brown  Muggsy Bogues"
"Just a down game he'll recover  Still pretty scary how the Nets without Harden, with KD not being that efficient, and with the Nets being cold in general almost won if it werent for Bruce Brown playing hero ball at the end"
"Yeah this was a poor showing by the Bucks imo, felt more like they lost to the Nets incompetence(Bruce Brown? Really?!!!). But hey, a wins a win, lucky or not, on to game 4."
The Nets deserved to lose for allowing Bruce Brown to get that many shots at the end lol
"Kyrie said after the game about the Bruce Brown shot:   “One thing I’ve always been comfortable with is, I’ve felt like I was the best option on every team I’ve played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can be like “that motherf***** can make that shot, too.”"
"Eh, for those who watched, they know without Bruce Brown in the 2nd, the Nets would've never got back in the game. Joe Harris was rough all night."
You mean bruce brown.
Everyone clowning Bruce Brown and rightfully so but if you’ve watched nets games throughout the season you realize constantly in clutch time they have problems getting the ball inbounds. Maybe a sign of Nash’s inexperience.
Everyone clowning Bruce Brown and rightfully so but if you’ve watched nets games throughout the season you realize constantly in clutch time they have problems getting the ball inbounds. Maybe a sign of Nash’s inexperience.
Bruce Brown is a cheat code the other way
Joe Harris shot 1/11 for the game and scored 3 total points. How about we talk about his .27 PPP instead of focusing on what Bruce Brown did wrong in the last minute of the game.
Just outside top 15 right behind Bruce Brown
"I'm talking about the second to last floater, not the one where Kyrie was trapped. Kyrie didn't even look for at the rim on that possession. He just ran pick and roll on the left side of the court with Bruce Brown and dumped it off to him forcing Brown to take a contested floater."
Two words: Bruce Brown lmao
Worse than Bruce Brown?
Who the fuck is Bruce brown
Yet I’d still feel more comfortable with the ball in his hands on the last play of the game than Bruce Brown lmao
If it wasn't for  Bruce brown joe would be the  target
Bruce Brown floater over a Durant midrange ALL DAY BABY
Durant &amp; Kyrie: Pass   Bruce Brown: https://media.giphy.com/media/aDL9oP00LeuPK/giphy.gif
He might get arrested for murdering Bruce Brown before Game 4
Bruce Brown forgot his place because of that first half
Donovon is the most selfish player  Bruce Brown would never player on his team
Bruce Brown scored 16 and thought he was the star lol
"Lmao I can't believe the amount of times they relied on a bruce brown floater instead of durant iso, but you do you"
Clips shooting like Bruce brown
Everyone talking about Bruce Brown in the comments but GODDAMN HARRIS 1-11. That is some bullshit. How do you miss that many wide open jumpers? Playing double agent tonight.
"If I was just going on what names sound like, I would assume Bruce Brown was the coach."
"Bruce Brown did his best Marcus Smart imitation tonight.  Welcome to Celtics fans world.  Live by the brown, die by the Brown."
"In the span of 3 minutes, Bruce Brown came off a pick a roll 4 times and bricked all 4 shots, and then on the critical play of the game, thought he was Lebron and drove for a layup that didn’t even hit rim.  My condolences to his mentions."
Thought Bruce Brown was gonna take it not gonna lie
this is a better than than a bruce brown floater
Bruce Brown thought he was Bruce Wayne saving the day
🥱 Had a 30-9 lead and refs on their tip the whole game and got bailed by harris and bruce brown choking      nets in 5
* Bruce Brown
"Wasn’t bucks defense, just nets offense being ass. Harris was terrible and Bruce Brown thought he was Mj"
Need a highlight of the Bruce Brown mishap expeditiously
And If Bruce Brown doesn't take that shot people would bitch about why he passed up a wide open lane.
He dropped 20 on the knicks when given a chance. He'd be doing the same as Bruce Brown if on the nets. He just doesn't fit with Giannis because he can't shoot.
Lol no Nets just missed shots. Lucked out on a Bruce Brown drive
wtf was that shot by bruce brown around the 30 second mark? stupid
Who tf does Bruce brown think he is it was 9secs left on the clock WTF
"Ugly game from both sides, you’d have to think at least the Nets will shoot better going forward.   Bruce Brown actually had a hell of a game before the very last moment, might have hurt his foot or ankle right before which didn’t help. Shitty inbound pass and Brown didn’t know what to do in such a clutch moment"
If I'm the Nets I'm seriously pulling Bruce Brown aside and having a talk with him
Bruce Brown apparently doesn't know he's Bruce Brown.
"He accidentally pulled a ""Give it to Westbrook"" at the end, and being petty, KD pointed to Bruce Brown and said, ""You heard him, your shot."""
Harris was just awful . Bruce brown messed up but he had a lot of big plays this game that kept Brooklyn in it.
"Bruce "" I think I'm Prime Wade"" Brown showed up in the last 2 mins."
Lmao hes getting fired regardless. Bruce  brown bought him an extra game
Bruce Brown saved coach Bud's job... for a week maybe.
"MVP for this game is Bruce brown for the mil bucks. He carried that team across the finish line. Defense, offense, offensive fouls, he was in his bag tonight. I blame nash for leaving him in, what is brown thinking? Time left, two of the best closers in the game”yea, I better drive against the guy with 4 blocks already, I was born ready,” wonder how many left handed mini sky hooks against elite defenders he has in his career."
Bruce Brown must have had money on the game
Bruce Brown is JR Smith without a jumper
This man Bruce Brown lost his mind and thought he was Steph with the floater 5 times in the last 2-3 minutes of the game. What did I just see?
Bruce Brown thinking he could Steve Kerr his way into NBA folklore
What about the play before that? He tried a circus floater from beyond the FT line with plenty of time on the clock in a pivotal playoff game even though he's Bruce Fuckin' Brown.
Last two minutes for Bruce Brown.  Gets to by Middleton/Holiday.  Bricks a floater and went hero ball for game winner.
Bruce Brown layup over Lopez is the ideal shot
Bruce Brown for the win doesn't even sound right tbh
"Where the fuck was Kyrie in the last 5 mins? I just turned it on, I physically see him on the court, but apparently the only Nets players were KD and Bruce Brown???? Who when I heard his name thought that Bowen came out of retirement just to dirty foul people?"
bruce brown gonna have a nice little talk with kd in the locker room
kd wondering if he can trade bruce brown for another All Star
I swear though if Kyrie or KD have the ball/take the shot on those last 2 possessions (the bruce brown floater and the brown missed layup) the nets win this game...
Not just that but the shot before the game tying attempt....it was Joe Harris and then Bruce Brown twice....neither Kyrie nor KD took shots....
“It’s Bruce Brown time” -Bruce Brown
KD abouta Milly Rock smack Bruce Brown from distance
KD: goes 11-28  This sub: but bruce brown
Bruce brown what is you doin?
BRUCE BROWN BUCKS MVP  Cause missing 4 floaters late in the 4th wasn’t enough   Gotta cap it off with a missed layup
Bruce Brown sold heavy please stop shooting it when you have Kevin Durant on your team
Nets have more than one guy to make big shots. Bruce Brown ain't one of them.
So did Bruce Brown think he was James Harden for today?
crazy cause Bruce Brown had a great game  with 46 mins &amp; threw it all away  in the last 2 mins
"BROWN???? BRUCE BROWN???"" in Soulja Boy's voice"
yeah but he's Bruce Brown  dude hits double figures once and thinks he's MJ lmao
"Bruce Brown and Joe Harris, best undercover bucks player."
"""BROWN???? BRUCE BOWEN???"" in Soulja Boy's voice"
"Nets would’ve won if they continued to go with Kevin Durant, the 2x champion and finals MVP instead of 4 consecutive floater misses by Bruce Brown the apparent number one option"
"MVP of the game, Bruce Brown"
Bruce brown thought it was his moment
"What the hell are the NETS doing with Bruce Brown...Jesus mother of Christ. Is it bad coaching? Are Kyrie and Durant dead tired? WTF is that? Its like the NETS wanted to lose the game. Kyrie didnt look like he wanted to be there.  WHY THE FUCK IS BROWN TAKING 5 CONTESTED FLOATERS IN THE LANE, WHEN YOU HAVE KEVIN ""GREATEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER IN HISTORY"" DURANT.  Im a CELTICS fan and Im pissed off."
"Everyone giving Bruce Brown shit, but he made the right basketball play.  Last 2 possessions:    -Wide open midrange with no time left on shot clock    -Looked like a clear lane to the basket. Guess he thought he would get the superstar foul call"
Bruce Brown going to get an earful in the locker room
"Bruce Brown: ""No OT tonight"""
Here comes ~~Austin Rivers~~ Bruce Brown
To be fair whats a KD who made 3 tough jumpers right before to Bruce Brown anyway
BRUCE BROWN HERO BALL LMAOO
why would u let kd take the last shot when u have bruce brown in
"If I were Nash, I would've called a timeout before that Bruce Brown layup attempt. Ball has to be in KD or Kyrie's hands."
Bruce brown sold lmao wtf
WHY THE FUCK WAS BRUCE BROWN TAKING ALL THE SHOTS AT THE END OF THE GAME???.  Two of the final possessions in a row. he should have killed clock when it was 83- 82 but put up a stupid floater and then screws up the last play.
Bruce brown is the anti KP. 6’4 that plays like he’s 6’10
"Blake came in bad circumstance (thats on the clips tho, we just wanted a big name)     Tried his fuckin ass off, lead a sorry ass team to a playoff series and got smooshed by the bucks and hurt himself in the process.     He gave it a go and we waived him because we actually hit on some draft picks.     I dont give a shit that the blake pistons years were a bit underwhelming it was nice seeing a dude give a fuck, im mad about the bruce brown trade tho"
KYRIEEEEEEEEEE  WHY YOU NEED KD? WHY YOU NEED BRUCE BROWN?
Does Bruce Brown have the best sky hook since Kareem?
Bruce Brown MVP tonight let's go
I agree. I’m fine leaving Blake and Bruce Brown open but Harris is one of the best shooters in the league.
Jeff Green and Bruce Brown were franchise players?
"That ""pre-switching"" was pretty cool to see. Unfortunately I don't see how it could work against the nets. The rockets had a bunch of off ball players for curry to pre-switch onto (rivers, house, pj). The nets will play Kyrie, Harden, Harris, KD, Blake. Trae obviously can't pre-switch to Kyrie, Harden, or KD and switching Trae onto Blake is probably not a good option either. Now if Harden is out then maybe it's a bit more feasible. But even if its like Shamet or Bruce Brown that only leaves Trae one player to pre-switch onto and that can probably be schemed against with proper spacing."
Put some respect on  Bruce Brown
"If you look closer, Kyrie asks KD to throw him a pass high over Bruce Brown. KD was just locked in on doing that."
Why isn’t Giannis guarding KD? Why is he guarding Bruce Brown?
"Nah fam, Joe Harris and Bruce brown"
"Because they don’t have a floor general capable or exploiting those mismatches. Zach Lowe just talked about it yesterday on his podcast. They have jrue holiday out there with weak defenders on him or someone else and he calls for useless screens that allow the nets to get more favorable switches.   The example he used was whenever holiday had shamet or kyrie on him, rather then calling for Giannis screen to exploit that mismatch he’d instead call for a screen and get Bruce brown switched onto him, and then call for Giannis screen making it much harder.   Middleton and holiday just aren’t floor generals or play makers. What they really should have done is gone after Chris Paul of Lowry. They’d know how and when to exploit weak defenders, and they have the capability to not let the other team hide its weaker defenders all game"
bruce brown for dpoy
"He needs a coach that isn’t afraid to take the ball out of his hands. A Giannis size up at the three point line is a wasted possession every single time. Giannis should be killing teams in transition or being the roll man for screens.  Also getting jrue was a mistake. A solid player and great defender but what the bucks actually need is a real floor general like Lowry or cp3. Someone to orchestrate the offense and that can kill teams in that midrange area after the screen. The nets have decided they don’t care about jrue holiday on the pick and roll. If the bucks want to set a screen and have jrue shoot pull up mid range shots they consider that a win. They couldn’t do that against a Lowry or cp3 though.   Also jrue just isn’t the playmaker the other guys are. Zach Lowe the other day on his podcast pointed out jrue is making mistakes like calling for useless screens when he already has a weak defender on him (allowing a better defender to switch to him) before initiating the offense. He will have someone like shamet or kyrie on him, and instead of calling for the Giannis screen he has the guy Bruce brown is guarding set the screen and Bruce will get the switch. Then they try to initiate the pick and roll with a positive defender on the guard. Someone like cp3 would never make that mistake. They would instantly try to attack or initiate the desired pick and roll immediately when they have the weakest defender"
At this point you might as well just guard him 1v1 and force him to drop 60. You can’t let Bruce brown and Harris combine for like 35 points. But nets are doing a really good job running actions with brown that make it hard to defend
Love promotions like these! I was at Bulls game and they have the same promo but with Portillo’s hot dogs. Thank you Bruce Brown for the free hot dogs 🙏
"I love this question. Draymond and Roberson are such good system defenders, their communication and “quarterbacking” the defence would make nets actions more sloppy and the overall team defence would make and sets inefficient most definitely. However one on one I think that the presence of Big Ben would be somewhat of a liability - if the nets go small and have Bruce brown/Blake on with the big three he’s essentially sitting in the corner leaving the mid post and paint open for the big three to attack. KD could effectively still pull up over draymond/rodman and if he’s on, good luck. Harden has the physicality to get to the rim, even on a great defender. If Big Ben can remain effective sitting in the paint similarly to how brook lopez did against Miami, they severely slow BK down. If not then they just make them inefficient"
i wouldn't wanna drive the lane and be met by Bruce Brown
"Can you say with a straight face those guys are significantly worse than Claxton, Mike James, and Bruce Brown"
Embiid vs Bruce Brown down low lol. We got it dont worry
Sir I think you mean Bruce Brown.
Bruce Brown would pass him up on the all time greats list
"Agreed on Mike James, but I don't think Bruce Brown was a complete no-name. Granted he was on the Pistons, but he played quite a few minutes for them last year."
"if money isn't an issue it's a no-brainer to keep him, but....  this year tax threshold is $132.6M and they're $33.3M over the threshold.  there was a big discount on their actual luxury tax bill because of covid but normally it would have been $107M.  next year tax threshold is $136.6M and they're already $32M over with just 9 players (big 3, harris, dinwiddie, jordan, shamet, claxton, johnson).  they have to have 5, if not 6, more players to comply with certain rules about the roster and whatever, maybe blake gets the MLE, maybe bruce brown gets more than the minimum.... i think they hit $42M into luxury tax pretty easily.  the luxury tax bill is then $172M because they're not repeat offenders.  but if they shed dinwiddie's $12M in salary, it's just $93M.  so they can save _$90M_ if they decide they don't need him.  that might not be chump change to the owners.  there's a tax table at the bottom https://hoopshype.com/2018/10/11/nba-luxury-tax/amp/"
Cause Nash didn't learn to play Bruce Brown yet until it was too late
Bruce Brown
"let's be real, nobody heard of Mike James, and Bruce Brown before this year."
"Their supporting cast is still mediocre and are over performing similarly to how Mavs were shooting better than the Warriors from 3 vs the Clips the first two games. Bruce Brown and Claxton are sophmores, it's unrealistic that they're this good in the playoffs already. And Bud should be ashamed for even allowing Nash to be comfortable enough to play these two.   All in all, it's likely their role players come back down to Earth. These three days off should benefit the Bucks. Not saying Milwaukee wins, in fact they certainly won't because of Giannis' limitations and Bud. Just saying Milwaukee's incompetence on both ends makes them look better than they are."
Who are the other 2 “top 10” players? Kyrie? Harris? Blake? Mike James? Bruce Brown?    Harden played a whole 40 seconds this series lol
"They got held to 86 points by a team starting kyrie KD Blake griffin and Bruce Brown, that was one of the worst playoff losses ever."
In an alternate universe Bruce Brown still sucks.
"hard to screw up a play more than bruce brown did with 11 seconds left.  drops the pass, runs into kyrie instead of letting him have it, and then decides it's all on him even though there's still 8 seconds left and kevin durant and kyrie irving on the floor.  that means his brain just exploded in a big moment and he panicked."
you mean trading shots with Bruce Brown. who the hell is this kd you speak of
bruce brown missed 4 floaters and airballed whatever the fuck that was at the end. good god.
Bruce Brown should get fired honestly lol
"Bruce brown played so well, but the last couple minutes Undid everything lmfao"
Bruce Brown gonna be this playoffs Danny Green lmao
"Bruce Brown is the GOAT, I thought this was acknowledged"
Here comes Bruce Brown
Because the worst inbounds pass in history forced Kyrie to give the ball up and Bruce Brown panicked when he got the ball.
bruce brown played a great game and gonna get shit on because of one broken possession while joe harris dodging slander. Funny stuff
Kyrie and KD *have* to be better.  Still think the Bucks have no chance.  They look like shit out there.  Bruce Brown is going to catch a lot of shit but Kyrie was invisible for a lot of the game and KD was fucking terrible through 3 quarters.
Would much rather have KD or Kyrie take a heavily contested shot than have Bruce Brown take a lightly contested one tbh
Bruce Brown ffs leave that fool in the arena
bruce brown got hot for a couple minutes mid game and really thought he could take the last shot....
How was Joe Harris not in the game on the last possession over Bruce Brown?
Bruce Brown is an idiot
I’m Bruce Brown and I don’t know how to do anything else
Bruce Brown sold 😭😭
I’m so mad at that Bruce Brown shot
He suck ass but you trust him to take those shots every time. Shooters miss  But god dam Bruce Brown fucking went full hero mode
Why run pick n rolls with Bruce fucking brown .
bruce brown said no sweep lmfao
Why the hell is Bruce Brown Leroy Jenkinsing on their last meaningful possession?
Bruce Brown would be this years Alex Caruso if it went in!
Both of them are Bruce Brown
these are the most annoying games to watch unfold as 1 guy who doesn’t know his fucking role in the most crucial part of the game tries to go 2k myplayer mode and play hero ball. if we don’t get a new copypasta about the nets team all cussing out bruce brown I’ll be even more disappointed
What the hell are the NETS doing with Bruce Brown...Jesus mother of Christ. Is it bad coaching? Are Kyrie and Durant dead tired? WTF is that? Its like the NETS wanted to lose the game.
Bruce brown thought he was the 3rd all star
Should have gone to their go to guy Bruce Brown to hit that 3.
I want some of whatever Bruce Brown was on
if im durant im swinging on bruce brown
"KD, one of the greatest scorers of all time  Kyrie, a great shooter and incredibly clutch player  Bruce Brown: ""I got this"""
"Bruce Brown with a When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong moment near the end   *Oh you wanna burn me on D? Watch THIS!*  Does…..whatever that play was, lol  Milwaukee is right back in it"
Bruce Brown really tried a left handed contested full speed layup.
RDCWORLD needs to do a kevin durant vs bruce brown video lol
Who should take a game winning shot?  Durant 🛑  Irving 🛑  Harden 🤕  Harris 🛑  Bruce Brown ✅
Bruce Brown was feeling himself too much after that first half he had
Bruce Brown might be the dumbest player in the NBA
i don't know if a role player can single-handedly lose a game but joe harris did his best.  so many open jumpers to help out.  and bruce brown has to distinguish between open floaters and shooting into lopez's elbow.  durant hits 3 straight shots and doesn't get the ball until that buzzer beater.  bucks figured out he brown PnR.
lol bruce brown wilding at the end
why is Bruce Brown the one taking the last good shot for the Nets ?
Bruce Brown took like 10 terrible shots in the last 5 minutes of a tied game.
Why the hell is Bruce Brown taking winning shots lmaoo
Bruce Brown are getting traded
Bruce Brown really channeling that pistons Reggie Jackson and going hero ball LMAO
Bruce Brown walking home
Bruce Brown lmao
I did not just see Bruce fucking Brown layup and float the Nets out the game with KD and Kyrie on the floor for 2 minutes. This is a fucking simulation I'm in. It has to be.
Is one of those two not Bruce Brown??
Should've given it to Bruce Brown tbh
Did bruce brown take more shots than kyrie in the 4th??
How did we lose this.. God damn Bruce Brown
Fuckin Bruce brown
Bruce Brown had one little good quarter and thought he was a HOFer lmao
What in the world was the Nets offense down the stretch   KD is hot time to put the hands repeatedly in the hands of Bruce Brown
Bruce Brown.. who the FUCK do you think you are?
“KD clutch 3 incoming” -&gt; “Bruce Brown clutch 3 incoming” -&gt; “Joe Harris 3 incoming”  Nephew stop lol
Bruce brown and Joe Harris disaster class
They better separate Bruce Brown from the rest of the team in the locker room after this one lmfaooo
This man Bruce brown has Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on his team and tries to play hero ball LOL
Bruce Brown going LERRROOYYYYYYY JENNKINNNNNSS didn’t end up working!  Who woulda thunk it?
Bruce Brown had to regress to the mean after that 1st half
Bruce Brown meanwhile took that shit and said “this is fine”
Which of the two notoriously clutch All NBA superstars should take the last shot?Neither BRUCE BROWN to the rescue. Fucking idiot
"Bruce ""I will sell the game in crunch time"" Brown"
Bruce brown wanted a moment more than a win.  Jesus Christ
"Bruce Brown choked in the fourth man. Missed 4 floaters and took that bad shot instead of giving it to Blake/KD or calling a timeout. KD was so hot in the fourth, how can you not get him the last shot. If they called a timeout and reset, they could’ve still got last shot and only needed 2 to win. Looked like he got hurt tho, he was grabbing at his groin, but he should’ve been subbed out then"
I know the Bucks did well to deny KD the ball but Bruce Brown should not have been taking those shots. Awful execution by the Nets at the end. Also Joe Harris sold too
Bruce Brown is in fact not LeBron. Who knew
Great job by Bruce Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks
"Bruce Brown: ""So, what y'all tryna eat?"""
Bruce Brown just can’t win with these cats
Bruce Brown taking 4 straight shots and missing all four lmao
Team with Kyrie and KD has Bruce Brown shooting the last two buckets for them lmao
HERE COMES BRUCE BROWN
Wtf Bruce brown
"Bruce Brown: ""It's Bruce Brown time"" lol  Good for the Bucks, they needed that obviously. I dun think there's going to be anymore 86-83 games tho"
Bruce Brown isn't allowed in the team hotel tonight.
Bruce Brown missed a floater while I was typing this comment
I dont even understand why Bruce Brown was on the court for the last shot. FLOATER TIME
BRUCE BROWN THOUGHT HE WAS KD.   WTF bro lol.
Bruce Brown on his Carlton Banks flow  Smh
Bruce Brown is the bucks MVP of Game 3
"Bruce Brown, go sit in the corner and think about what you did"
Bruce brown
"Imagine having all time offensive talents in KD + Kyrie, and BRUCE BROWN takes your 2 out of your last 3 shots."
Bruce Brown for the win!  The rim:  https://i.imgur.com/TqdisPf.jpg
Bruce Brown forgot he's Bruce Brown.
Don’t let the box score fool you. Bruce Brown had a terrible game.
... Bruce Brown?
Bruce Brown handed this game to the Bucks on a silver platter
KD and Kyrie yet Bruce Brown is taking the shot down one
Bruce Brown thought he was gonna be Bruce Wayne or some shit and ended up being Brucie from Longest Yard instead.
BREAKING: Bruce Brown murdered by Kevin Durant in lockerroom
"Who gave Bruce Brown the confidence to do that? After blowing the previous 5 floaters, how the fuck did he gain the confidence to do THAT?"
 Why the fuck is Bruce Brown taking the game winning shot when you have KD and Kyrie lmao.
On multiple possessions....the last 3 possessions had Joe Harris and Bruce Brown taking shots
Bruce Brown is a double agent y’all. Nets need to release him before it’s crunch time in the finals and he scores for the other team. You heard it here first.
Bruce Brown tho maaaan fudge
"I watched the ""empty stats"" video and that is not what I took away from it. What I got from that was ""Yes, Booker can be a good player on a winning team but he'd only be the 2nd or 3rd best player on it"". Suffice to say, he was wrong about Book. Ben Taylor, with all due respect, is a quack. He talks and writes well, and that's the main reason why people eat up his content. Effective communication is an underrated skill but his actual analysis is quite average.   If he wrote positively about KD, good for him. I'm not exactly sure what you'd write negatively about KD. He's a top 20 player of all time even without championships. I haven't watched the Trae video. From what I can tell, Taylor's favorite players are Luka, Giannis, and Steph. Nothing wrong with that but credit needs to be given where credit is due. Has Taylor come out with a video or podcast yet about how three high usage players have been able to work together so seamlessly? Has he come out with a video yet about how Kyrie is playing a hyper efficient game with only 1.3 turnovers per game in the postseason? Instead I see podcasts from the Athletic about Bruce Brown. Bruce Brown is a fantastic role player/glue guy but let's be real now."
"Can’t believe Bruce brown could give the ball to KD, Irving, Blake Griffin, or one of the best three point shooters in the game - and he calls his own number and misses the layup that badly. Probably the right shot but whew"
KD and Kyrie better scream at Bruce Brown and Joe Harris in the locker room
Bruce brown is an idiot
KD - Please don't compare to me Bruce Bowen   Reporter - It's Bruce Brown  KD - Whatever
Is something wrong with Kyrie? Turned in last 5 minutes and don't think I've heard his name once. I see him on the floor but Bruce Brown (who when I heard his name I thought damn Bowen came outta retirement just to dirty foul people) and Durant are the only names you hear on the Nets?
Whoever gassed up Bruce Brown on that Nets team need to give me a pep talk lol
When you were expecting Kd or Kai to kill you and you got Bruce Brown lmfao
"This is going to be the ""Bruce Brown"" game."
Imagine being Steve Nash and watching Bruce Brown decide to drive for a hero layup instead of giving the ball to Kevin Durant.
I am no basketball expert but giving the ball to Bruce Brown for down the stretch plays won't win you the game
Bruce Brown about to get himself into the G-League after his performance tonight.
Bruce Brown is definitely gonna take the 3 to tie RN lmao.
"I know Bruce Brown shoulder be taking the shot, but he actually the one who shot less worse today"
Fuck Bruce Brown
BRUCE BROWN FLOATER ALERT
You have Durant and Kyrie but Bruce Brown is taking all your crunch time shots
Is it just me or was Bruce brown actually the absolute worst offensive option of the 5 out there? Lmao
Bruce Brown thinks it's summer league
"On a team where kyrie and kd were both on the floor... Clock running down and they're down by 2... The last THREE shots of the game came from Joe Harris, and Bruce brown. You can't make this up 😭"
*Kd makes 3 difficult jumpers in a row*  Bruce Brown: my time to shine!
congrats nets fans y’all atleast get to know why y’all lost the game if y’all do. thank bruce brown
"Bruce Brown was keeping them in the game in the first and now he just cost them the game, bad tunnel vision there"
"Kd, Kyrie, and Harden. The question was who will take the last shot well, BRUCE BROWN WILL."
"with harden out, bruce brown thinks he's part of the big three now lol."
"&gt;Pivotal playoff game 3.   &gt;One point game  &gt; Get the last shot  &gt;KD hitting everything, Kyrie on the floor with him  &gt;????   &gt;Bruce Brown contested layup?"
bruce brown gotta take this last shot right? lmao
Holy shit I’m dying. Bruce brown has completely taken over this game for the bucks
Bruce brown made some floaters in the 2nd and all of a sudden it's Bruce brown time
How tf is Bruce Brown taking the last shot on a team with KD and Kyrie.. clowns
"How TF some dude named Bruce Brown taking the last shot on a team with Durant, Irving, and Harden on it."
Ah yes lets give the last two decidive shots to...Bruce Brown
"Bruce Brown can take all the shots he wants in the 2nd quarter but with a red hot KD who just ripped off 11 points, he has to get the ball there"
You gotta leave Bruce Brown at the arena tonight lol
That play by Bruce Brown was JR Smith bad
Lets see if Bruce Brown even sees the court on this last possession
How did Bruce Brown not even look at KD there was 7 seconds left what a fucking idiot
"Hey ""Bruce Brown"".. maybe don't take the last two shots with KD and Kyrie on the floor."
Bruce Brown was feelin himself 😂
Bruce Brown sold
Bruce Brown: “Look at me. I’m the captain now.”
Yo RDC needs to make a video about KD and Bruce Brown.
"it's bruce brown time, let's go"
Bruce Brown is soooooo fucked after this game ends.
Holy fuck I’m dead. Bruce Brown thought he was Kawhi.
Bruce Brown got gambling debts to pay off
Bruce Brown just lost that game. You've got KD and Kyrie on your team and you take it yourself on the last 2 possessions of a 1 point game
Bruce brown about to get his ass whooped in the locker room
Who does bruce brown think he is lmao

"Bruce ""Carlton"" Brown"
Just don't put in bruce brown
Bruce “Fauxbe Bryant” Brown
You got Kyrie and KD out there and BRUCE BROWN is taking the most important 2 shots of the game
"Honestly, we’re blaming Bruce Brown but why was KD standing still in the corner? Nobody was giving him a good opportunity to give it elsewhere right?"
Bruce Brown taking the last three Nets shots. Just as they planned when they united KD-Kyrie-Harden
gotta make sure bruce brown has an open 3 here
"Watched Bruce Brown take and miss way too many shots tonight. Give it up, you have Durant and Kyrie as teammates you bum."
BRUCE BROWN TIME
Great contest by Brook against Bruce Brown my god
Lmao Bruce Brown strikes again
Bruce brown floater followed by Bruce brown contested layup.     Can't imagine how pissed nets fans are seeing that shit. I akin it to if that was Danny green doing it for the sixers lol
99% chance Bruce Brown takes this last shot.
Of course Bruce Brown trying to be Harden
KD gonna be ignoring Bruce Brown for the rest of the night
KD and Kyrie on the team and Bruce Brown takes the final 2 shots
Who is letting Bruce brown take these shots in crunch time? Does he not realize KD is on his team?
BRUCE BROWN REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA DO SOMETHING THERE
Bruce Brown better stay off twitter lol. Can’t imagine how he’s feeling.
Bruce brown trying to be Kobe smh
Bruce Brown (BB) tanking his value just like in the market today.
How is Bruce Brown taking your biggest shots down the stretch
Who does Bruce Brown think he is?
Bruce Brown thought he was the 2nd MVP everyone been talking about
"Bruce Brown - ""I'm the 4th all star"""
Bruce Brown 3 on the way
That’s entirely a Bruce Brown decision making error
I watched Bruce Brown get sonned all game long by brook lopez and he still kept trying it lmfao
Bruce Brown for the win!  The rim:   https://i.imgur.com/TqdisPf.jpg
Bruce brown about to get death threats. Sheesh.
"Bruce brown, you're not fucking Tony Parker lol"
Bruce Brown sold smh
Trash ass Bruce Brown missed so many damn shots
Ok Bruce brown. We know you played well but how about thinking about letting KD or Kyrie take the game winning shot?
Bruce brown thought his PNR Floater was gonna go in every time
"I'm Bruce Brown, I can't bend my elbow when making a layup."
Bruce Brown MVP memes are now deceased.
Bruce Brown choked that entire play
Bruce Brown taking the last shot with Durant and Kyrie on the court...............
Is Bruce fucking brown the superstar in brooklyn? did i miss something lol
…Bruce Brown?
"I like Bruce Brown, but you've got KD and Kyrie on your team bro"
"Dude Bruce brown literally lost them this game, the whole game he fucked up"
LMAO BRUCE BROWN??
Bruce Brown takes the final two shots for Brooklyn. Why tf is he trying to play hero ball?
Fuckin lol Bruce Brown lost it for the Nets.
Bruce brown went from fan fav to annoying as fuck for nets fans real quick lmaoo wtf is he doing
"Some key points touched on in the video:   Brooklyn after switching all year is now playing drop coverage even with switchable defenders like claxton and Durant. Reason why is likely the lack of respect for jrue mid range jumper and Giannis has no pick and pop threat.    Brooklyn is attacking brook Lopez in the drop coverage every possession. Durant and kyrie shoot 50% from mid range and can either hit the jumper or when help comes off shooters Durant has been finding guys for threes.    Brooklyn is predictably roasting Bryn Forbes by attacking their hedge and recover strategy by hitting Forbes with another screen off the recovery by a third guy, example given is by claxton. Also shamet/Harris are slipping screen at the peak of the hedge timing it perfectly for open shots.   Overall the nets defensively are playing shooters effectively. The only one they are giving proper respect to are Forbes and middleton to a lesser extent. Jrue and brook are being played off of to give help when necessary.   Durant attacks each defender in different ways. Against Giannis he is consistently isoing him and going back and forth to attack his foot speed laterally. Against jrue he has gone into the post to avoid his dribble being contested and then shooting over or hitting with counter post moves. Against tucker he puts him into the pick and roll, tucker has not been great getting over screens and they’re attack him in this area.   It appears the nets coaching staff pushed literally every right button this game and had a counter to every strategy the bucks threw at them. When they went to the zone it did slow the nets down temporarily but the nash counter was Bruce brown playing the center of the floor where he thrives with his floater and kicking to shooters."
&gt;	trophies  ~~I double counted Harden to make sound better since he has 2~~ big dumb   Alternatively Bruce Brown is the MVP in my heart
Same but the way he’s been playing Blake might get a contract and dip after this year. Same with Bruce Brown. Hope he does atleast would help make the league more competitive
"Bruce brown giveth, bruce brown taketh away"
Bruce Brown playing with the best offensive player on the planet and he drives against 7 foot Brook Lopez⁉️⁉️⁉️
"Imagine needing a clutch bucket, having Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the floor....  And Bruce Brown takes the shot"
Does Bruce Brown know what team he's on?? wtf was that

IMAGINE BEING A SUPERTEAM AND HAVING BRUCE BROWN SHOOT A GAME WINNING SHOT
Bruce brown ruined all the good will he built up in the first 3 quarters oh my god get the fuck off the court
you have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the floor and somehow Bruce Brown took more shots than them in the final 4 minutes.
why the fuck is bruce brown taking these shots?
Why did they give Bruce Brown that last shot
Bruce Brown more than Kyrie
Bruce Brown is the Miami Valuable Player
probably pistons legend bruce brown
"Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, and Nick Claxton don't seem like dudes who just check out and have fun"
"That 2018 draft is STACKED....  Luka, Trae, MPJ, Shai, Ayton     And then you have a ton of young talent such Bruce Brown, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Mikal Bridges, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Jaren Jackson, and even Marvin Bagley (still has time to develop and improve)."
Bruce brown the worst player in the nba
"Bruce Brown hero ball, bad move lol. How does KD not touch that ball?"
I was lowkey hoping Bruce GOAT Brown hit that.
What the fuck Bruce Brown……?  Hell nah he’s walking to the hotel
The world on the line I want a Bruce brown floater hook shot
Hahaha what is Bruce brown doing
Get Bruce Brown off the court lmao
Bruce Brown what the the fuck are you doing
"Bruce Brown has been fantastic tonight, but no way he should he ever be taking that shot in that situation."
Bruce Brown wtf are you doin!!!!
Bruce brown bruh
Bruce Brown????
"If im Steve Nash, Bruce Brown is being bent over and ass slapped post game"
Bruce Brown should never shoot a floater again
Bruce Brown is so bad
Bruce brown wtf piece of shit
The Nets trying to have Bruce Brown close the game for them is an interesting decision
bruce brown?????
Bruce Brown must not know he has two of the best players in the league on his team and just runs in and blows the game.
So many Bruce brown floaters and they were all short
1st quarter had Bruce Brown feeling himself
why is a bruce brown floater over a 7ft shot blocker the shot they keep going to down the stretch after missing it like 3 or 4 times in the last 3 minutes alone
Why the fuck did they give to Bruce Brown...
Better question. Why the hell is Bruce brown taking the shot up 1 with 12 seconds left
BRUCE BROWN YOU ARE A LITERAL ROCK AND DON’T SHOOT AT ALL AND THEN DECIDE TO TAKE A CONTESTED LAYUP WITH &gt;30 LEFT.
lol bruce brown taking floaters over. kyrie who hasnt touched the ball much in crunch time
How did Bruce Brown miss a 5 foot floater
They gotta stop letting Bruce brown do that stupid floater Jesus I would take any contested KD/Kyrie shot over that.
Bruce Brown wanna be that 3rd star so bad lmfaooooooo
Bruce brown fuck off holy shit

Stop running shit through Bruce Brown with the game on line huh
You have KD yet your go to play was Bruce Brown floaters over Lopez
What’s with these shitty Bruce brown floater plays? They keep going for it and keep failing.
bruce brown???
Bruce brown taking the clutch shot with KD and Kyrie on the floor big oof.
The world has advanced beyond the need for Bruce Brown floaters
"KD nah, Kyrie nah  Bruce Brown yeah"
What was Bruce Brown doing?
Why does Bruce brown keep taking those shitty ass floaters
Bruce brown and Joe Harris have been awful today
LMFAO how are the Nets gonna keep running that pick and roll with Bruce brown? That shit sucks
Why tf is Bruce Brown shooting there. Give KD the damn ball.
lmao that's the shot they want? a Bruce brown floater
Letting Bruce brown shoot in a crucial possession with less than 20 seconds left. Good idea
BRUCE BROWN TAKE SHOT OVER KD WTF????
why did bruce brown take the most important shot of the night
Bruce Brown
Bruce brown is ass lol
does bruce brown only practice floaters 😂
Bruce brown is a mole for the bucks
Bruce Brown floater has been nullified
"Fuck, I hope Bruce Brown is okay. Definitely my fave player on this Nets team"
Bruce Brown should take that wide open three they're giving him. He's not that bad of a shooter when he's wide open
Making up for getting sonned in the paint by Bruce Brown in the 2nd quarter.
"If Bruce Brown needs me to massage his groin, I’d oblige :("
So can Bruce Brown not shoot? They sagged way off worse than Rondo back in the day
Bruce Brown with the dreaded groin pull. Someone needs to make a post.
"Oh no, Bruce Brown looks like he busted a nut"
Bruce Brown just got AD’d :/
"Bruce Brown looks hurt :( Grabbing at his groin, probably why Nash took a TO."
Hopefully Bruce Brown just got nut shotted or copped some hit rather than pulled  groin or something
Is Mary Albert even watching the game. Bruce brown was walking around hurt for a minute and he doesn’t mention it
Bruce brown hurt yikes
Yeah Bruce brown is hurt
Bruce brown scared to shoot for some reason
Bruce “fire hydrant” brown
Bruce Brown with 5 fouls. Why did Steve Nash waste that challenge
Bruce Brown can be so dumb
Bucks winning cause the Goat Bruce Brown in foul trouble
bruce brown
what if he and bruce brown just go form their own super team in one of the expansion cities
lol the Bucks are getting beaten by Bruce Brown.
"Giannis, Middleton and Bruce Brown are the only ones who showed up to play  Pathetic garbage from Kyrie and KD. Getting deja vu from those 2 regular season losses to the Bucks. Really tight games going into the 4th just like this one"
How do you want on your team Bruce Brown or Draymond? (Consider age)
Nets spam Bruce Brown as a screener. Bucks need to do the same. Fuck the egalitarian system.
"Bruce ""Bowen"" Brown"
Bruce Brown is the greatest catch and floater player in the league
Yo Bruce Brown just looked like Dylan right now in that Chappelle skit
"Bruce ""Bowen"" Brown"
I just realized Bruce Brown looks like Chiwetel Ejiofor.
Bruce brown floater ggez
THE EAST RUNS THROUGH BRUCE BROWN
Bruce Brown said death by floater
LMAO people really telling me Harden is more important than Bruce Brown
Bucks really getting lit up by bruce brown floaters
I wanna learn that Bruce Brown floater bro it’s unstoppable
Is Bruce brown the best center in the league?
Bruce Brown just got headbutted really hard.
bruce brown outworking the entire bucks team   y’all are down 0-2 wtf
"The Nets without Harden are not a superteam, they traded all their depth for harden and he's not playing  It's just KD and Kyrie, a pretty normal duo compared to past elite teams. They are surrounded by castoffs and late picks like Bruce Brown, Claxton, Harris and Mike James - who's agent offered him to the entire league.   Basketball is a simple game where the best player on the floor usually wins, right now that's KD."
good stuff. also just want to say that the rare Ben and Joel pick and rolls still eye fuck me. nice read by ben there though.   [this](https://youtu.be/BNivs6Jyxiw) is a good video breaking down how thybulle can learn from Bruce Brown. obviously his shooting will be his swing skill but his ability to work as a pseudo-4 will help in the short term.
The bucks don’t deserve to win. Getting outplayed by Bruce Brown
Bruce fucking Brown
bruce brown
"It seems a lot like the whole “AD at the five thing” as well. It’s not even like giannis would have to bang against a big center like Brook or embiid. The nets center is either Blake, Durant, or Bruce brown??"
Bruce Brown is going to get paid this offseason. D'antoni/Nash just created a new position. Anyone see short players now rolling in the future?
Bud decided to stop doing everything that gave them a 21 point lead and Bruce Brown caught fire
Nash should have gotten more COY votes just for creating this role for Bruce GOAT Brown.
"I don't remember hating Kidd this much. I never thought I could hate a head coach more than the wifebeater.   We're not running any plays, it's Middleton ISO, Giannis drive and kicks, run a fucking pick and roll FFS. Meanwhile we're playing drop coverage in defense with Lopez standing still under the rim, going so deep that Bruce Brown makes uncontested 4 feet floaters."
"Won’t matter much either way, Bruce Brown 50 piece incoming"
There's a difference between taking a couple 3's a game in the regular season to develop and bricking four in the first half of a playoff game.  I think Bruce Brown has found a good medium. Take the wide open corner 3's and open ones at the top of the key when the ball is swinging and in rhythm. Pass up the standstill shots from the top of the arc.
"What? Bruce Brown has scored all of his points in the paint, kryie has 6 of his points from beneath the FT line. KD is 2-10 with one of his makes being a jumper from not even 10 feet"
And outside of a few flashes Irving has been fairly invisible too. Bucks legit being taken apart by Bruce Brown.
He’s screaming cause Bruce Brown is taking over
They tried to tell us that Steph KD PnR was the deadliest play in nba history but it was Mike James and Bruce brown all along
"Nope. KD, Kyrie, and Harden ain't shit compared to Bruce brown"
this is exactly what the bucks need. bruce brown to win the game for the nets lol
"True, Portis has barely played but done well in the minutes he’s gotten.   Lopez has been horrifying out there. Can’t hit a shot and continuously getting torched by Bruce Brown. He’s absolute dead weight out there right now."
"&gt; According to data supplied to The Athletic by NBA Advanced Stats, guards rolled hard to the rim only 15.7 percent of the time after setting a ball screen. On average, centers did so 55.7 percent of the time. Brown dove to the basket 219 times on the 326 screens he set, good for a whopping 67.2 percent. By comparison, Jarrett Allen finished the season at 66.2 percent playing for Brooklyn and Cleveland.   &gt; ...  &gt; As a result, after having a grand total of one scoring attempt as a screener in his first two seasons, Brown has used 74 possessions in that fashion across the regular season and playoffs, per Synergy Sports. The majority of those have come on rolls to the rim, on which Brown has averaged just over 1.2 points per chance. That figure is about average for a big man, which sounds unimpressive until one remembers that Brown is a 6’4 shooting guard diving as effectively as the average big.  From [this](https://theathletic.com/2641221/2021/06/09/how-bruce-browns-mastery-of-the-short-pick-and-roll-has-made-him-the-nets-and-the-nbas-most-surprising-guard/) piece, written yesterday."
"KD shooting 20% from the field with 4 TOs yet the Nets are still in this. Y’all keep harping on the big 3 but the role players in Joe Harris, Bruce brown are really solid contributors as well."
"Bruce ""6'4"" Shaq"" Brown"
Bruce Brown go brrr
Bruce Brown is a boss who does everything. Giannis is settling for too many jumpers but otherwise doing well in the paint. Middleton is absolutely killing it. Nobody else on the Bucks is doing anything and it’s leaving things open for a comeback.   Jrue needs to step up.
Giannis has nightmares of Bruce Brown
"can't wait for the post game ""is bruce brown the most valuable player on the nets"" question"
Leaving Brook in to get cooked by Bruce Brown while not using his size at all on offense is such a great move....
Bruce Brown leading the nets in a close game at the half.... just like we all expected.
I was just thinking how Bruce Brown might actually be the smallest NBA centre ever.
that's Nets MVP Bruce brown
And Bruce brown was feasting on brook lopez stupid defence and brook lopez doesn't use his post game today and just sit at corner
I'm happy Bruce brown is doing well. Always liked how hard he played for us
Bruce Brown floater unstoppable
Bruce Brown :’)
"Can't really blame them, Bruce Brown is just too elite"
Nets have most of their points from the paint and KD and Bruce Brown have been getting fouled when they drive
The drop coverage they run is why the Bucks will lose. You need to bench Lopez. Dude can't even guard Bruce Brown what do you think is going to happen with Kyrie off screens?
I never thought I would say this the bucks can't defend Bruce brown
When harden comes back tell him to come off the bench cause Bruce brown is starting
I'm gonna be seeing that Bruce Brown floater in my nightmares tonight
Is Bobby Portis or Bruce Brown the true MVP over that fake Jokic?
to bruce brown
Bruce Brown: *am I a joke to you*
Bruce Brown
"Most players obviously bitch here and there, but I don't think I've ever seen Bruce Brown not have an absurdly aggrieved reaction to literally any call a ref has ever made.  Dude seems like he has the league office on speed dial to complain whenever he misses shooting a crumpled up piece of paper into his trash can at home."
"People gonna complain about kd Kyrie harden but kd has been playing like shit and they’re still in it because they have good role players in Bruce brown, joe Harris, etc"
Bruce brown
bobby portis vs bruce brown 1v1 for the series win
Bruce Brown deserves a $15 million/yr contract
"i love this bruce brown kyrie pick and roll, it's v fun"
"Bruce Brown has been the X-factor, but how him setting simple pick and rolls repeatedly has destroyed the bucks defense is beyond me."
Where were you for the legendary Bobby Portis vs Bruce Brown playoff battle?
Bruce Brown ballin rn
Bruce Brown has so far outscored the Bucks in the 2nd quarter!
death by a million bruce brown floaters lmao
"Brook Lopez should be playing exactly zero minutes this series, run Giannis at Center and play Portis more. Losing a 21 point lead to fucking BRUCE BROWN is more embarrassing than getting swept"
Yo is Bruce brown better than prime MJ?
Bruce Brown has tripled the Bucks production this quarter head to head
"How bad was Stan Van Gundy as a coach when the 2019 Detroit Pistons are balling out everywhere in these playoffs?  Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris (Clippers).  Fucking horrible head coach.  Yeah, I realize it was Markieff and not Marcus on the 2019 Pistons, but Marcus was on the 2017 Pistons who were in the playoffs, too with Fat Van Gundy.  God, that guy sucked."
Better all time floater: Tony parker or Bruce fucking Brown?
"Bruce brown is not 6'4, he gets dwarfed by joe harris. Hes 6'1 at most"
"The Bucks really thought they could guard Bruce Brown when he's 1 out of 11 siblings, gtfo"
Bruce Brown is on his Ben Wallace shit playing center lmao

Bruce Brown is one of the most unique players in the league and I love him for it

Bruce Brown Jr is having me in tears. Playing his heart out.
Nets need to help their star Bruce Brown more
Brooklyn needs to build around Bruce Brown
"Bruce Brown is goated, how do you hate on a guy that small getting into it with centers"
Giannis plays like a small biatch sometimes...    And I love his game usually but damn man Bruce Brown plays twice your size
My god Bruce Brown has been the best player so far
Bruce Brown MVP
Bruce Brown &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; KD
They have kyrie and kd on the floor and the mike James and Bruce brown pnr is somehow the most effective set.
Absolutely. Bruce Brown has looked like a 20m/yr guy this season
Nets are better without harden since Bruce brown can take his minutes
Bruce Brown is incredible. Fascinatingly weird player.

Bruce Brown is goated
BRUCE FUCKING BROWN
bruce brown
"Um.  I've been a fan for a decade, Bruce Brown wasn't a Net a year ago."
Everyone on the Nets needs to go.. except for Bruce Brown
Bucks no match for Bruce Brown
"I mean 6’5” guard is beating your 7’0” center as the roll man lol. It’s also a role player on a team with 2 all nba players  If Bruce Brown is gonna beat you doing this, I have no idea what “adjustments” y’all want"
He's a big reason Bruce Brown has turned into an effective player.
"I really wanted the Bud mic clip to be him yelling ""STOP BRUCE BROWN"""
I dont understand what the fuck Milwaukee is doing.  Getting fucking thrashed for multiple possessions by the two man game of Landry Shame and Bruce Brown?  One new coach please
Nets running Mike James and Bruce Brown pick n roll and cooking the bucks lmfao
"Bruce Brown is legitimately one of the best roll men in the league.   Just a tragedy that someone like Westbrook or Fox isn’t used on plays like this more. Having short, strong players with good touch operate as roll men is an offensive wrinkle a lot of teams could benefit from."
If you watched Nets games (which you don’t) you’d know Bruce Brown is a pretty solid finisher at the rim.
Getting killed by Bruce Brown!
"FUCKING BUCKS FUCK YOU BUD FUCK EVERYTHING  What is wrong with them??? They fucking had the Nets on the ropes - Drive, Drive, Drive - then decide to go ham with misguided threes and Jrue Holiday 12 second iso post ups?? What in the actual fuck??  I'm not even talking about falling for a Bruce Brown screen and roll for 4 straight possessions in a row, giving him 8 straight points.   Bud is killing this team, this is Mark Jackson level bad."
Brooklyn going to win a title and some .500 team is going to spend big money on Bruce Brown.
Bruce “6’4 center” Brown
league really let Bruce Brown get decent help like KD and Harden.
"Bruce brown and a shamet 3 carried them back in the game, just like I predicted"
Bud may be the most useless coach in playoff history. Giannis being wasted guarding Blake while Bruce Brown is absolutely torching Lopez. Who ever thought those were the best matchups they could come up with?
keep spamming Bruce Brown pnr until it stops working
Nobody even knows who Bruce Brown is and he's carving up the Bucks like a turkey.
 Bruce “Hakeem the dream” brown
"8-0 run by Bruce Brown. Same play as well.   Lopez is unplayable, just like many other slow footed centers. Bud needs to accept it"
Man last summer when Bruce Brown was among the first players to be traded people were complaining that no blockbuster players had moved and others jokingly said “what about Bruce brown?” And boy were those people right. He’s not flashy or spectacular but is really solid and surprisingly versatile. Who knew he was a solid screener for a small guy??
Bruce Brown doesn’t miss any shots within 10 feet that’s his super ability
Mike James and Bruce Brown vs KD and Kyrie. Who you taking?
GG bucks. Mike James and Bruce Brown have arrived.

Prime Michael Jordan or Bruce Brown?

Bruce Brown must be so tired given how he has to carry all these chumps. What a guy. What a hero.
Imagine calling yourself a championship contender and then letting Bruce Brown go on a personal 8-0 run.
Kareem Sky Hook &lt; Bruce Brown Floater
can't wait for bruce brown to win finals MVP
If Bruce Brown pulled a Trae and told the Bucks Crowd “ ITS QUIET AS FUCK IN HERE” I’m dying here and now
"Oh look, it's exactly like what I said when we were up 20, the drop defense will lead to the Nets carving up our defense as soon as their shots start falling. Bruce Brown might go for 30 tonight because we won't adjust."
"When bud realizes this isnt the series for lopez and they need to out smallball brooklyn, play Giannis at 5, and play more aggressive on ball screens, bucks will have a legit chance. Too bad that wont happen.     Tried to hide him on bruce brown which brooklyn clearly figured out pretty quickly"
Bruce Brown built different
Bruce Brown &gt;&gt; AI
Embarrassing letting Bruce brown cook you. And Connaughton should not see the floor from here on out the dude literally brings nothing

Go small with Tucker and then switch everything, or go big with Lopez"
