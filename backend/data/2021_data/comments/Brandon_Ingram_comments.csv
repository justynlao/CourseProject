Damn Brandon Ingram doesn‚Äôt even get a mention for him?
No Brandon Ingram?
"I mean it doesn't have 100% predictive value but it doesn't have 0% predictive value either.   The initial draft time rankings were largely created from 20-30 NCAA games. Clearly 20 rookie games in the actual NBA should mean *something*.   If you play like trash like Wiggins/Okafor/Fultz, it seems fine to slightly de-value that player. Every now and then you might wrongly write off a player too early (eg Brandon Ingram), but probably still ""less wrong"" than pretending they are still a #1 pick-level prospect.   Likewise if a player is super good as a rookie (ie Jokic, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, etc), even if they are a late pick, it's probably fine to value them as a top 5 pick."

Brandon Ingram reminds me of Knicks Melo. Lots of street cred....not winning basketball

How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Man if only we had good individual defenders like Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, or that Josh Hart! Maybe we could add in a great help defender like Steven Adams!  Then you know what we could do? Give them more than 18 games to judge whether or not its gonna work."
Me: It's possible that the L2M report rules that the missed call on Brandon Ingram's game tying attempt was actually an offensive foul on Ingram  Me when the L2M comes out: League has ruled that it was not and the foul was on Gobert.  What is confusing you?
Brandon Ingram rn: üëÄ
"I just want to say that I *always* hated the Lakers. I gave them one night of rooting for them in Kobe's last game (bonus points that it was against the Jazz), but other than that I couldn't stand them hyping up Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma as the next big things. I also thought Brandon Ingram would bust (his poor free throw shooting did not inspire confidence in the KD comparison), so I'll take the ""L"" on that."
"I remember it very clearly. It was posted as ‚Äútwo nba players‚Äù at first with no names. Then someone posted BrAndoN Ingram was involved, then it came out it was TT and Dray. Dray shoulda known better than that shit."
"Pelicans need some 3 and d guys. Kemba can shoot and score but his defense isn‚Äôt great. They have enough scoring with Zion and Brandon Ingram, I feel like they need a pat beverley or someone like that."
Hes had some moments that look SO good. He had a play last game against the 76ers where he shook his defender and took a jump shot that looked KD or Brandon Ingram like. He has the potential to be super good

Former Lakers Lonzo Ball and Former Lakers Brandon Ingram
All-Star Brandon Ingram
Brandon I‚Äôm just standing Ingram does not agree with that statement himself
Brandon ingram? Everyone hes teamed with has said he is one of the hardest working player around
Hassan whiteside. Nikola mirotic. Brandon Ingram. Are you doing a class project? Gtfo
Brandon Ingram being the only person in the Pelicans starting lineup who can shoot the basketball well on a consistent basis and still averaging 48% from the field should earn him another trip to the all star game
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
I watched the game; they couldn't guard Brandon Ingram :(
Didn‚Äôt Brandon Ingram literally just win
"Come on AD, Brandon Ingram has been playing better lol"
If Brandon Ingram did it he'd be the one who fell over
"Lu Dort  Hear me out before downvoting. He's definitely a great contract value but I see as many or more posts/highlights for him than guys like Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, KAT, DeAndre Ayton, De'Aaron Fox, etc."
I still think both teams won tbh. You can‚Äôt think the pels made that trade with all those picks and Brandon Ingram who‚Äôs only 23 and just signed a max with the expectation to be contending right away.   Most bad teams take longer to rebuild after trading a superstar like AD and the pels are likely still ahead of schedule to most in that comparison. But nba Twitter/Reddit is shortsighted and only looks short term.
How are you gonna put Zion over Brandon Ingram smh. Zion shouldn‚Äôt even be top ten yet.

"Brandon Ingram   Dude can do everything tatum can do and hes a better iso scorer and passer, granted his defense slipped alot in new Orleans. Switch ingram and Tatum last year and I think boston has a similar amount of success"
"woah, what happened? i thought superstar Brandon Ingram is already the next KD?"
"I've only seen one a few games of theirs this season, one of which this last Thursday at Utah. Zion looked absolutely lost on every defensive possession. The commentary even mentioned it a few times how poorly he looked. Offensively he looked like he wanted to play hero ball or not be involved at all. Terrible look for a #1 overall.  Brandon Ingram on the other hand is a superstar in progress and has been a treat to watch this week."
"I mean yeah their roster isn't amazing but you'd expect more out of team with a COTY, an MVP candidate in Steph, a solid 3&amp;D wing(at least recently) in Wiggins, a second #1 pick in Wiseman, plus Draymond who is still valuable defensively. Like we've seen worse teams do a lot better than play .500 ball. I mean for fucks sake Lebron somehow went 20-14 before he got injured playing with Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and the useless Luke Walton. Or when Russ willed his Thunder into the playoffs in 2016  This is nothing against Steph and Kerr, but for years everyone's always said Kerr was probably one of the best coaches in the NBA and Steph was one of the best players in the league. Yet there's always so many excuses. playoffs."
Brandon Ingram and some picks basically
"Honestly I'd much prefer a squad with all younger guys than this group. Particularly because the Olympics are most likely not happening this summer.  Would love to see the Celtics guys, DeAron Fox, Morant, Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Van Vleet, Herro/Duncan Robinson maybe"
"This is honestly the weirdest troll brigade I‚Äôve encountered in a while lol.  No one gave two shits about the lakers when they sucked except for lakers fans, same as any other fan base.  Lmao @ Nick Van exel &amp; brandon ingram, no one cared  The Knicks!?  Again, *no one even knows what the Knicks is outside of the tri state area*.  Trust me, I travel, a lot, and am able to catch basketball games at establishments all over the globe.  The way the overwhelmingly vast majority of the entire planet views basketball is:  The Chicago Bulls.  That‚Äôs it lol.  ‚ÄúChicago &amp; MJ‚Äù, that‚Äôs literally it.  Even amongst little kids, their parents tell them that ‚Äúbasketball peaked in the 90s‚Äù  The NBA *still* hasn‚Äôt even come remotely close to approaching the ratings heights that they did under Chicago/MJ.  Heck, The lion‚Äôs share of casual sports fans view the NBA as ‚Äúlame‚Äù &amp; as a ‚Äúdead league‚Äù, ‚Äúpeaked in the 90s when Chicago was good‚Äù.  Seriously, this is a common rhetoric amongst casual sports observers.  Get out more lol.  Even here in Los Angeles where I live now, I see more bulls gear than clippers gear hahaha  As far as name value amongst casual sports fans worldwide, it‚Äôs the Bulls, the Lakers, And then everyone else.  There‚Äôs a reason Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the entire planet after *one* great (hugely overrated) season, and it‚Äôs not because he was playing for the Celtics üòÜü§£üòÇ  The Knicks aren‚Äôt even worth mentioning.  No one has heard of them outside of the tri state area.  Except for in east Asia, they gained some traction there after the whole Jeremy lin thing, but that was very short lived &amp; not even really bringing up"
Malcolm Brogdon won Rory with 10/2/4 averages. Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram failed to score in double digits that same season so that 2017 rookie class comes to mind.
Brandon Ingram rookie year: 9.4 ppg on 47% TS  Jaylen Brown rookie year: 6.6 ppg on 54% TS  he's got some time
Unless your name was Brandon Ingram lol
Brandon Ingram
"Thanks for the info though I already know it, I've been following Shaq since he got in the league. I don't buy it because clearly the correct, albeit longer, tedious and more difficult way is hitting the weight room.   Look at Ben Wallace, Rodman, Ewing, even the skinner guys like Tim Duncan and Hakeem. They had no problems with beefy centers because they put in the work in the weight room, they have insanely strong cores and legs.   Young Shaq already was at an optimal weight, it wasn't like he's Brandon Ingram lol. All he needed to was to eat clean, maybe gain 5-10lbs of muscles, do yoga like Kareem, he would be stronger than fat-shaq. It'll always be a poor excuse to me. He already was so good, I can't imagine him in his prime with a well-tuned, years-of-weightlifting strength body. He would be GOAT of GOATs.  But fat-shaq still had a very, very good HoF career with a lot of rings so maybe he's satisfied enough and doesn't care about ""what if""."
"Rudy is also the 3rd or 4th best center in the league. Brandon Ingram is like 12th best forward in the league and makes the same money.   Rudy is really good and when he‚Äôs on he‚Äôs Mutumbo/Lonzo Mourning level on defense. He took over in one of the games in the Denver series last year. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it. If they had average wing defenders they‚Äôd be the best defense in the league. Rudy just makes it hard because he can‚Äôt guard guys like Dame or Steph on the perimeter so you have to work your defense around him, but it‚Äôs totally worth it for how well he shuts down the paint."
Not really. The only one I can see being a contender is Brandon Ingram.
Brandon Ingram Got shorter lol he looks taller though.
The Brandon ingram close up üíÄüíÄ
"Well I'll tell you: I've been a laker fan for over 20 years and when lebron first came to the lakers I was so annoyed. I had the same thought. ""How am I ever going to enjoy the games?"" I wanted to keep our young core and even before the trade I was super high on Brandon ingram. It really irked me but buddy let me tell you what, winning a ring made it all better lmao. Just saying. If you've been a fan for that long maybe it's okay to soak up a super team for once. Besides, winning feels good."
Why does it seem like the pelicans have our number most of the time? We can never shut down Brandon Ingram

hahaha oh well at least I get to watch Brandon Ingram now
Brandon Ingram
Damian Lillard and Brandon Ingram
"Theres a difference between constructive criticism and just rude criticism. Theres also a difference between that and plain ignorance, which is where you are at. And its arrogant at that.  Just this thread ive seen you say thay Eric Bledsoe barely touches the ball and that Brandon Ingram is a ""dribble bro"". Here is the fun thing about the NBA. All of this stuff is recorded so I dont just know from watching, I know for a FACT that you are wrong and have the numbers to prove it.  Bledsoe averages roughly the same number of touches per game as both Zion and Ingram. Unless you wanna make the claim that neither of them touch the ball very much, you are clesrly wrong.  As for ""dribble bro"" he dribbles less per touch than both Bledsoe and Ball. So uh, you can try that again as well.  As for Adams, well uh, if you see him doing nothing but clogging the lane, well then. Well lets just say youre special and leave it at that.   Like I said. Can I get ""I dont actually watch this team for 1000, Alex?"""
"No.  We arent ignoring anything in the tenures of the 2 players with lebron.  There are clear and obvious tiers to it.  AD, wade, and kyrie.  And then a clear drop to the next tier with bosh, k.love, big z, and possibly mo williams and brandon ingram and carlos boozer if we want to be technical about including all of lebrons teammates and their time with lebron which it sounds like you want to be.   If you want to bring stats into this we can but you seem to be hesistant for some reason.  Id like to see the case for bosh over kyrie if you dont mind."
Brandon Ingram is finally better than Ben
Zion was born in North Carolina (as was Brandon Ingram as it happens).
Not like he's not trying https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/brandon-ingram-is-on-a-sickening-weight-gain-program/
"Nah , he's mentioned before that he tries to eat a lot  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/brandon-ingram-is-on-a-sickening-weight-gain-program/"
He will transform from skinny KD to... KD. Brandon Ingram is Kevin Durant. Ingram is gone. There is only Kevin Durant now.
"[Go look at his advance stats. They're all mediocre. ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Brandon Ingram&amp;season=2021)And he's terrible at defense.  And when you watch him play. He sucks up the offense. He needs possession of the ball a lot to score and make any impact. Which is easy to do when your team has no expectations this season.  I'm amazed he gets so much hype. He's an okay player, but Zion has already surpassed him as the best player on that team."
just checking into to say i love brandon ingram. have a great day everyone
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram Josh Hart, Lance Stephenson."
So is Ben Simmons vs Brandon Ingram a legit debate now? Or is Ben clearly ahead still
That's not really an appropriate comparison since Kuzma isn't a lottery pick and performed more than what was expected from him so far.  A good comparison is asking whether having Jaylen Brown or Brandon Ingram would've been better
"No one will ever say that Brandon Ingram has a bad work ethic, however good he will be at basketball will be because this dude wants it, and wants it bad."

"KEEFE WAS EATING pizza outside in Laguna Beach, California, on Nov. 24, when his phone rang. It was Ingram. They hadn't talked in a while. Ingram told Keefe he had just signed his new contract in New Orleans, and thanked him for the work they had done together.  ""I was like, 'Wow,'"" Keefe said.  Before the Davis trade, the Lakers saw signals that work was paying off. Luke Walton, the Lakers coach for Ingram's three seasons there, was among Ingram's biggest supporters in the organization. In meetings, Walton and his staff debated Ingram's best position. Several argued he could be a point-forward. They tried him there when Lonzo Ball got injured in early 2018.  ""With no prior reps, he knew the offense,"" Walton said. ""He became a playmaker. It was only a matter of time for him."" The NBA on ESPN and ABC  The NBA is back! Catch all the 2020-21 season action on ESPN, ABC and the ESPN App.  Wednesday, Jan. 20 ‚Ä¢ Celtics at Sixers, 7 p.m. on ESPN ‚Ä¢ Suns at Rockets, 9:30 p.m. on ESPN  All times Eastern  He was getting stronger. Mark Madsen, the former NBA player and Lakers assistant, hopped into pickup games with players. On one defensive possession, Madsen rotated and tried to plow through an opponent. When they collided, Madsen stumbled.  ""Dang, whoever did that is pretty strong,"" Madsen thought. He looked up and was surprised to see Ingram. ""He plays much stronger than he looks.""  Madsen watched Keefe and Ingram work, and thought about one of his old teammates over six years with the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""Brandon reminds me of [Kevin Garnett] in terms of his consistency, his routine,"" Madsen said.  ""He is the hardest worker I've ever seen,"" said Larry Nance Jr., Ingram's teammate in L.A. for parts of two seasons. ""The rest of us would get [to practice], and he'd already be drenched in sweat.""  Pelicans officials eventually banned Ingram from showing up to their facility on off days. They showed him data from their training staff indicating he was overworking himself. ""I hate it,"" Ingram said. ""But I use those off days to visualize the game.""  In search of more tutoring, Stackhouse hooked Ingram up with Micah Lancaster, a Michigan-based trainer who has worked with several NBA players. Lancaster pushed Ingram to bend more while dribbling, and shorten his strides while zigzagging through narrow corridors.  The idea was to be faster changing directions. In a crouch, Ingram would be harder for defenders to grasp. He could lean forward and use his shoulders for leverage around the rim. Lancaster learned firsthand of Ingram's wiry strength. He has clients toss a special medicine ball off a wall at his facility in Grand Rapids. Ingram threw the ball straight through Lancaster's drywall, leaving a hole that is still there. They tried another wall. Ingram cracked it on the first throw. ""We had to stop him,"" Lancaster said.  Lancaster set up short cones in twisting patterns, and he had Ingram reach down to touch each one as he dribbled the maze. At first, Ingram slowed to tap the cones. Eventually, he performed the drills at full speed.  ""My job is to show you how bad you are at something,"" Lancaster said. ""Some guys don't have the stomach for that. Brandon does.""  The choppier strides seemed to contrast with Keefe's work in L.A. helping Ingram use elongated steps getting to the basket. In reality, the skills were complementary -- for use in different scenarios. Honing them all -- digesting where and how to use which style of footwork -- took time."
"INGRAM'S DRIVE AND willingness to be coached date to the days and late nights he spent with his father, Donald, who played growing up and helped run the Martin C. Freeman Recreation Center in Kinston. After hours, Donald Ingram kept the center open for Ingram and his friends.  Ingram's father viewed his son's game as representing both his family and the rec center. ""He wasn't gonna be a sorry player, or an unskilled player,"" Donald Ingram said. ""I saw a lot of players caught up in fancy dribbling and 'AND1' basketball. I wasn't having that.""  They spent evenings working on dribbling and passing, sometimes using Brandon Ingram's friends as defenders and cutters. Ingram never asked for a day off.  Perhaps Ingram internalized the example of two working parents. For 23 years, Donald Ingram awoke before 4 a.m. to arrive early at the Crown Equipment Corporation forklift plant in Kinston. He got home shortly after 3 p.m., dozed in his recliner, and opened the rec center at 5 p.m. -- where he remained until at least 9 p.m. Editor's Picks      Lowe: Answering the massive questions driving this James Harden trade     Lowe's 10 things: Awesome Lakers, Zion boards and Dort (!)  At the rec center, Brandon Ingram played against men who tried to bully the skinny kid. On defense, Donald would rest his forearm on Ingram's waist, preventing him from moving forward. He demanded his son push back. ""Don't let nobody guide you with the ball!""  Donald Ingram played in various leagues against a younger Jerry Stackhouse, who became Brandon Ingram's AAU coach in Kinston and one of his mentors. During a gathering at Stackhouse's mother's home, Stackhouse challenged Ingram -- then around 12 or 13 -- to one-on-one. When Ingram got the ball, Stackhouse grabbed his off arm with both hands. ""You're not gonna let me hold you, are you?"" he asked. Ten seconds passed, maybe 20. ""Get my damn hands off you!"" Finally Ingram wrenched them off.  In Stackhouse's memory, they did not play one-on-one again until Ingram's senior year. ""He really came at me,"" Stackhouse said, ""and I knew he was ready.""  ""I don't think he wanted anymore smoke after that,"" Ingram said.  As Ingram's star rose at Kinston and on the AAU circuit, teammates and coaches admired how unselfish he remained.  ""He always made the right play,"" said Darnell Dunn, Ingram's teammate at Kinston and on Stackhouse's AAU team.  ""Everyone knew how talented he was,"" Stackhouse said. ""They were happy to say, 'You do you.' But he ain't the 'do you' type. He would hit the open man and know the ball might come back to him.""  The Pelicans have noticed more of that this season. Ingram is making simple plays to keep the offense moving. When defenses trap him, he slips the ball to Steven Adams:  When defenses ignore New Orleans' shaky shooters, Ingram kicks them the ball, confident they will exploit open space. Sometimes, the ball comes back to him -- just as it did in AAU:  ""He's making the right play, and that gets to be contagious,"" Van Gundy said.  In past seasons, Ingram would sometimes either miss simple passes or decline them. He often requested the Pelicans video crew send him compilations of passes he should have made but didn't.  ""The guy watches more film than any player I've been around except maybe Chris Paul,"" Redick said.  He might spot himself settling for midrangers or picking up his dribble when one more bounce would have unlocked something better -- a drop-off to Williamson, or a crosscourt pass for a corner 3.  The dilemma for New Orleans is that Ingram is both their best creator and the best shooter in their starting five. That means the Pelicans sometimes use him as a floor-spacer. It also means many Ingram kickouts go to below-average 3-point shooters.  ""It's my responsibility to have guys out there that can finish those plays,"" Van Gundy said.  If anything, there are possessions where it might be better for Ingram to force it. He has mostly demurred. ""I like his balance so far,"" Van Gundy said. ""You don't want someone who is just looking to pass, but you also don't want a pig.""  Ingram has become a more confident and polished finisher around the basket -- a prolific producer of free throws. Something clicked in the 2018-19 season, his rumor-filled final year with the Lakers, and the development accelerated in New Orleans. Ingram mastered his footwork -- when to use choppy steps in tight creases, and when to gobble up space with loping strides. He finally seemed to understand how long his arms are -- that he was on top of the rim sooner than he had perceived."
"SOMETIME IN OCTOBER 2019, Joe Boylan, then an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans, received an unexpected text from Brandon Ingram -- one of the franchise's new stars, acquired months earlier in the Anthony Davis trade.  ""I trust you now,"" the message began.  Ingram urged Boylan to coach him hard, invited Boylan to ""motherf---"" him if necessary, whatever it took. It was the same message Ingram had delivered to New Orleans higher-ups on his first day there, when he walked into the office of Jeff Bzdelik, then the Pelicans' lead assistant, and declared, ""I think I have greatness in me. I want you to get it out of me, and I don't care what you do,"" several in that room recalled.  Days after that text, Ingram arrived a few minutes late to his appointment at the training table. That was not unusual. Ingram is a night owl. Boylan lit into him in front of the training staff: ""This is why the Lakers got rid of you! This motherf---er wants to be great? No! He wants to be comfortable.""  Boylan's delivery was so over the top, everyone knew it was somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Boylan reminded Ingram that his lateness delayed players behind him on the schedule.  Ingram smiled and took it. ""I like being called out,"" he said. ""Players at this level think they're above that. I'm still a few minutes late sometimes, but I'm much better.""  Perry Tyndall, Ingram's coach at Kinston High School in eastern North Carolina, called out Ingram only once -- when Ingram shrugged and refused to make eye contact as Tyndall criticized Kinston's starters for losing to backups in practice. Tyndall ripped Ingram. He felt bad about it almost right away.  When Tyndall arrived home, he was surprised to receive a text from Ingram apologizing. ""I realized I'm being cussed at for a reason,"" Ingram said. ""If I'm the leader of this team, that is going to trickle down. I had to be sharper. I had to be on top of my s---.""  When Ingram and Stan Van Gundy met at Ingram's rental home in Miami in October for their first sit-down, Ingram told his new coach he was ready for heavy scrutiny. ""What struck me was how self-aware he was,"" Van Gundy said. Ingram admitted to Van Gundy that his defense had slipped as he embraced a larger scoring role. Ingram vowed to improve his playmaking. After earning individual glory -- plus a new five-year, $158 million contract -- Ingram was ready to focus on passing and defense.  ""One of the blessings of him being an All-Star and getting that contract is that he is at peace that you know he's really good,"" said David Griffin, the Pelicans' personnel chief. ""He's just playing his game.""  Van Gundy walked out of Ingram's house and called his brother, Jeff, a decorated coach and current analyst for ESPN. ""This guy,"" Van Gundy told his brother, ""is the real deal.""  Ingram is one of the most important swing players in determining the NBA's balance of power. If he becomes the player he thinks he can be -- a two-way superstar who approaches double digits in assists -- the Pelicans have a chance to contend for titles around Ingram and Zion Williamson. Boylan often told Ingram that New Orleans could win championships if he became their Scottie Pippen.  If Ingram plateaus as an average (or maybe worse) defender and B-plus passer, the Pelicans' ceiling won't reach as high.  Ingram is averaging 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game -- almost identical to his numbers last season. His shooting is down, but he's more dialed in on defense.  Teammates have noticed Ingram moving the ball earlier, but it hasn't resulted in the leap in assists his opening-night near triple-double against the Toronto Raptors portended.  ""That's what you should average,"" JJ Redick, a New Orleans guard, told Ingram after that game.  Redick has been exhorting Ingram since last season that he might average a triple-double, and become a top-10 player.  ""I'm not gonna stop until I'm the best,"" Ingram once replied."
"You nailed this exactly.  I feel like we can't even get to the BI/Zion possible issues because our shooting/shot creation is so abysmal.  Brandon Ingram is great as a ball-dominant player that sometimes leads the charge. That works just fine with Zion. He needs a secondary playmaker who will give him the ball though because he's also a great shooter, and so we need a point guard who can initiate offense and break up defenses.  Zion is still growing on defense, but he's a handful of trouble in the paint and once he picks up more shooting, he's gonna be a tough fucking guy to stop.  They both need a lot of space/a lot of paint and you can take turns running the offense through them. They can still give each other breaks against certain teams with their skillsets, and I think that's a good thing.  But right now, teams don't feel the need to guard anyone else. I've seen guys pay attention to Nickeil Alexander-Walker when he's on the court since his 37pt game, but most defenders can just flatout ignore Bledsoe, Josh, Lonzo, and sometimes even J.J., because Brandon and Zion are way more of a threat."
So is Brandon Ingram undersized wing too?
Eh I like it more from Brandon Ingram though

"but they play in lineups at some point in the game, right? because if not then it's just Brandon Ingram spacing for Zion. so I'm pretty sure they've at least PLAYED together. i said the only shooters he can be in a lineup with. not starting together."
PG Lonzo Ball  SG D'Angelo Russell  SF Brandon Ingram  PF Julius Randle  C    Ivica Zubac  6th Larry Nance
"frankly, I think David griffin set this team up to fail this year. I'm not saying they didn't try to get serge Ibaka or whatever, but I'd certainly do just about anything to avoid putting Zion in a starting lineup with only ONE shooter, and Brandon Ingram. BI is great, but even his shooting has only come on this last season and a half.   i know he was shoring up the defense with Bledsoe and Adams, but theres no excuse for this team composition in the 2020s. lonzo isn't great but he's also set up to fail with this team situation. maybe he's trying to keep him on the cheap by giving him a bad season lol I just don't love it."
I always thought Brandon Ingram had KD potential. It‚Äôs been a blast watching him ball out in NO. This is coming from a Celtics fan lol
"And he was a professional about it , unlike Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart who acted like they were being wronged when the AD trade rumors started. The media also left those players alone and had a field day with the lakers. Different standards ."
"Love it. I googled ""Brandon Ingram Slim Reaper"" and there were a few youtube videos so I'm not 100% crazy. That said, it was KD originally and he apparently rejected it. It suits him better at this stage in their careers.  KD - 2014... It's his"
Brandon Ingram = The Anorexic Reaper
I know what you mean but in some cases he‚Äôs arguably more dimensional than Harden in the sense Kawhi Leonard is more dimensional than Brandon Ingram
"How? Brandon Ingram is a border line all-star. I have no issue with his contract. A 25% max for a ~23 year old borderline all star is much much much better than ~$20M per year for a 25 year old RFA who is never going to be more than a 5th starter.  Look at the recent ones. Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, BI. All looking pretty good. Compare that to Buddy Hield."
Brandon ingram
"Oh, so you‚Äôre saying a guy who started his rookie year barely 19 years old shouldn‚Äôt immediately be thrown in the dumpster because he didn‚Äôt have a hall of fame worthy first season? Brandon Ingram would like a word. Even Kevin Durant only averaged 20 a game on 52% true shooting his first year. Meanwhile he‚Äôs now at 31/7/6. Give guys time. Oladipo and Giannis taught me to not judge a young player until like, their 5th season."
"He was second in the entire league in DRPM. This year he‚Äôs holding his opponents to 37% shooting, even opponents that are all star wings who are eight inches taller (such as Brandon Ingram, who he held to 2-7 shooting for 5 points this past week)"
"People got to realize that these are literally kids playing vs men and most don‚Äôt develop into a top level pro until their mid 20s after a few seasons in the league.  Look at Brandon Ingram who seems to finally be hitting his stride.  Not everyone is going to be a Lebron, Durant, luka and just be good day 1"
"Ah, the Brandon Ingram experience."
Brandon Ingram
"Yeah. Barring a serious injury, I don't think they ever work at very well. Brandon Ingram is still 23 though. So he has the potential to be the star that AD is. But I think LA is pretty happy with what they got. A ring on the first try."
According to the females in my house Brandon Ingram is it in terms of hottest NBA player
This is the type of thread that we will look back on and laugh at the stupid reactionary takes. Like the post comparing Brandon Ingram and Travis Outlaw.
"He‚Äôs still an athletic freak and a 6‚Äô10 PG with great passing, court vision, ball handling, defense, and rebounding. The other guys at the top of his draft class were Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Dragan Bender, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Kris Dunn, etc.     Even now how many of those guys would you take over Simmons? And keep in mind Simmons went straight to averaging 16-8-8 in his rookie year."
"It wouldn‚Äôt do anything. It really wouldn‚Äôt.   Even guys who often shoot outside willingly as the focal point of an offense like Brandon Ingram, LeBron, or Victor Oladipo don‚Äôt get the super hard closeout treatment. You treat all of those guys as drivers first and close out 2 steps short because they‚Äôre league average shooters and if they‚Äôre taking a high volume of 3s instead of doing what they do better (I.e, attacking the rim) you‚Äôre fine living with how bad they hurt you.  Guys like Giannis, Elfrid Peyton, or Ben Simmons are honestly better going downhill more and attacking the basket or distributing the ball to actual shooters."
Good video. One thing I wanna ask is the wisdom of going under on a screen with Brandon Ingram. He‚Äôs dramatically improved his shooting so is it a question of his reluctance to just let it fly?   Also this is nice HD footage. Where do you find it?
Brandon Ingram and get a head start on the next stoner comedy film
"You don‚Äôt think trading all your draft picks 7 years down the road carries a different risk than trading Brandon Ingram and Lonzo for a 26 year old top 5 player to pair with LeBron who you are basically assured of resigning? Clips gave up a lot, but the PG trade was basically a package deal with Kawhi.   What was the Clips title odds before Kawhi and PG? What was the Nets before adding Harden? There is a difference there, and amount of picks are not nearly as oppressive. There is obviously different degrees of risk and how much that risk actually improves your title odds as a team."
Why anfernee look like a mini brandon ingram
I just realized Simons looks like a shorter Brandon Ingram with no tats
Why does anfernee Simons look like brandon Ingram
Literally everything. Brandon Ingram is a poor mans poor man Durant
Defensive Beast Brandon Ingram back at it again
And Brandon Ingram!
Maybe the BBB was Brandon Zion Ingram all along.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Brandon Ingram. I‚Äôm always going to have love for him. I love the way he is always methodical with his game. I love that he has teammates back and is willing to get suspended for them. His offensive game reminds me of the early 2000‚Äôs and his game is just fun to watch. I wish there was a way we could have kept him because I think he‚Äôs going to be an MVP contender for a few years while in his prime. Pelicans you guys take care of him for me please
"Brandon Ingram, Ja Morant, Facundo Campazzo."
Nah back in highschool kd used to get into the paint like he was a big hustling for boards abusing his length over his defenders kd wasn‚Äôt afraid to get down low and do the work   The only player who was ever truely comparable to kd is Brandon Ingram his game seriously reminded me of okc Durant but he failed when he also started to mimic Kobe   When I watch emoni it just doesn‚Äôt feel like I watching a kd breed I‚Äôm just watching a unicorn
"I don‚Äôt think Brandon Ingram is a winning player  I don‚Äôt have stats or anything to back it up, I just don‚Äôt think his play style will ever materialize into wins if he‚Äôs the #1 or #2 option  He‚Äôs got a million moves in his bag and gets to the rim so easily, but it always seems that his footwork and handles always results in a mid range semi contested jumper"
"I never said that. But to be fair the question marks were mostly about his build because we had never seen that archetype of player before, so his stock suffered in that regard. Now that KD has kind of paved the way for emoni and prospects like him it definitely helps his stock. Brandon ingram was raw af but was 2nd overall because he had KD potential. If KD was a prospect in this year‚Äôs draft considering the game and knowing what we know now he‚Äôd go number 1 easily."
"I will not stand for this slander.   Rashard Lewis was basically Brandon Ingram, he was fully qualified to be a #1 offensive option on a contendor.  Hedo was great, too."
"Think they will actually run a play for him now? Or is Brandon ""Kobe Jordan"" Ingram still on his and1 mixtape tour."
If the Pels traded Brandon Ingram for Jerami Grant I would actually kill myself
"The only player with the balls to take the late three was bledsoe, and he couldn't hit a the sky from a hot air balloon. Brandon ingram wants to be THE GUY? He needs to take THE SHOT."
"Fuck Brandon Ingram, what the fuck was that? Down by 3 with five seconds left."
Brandon Ingram is so lazy on defense
"imagine Zion allowed to be 1st option and play bullyball in the paint while having shooters to kick out to.. as good as Brandon Ingram is, i don't think he's a good fit with Zion"
You‚Äôre forgetting Brandon Ingram for the pels and Vucevic for the magic . They Cold AF
Expect they have the top 2 6MOTY instead of Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram?
Luke Walton is by far one of the worst coaches in the league. D'Angelo was terrible in the locker room until he got traded and realized that he was expandable. Julius is having a good year but isn't the kind of guy who can be the first option on a championship team. Brandon Ingram was going to turn into Brandon Ingram no matter what team he ended up on. All of Laker nation is still sad Brandon is gone.
"Brandon ""Kyrie Irving"" Ingram."

"Lakers could really use Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and Brandon Ingram right about now üëÄ"
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
"Trae Young is definitely a snub. Record aside he is averaging 27/10. That‚Äôs better than 99% of the league. Position wise I understand taking randle over Young, and I understand Randle is killing it, but 27/10 has to be a all star appearance surely. If his team was in the playoffs and he averaged the same then he would‚Äôve made it. And he is only 2 games away from the Celtics who have two players. So I think the record definitely hurt Trae.  Brandon Ingram or Fox over Zion for me also. Obviously Zion is unstoppable, future perennial all star and the past couple weeks he has really been the guy, but for me Ingram‚Äôs first half was way better than Zions, and even though Zion has lifted his game, Ingram is still balling the same. Fox has taken his game to another level, the soul piece on the kings and is averaging career highs in everything . I get it would be adding another guard but I genuinely believe fox has had a better year than both Zion and Ingram."

you don't think Brandon Ingram is the best player on that roster?
I‚Äôm not mad about any ASG snubs but I‚Äôm absolutely furious that Brandon Ingram keeps getting snubbed from the snubbed lists
If they would have the Spurs would have Brandon Ingram hart and two 1sts just saying
"If you have NBA 2k21 sometimes Shaq is a guest commentator in the 1st half. They ask him who he thinks is underrated in the NBA and the first player he names is Sabonis, along with Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam"
Brandon Ingram
"yeah that's fine, that's what I'm saying, whoever you want to make the argument that Booker is better than is doable, no positional requirements stand in the way of him getting on. like last year Brandon Ingram got on as the third front court player so you couldn't replace him with a guard.   I'm not super worried bc I think he'll be AD's replacement but still would like to see him get it outright"
"Actually. Ball is a good PG, and has the potential to become a good playmaker. Brandon Ingram is good, but not great. He's being used as a second scoring option behind Zion, which itself is kinda absurd, because Ingram can score in different ways. He's fairly good at midrange and can shoot the ball, unlike Zion, who is not a good shooter. Pelicans have good shooters though. But yeah, the hype that they're getting is kinda unfair on good teams, like the Denver Nuggets, who have an impeccable offensive system. The media didn't even notice the Nuggets, until they eliminated a fully stacked clippers team in the playoffs.  And yeah, iso ball is dying. And it isn't an efficient play as well. Definitely not. I mean, only elite scorers like KD, Harden, Curry, Irving, etc.. can generate efficient iso plays, nowadays."
"imagine CP3 faking an injury.  Silver be like *drumrolls*, ""Brandon Ingram from the New Orleans Pelicans"""
Booker‚Äôs team had a better season last year without Chris Paul than Zion is this year tho. Booker is playing the same and the team is better with CP3. Why does Booker have to take a hit for his team improving?   Also Brandon Ingram is doing also as well as Zion while playing more games. It‚Äôs not like Zion is unanimously the best player just like Booker and cp3. The difference is the suns have a much better record.
Brandon Ingram isn‚Äôt a snub but after Book he would be my next choice as a replacement player
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
Where is Brandon Ingram??
"Or we can ignore the fact that every single season Brandon Ingram got better, averaging better numbers on better efficiency every season. Right before he was diagnosed with that blood clot, he was averaging 20/6/4 in his last 30 games. Post all star break he was averaging 28/7.5/2.5.   But it's because he went to the Pelicans and that's why he's good."
"Yeah we live in an RPG, Brandon Ingram just needed enough EXP points to upgrade his 3 pointer to 40%, not the Pel's  staff who have vastly improved the shooting of many of their players. Totally."
"Enire's replacement is the worst, he just said Luka won most improved player last season and said he didn't deserve it even though Brandon Ingram fully won it. Also said NFL instead of NBA lol, Candace Parker also talks for way too long to say essentially nothing."
Ok Brandon ingram has the most votes out of these guys
"Zion over Brandon Ingram, Demar Derozean, Devin Booker, Deaaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Christian Wood, John Wall, and so many others? I don't agree. Zion's game is limited and his team isn't good. How do the Spurs not have one all star? They're the fifth seed!"
"I mean, the All Star roster hasn't been expanded in fucking ages, and for Sabonis, Bam, Trae Young, Booker, Jimmy Buttler, Brandon Ingram, DeRozen, etc, all not to make it? This season has been a mess due to covid, and by time the year is over, many of these selections will look straight up silly."
"Yeah that‚Äôs my bad there, look I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt have a right as a suns fan to feel slighted, I‚Äôm just saying Zion has been insane this season. They both deserve a spot, the west is just a bloodbath of fantastic players right now and someone is going to miss out. Brandon Ingram has been insane again this year and isn‚Äôt making it when he deserves it just as much as Booker and Zion do. It sucks."
"Zion has been significantly better than Brandon Ingram was last year, I didn't think Ingram should have made it but if he can zion definitely can."
Brandon Ingram. He‚Äôs just so fluid. Moves like a snake through water.
I thought Brandon Ingram was gonna be a huge bust
"Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that was the max available offer for a guy with Dipo's experience and accomplishments.  You can't just sign everyone to the $200m max, it's tiered.  I don't know what the max is this year for him, but considering he's not making all NBA or all star i don't think it'll even be anything close to like a Brandon Ingram deal, or even the pacers offer. Prolly will need to take a prove it deal for a year if anything."
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."

# BRANDON XAVIER INGRAM
"Brandon Ingram is a fucking G, honestly I think this season both Zion/Ingram are having growing pains playing next to each other but starting next season both of these guys will be averaging 25+ kind of like how Tatum/Brown after multiple years are now both killing it"

Brandon Ingram is an ugly mfer. Dude looks permafried.
BRANDON INGRAM
Damn things going so well for the Pels right now Brandon Ingram even rotated on defense
How close is Brandon Ingram to being one of those guys that can singlehandedly tank a defence?
He was once my favorite player but... Brandon Ingram.  Feels like his game is overly iso heavy
That wasn‚Äôt the Brandon Ingram of today though
Give me cp over brandon Ingram
They also lost Brandon Ingram for the rest of the year that season. Rondo missed like 35 games. Lonzo missed in the 30s too.
They also have Steven Adams who is definitely a winning player. Brandon Ingram seems to be pretty good too.
Same shit with Brandon Ingram too
"Yeah, just gotta wait till the end of the season then. Brandon Ingram was doing similar shit last year from midrange through the first half of the year and then predictably regressed to the mean by the end."
"I mean I think hes like Charles Barkley, I just really like CP3 and think he should've won an MVP. Taking one mvp over another isn't that crazy, it isnt like people are doing the ""brandon Ingram --&gt; travis outlaw!!"" takes. Zion is fye with it but there is legitimate concerns about his longevity - you mention he can't legally drink, he also walks like someone who's retired. He's overweight. I get he doesnt use athleticism to it's full extent to extend his career, but it's not even mentioning someone able to run the offense and get everyone involved and score at will is always so valuable."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"I mean, Brandon Ingram was picked right behind him and has improved dramatically from his rookie year.  Ben just isn't going to change his game much.  It is what it is.  It's a myth that players can ""develop"" a shot after they've already made the league - so that's out.  And his other biggest knock is lack of aggression, which was the same knock he had at LSU and even before that - so that's probably not going to change either.  Ben's an amazing player but I don't think we have to wait much longer to see his ceiling."
Brandon ingram got ejected for going for a block and accidentally hitting the back of guy's head. A pure basketball move. This was dirty and intentional as hell.
"You hit the nail on the head brother! ....RJ's jealousy of Zion is the reason I feel Duke didn't go all the way that year...And Brandon Ingram reminds me of same situation..personally, and i have been saying this since Zion came on board that Ingram is gonna hurt the Pels more that help them because of this jealousy that I've seen from the very start..Ingram barely passes the ball to Zion during the game..it's like he only passes it to Zion when he has too! and that's only a couple times a game..what is up with that? I wish the Pels front office could see that Ingram should be traded for someone who has better chemistry with Zion &amp; the rest of the Pelicans.."
"It probably should be (like the coaches), but whatever. You can't really fuck up an all-star draft too badly. What's the worst that can happen, you panic and end up with Brandon Ingram or something?"
That was like a tough midrange like Brandon Ingram would take.
Matters just as much as availability. Tell that to the players that voted for Brandon Ingram over Gobert  FWIW Clarkson is playing the best defense of his career this year
"Your ideal roster should probably have at least one all-star on it.  You're going to take away Brandon Ingram, the closest thing to an all-star, and replace him with guys that are the ones that you live with until you can find something better (plus Myles Turner)."
If Brandon Ingram is a star then it's him.

"With LeBron joining the team, basically all the rookies we drafted besides Brandon Ingram needed a new environment to really max out their potential."
"Wiggins, Jimmy Butler, Brandon Ingram"
Rich man‚Äôs Brandon Ingram
How do I expected the opposite of your enthusiasm about Brandon Ingram
"Zion, alone, allows them to have a place on this list. Now put Brandon Ingram on top of that.   I think their future is brighter than the Suns, whose best player is 35 right now."
Really don't understand how Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball are in the same category as Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram.    Gordon has been in the league for 7 years and hasn't sniffed an ASG. Lonzo will never get there. BI and Brown (and KP for that matter) are already All Stars.
What‚Äôs the hypothetical situation here? Are you asking if you add the likely MVP to any current roster without removing a piece would they benefit from it? I‚Äôm sure if you add Brandon Ingram to any playoff team without removing any player they would become instant favorites.
Gonna give my best guesses here not in any particular order....  Zion  Luka  Tatum  Ja Morant   SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander)  Jaylen Brown   Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Brandon Ingram
I miss Brandon Ingram  and NAW/Hart :(
"He ain't playing, lbr. Nets pulled a fast one.  Where's Brandon Ingram tho, is he injured?"
Gaining weight really isn‚Äôt a given though. See Brandon ingram
"Because teams like the Lakers aren't cash-rich. It's a common misconception that these marquee teams are loaded with cash but they're not. You have to look at the individuals running the teams, not the teams themselves. The Buss family has money, but less than half as much as Steve Balmer, for example. By removing the cap, you'll get owners to sell their teams because they don't want to stick around for the kinds of salaries they'll have to pay and the cash they'll have to shell out. So new owners with new money take over and are willing to spend, like Balmer. A team like the Pelicans have shitty ownership who isn't willing to invest in them because they care about the football team they also own. If the NBA salaries triple for example, they're selling. Who isn't lining up to buy that team with Zion when their growth projections would be off the chart?   As for the middle/low tier player, I don't think this would hurt them at all. By removing the hard cap, you get rid of the limited money problem. So once a team like the Clippers starts to shell out huge money, it will force the other teams to follow suit. Big spenders would increase the overall spending floor. The markets would actually dictate salary unlike now where a guy like Lebron and a guy like Brandon Ingram will count the same percentage toward the cap. They're two different guys in different leagues in terms of impact, so they should be paid accordingly. No cap and no salary restrictions allow for a free market."
"Why do Spurs fans always say this shit? Lakers were willing to give up Ingram in a trade for Kawhi. Unless Woj is a liar now.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks  &gt;The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard, but the Spurs are seeking a far more complete haul of young Lakers players and future picks, league sources said."
Brandon Ingram is better than Zion
If he misses the playoffs for 6 years in a row he can be Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram was the accidental league darling for the first part of the ‚Äò19-20 season.
Brandon Ingram lol
Brandon Ingram.   Dude is a workhorse and I hope he has a wonderful career. He‚Äôs got the tools to be great on both sides of the court.
"Brandon Ingram hasn't played a single season of winning basketball and has struggled to fit alongside elite talents in Lebron James and Zion. He is a ball stopper, a poor defender and doesn't make his teammates better.  There are countless prospects I would rather build around than him."
Brandon Ingram was awful statistically his rookie year
"&gt; The Mavs' relative oRTG was still much better.  This is a cheap cop out because you didnt realize how similar those two were offensively. Just to let you know. ""Relative oRTG"" is just bullshit lol.  As for Bledsoe he has played so much because the young guys werent ready. If we were healthy right now he probably wouldnt be getting as many minutes but we have been missing most of our guards recently.  As for SVG I cannot believe I am still having to say this.  &gt;because Ingram had the green light to hero ball and iso into a turnover or low percentage shot  He did NOT have the green light to do this. Players and SVG psuedo-called him out in the post game almost every time because it wasnt the game plan. One time Stan went so far as to say the ball was supposed to go to Zion but the ""team"" decided otherwise.   &gt;Y'all don't have the roster to be that bad  The thing is we do. Its getting better. Replaced a few net negatives with some positive only to run into injuries when we did so. Shit happens.  &gt; I get that he has a bigger offensive load but Ingram's defense has regressed HARD since his LA days.  Considering the defensive improvements of Zion, Jax, Nickeil, Kira, and even Lonzo over this season, what should that tell you about BI? I know what it says because I havent missed a game all season. Brandon doesnt give any effort on the defensive side of the ball. Its been a major point of frustration for Pels fans. It has 0 to do with Stan either because BI did this last year."
Brandon Ingram and Travis Outlaw  Anytime I hear Outlaws name (which isnt exactly often) its the first thing I think of
"Then people don't know how defense works. Lonzo is aggressively mediocre. And Brandon Ingram plays defense like a turnstyle.   And are we pretending Tim Hardaway doesn't exist? I mean, there's a not even difficult argument that he's better than Lonzo."
I think far better is a stretch. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo would be above KP and Jalen Brunson in most peoples eyes
"No James, you aren‚Äôt Hakeem right out of the gates, are playing like you‚Äôre a rookie, are making rookie mistakes, and are playing one of the hardest positions to learn in NBA.   You‚Äôre a bust. There‚Äôs no more hope for you. Just like how Brandon Ingram is a bust from his first half of rookie year. Right guys?"
"IDK what Pelicans are going to do.  Everything you said *plus* his teammates love him. Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson love him. When he was slumping earlier this year they both vouched hard for him and hyped him up.  We're not as desperate for point guards as the Bulls/Knicks are. We have two forwards who like to run point plus a handful of more guards, but it doesn't make the situation any less tricky."
"The answer is somewhat complicated, but the answer is basically: Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Kira Lewis Jr."
"Zion be like:  *I run shit here*, you just live here! Brandon Ingram ain't got shit on me!"
"4-0 with Gordon in the lineup, he didn‚Äôt play in the Pelicans game. Brandon Ingram won that one for the Nuggets."
That would be the goat Fred Vinson. Brandon Ingram also credits him for helping him become an elite free throw shooter with an insane jump in percentage since last season and great 3 point shooter.
That is not what Gilbert said there was way more nuance than this comment gives credit. This comment does a complete disservice to Gilbert Arenas analysis. He was saying he needs go to moves like Giannis does but Zion will dominate from day 1. It‚Äôs literally in his podcast he talked how they need to play him at point forward for the Pelicans to truly thrive and Brandon Ingram has to be the 2nd killer. That was back in the summer of 2019 before he even played an NBA game. He said the court was going to open up unlike in college and him playing point forward would allow him to get downhill and attack in space. Although I believe to be fair that Gilbert may not have anticipated his finishing would be at this level
"Brandon Ingram was ass his first year, he was probably the worst rookie I've seen become a good player"
"Brandon Ingram may not be a bust but he certainly isn't a ""monster"" looking at his complete game. Have you seen him try to play defense?"
"I mean, his build is more Kevin Durant/Brandon Ingram than a ball handling center."
"I mean, Kevin Durant went #2 overall in his draft, as did Brandon Ingram but yeah there seems to be sort of a trend. I think it's due to the fact that the team who picks second likely misses out on the clear cut best player, so they try to reach for the player with the most upside to try to make up for it."
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
"The combined people out from both teams would make a playoff team.  Trae Young, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williams, John Collins, Danillo Gallinari, Cameron Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Josh Hart, Kris Dunn."
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Hawks chance of winning (injured players) is out  EDIT:  &gt;Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart have all been ruled out for tonight's game vs Atlanta, per the Pelicans. (twitter.com)  any chance of me viewing this game is out"
Pretty cool post. I think the closest in recent times was last season when Brandon Ingram put the Pelicans up 1 with 0.2 seconds remaining against Utah.      Ingram had 49 that game and Mitchell had 46 in an amazing contest between two young scoring phenomenons.
"I'm not sure if this is the exact definition being used, but **worst FG% in final 5 minutes of 4th Q or OT with score within 5 points this season (min. 30 FGA in that situation)**  |Player|Season|Tm|FG|FGA|FG%| |:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:| |Devin Booker|2020-21|PHO|15|56|.268| |Malik Beasley|2020-21|MIN|10|34|.294| |Buddy Hield|2020-21|SAC|11|37|.297| |Ja Morant|2020-21|MEM|10|32|.313| |Tyler Herro|2020-21|MIA|11|35|.314| |**Kawhi Leonard**|2020-21|LAC|11|35|.314| |Donovan Mitchell|2020-21|UTA|14|42|.333| |Jimmy Butler|2020-21|MIA|13|38|.342| |Dillon Brooks|2020-21|MEM|13|38|.342| |Brandon Ingram|2020-21|NOP|17|49|.347|  [Full list](https://stathead.com/tiny/G0PFQ) Generated 4/2/2021."
Brandon Ingram is fucking hot. I‚Äôm a woman. I‚Äôd do him so fast.
Brandon Ingram belongs somewhere on the list
"&gt;you need spacing is a myth.  I don't think it's been hard for him to adapt at all. He'll just finish through five guys. I'll say, it's been hard for Brandon Ingram though. I hope we get more space for BI."
"&gt; If we imagine the NBA decided to put all its players and coaches in a draft, and let the 30 teams pick among them, I think Stevens would probably go in the top 30 or 40 -- that is, late in the first round or maybe early in the second. That would put him in the same range as current or future All-Star players.  This was a bad take at the time, as was this one from KOC:  &gt; There‚Äôs not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He‚Äôs undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I‚Äôd take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he‚Äôs ahead of high lottery picks. I‚Äôd take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range.  If Stevens were worth $20 million per season, teams would be offering him $20 million per season. But the very top coaches make half that much, despite the fact that their salaries don't count against the cap or the tax."
"Lamelo, Lou Williams, Brandon ingram, lebron, boogie.  (Lamelo recently passed Dion waiters since the later is not in the league rn)  I think that‚Äôs a 2nd round team maybe but they‚Äôd be awful defensively"
I'm 8 inches taller but only 10 or so pounds heavier and I'm not exactly skinny like Brandon Ingram or Bol Bol. If that's accurate that's pretty impressive.
"PG -- Chris Paul   SG -- Jrue Holiday      SF --  Brandon Ingram   PF --  Zion   C -- Anthony Davis    BONUS: 6th Man: David West     Literally everybody else would have some sort of Asterisk of ""Well, but...."" I'm pretty sure Shoeless Joe Jackson might qualify as our 7th man."
"Chris Paul, Jrue Holiday, Glen Rice, Anthony Davis, and Alonzo Mourning starting with Larry Johnson, Zion, Brandon Ingram, Baron Davis, and Dell Curry (I guess I don't remember too many more Pelicans guards tbh) as the second unit. The Pelicans all time team would be fun."
"My predictions:  NBA 1st Team: Embiid / Giannis / Jokic / Luka / Lillard   NBA 2nd Team: Zion / LBJ / Tatum / Curry / Beal   NBA 3rd Team: Vucevic / Kawhi / Tatum / Irving / Harden  There's an outside chance he wins it over Vuce, but it'll be close. You also can't rule out Brandon Ingram if he can get the Pelicans into the play-in tournament, Davis if he comes back and dominates the rest of the way (doubtful), and Butler/Bam might be in the mix.  I think it's fringe he makes it in there, but there's a chance at least."
"Just comparing it to the AD trade, which is the closest comparison in terms of level of player, they didn‚Äôt even come close to the same level of return. Obviously the nets didn‚Äôt have a Brandon Ingram type player but a promising prospect plus picks should be the return. Harden also had 1 more year on his contract which gives them leverage"
"Except they traded away Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, and picks for one of those players. Those three are all 1st rounders and two of em are top lottery picks.  But ya, if Lebron joins any team that team is now a contender and needs to push some chips in. Fortunate that LA got Bron, Bron could join half the teams in the NBA and those teams would automatically become a contender if they weren't before."
"If a young star on their first extension requests a trade, the Thunder have more capital than just about anyone to bid for that player. PURELY hypothetical (please don't take this the wrong way Wolves/Rockets/Pels fans), but let's say a KAT, or Christian Wood, or Brandon Ingram caliber player requests a trade this offseason. The Thunder could put together a trade package probably better than anyone else in the league to go grab one of those guys.   Not a knock on Lauri, but I think the Thunder would set their sights a little higher than a player of his level."

"So also an incredibly dumb play by Brandon Ingram, nice."
[I will forever remember long boi ](https://gfycat.com/dangerousnextdotterel-angeles-brandon-houston-rockets-ingram)
Brandon Ingram was dying along with the rest of us... lol
We are all Brandon Ingram today lmao
"I don't think it will be either of those guys.  It's gotta be someone with multiple years on his deal, or has ties to Oklahoma/ the Thunder, or is on a rookie scale deal.   Ben Simmons has been in a lot of trade rumors. Jaylen Brown maybe? Trae Young? Brandon Ingram? Deandra Ayton?"
"I was at the Smoothie King Center that night (lucked out that the tickets I bought at the beginning of the season happened to be his debut). Even though I was cheering for the Spurs, I couldn't deny how insane the atmosphere was in that building. From the anxiousness during those first 3 quarters to the absolute explosion in the 4th to the disappointment/frustration when he sat, it's a night I won't soon forget. Underrated part of that night was the ""WE WANT ZION!"" chants during a fairly important trip to the free throw line for Brandon Ingram. I was like ""I bet that feels great for BI"".  Also Lonnie almost murdered someone during this game (I think in the 1st)."
"Good lord with the assumptions here, and I'm a fellow Nuggets fan! Jesus man..   I would contend we traded for Gordon because he's way, way better at guarding multiple positions and especially bigger wings and athletic 4s while being a body type/athlete we didn't previously have, and he's a much better offensive player than Dozier as well. This does not mean Dozier is incapable of guarding 3s competently. He spent time on Brandon Ingram both Pelis games and did mostly ok on him for instance, and he's done well against other 3s too. The issue is he's not a very good offensive player, and he's not big enough to guard guys like LeBron and that ilk, and even if he was - you wouldnt want him playing more than 20 minutes a night. You can't have just one guy though who can guard some 3s in limited minutes and be successful. And of course Gordon is a huge upgrade over him guarding 3s, while being a huge upgrade over Millsap/JMG guarding athletic 4s at the same time.   I'm just going to go back to what was supposed to be my main point earlier, saying we don't miss Torrey Craig at all and PJ Dozier is probably a better player than TC3."
"3s &gt; layups is untrue. The whole point of a layup is that it is the most efficient shot in the game. 2*0.68 = 1.36- similar to shooting ~45 percent from three. That‚Äôs Curry level. The pelicans are at the bottom of the west is because they‚Äôre a poor team, Brandon Ingram isn‚Äôt an upper echelon player yet, and because the roster surrounding Zion and BI can‚Äôt hit open jump shots or play above average defence. I don‚Äôt even like Zion but you‚Äôre speaking nonsense."
Brandon Ingram is a generational scoring talent. is this statement seriously controversial
"Usually players who are young and with high potential. To mind Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Lamelo Ball, John Collins, Ja Morant, Murray, Mitchell, MPJ. B- tier players that could probably go to A - tier. BI Murray and Mitchell are already all-stars."
Probably LaMelo. But if we're excluding players on rookie contracts i'd say Brandon Ingram.
Coulda had Brandon Ingram üòû
"So because the roster could get even better means their bench wasn't good? What kind of logic is that, there's always room for improvement.   The Lakers were the only team in the league that had 2 superstars. The only reason the Clippers were favored was because of their better supporting cast. If they had an equal bench to the Lakers, the Lakers would've been favored.  Not to mention, that definition of 3 all stars is dumb and I personally don't agree with it. Would you really act like Brandon Ingram joining the Jazz would give them a super team? How is it I and most others would still choose a healthy Lakers team / ""non super team"" over them?"
"I wouldn't describe Brandon Ingram as ""very okay"" or group him with D'Lo and Lonzo."
"I feel like Fox, Shai or Demar should have been in the game prover Mike Conley and they only put him in there bc he has never been. and I said Kings PLAYERS get no love the team doesn't deserve love but Buddy, Fox and Haliburton definitely deserve their credit, bc if you think players don't deserve credit for doing really good but having a bad team Bradley Beal, Christian Wood, KAT, Lavine, Brandon Ingram and Zion should get no love either."
Brandon Ingram
"You guys are spoiled. Even getting playable big wings is hard in the NBA these days, there's a reason guys like Harrison Barnes and Otto Porter keep getting huge contracts. Brandon Ingram is a huge plus at that position, even on his current max contract."
Brandon Ingram?
" ‚Ä¢ Brandon Ingram and KD have similar height, length, body structure, handle, and shooting touch, why isn't Ingram as good as KD was at 23? What does he lack?  This is something that happens often in sports so your question is quite common and can be applied to numerous players.  Look back at the '90s and all the ""next jordans"" that failed.  There always something more than just physical features.   Love Ingram but he goes on these weird cold streaks where he's just really below average it's frustrating as Ingram-stan.  Van Gundy puts the ball in his hands way too late in the game when it should have gone to Zion."
"Honest question, didn‚Äôt watch the game: why is Brandon ingram still taking shots over zion?"
Tell that to Brandon Ingram
I was thinking pelicans need him. Brandon Ingram for CJ

"People keep saying to ship out Lonzo. But he's the perfect accompaniment to Zions game. Since Zions first season It's obvious he's a generational talent and they should build the team around him. With that in mind they should ship out Brandon Ingram, because he'll never be a #2 and his iso heavy game doesn't work with Zion. Brandon ingram could be a Franchise player too, just not this franchise."
Huh? Dude I love Ingram Lmfao. He‚Äôs a phenomenal player currently. But BRANDON INGRAM IN HIS THIRD YEAR WAS NOT BETTER THAN CURRENT JEREMI GRANT. Maybe Current Brandon Ingram is better than Current Jeremi Grant? But that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre saying.  Who‚Äôs image am I protecting you weirdoüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ it‚Äôs not that deep üíÄüíÄ
"Ok? His scoring would take a hit sure. But Grant‚Äôs defense is 100x that of Ingram‚Äôs. There‚Äôs more to the game than scoring a basket. Clearly your evaluation methods are only points and nothing outside of that if you sincerely think Grant right now is not a better player than a third year Brandon Ingram lol. I‚Äôm literally a Lakers fan dude. I watched every single game Brandon Ingram played in for 3 straight years, and I‚Äôm taking current Jeremiah Grant over 3rd year Brandon Ingram 100 out of 100 times lol"
"This is the issue you have with young talented team Brandon Ingram has mindset to be number player in his prime. Zion Williamson is a talented player starting to tap into his potential, but better than Brandon Ingram in helping the team win. SVG is having difficult time relaying that message effectively to all those players. Some are not accepting, and understanding the reasons."
"I dont feel like going back through all of them but the Pacers game was a 10 point lead with 2min left, and 6 points with 25 sec left. We lost by 2 in regulation.  &gt;  According to ESPN, the Pelicans were just third team in 8,107 games to blow at least a six-point lead in the final 25 seconds of regulation over the past decade.  This was just the 7th game of the season, and nothing's changed:  &gt; When the games get tight and the clock runs low, the Pelicans fall into a peculiar pattern.  &gt; Basically, the ball goes to Brandon Ingram. And then he‚Äôs responsible for everything.  So yeah, this was a pretty common choke for us.  https://www.nola.com/sports/pelicans/article_ecdf2ad0-4fab-11eb-a97e-cffc9ecc0efc.html"
An 88% free throw shooter in Brandon Ingram missing 2 free throws while up 3 points was astonishing.
It what world are Brandon Ingram and Donovan Mitchell on the same level? I don't think anything thinks Ingram is better than Simmons. Mitchell is definitely better.
Brandon Ingram is not an enjoyable basketball player to watch
Are you talking about Brandon Xavier Ingram?
Same for Brandon Ingram...
Brandon Ingram thinks he's the Pelicans closer. That's why they're a lottery team. Get it to Zion
Brandon Ingram actually sucks.i bet I could bench more than his squat
Give Brandon Ingram this years Jazz and he could do it
"This town of 20,000 people town yielded Brandon Ingram, Jerry Stackhouse, Mitchell Wiggins, Reggie Bullock, Cedrick Maxwell, and Dwight Clark (49er who made The Catch). That‚Äôs insane."
"i don't think he should be grouped with those guys either. he's in the tier right below, more comparable to someone like brandon ingram."
Morant   Tatum   SGA   Brandon Ingram  Joel   Lineup would be  Morant   SGA  BI  Tatum   Joel  Love the perimeter defense and the play making between all of them.
"LeBron doesn‚Äôt have Tatum and brown caliber players, young stars who wanna get their own shot and show they are great. Those guys love kyrie, terry Rozier was apart of those chemistry issues too and bringing Gordon Hayward in, it was quite the situation. And Brandon Ingram played miles better after playing with LeBron, Bron wasn‚Äôt That great of a leader in 18-19 when he was playing with young stars was he?    he usually has a superstar, and/ or a veteran all star and a bunch of role players who just stand and shoot 3s...which is an optimal situation for him.  And I‚Äôm not saying kyrie is as good as LeBron or something anyway I‚Äôm just saying kyrie is treated too harshly for those years that‚Äôs all"
Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram
"Yep. If he does pan out at his ceiling, it's probably going to be closer to a Brandon Ingram-like trajectory where he takes a couple of years to develop (and is still developing)."
"Brandon Ingram in his rookie year is very bad, i think at some point or maybe his rookie szn he's the worst shooting in the league."
Clips defense was joke city  Started with their franchise players neither PG nor Kawhi gave a shit tonight on that end  For the pels you know it‚Äôs your best game of the year when even Brandon Ingram is getting back in transition. Didn‚Äôt know what I was watching.
I love Brandon Ingram in the backcourt
This man just said Brandon Ingram for brook lopez üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"lmfao   turn brandon ingram into brook lopez, perfect"
"&gt;Bruh there‚Äôs a difference between discounting the rookie year and acting like it didn‚Äôt matter by somehow comparing it to college years like you did.   Rookie years don‚Äôt change sophomore year stats. If someone had a good rookie year you would expect them to have a good sophomore year and you would expect someone who didn‚Äôt have a good rookie year to have worse sophomore comparably.   &gt; No I wouldn‚Äôt be over here. You tried to send a shot at a player on my team by acting like RJ Barrett is on track to somehow be above him  yeah you would lmao, can‚Äôt have someone making any comparisons to your boy.   &gt;Naw you could make comparisons but again as I just said the way you said it you meant for it to be a shot, don‚Äôt get mad when people see it that way. You‚Äôre too smart for that  yeah cos every comparison is a shot. funny how your only response has been ‚Äúwaaahh look at the rookie years!!‚Äù and ‚Äúwaaahh don‚Äôt compare him to my boy compare him to someone else!!‚Äù   &gt; And you mention ‚ÄúAge,Draft Pick, College‚Äù what about Brandon Ingram then? What about Jabari Parker then? They‚Äôre Duke too, what so because they were the #2 pick instead of 3rd you decided to go with Tatum? Knock it off you had Tatum on your mind  Because Tatum is the better player? Why wouldn‚Äôt I compare him to Tatum?   &gt; When he wasn‚Äôt that though, I didn‚Äôt spend my time saying ‚Äúwow look at how much better Tatum‚Äôs numbers are than insert player on a team in which I hate‚Äù  yeah, no one ever compared his stats to other superstars when they were younger.  This post is literally the first time anyone has compared anyone‚Äôs sophomore stats with someone else‚Äôs.    &gt;I made a thread a month ago, saying ‚Äúwho‚Äôs gonna make the all star team first him or Herro?‚Äù. I knew about Barrett before you did most likely. It‚Äôs the fans like you who ruin it  Wow man you knew about him a month ago? Teach us casuals how to stay up to date on young players pls"
That brandon ingram body type.
"Not a Spurs fan obviously, but I think it's a solid framework for a team. I don't think they have anyone who's going to be a consistent All-NBA player or anything like that, but they've got some good pieces throughout their roster that a top level player (especially a top level wing) would turn into a legitimately threatening team.   Of course, that's way easier said than done. It's remarkably unlikely that they'll be able to sign someone to be that piece given that it's San Antonio (Jimmy Butler honestly probably was their best shot there, but even then, that clearly wasn't a likely scenario at all), you can't count on drafting someone like that when you're a fringe playoff team, and I don't see how they could trade for someone like that while retaining the pieces that would make it all work.   Like you said, it's hard getting to the point of being a genuinely good team that's a legit championship threat. There's just not that many guys that are actually capable of being the best player on a contending team, and getting any of those players takes immense luck and (generally) an equally large investment, particularly when you're a small market team. I honestly don't know where I'd say they should go from here when working within the timeframe of Pop's likely remaining years. I don't think they have the assets to move up for a top draft pick, which then leads me to looking at the top players on underperforming teams that maybe could make that next step under a top level coach like Pop. Even then, though, that's a pretty barren list filled with a ton of maybes and ifs, and you basically are locked in once you make those moves given the limits of their draft capital. The best players that I think they could realistically get considering team circumstances would be players like Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, and others like them. Really good players for sure, but do I think any of them (or even all of them) would be enough to put the Spurs into a contending window? Not really, no."
It‚Äôll be fun until all 5 Brandon ingram get back cut while ball watching (yes even the one guarding the ball) and then it turns into a lay-up drill.
"There will also rarely be teams, if any, that can accurately guard all 5 Brandon Ingrams at once. I‚Äôm not even a BI fan but as long as there isn‚Äôt a 16th Brandon Ingram as coach, you can have an easy matchup every possession, especially when the other team has to put their bench in."
"On the other hand if there's a player on the other team Brandon Ingram can't guard, you have zero ways to solve that problem."

Cp3   Klay thompson ( if healthy if not give me CJ McCollum)  Brandon Ingram   KD   AD
My guess is Dearon Fox and Brandon Ingram. I could see Ben Simmons either being traded or asking for one if he keeps regressing on offense or the team has a couple more early exits

"I actually care more about Brandon Ingram than Lonzo. I'm just not an idiot, which seems like its too hard for you to do"
KD Brandon ingram  Luka
Okay but is Brandon Ingram just a worse Travis Outlaw or what?
"I've watched a few because im a Brandon Ingram fan but its tough watching Adams clog up the paint and make it harder for Zion and BI to score, Bledsoe chucking, and Lonzo being forced to give up the ball at half court and severly underutilized"
"Try to turn Bledsoe, Lonzo, Adams into:  Myles Turner, Kyle Lowry  Maybe a sign and trade featuring Lonzo/Adams to get Lowry this offseason, and then whatever you need try to get Myles turner while also getting rid of Bledsoe. Gonna have to throw some picks in to get him.   Ideally that turns your starting lineup in New Orleans into:  Kyle Lowry, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Myles Turner  That is certainly a playoff caliber starting 5, maybe even a team that can get home court advantage. At that point you need to fill in the bench. I'm not educated enough on their bench pieces now to know who is worth keeping, but Lowry and Turner would be my Plan A."
Yeah right theyre gonna lose in the playoff to former Lakers Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball by 30
"Adams is a good rim protector, but he absolutely cannot defend PNR. With Adams on they have a 117 DRtg, and without they have a 111. Even with Brandon Ingram off (who is the worst perimeter defender in the Pels lineup) and Adams on, they have a 120.  There's a reason why he got played off the floor vs the Rockets last year in the playoffs.  Yes they need a good defending 3 as well."
Brandon Ingram
The spacing argument is kinda flawed tho. We have a good percentage but that‚Äôs because we only take WIDE open shots. We‚Äôre 27th in 3 point shot attempts. Brandon Ingram is still way better than rj and Lonzo is a lot better than everyone else on our team. That team is way better than us on paper
Bro you good man. It‚Äôs not that serious. I‚Äôm a die hard lakers fan but I‚Äôm also a big Brandon Ingram fam. So after they traded him I started supported the pelicans and now I am fan of two teams.
"What are your thoughts on someone like Brandon Ingram who‚Äôs %s went from 62%, 68%, 67.5%, 85%, 88%? Is he an outlier in terms of improvement? I feel like even if you do practice free throws you can make an improvement. There‚Äôs always ways to be more consistent with your form (something that LeBron really lacks)."
A healthy Shaun Livingston is a perennial all-star similar to Brandon Ingram. (Bold statement. I know.)
The next Brandon Ingram
"Will the trade talk you might say Lonzo Ball for the Pels, but lowkey I think it's Brandon Ingram. He's struggling to play with Zion, he's struggling in the clutch and he's struggling with defense."
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
it's actually probably Brandon Ingram for us at this point.

"If Warriors sneak into the Playoffs I think Andrew Wiggins is going to be the most underrated player in the Playoffs because the changes in gameplay seen in the Playoffs are conducive to Wiggins strengths as a mid range operator and his 1v1 defence has improved immensely (2nd in league for OPP FG% at one stage this season, still up there).  He is a guy who relishes  pull up mid range shots and in the Playoffs that‚Äôs the shot teams are willing to give up defensively. I think his offensive game has some similarities to Kawhi in this sense (obviously not as talented as Kawhi) and he can capitalise in some similar ways.   Defensively this year Wiggins has been a guy that‚Äôs taken the opponents best perimeter player and had taken a few scalps defensively this year (Brandon Ingram in the recent mini series with Pelicans). In the Playoffs there will be a greater value on this ability to keep as tight a lid as can be expected on the elite perimeter scoring talent in the league these days.     Tl;dr: Kawhi‚Äôs game/strengths is more suited to ‚ÄúPlayoff‚Äù style basketball and Andrew Wiggins‚Äô strengths this year have been similar so he can be a store brand Kawhi style player in the Playoffs"
"Mine might be a bit of a hot take but it‚Äôs low key been a dream line up of mine for a while.   $4 Ben simmons, Brandon Ingram  $3: SGA  $2. Lamelo and ayton.  That‚Äôs a team where literally everyone could beat you."
"Oh shit, I can actually make one of my dream line ups, might be a bit of a hot take:    $4 Ben simmons, Brandon Ingram  $3: SGA  $2. Lamelo and ayton."
"I think that's the right type of question to ask, so not sure why people are downvoting you (-4 at the time I'm leaving this comment). Someone like Brandon Ingram to go from solid and mostly unremarkable to All-Star is a really big leap. But how much does it actually help his team win? Contrast that to someone like Giannis two seasons ago or Curry 6 seasons ago to go from All-Star to MVP level and ask how much that helps their teams win.   The tradition of the award is that it usually goes to players making the leap to All-Star (or nearly so) level. However, it's worth discussing if the leap from All-Star to MVP ballot is a more important leap."
"I‚Äôm in the championship too but I have goddamn Lebron and jaylen brown and Brandon Ingram and Christian wood and all those fuckers missing games. Anderson had a baller game last night tho, dude consistently fills up the stat sheet, can make you some 3s, score double digits, get you assists, get 5+ rebounds, get you a steal and close to a blk, he‚Äôs really a super underrated fantasy player because he helps you in so many categories and that‚Äôs valuable."
"&gt; &gt;1. **Re-Sign Lonzo Ball or let him walk?**   Let RFA play out. New Orleans has the upper hand in regards to holds. Work out a S&amp;T if the price looks to get to be too much.   &gt; &gt;2. **What to do with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?**   Move Bledsoe as salary ballast for a bigger move as MKE did, using actual assets to offset his poor value on the court. This is preferable this off season but could be pushed to trade deadline.   Adams is... Fine. At 17M he's not a value, but not crippling. Jaxson Hayes or a better acquired C can easily take his minutes as season goes on. Again, could be moved as salary ballast in off season or at the deadline.   &gt; &gt;3. **Keep coach Stan Van Gundy?**   SVG is going nowhere. He was brought in for long term development and stability. Considering the next to no off season and limited practice time this season, the individual development of young players has been fine. Team defense has actually improved as the season has gone on. He's likely not the answer for a contender, but he'll get at minimum one more year.   &gt; &gt;4. **What to do with Brandon Ingram?**   Ingram has already been paid. He is a big question long term if his defense doesn't improve, but they will give him at least another year unless the perfect fit alongside Zion becomes available. He fits well with the city of New Orleans and star level players actually wanting to be here should not be taken for granted. If he regresses in fit/defense this can and will be revisited next off season."
"Love this post.   I think Zach lavine and Brandon Ingram are other great examples this year.   Hyper efficient scorers who don‚Äôt seem to elevate their teams as much as you‚Äôd think (obviously neither are close to KD in impact incase anyone thinks that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm making).  I think it stems from an inability to truly warp defences how guys like curry, harden, lebron and jokic etc do.   It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so high on Zion, because he‚Äôs shown that immense defence warping offensive ability, and has shown a knack for being able to find the open man and find lapses in the defence with the occasional slick pass."
"Cooper aint that high on the big boards, but I believe he's going to be a steal in the draft and go mid to late first. I agree on the Green take since his scoring and athleticism is already so good but the risk is higher on him than Cade. I compare these two players to Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram that one draft, you can't really lose with either but Simmons and Cade in this case is the clear cut number one"
Selfish decision .. Wiggins and Brandon Ingram are two of the scariest d00dz in the league
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"Do you honestly think merch sales is an indicator? Do you think the worldwide market was rushing to grab a sweet Brandon Ingram Jersey? No, it was propped up by people buying Kobe jerseys post retirement. Pure raw dollars won‚Äôt tell you a whole lot, you would need a metric like $ per estimated fan.   And I wasn‚Äôt talking about you as an individual, I was talking about the overall fan base. Getting tickets to staples in 16/17 and 17/18 was they easiest task."
"&gt; I know, but he also gets a better selection of shots next to curry. Plus his volume is lower.   Well, yeah.  Dude's 26. He's just now *approaching* the age at which most basketball players hit their prime.  It's not actually that much of a knock on him that he wasn't ready to carry a team that notably still sucks without him. The expectations on him prior to this were insane, and then not only did fans shit on him for not meeting them... the *team* kinda did, too.  The Warriors celebrate him for playing lockdown D, which is *all* effort (although, seriously, did Brandon Ingram specifically piss in his cornflakes at some point?) and for playing within the offense - he's not expected to BE the offense.  When the Warriors lose, it's not declared to be *his fault*."
"Why do ruffles have ridges?  Also, did I make the right decision when I bought my pelicans Brandon Ingram jersey over Zion and JJ Reddick (rip)?"
I imagine you haven't been able to watch a lot of Warrior games - Wiggins has been absolutely a stud as an on ball defender.  He's currently absolutely bothering Brandon Ingram and has guarded the best perimeter guy for the last 3 months while scoring 18PPG on career high shooting.
I'd find a way to get Stephen adams from the pelicans. Maybe figure out a package including a sign and trade for  Lonzo. Shoot I'd take Brandon Ingram too if they offered him   Basically both teams would be better off swapping a few players between them
"Yeah, wish Zion played next to Brandon Ingram, who was an All Star last year..."
Brandon Ingram in his mind thinks he is better than Zion. That is okay. But it‚Äôs not okay if he wants to be on this team.
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
"&gt;""If you're team Brandon Ingram, you're team Black Widow tonight""  Black Widow died so this is spot on"
What symbol is Brandon Ingram as he runs back to defend Curry? What symbol is Draymond? I don't know enough about Marvel to recognize all the references.
"Oh you want to play this game ok. Let‚Äôs start off with Julius Randle, he‚Äôs averaging 24/10/6 on 46/42/80 splits and 57 TS% leading the knicks to the 4th seed currently.   D‚ÄôAngelo Russell is averaging 19/2/5 on 42/38/78 splits and 55 TS%. He‚Äôs been unhealthy this year but he‚Äôs been a good secondary star to KAT.   Brandon Ingram is averaging 24/5/5 on 46/38/87 splits and 58 TS%. He‚Äôs not a good defender but he‚Äôs a great offensive player on a young pelicans team.   Lonzo Ball is averaging 14/4/5 on 42/37/78 splits and 55 TS%. He‚Äôs been playing like an elite role player this year and last year. He‚Äôs been getting better every year so there‚Äôs no reason to doubt he won‚Äôt get better.   Kuzma is averaging 12/6/1 on 43/46/68 splits and  54 TS%. He‚Äôs clearly taking. Complimentary role since AD arrived and I love that he‚Äôs accepted his role. He went from a good scorer to a role player who tries to do a little of everything. He‚Äôs a good team player.   Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17/4/2 on 41/34/92 splits and 54 TS% and is a main part of one of the best teams in the league  Larry Nance and Jason Hart and really good role players as well.   This sub said Russell, Lonzo and Ingram were bust but they‚Äôve all turned out to be good players. Randle has even exceeded expectations and is playing phenomenal. Maybe we as fans of the team watch them play more and therefore we have a better understanding of how good a player can get.   You say Laker fans over value their young guys but show me a fan base who doesn‚Äôt."
"The 7 and 8 seed has never won the finals. You could make the argument that they shouldn‚Äôt even make the playoffs.   The play in prevents the 9, 10, and potentially the 11 and 12 seeds from tanking, especially so early in the year. It provides for better regular season basketball.    A few weeks ago Zion and Brandon Ingram were both hurt for the Pels as the 12th seed. In normal years they just give up and both still may not be back yet."
"&gt;If you can't take constructive criticism on how to format arguments properly  From someone who has not even attempted an argument.  Why on earth would I do that?  &gt;Your entire argument consists of ""You suck and I'm smarter than you"" as well as ""I have evidence, you're wrong.""   Actually, if you could read, which seems very much in doubt at this juncture, you would see that I posted my actual evidence very early on.  No one chose to comment on that evidence, particularly not you.  Instead, you chose pathetic ad hominem attacks, for the obvious reason that you have no counter argument at all.  &gt;Not a single person believes you because you don't actually respond.  I have responded to each and every comment.  None contained any arguments to speak of, but I took the time to respond anyway.  &gt;You're literally arguing against nobody when you say ""Nobody has provided evidence against my claim"" because nobody HAS to provide evidence.   When I have already provided evidence proving the point, then yes, you and anyone else questioning do precisely need to provide counter evidence, or, frankly, just be quiet.  &gt; You didn't actually respond to me.   You have not posted one word worthy of a response, and yet I'm wasting my time educating you.  &gt;You probably know ""I'm willing to bet"" is a phrase that isn't meant to be taken literally, I didn't actually mean that.   Don't hurt yourself backpedaling so fast.  Don't say things you don't mean, if you don't want to be called on them, and embarrassed.  &gt;My point was that if you reread what say, MazKhan said at the start, it debunks the point.   Pick better allies.  That person did not even know about the trades I specified.  They challenged me to find one such trade -- I posted two, and they ran away, embarrassed.  &gt; And if you REALLY so badly want me to debate you   Honestly, I'd prefer you just say ""Thank you"" and remain quiet.  &gt;unless you can without a shadow of a doubt prove that Brandon Ingram would have made that buzzer beater with the Lakers or gotten them that far without making any assumptions, then the AD trade was a success.   Utter nonsense.  You cannot prove that Ingram would not have had a bubble campaign just like Davis' or better.  Or Ball.  Or Hart.  Or Hunter.  Or Zubac.  Or more to the point, that the combination of those five, plus whatever the Lakers did with that future draft capital would not have won last year and left the Lakers in far better shape for the next decade.  There are precious few NBA players who are better than 5 good NBA players combined, and Davis has never shown himself to be one.  &gt;If you can't, it successfully proves that AD was a net positive, making that trade good.   It proves nothing of the sort.  &gt;I don't even need to reiterate the Knicks flair MCzebo33's point on how valuable AD was to the team.   And why did Davis win nothing in New Orleans if he's so good?  Why is New Orleans' winning percentage this season better than all but two of Davis' seasons there?  Even though New Orleans only received part of what Los Angeles traded for Davis, and hasn't gotten to execute any of the picks yet, they are already better without him.  &gt;The fact is, you CAN'T prove that Lonzo would have developed enough to make that shot, so you can't prove your case.   More nonsense.  Ball is a better shooter from three than Davis, so he's more likely to have made that shot.  So is Ingram.  Hell, I might be a better three-point shooter than Davis.  You're going to have to do much better if you hope to avoid embarrassment here.  &gt; Nobody cares if the Blazers traded away Moses and still won a ring but they lost the trade   If you don't care about the point, why are you wasting my time?  Just go remain ignorant and quiet in a corner somewhere.  &gt;It's about the Lakers and if they won the trade. You objectively cannot prove this, it is why nearly every single comment you've made has been downvoted.   Nothing can be proven to your ridiculous standard -- including your claim.  &gt; Your argument fundamentally doesn't work because you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that they could have had that success without any assumptions.   And you cannot prove that the Lakers would lose last year without Davis.  And you cannot prove that the Lakers would not win multiple titles with all those players and picks they traded away.  &gt;  Jimmy Butler trade hypotheticals don't work because you're assuming that the NBA landscape is the same then and the debate devolves into fanfiction.   See, this is another example of you talking out of your asshole on a topic you nothing about.    Butler was traded on July 6, 2019.  The exact same day Anthony Davis was.  Better luck next time."
"If you can't take constructive criticism on how to format arguments properly, you can stick to losing all your debates and getting laughed at man. I didn't even use ad hominem either lmfao. Your entire argument consists of ""You suck and I'm smarter than you"" as well as ""I have evidence, you're wrong."" You just said I lost the bet but you still haven't provided evidence. Your entire argument fundamentally lacks structure because every time you say things like ""You're wrong, you lost that bet."" and ""No one has disproven me"" as well as ""Why can no one prove me wrong?"" or ""I've already debated this"" you aren't bringing up points. The people you're trying to convince of your relatively unpopular take will not believe you. Not a single person believes you because you don't actually respond. You're literally arguing against nobody when you say ""Nobody has provided evidence against my claim"" because nobody HAS to provide evidence. It is your job to convince them, you're the one with the unpopular opinion. I like that you quote people in your responses, that's something I like doing and more people should do it. It shows a direct response. But when you quote somebody, your next statement has to be directly tied to that.   &amp;#x200B;  Take this instance.   &gt;This isn't a debate, this is me telling you that you need to format and structure your arguments better.  ""So did you want to try and make an argument, or are you just going to pathetically stick with ad hominem attacks and losing bets?""  You didn't actually respond to me. What I said was about your structure of your argument. I explicitly said this isn't a debate on the AD trade. You shifted and made up me attacking you with ad hominem and losing bets. You probably know ""I'm willing to bet"" is a phrase that isn't meant to be taken literally, I didn't actually mean that. Your statement is completely unrelated in every way.   &amp;#x200B;  You did the same thing here:   ""There has been no argument presented that Portland and Los Angeles did not badly lose those trades, despite winning titles in those seasons. In fact, no such argument even exists. I've looked, and I've dared people that are far cleverer than you to find one, and no one has.""  I note that you snuck in some ad hominem to try and devalue your caricature of my point, your personal strawman. My point was that if you reread what say, MazKhan said at the start, it debunks the point. You didn't actually respond to me, you talked about your own point.   &amp;#x200B;  And if you REALLY so badly want me to debate you, unless you can without a shadow of a doubt prove that Brandon Ingram would have made that buzzer beater with the Lakers or gotten them that far without making any assumptions, then the AD trade was a success. If you can't, it successfully proves that AD was a net positive, making that trade good.    I don't even need to reiterate the Knicks flair MCzebo33's point on how valuable AD was to the team. (Funny enough, in that thread you did the same thing of not properly replying to what you quote.) The fact is, you CAN'T prove that Lonzo would have developed enough to make that shot, so you can't prove your case.    Nobody cares if the Blazers traded away Moses and still won a ring but they lost the trade lmao, that's a side point. It's about the Lakers and if they won the trade. You objectively cannot prove this, it is why nearly every single comment you've made has been downvoted. It's why I commented at all. Your argument fundamentally doesn't work because you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that they could have had that success without any assumptions. Jimmy Butler trade hypotheticals don't work because you're assuming that the NBA landscape is the same then and the debate devolves into fanfiction."
"That was one of the worst clutch performances I‚Äôve seen in a while, Brandon Ingram level ish. Bricked an open 3, then the game winner, then almost every shot in OT, including the last one. And this. Just brutal"
"Uh no? We never lost games purposefully. You did. That's the distinction. The year we ended with the #2 pick (Brandon Ingram I think), we actually went on a win streak to close the season."
Don‚Äôt forget Brandon Ingram
If Poku can become Brandon Ingram one day I‚Äôll be thrilled  Getting as good as KD would mean being an all time great and the odds are super low of that
Also the foul called on Brandon Ingram 30 seconds earlier should‚Äôve been called an offensive foul ü•≤

There's no way the 14 Brandon Ingram clones would be able to make it through the grind of a season and playoffs. Too many DNP - Cellular degeneration and DNP - Turned into genetic goo games to be reliable down the stretch
"Actually have kind of a funny story about Brandon Ingram. We went to middle school together. He used to go around giving people wet willies. It was a little annoying but endearing at the same time. Earned him the nickname Willy. Anyway, one day a girl complained and he had detention all week. This meant he couldn‚Äôt play in the league championship game on Friday. The whole team staged a walkout during classes and started chanting ‚ÄúFree Willy‚Äù. The move paid off and the principal let him off the hook. We ended up winning the chip. Years later some Hollywood executive ripped off our chant and turned it into a movie about a whale."
I don‚Äôt think any of those guys are over/underrated.   I.e. I think they get the proper amount of love and attention.   Westbrook is Westbrook. He‚Äôs had a stellar past few games but has been inconsistent this year and the early part of the year wasn‚Äôt doing so hot.  Kleber has intangibles but it doesn‚Äôt matter what you provide if it doesn‚Äôt show up on a stat sheet.. his 3p% is great on decent attempts per game. His defensive rating is ok-ish and his offensive rating is alright. His per 36 is worse this year than last year so take that for what you will.  Rudy Gobert is neither over or underrated. He‚Äôs a prototypical big that puts up DPOY level interior defense... that‚Äôs what he does not much else to say about it.   Demar Derozan.. if he added a 3 pointer to his repertoire he would be a killer. His draw foul on the drive game is incredible and he‚Äôs got the mid range down. But he‚Äôs not all nba.. yet.. he is too small and not a tank like Zion so he has to be crafty to get to the rim.. it would help him to be able to hit a 3 on 35% 3-4 attempts a game.   I agree with Tobias harris...  I think the most under appreciated players are almost always role players or borderline all star players on small market teams...  I.e. Brandon Ingram put up all star numbers this year but didn‚Äôt make the all star game. Same with de Aaron fox who got snubbed for all star reserves this year.
Brandon Ingram looking impressed at the end.
"Lmfao no, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt know shit about the Lakers and just hate from a distance. They literally drafted Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in consecutive years.   They weren‚Äôt a dumpster fire because they missed out on overpaying Aldridge or Melo. They were young. They built a war chest of assets and cashed in on them to win a damn championship. If they were a dumpster fire they‚Äôd waste all their high picks like Sacramento, Minnesota, Orlando, etc. They attract stars because players know the organization treats players amazingly and will move heaven and earth to field a championship contender. Dumpster fire lmfao you sound like those morons who ‚Äúprotested‚Äù outside the Staples Center üòÇ"
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I‚Äôll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting. How could anyone question your asset acquisition skills.
Okay. Brandon Ingram and lonzo got them AD and a ring.
No way Brandon ingram is 5 or lower
Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram are better than any player Cleveland has drafted since Kyrie.  Shut up dude.
&gt; Brandon Ingram &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick &gt; &gt; Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  BWAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH  FOR ANTHONY DAVIS  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  17TH RING  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH  Pure clown shoes partner.  All you can argue here is that Lakers made some trades at the time that didn't turn out.   You abandonded your argument about Lakers drafting poor because you know you got spanked with the examples I gave you.  Lmfao enjoy Kevin Love and your ace managment in Cleveland.  I smell a first round exit in the playoffs... in like another 15 years.  Kings of the east.  literally
"Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -dumped for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Talen Horton Tucker  Jesus, Midas touch over here."
Brandon Ingram and Lonzo would be #5 or lower in a redraft I strongly disagree with the idea that the Lakers are good at drafting.
"It wasn't for tanking purposes, and I always found it amusing when people thought the Lakers were sitting Deng and Mozgov to tank, like those guys were helping the Lakers win too many games or something üòÇ  The truth was that the Lakers signed Deng cause they needed a small forward (rookie Brandon Ingram was the only other 3 on the roster), but the Lakers failed to realize that Deng was no longer quick enough to play SF, nor was he a good enough shooter to do so in the new pace and space NBA. Deng was exclusively a small ball 4, but the Lakers already had two good, young 4s in Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr, so there weren't any minutes for Deng there. The Lakers sat Deng cause they were losing anyway, cause him at SF was a disaster, and because they wanted to give Ingram more minutes in the second half of the year.   Then the following year the Lakers added Kyle Kuzma, who was looking very impressive for a rookie, and he just pushed Deng further down the rotation, and effectively out of it. The Lakers had Ingram, Kuzma, Randle and Nance at forward, so all they could do with Deng was offer him garbage time minutes, which would have been insulting for a vet, so instead they agreed he just wouldn't dress at all. But supposedly he stayed ready in case there were injuries.   He did that for a full year and then the Lakers bought him out and stretched him. If they'd bought him out a year earlier his remaining $35 million would have been stretched over 7 seasons, so by waiting that year, instead it was only $15 million stretched over 3 years ($5 million per year)."
"How‚Äôs that Grant‚Äôs fault? He‚Äôs playing with a team of rookies. Brandon Ingram won MIP in a lottery team, it‚Äôs an individual award"
"That doesn‚Äôt mean shit, it‚Äôs an individual award. Brandon Ingram just got it while being on a lottery team."
"This is an individual award tho why does his team matter? Brandon Ingram just won it while playing on a lottery team. Randle has been phenomenal tho thats for sure, adding the 3pt shot &amp; playmaking has improved the team tenfold. MIP has always been about PPG so I‚Äôm just surprised the narrative this year is different. Randle averaged 21 with the Pelicans, hes averaging 23 now.   Grant has league average TS. He was incredibly efficient at the start of the season but once Rose/Griffin/Wright left he doesn‚Äôt have any real help on the offensive end, his life has become so much more difficult now, trying to iso his way through entire opposing defences. That‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt get it and it sucks for him but he‚Äôs still got a lot in him to take another step next season"

"Except Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball."
"Imagine stumbling ass backwards into the number one pick, drafting Zion Williamson and starting him alongside Brandon Ingram and lonzo ball and say ‚Äòwe need more talent‚Äô do you guys even listen to yourselves?"
"Brandon Ingram has played in 307 games, and MPJ has played in 105. The fact that they are even comparable right now should be enough to make a decision."
Give us Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram and then we‚Äôll give u Reggie Bullock and RJ Barrett for a season and let‚Äôs see who comes out on top
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they‚Äôd rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I‚Äôm not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion‚Äôs efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
"Kupchak is a fantastic drafter. He‚Äôs gone Julius Randle, dangelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, miles bridges, Devonte Graham, pj Washington and Lamelo in consecutive drafts"
"Trade Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe , figure out my life with Lonzo and surround him with shooters   Brandon Ingram is a top 10 scorer in the league (averaging 25+ on high efficiency with the worst spacing in the league) . Get 3 and D defenders and you‚Äôre a championship contender for the next 10 years . Personally I wouldn‚Äôt let go of Lonzo but BI and Zion are a very very very good core . And fire Stan Van Gundy.   I don‚Äôt completely blame him as Bledsoe and Adams do put you in a horrible place in today‚Äôs NBA but he‚Äôs not it ."
Brandon Ingram is a guy who as truly bad his rookie year in every aspect
Not my team but I always loved the nickname Slim Reefer for Brandon Ingram. Not sure if it was Lakers or Pelicans fans who came up with that one

"Ingram is not a good defender. That said, it's still Brandon"
Brandon Ingram and Jayson Tatum been crushin it too.
"Tell me you haven‚Äôt watched a single Pistons game without telling me you haven‚Äôt watched a single Pistons game   Seriously, Grant was never capable of creating off the dribble or handling the ball. Now he has tight ass handles &amp; a solid midrange game. He looks like a much stronger Brandon Ingram now, when most thought he‚Äôd never be more than a 3 and D"
Brandon Ingram lookin
Just like Brandon Ingram or RJ Barrett were busts after their rookie years?
"I would consolidate talent for a stud two way wing if one becomes available  They‚Äôre crazy deep but they‚Äôre inevitably not going be able to pay all of them so I really think they should capitalize on some of their trade value right now and form a more defined trio with Ja/JJJ. It will give them a higher playoff ceiling  Someone like Brandon Ingram would be a super interesting fit for them, though I don‚Äôt think NOLA seriously considers a trade"

"No it wasn't.

[This](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) is the only trade offer from the lakers that included Ingram - Ingram and one pick and presumably having to take on a negative contract in Dieng."
"Or even Dame, Zion, and Brandon Ingram? üòà"
i got downvoted the other day for saying he max leveled and brandon ingram might be better for the sixers now. a 6'10 tony allen is useful but not as a max player or your second best player.
"It used to be a controversial to say Brandon Ingram was better, but people called us Lakers fans crazy. I mean, some of us are fucking stupid, but we were right about BI."
First glance Wolves would be the most interesting trade partner for Ben Simmons because they have a lot of pieces that 76ers would like especially if they keep the pick.  Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram trade will probably be the most popular one that floats around though if 76ers get bounced by Hawks
"The 76ers had back-to-back #1 picks, and they wasted them on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  In 2016, Simmons was picked ahead of Brandon Ingram (#2) and Jaylen Brown (#3)  In 2017, Fultz was picked ahead of Lonzo Ball (#2) and Jayson Tatum (#3)  Which goes to show how successful the Celtics have been with those two drafts"
"Friendly reminder that the 76ers could have drafted Brandon ingram/jaylen brown and/or Jason Tatum. Instead,  they got Markelle Fultz and Bum Simmons"
"&gt;People need to stop reading this as ""Brandon Ingram upset because coach preached defense"".  The weirdest part of everyone honing in on that is there are multiple parts of the game the quote calls out SVG ripping people over."
"It doesn't matter who's coaching.  As long as Brandon Ingram thinks he's the best player on the roster, this team will never develop with Zion. Ingram still thinks it's his team."
"cool tidbit:    Bridges is one of the league‚Äôs most versatile defenders, with the physical tools to match up with players at all four perimeter positions. He was the highest vote getter not to make an All-Defensive Team and is the tip of the spear of a top-10 defense. There were no off nights for him this season.¬†[His top five most frequent assignments](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628969/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)¬†were Brandon Ingram, Damian Lillard, Jamal Murray, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry.¬†"
"People need to stop reading this as ""Brandon Ingram upset because coach preached defense"".  What coach DOESN'T preach defense these days? It's really about how you do it. Is your mom wrong for wanting you to clean your room? Obviously not. Is she wrong if she beat your ass to make you clean your room? Possibly.  SVG might just be one of those hard ass dudes that gives zero fuck about your feelings kind of like Larry Brown. Does that make him a bad coach? Not necessarily but don't be surprised when some players don't like that. Does it make BI seem a bit soft? Maybe, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't want to commit playing defense lol. I don't know too much about Alvin Gentry, but he seems like a well spoken guy that really gets along with his players. He seems like the type of dude that will invite his players over for dinner once every month while SVG seems like the type of guy that wants nothing to do with his players after practice lol (not saying this is true obviously but just going off by the vibes).  IMO as a coach, you have to figure out what kind of players are on your team and adjust your coaching style based on that. If you got a guy like Butler/Kobe okay yeah be a hardass. If you got guys like Ingram then maybe you gota soften up a bit."
"Everyone says this, but I think the reason why no one actually tries it in-game is because FT shooting is generally very psychological and fans going crazy while you're shooting underhand would mess with you even more.  There are some bad or horrific FT shooters who have improved over time (Drummond and DeAndre Jordan both went from like historically 40% to consistent 60% suddenly, and Brandon Ingram was in the 60s for a few years to becoming one of the best FT shooters in the league) so it doesn't have to be as drastic as a brand new shot.  That said, there are also players who seemingly get worse at FTs over time (Westbrook, Bron) or guys who are just constantly erratic and swing back and forth 10% every year (Duncan)."
"At one point on MyCareer on 2k I had me (SG), Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis lmao"
"I mean they literally just won an NBA championship because of their location. What other team could suck ass for 7 years, have a team consisting of Brandon ingram and lonzo ball, and be an attractive destination for lebron James"
I don't think either benefits. Ben Simmons and Zion won't fit well together. I hate to be the guy but the spacing would not be great. Also the Pels seem to want to make Zion more of a playmaker and Ben would kind of ruin that. And Brandon Ingram would be like another Tobias Harris on the 76ers. He can get buckets but they lose their best playmaker.
"Ok, sure thing buddy. We're talking about Brandon Ingram and Ben Simmons. Not Brandon Ingram + Veteran Playmaker and Ben Simmons"
"Plus your losing a really good defender. If I were to trade Simmons I‚Äôd try and target Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, or player of similar caliber def someone not over 28"
Is Brandon Ingram gonna sucker punch paul again?
Brandon Ingram ‚ÄúTiny Dog‚Äù  Apparently Tiny because of his size and Dog because he wasn‚Äôt afraid to challenge anyone.  Still a dumb af nickname lmao
Sad to see my guy Jamal is becoming this underrated to the point even Brandon fucking Ingram is rated above him. Are you serious?
Maaaaaan they already have Brandon Ingram who they signed to a max contract smh
"he would be allowed to break up altercations if there were one, yes, because team staff has always done that as seen by, you know, your team staff doign the same thing to Brandon Ingram without punishment  &amp;#x200B;  i just genuinely don't know where you thought i posted that i thought it was okay that the guy did that to PJ. i don't even think you're reading what I'm saying, you're just chomping at the bit to post the next dramatization.  &amp;#x200B;  anyway, you clearly want this to blow up into something bigger. carry on."
"the same can be true for every person on a coaching or training staff that goes onto the court to stop an altercation. nobody is ever punished for doing so. as people have mentioned to you, you had someone on your coaching staff shove Brandon Ingram during an altercation.  &amp;#x200B;  Was he sued for assault? Banned for life? Fined?"
So looks like Pelicans are going to lose Lonzo and Hart for nothing.   Brandon Ingram better be the next Larry Bird.   Otherwise they pretty much traded away AD for nothing.

"Logan's All-NBA Second Team ballot from last year:  * Leonard, Kawhi  * Ingram, Brandon (only 2nd team vote) * Drummond, Andre  (only vote)  * Westbrook Russell (one of 9 2nd team votes) * Young, Trae (only second team vote)  He had Booker and Beal on his Third Team, leaving Lillard and CP3 entirely off his ballot. He also gave LaVine his only vote, leaving off Tatum and Butler."
"It‚Äôs funny you mention Zion because he was on a team this year with another all-star caliber player in Brandon Ingram and they were still not close to making the playoffs. Same with Minnesota, two all-star caliber players and not close to the playoffs. Golden State has two hall of farmers and two top 2 picks and again, didn‚Äôt make the playoffs. I think that right there is a sign that there is plenty of talent in the league and it‚Äôs a good time to expand."
"Jamal Murray  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakim  Jaylen brown and Ben Simmons are extremely close imo. Although Ben is an elite defender, Jaylen can create his own shot and defend really good as well. Which is why I give him the edge"
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
Damn this is actually pretty close between all these guys 5 years into their careers. They‚Äôre all  great in their own different ways so it‚Äôs tough to perfectly list them. I‚Äôd probably say something like:  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis   I‚Äôm mainly basing this off who I would want in the playoffs.
"Jaylen Brown - best 2 way  Jamal Murray - best offensively  Ben Simmons - best defensively   Brandon Ingram - solid 2way wing, still want more  Pascal Siakam - will need to prove he's up to his pre-ASB 2020 self to jump ahead  Domantas Sabonis - Worst defensively, very talented, but not sure if it drives winning"

"This looks like a good place to repeat my somewhat-popular trade idea  Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 2 Blazers 1sts  * 2 Heat 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline. BI is the greatest asset in the trade so the Heat pay the most. They can build around a BI/Bam duo for the next decade.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as four first round picks to help with their rebuild. That leaves them with 8 picks they can trade if needed! Can upgrade PG and/or SF  -- maybe they package picks with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams. Or maybe offer the Cavs Bledsoe and 4 1sts for Colin Sexton. Etc."

Depends on what your definition is but Wiggins and Jabari Parker both essentially busted and were surpassed by later picks.  Brandon Ingram might count.

"Brandon Ingram has potential to be borderline top 10.  People think he‚Äôs just a solid scorer, but he‚Äôs better than he seems. He just has horrible spacing and is now the second option. He‚Äôs a great playmaker and still has potential to be a good defender."
"post-hindsight, there's an argument that the player that brandon ingram is now is more valuable than simmons"
"You mean the season [where this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhfrR3U9NTE), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM-o6WFbrW8) and [this](https://www.nba.com/news/brandon-ingram-out-rest-season-blood-clot-arm). Timberwolves didn't even make the playoffs. If Lebron fought for the 8th seed, you would've said he just got swept by the Warriors even though 4-5 starters and 3 bench players missed at least a month each that season."

Middleton is Brandon Ingram but trash
He‚Äôs Brandon Ingram but trash
"MIP = Missing in Playoffs  Same thing occurred with last year‚Äôs MIP winner, Brandon Ingram, who failed to make the playoffs."
"I‚Äôm not sure you can make them a contender. I would say trade CJ for some scoring wing (Brandon Ingram?)or interior presence but even then that doesn‚Äôt make them drastically better. They are pretty much what they are going to be middling western conference playoff team. Trade dame for Ben Simmons, Maxey, pick(s) and or Jaylen brown pick(s) and Payton Pritchard. That would be real of them to do for dame, they would still be competitive too"
"well obviously if you draft the greatest player to ever play you are probably going to be fine but if you drafted 5 Brandon Ingram/Zion's for example, they aren't doing shit by the time you need to pay them all and then you cant afford them all."
"I don't watch college ball (outside of march madness) either but I saw his clips all the time and I completely agree. Trae is a force to be reckoned with, it's been obvious from day 1. Also gotta respect the Brandon Ingram flair. I hope he finds his way to the Spurs one day. Luka is just insane, I'm glad I live in TX and have been able to see him live many times."
"Yea I do feel like that works against Kuzma seeing the success of all those guys but one problem is ppl always assume that the Lakers chose to keep Kuzma over Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, when in fact the Pelicans trade and salaries was only going to work with Ball and Ingram anyways!"
"I think one problem is ppl always assume that the Lakers chose to keep Kuzma over Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, when in fact the Pelicans trade and salaries was only going to work with Ball and Ingram anyways!"
OKC has a lot but not sure it's anything more than the Pelicans. Both have a lot of picks in the future.  But I don't see the Pelicans wanting to give Brandon Ingram as a major piece for Lillard. And I definitely don't see OKC giving up SGA.
I think Zach Lowe had a great point on his latest pod. The league views CJ as at best the third best player on a championship team. Accordingly other teams are not willing to give up a star second option. Who could the Blazers possibly get in return that would make them considerably better? I don‚Äôt see them getting Jaylen Brown or Brandon Ingram. A Heat-package of Herro and other young players would not be a win-now move to satisfy Lillard. Tough spot.
"Kuzma and the Lakers would both be better off if he left LA. Maybe try and land with a smaller market team lacking star power so he can start somewhere and be a bigger part of the offense, and even if the team isn't that great he can still put up like 20ppg on 30+min per night for them.   There's no way he does that in LA. When Kobe was there and now that Lebron is there, it's clear he plays subpar in that style. In hindsight, keeping Brandon Ingram and trading Kuzma probably would feel nice right now."
Luka hoop like Larry Bird the first 3 quarters and Brandon Ingram in the 4th
"what about CJ McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr. &amp; Anfernee Simons to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram &amp; Eric Bledsoe's terrible contract?  Maybe some draft compensation has to also go to the Pelicans in this scenario?"
not keeping brandon ingram was a massive mistake...
"Lakers got rid of Jordan Clarkson, Brandon ingram, Julius randle, Josh hart. Kept Kyle kuzma"
"Quick reminder that this team had Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, and DeAngelo Russell and kept Kuzma üíÄ"
"I'd rather have Lonzo, Kuzma and BI (and Danny Green) than DeRozan, Poeltl and Samanic. Brandon Ingram is the best player of the bunch. And imagine what Pop could get out of Lonzo Ball. Kuzma is a pigeon, but so are Poeltl and Samanic. And you would have gotten to keep Danny Green."
Well at least he has a fit with more mirrors on it than Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram own in total. That's something I guess.
Lakers need a small forward that can carry right now. A Brandon Ingram type.
"Brandon Ingram is such a bad fit with Zion, maybe CJ for Ingram?"
"CJ for Brandon Ingram, who says no?"
I‚Äôm a big fan of mini Brandon Ingram with a fro
"I mean we spent a lot of time trying to tell all yall that Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, D‚ÄôLo, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo were all great pieces to trade for but yall aint listen"
The Lakers are in the Mud  - Brandon Ingram is playing for a bigger Team  -ADisney wants to leave   -Lemickey wants to leave   -Lonzo left  -Harrel wants to leave   -Still play 34 year olds  -Bad coach   -Ruined Schroder  -Lost to a Fraud suns team  GOAT franchise? Not in my book
"&gt; Thanks for the most generic description of what an NBA wing does on defense  If you think Kawhi isn't a good defender idk what to tell you.   &gt; More examples  You gave me one game and one quarter from a series he's been amazing in, and the Nuggets series last yr. Ignoring every other series he's played because... reasons  &gt; Fucking dumb questions in response  Have you considered that the Raptors may have been top 5 offensively and defensively because... they had... Kawhi...   You do realize that not a single other team since the 2011 Mavs (an ENORMOUS outlier) won a championship without two top 20 players at least? I cannot believe you're actually trying to say Kawhi's 2019 run wasn't that good...  Beat a Warriors team decimated by injuries like they didn't beat the Sixers and the Bucks on the way there. Also there have been injuries in literally every single Finals. It's a part of basketball.  &gt; Chris Paul  Let me know when the Suns make it past where year 1 Kawhi Clippers did  &gt; LeBron didn't have another perinneal All-Star + 2 6MOTY candidates + vets did he?  Yeah, but he had Brandon Ingram + Lonzo + good depth and didn't even make the playoffs. Kawhi at least made the second round lmao  &gt; Rockets dropped blah blah blah  Does the losing games at home part really matter as much as the losing games part? My b for being wrong though"
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
Brandon Ingram needs whatever Zion is on
yeah I really worry for dudes like brandon ingram sometimes.  his legs are like toothpick thin for his body lol.
"I actually agree in principle, but my line is much further than KOC's. I probably **would** take him over Steven Adams going into the 2021-2022 season. But definitely not Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Jrue Holiday, or some of the other players in this list.  As a proximation, there are probably 60-90 players I'd take over Stevens. But at a certain point, I'd take him over some player at their contract.  And for a coach like Nurse, it might be closer to 40-70."
"[Classic](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/7/17326080/brad-stevens-celtics-sixers).  &gt; There‚Äôs not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He‚Äôs undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I‚Äôd take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he‚Äôs ahead of high lottery picks. I‚Äôd take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range. I‚Äôd take Stevens over aging stars like Chris Paul and injured ones like DeMarcus Cousins. &gt;  &gt; Obviously, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant would be selected first. And rising stars like Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Simmons would go ahead of Stevens, too. But are you really taking DeMar DeRozan ahead of Stevens? I don‚Äôt think so. &gt;  &gt; It‚Äôs tough to know where to draw the line, but there‚Äôs no doubt Stevens has proved himself to be one of the most valuable commodities in the NBA."
"Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, and DeAngelo Russell send their regards..."
Lakers could sure use Julias Randle and Brandon Ingram right about now.
"Trade Anthony Davis and three firsts to New Orleans for Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram."
Just a personal grudge from allowing that Brandon Ingram game winner years ago. I was down on my luck in New York City and really needed some capital to my name. So here‚Äôs the jist I have my bet made I‚Äôm comfortable I make plans accordingly and Roco blows it with one of uniquely roco stupid ass decisions and I was then more broke than before. Thanks to that asshat
Brandon Ingram
They should try to trade CJ and Picks for Brandon Ingram.
"Man, weird to go back and see those comments arguing who was better between Kuzma and Brandon Ingram lol"
"Yeah, he was a free agent by then and had no interest in staying with a team that doesn't try to compete. Cavs traded Kyrie for a broken IT and a pick and spent all their cap space on KLove on his last legs. Fuck him for leaving amirite? Also saying he went to the Lakers for a star, I guess 2019 Brandon Ingram counts now?"
"Lol so you think other teams wouldn‚Äôt have offered him the max if they could?  And like others have said, he won them a title, so you‚Äôre expecting them to let a guy who was top 5 at the time to go for free? Just because he‚Äôs 28 and injury prone?? And after trading Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and 4 1sts for him???  Absolute lunacy. What a shit take dude, and it‚Äôs not even the mushroom."
"I became a Pelicans fan two years ago via Duke (i.e. Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson) and I spent my first year of college at UCLA (Lonzo Ball)  I was not a Pelicans fan while he was here lol"
"I had stocks in Brandon Ingram when this galaxy brain sub thought he was the next Travis Outlaw, so I'll take that to the bank"
Cant see it with the situation he‚Äôs in surrounded by two superstars. Maybe if he goes somewhere else but even Brandon Ingram becoming a HOF in NOLA is a reach in my opinion
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"Curry deserves all the credit more so than KD, because Curry and Draymond were the LEADERS of that team, leadership men‚Äôs s a lot outside of the stat line. Also Curry and Kyrie were the last great All star guards to be on the finals, besides Lowry of course who is also a great leader. Before that we have to go back to Tony Parker and Jason Kidd, this goes to show how‚Äôs difficult is to make it to the final when led by a small guard as your best player. Nash couldn‚Äôt do it, AI almost did. Kobe is a big guard who can play forward, as is Dwayne. This is why Curry and Dame get a pass more so than KD, Lebron, Giannis or Embiid. Also Dame loses series where he is expected to lose, he has also won when he wasn‚Äôt suppose to.  The player who doesn‚Äôt get enough criticism in my book is Porzingis who has fell off which can be chalked up to injuries, but still. Demand Derozan use to be talked about with Klay, PG and Jimmy. Jimmy redeemed himself from losing that series up 2-0 on the Celtics after rondo got hurt, thanks to his finals run, but now his performance this series another disappointment, even as the underdog. Kawhis leadership in the clutch, as well as James Harden. Russ Westbrook only gets triple double in the regular season has made 1 second round appearance since KD departure. Brandon Brandon Ingram with a third straight season of leading his team to the lottery. Jayson Tatum is #1, Jaylen Brown is second fiddle, that convo is over."
I would hope he can shoot a high percentage catching lobs from lonzo and Brandon ingram bricks. Tougher when you're responsible for the entire offense
Lol no it was not wtf. They did argue Brandon Ingram was better tho

Rondo punching Chris Paul. Or Brandon Ingram.  Lakers have thrown punches a few times in the last 3-4 years.
"&gt;Jayson Tatum ... people were saying he should have had Rookie of the Year    He was on the very fringes of that discussion. It was all Mitchell vs Simmons.   &gt; but his first two seasons weren't even great compared to other players in his class.    He scored the second most playoff points in NBA history for a rookie and almost lead a team to the finals in his age 19 season, but you don't understand the hype?    &gt; I think Jayson Tatum is a great basketball player ... Jayson Tatum is one of the players that are the future of the NBA he will be around for a long time ... He is a smooth handled, 2 way guard, that has a slow pace at times and quick one at other times. He can shoot, drive, rebound, and defend. He is as talented as players come in the NBA, and he is coming off a fantastic season    It sounds like you think that he is worth the hype. Did I mention that he dropped 50 a few times this year?   (And Im ignoring that you called him a guard)   &gt; but my secondary issue with the love that surrounds him is the amount people ignore other talent with similar age and play style. Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown    What is this logic? Is there only so much love to go around?   Your issue with Tatum is the Ingram and Brown don't get enough credit? What does that have to do with Tatum getting his rightful credit?   &gt; nobody showers these two with the same kind of love.    Didn't Brandon Ingram win MIP last season and then plateau this season?   And Jaylen gets a ton of credit for his improvements."
"By the time LeBron came back (too early, I might add), Lonzo was already done for the season with a grade 3 ankle sprain, and they only got a couple more games from Brandon Ingram before he had that blood clot which ended his season. Josh Hart as well had a season ending knee injury that season. They were a MASH unit."
Remember when Brandon Ingram punched Chris Paul in the face with that long boi reach?
The Warriors have another player who was probably the worst player in the league last year and turned into a very useful player this year for them. Brandon Ingram was one of the worst players in the league his first year.  Worth an all-star is really context dependent.
What about Brandon Ingram and KD?  There‚Äôs probably like 0 guys that are actually 6‚Äô7 250 in nba
"I see what you're saying, but I don't want to conflate playing with a passion to ""angry"" (don't wanna say ""angry Black man"" and hurt anyone's feelings)..  Based off pure observation - Brandon Ingram is more likely to go into the stands and hit someone disrespecting him than Russ. Russ merely points them out for ejection (Utah game). This is the angriest I've seen him, fitting considering the act."
Fun fact he‚Äôs older than Brandon Ingram
"Thats not even including Trae Young, Bam Adebayo and Brandon Ingram who were All Stars last year"
"His rookie highlights really doubles my belief that 99% of players in the NBA are nowhere near their potential because they are just too physically weak.  For any sport and position you play there becomes a point where adding additional muscle ends up being a negative tradeoff for size vs speed. For NFL linemen that's unreachable. For NFL linebackers that's ~230-280, depending on your role and height. For NFL CBs that's ~210.   For NBA players this is too hard to generalize because of the wide ranges of heights and frames, but for 99% of players in the league it's more-than-you-currently-weigh. Giannis went from a level of mobility that I'd say comparable to Brandon Ingram to a bigger and slower version of LeBron. And in the same period he went from not being actually good enough to play in the NBA to the best player."
Was originally thinking Brandon Ingram since it fit with OPs theme but igoudala would be a better fit and provide great wing defense.
Imagine having Keldon Johnson and Love on the team instead of young stars like Zion and Brandon Ingram. DeRozan. Westbrook. Butler. Lonzo. Mike Conley. Randle. None of these people came out and said no?
"without curry, kd just a slightly better brandon ingram with twitter disputes"
"By the time Zion hits his prime, Dame is like 35  Brandon Ingram would have to be part of the deal also"
Bates is not even the best in his class. I do like his game though. He is nothing close to Durant. He is much more similar to Brandon Ingram.
"&gt;yet Pop &amp; SAS have still won more than that group every year since the trade.  What an utterly backwards way to evaluate that trade. It's not like the Spurs have won the title to make it worth it. Hell, they've missed the last two playoffs, so who cares who's won more since that trade? Pop had the option of going in a rebuilding direction with that trade or making a win now move, and he went with the latter. And while he has technically ""won more"" since, he has absolutely nothing to show for it. DeRozan will probably walk in free agency, while Brandon Ingram is a 23 year old All Star under contract for the next four seasons. Pop very obviously made a stupid decision with that trade. To try to say otherwise is laughable."
I love to see how Brandon Ingram would do with Pop.
"I don't think there's a solid, hard rule like that. For example BI = Brandon Ingram and LMA = LaMarcus Aldridge are more recognizable than if you tried to refer to Giannis and Steph as GA and SC.  Some players' names sound best referring to them as a first name, sometimes last name, sometimes entire name, sometimes acronym, sometimes first-initial-last-name format like DRose, DWade and KLove. The other guy was just using acronyms for players that have never had one before and that caused the confusion."
"Ah yes because Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and D'angelo Russell/Brook Lopez is definitely a worse team than the Kings starting 5...."
Brandon Ingram
"The Blazers shouldn‚Äôt trade without wiseman included.     Really these are the fair offers I can see    Warriors: Picks, Wiseman, and Wiggins    Pelicans Picks, Brandon Ingram, and maybe Adams   Nuggets: Murray, picks, some role player    76ers, Simmons, Thybulle, and picks"
Played against Brandon Ingram when he was in high school. I was a senior and I think he was a freshman. He didn't start and didn't come in till his team was up 20 in the second half. We expected him to come in and play down low. He started by raining threes from 10 feet back and then dunked on one of our guys on a fast break
Last I read he was on the select team but then wasn't extended an offer.   https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/zion-williamson-joins-brandon-ingram-usa-basketball-olympic-finalist  I think he got snubbed just like Trae.
Honestly I think the Warriors and their first round picks are better over the Pelicans. Unless the Pelicans offer Brandon Ingram the trailblazers shouldn‚Äôt do it
Pmfaooo and they call us fans delusional    How can you have dame without trading Brandon Ingram
"These GMs are weak man. I have no problem whatsoever with players having preferences, but this is also a business and leverage comes into play. He is under contract for like 5 f‚Äôing years. He has ZERO leverage, but when you wait for him to name his teams you immediately lower his value.    I would have traded him to New Orleans. Give me Brandon Ingram and all your young assets. Kill 2 birds with one stone. If I‚Äôm Nola, I dare Dame AND Zion, two superstars, to still say they‚Äôre ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù and blame others meanwhile they‚Äôd be one of the best duos in the league"
"Brandon Ingram -&gt; Philadelphia   Ben Simmons -&gt; Cleveland   Damian Lillard -&gt; New Orleans   Clevelands 3rd pick, New Orleans misc assets, Philadelphia misc assets -&gt; Portland   Does this represent a legitimately possible trade?"
Do you think the Pellies would take AD if Nola threw in Brandon Ingram?
"Yeah it's still really hard to get to 30ppg, so saying 25ppg in 07 &gt; 30ppg in 21 is definitely a exaggeration, but saying something like 20 ppg in 2007 ~= 24 ppg in 2021 might not be (Duncan was the 20th highest scorer in 2007 at exactly 20, and Brandon Ingram was the 20th highest scorer this year at 23.8). To really get an understanding of the individual scoring, you probably need to look at more than just 1 year at a time (combine 2005-2010) vs 2016-2021) and also track pace numbers. I'm sure that research has been done plenty of times.     PPG cutoff| 2021 | 2007 ---|----|---- 30+ | 2 (Curry and Beal) | 1 (Kobe) 25+ | 15 | 9 20+ | 31 | 20"
I know this is all hindsight but even Brandon Ingram/jaylen brown haha
"*Kyrie Irving will win MVP*  Not really seeing it but because the MVP can be a popularity contest, who knows - maybe Kyrie hires a great promotional firm and can keep fooling people into thinking he's on the same level as Harden and KD.      *CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved*  Has there ever been a player that's never made an all-star team and gets mentioned as an MVP candidate?      *Russ or Beal will not be wearing a Wizards uniform by the trade deadline*  I could see it      *Kyle Kuzma becomes a legit 3rd option in another team*  Is it a good team? I could see him playing well on a team like the Warriors or Nuggets where they've got some players already. But I don't know about 3rd option.      *Brandon Ingram will be in a Warriors uniform*  You've got me torn on this one. The scoring and the size would be nice but I'm not sure how they could convince NoLa to part with him. I like Wiggins but he doesn't really move the needle.      *Grayson Allen will be an All Star*  Well, it's always good to end with something memorable - like a punchline."
"Butler, CP3, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, Jrue, and Brandon Ingram included"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

"No you can't. The best player included in the AD trade was Brandon Ingram. Best player included in the Harden trade was Caris Levert. Best player included in the PG trade was SGA. When you trade a star player, you're mostly getting picks back plus one or two good but not great young players."
Not an all star both seasons but Brandon Ingram was crazy consistent 2020/2021 especially in his scoring and shooting splits  PPG: 23.8/23.8  FG%: 46.3/46.6%  3PT%: 39.1/38.1%  FT%: 85.1/87.8%  eFG: 53.1%/53.1%  TS%: 58.7%/58.4%  APG: 4.2/4.9  BPG: 0.6/0.6  The only major differences are rebounds and steals
Beause Tatum is Brandon Ingram in a Celtics jersey.

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram
There is a very real chance none of the picks Houston got turn into someone as good as Brandon Ingram
The Pelicans could make a better offer imo. They have a ton of picks and could give up Brandon Ingram if the Blazers want him. BI + future Laker picks &gt; Wiseman + #7 +#14  Also who knows what this Rockets front office is going to do. Tillman doesn't seem like the type of owner that's willing to wait for all these picks to be taken and develop. #2 + future Nets picks &gt; Wiseman + #7 +#14
off the top of my head ?  denver : could (should) offer porter jr and available picks   pelicans: brandon ingram + first rounds  Toronto: 4th pick and OG anunoby + future firsts   sixers: simmons + picks + whoever else portland wants except embiid

Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. Their game is perfect for 3v3
"Also, lack of bulk is one of the easiest things to fix with a prospect. Is everyone going to have a Giannis-esque development in that regard where they go from lanky boy to veritable Greek god? No, obviously not, but it's pretty straightforward to get another 10-15 pounds of good weight onto a player after they make it into the league. Brandon Ingram had the same concerns in regards to his size, and while he still could probably stand to get a little bulkier, he's progressed enough in that regard for it not to be an issue."
I think if you are looking for a surprise like that if it were to happen Beal and dame two obvious candidates. LaVine is a sleeper if he indicates to Chi he doesn‚Äôt want to re-sign. I still think it‚Äôs a year too early for this but s deep sleeper is Brandon Ingram.
I would swap Brandon Ingram with Russel Westbrook. Then I would move Ben Simmons down to tier 8 while moving up Pascal Siakam into tier 6 and SGA into tier 7. Finally I would swap Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry.
"He really went from ""the next KD best HS prospect since LeBron"" to ""ehhh he might be Brandon Ingram"""
His second best player was like Brandon Ingram
"You have to get a good prospect in return not just picks  - DEN: Michael Porter Jr., salary filler, 2 picks   - NOP: Brandon Ingram, 2 picks   - NYK: RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, 3 1sts   - MIN: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, 3 1sts"
"This team is pretty solid but the  team has to be just 12 players... id cut off Huerter, Collins, Haliburton.   I really want to add Brandon Ingram but they have players like him at the wings.  Bridges more important for defense and MPJ is a better shooter.  Starters: Trae, Booker, Brown, Tatum, Adebayo  Bench: Ja, Mitchell, Bridges, Zion, Jackson Jr, Fox, MPJ"
lol ask Brandon Ingram
"A lot of reports indicated that [Brandon Ingram was on the trade table per Woj](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) but they wanted more. So, it would have been Ingram + a bunch of first round picks.  They wanted more. If negotiations were done in good faith, it probably would have been based around Ingram. Even if the Spurs had no interest in Lonzo, it's not like he couldn't have been an additional trade asset for the Spurs.  And a package of Randle + Kuzma + picks may not have been better than what they got from Toronto, but you were trying to say that we were like ""Kuzma + picks"" when, in reality, a lot of us were anticipating Brando being moved and being the primary catalyst of a trade package."
"That's revisionist.   It wouldn't have been a Kuz + picks trade, it would have been a package like what we did for AD. We were clearly willing to lump in Brandon Ingram, Lonzo + picks and, at the time, Julius Randle was an RFA so he could have been included as well."
"The Lakers development team sucks. Players leave the Lakers and always seem to get better. For example, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Deangelo Russel, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson‚Ä¶"
"Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 1996-97:   MJ 14.7, Terrell Brandon 11.1, Mitch Richmond 11.0, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 9.6, Karl Malone 9.5, Glenn Robinson 9.4  Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 2020-21:   Russ 6.1, Brandon Ingram 5.8, Julius Randle 5.8, Bradley Beal 5.6, Joel Embiid 5.6, CP3 5.5  That's a 45-50% drop, dude. And BTW, ALL of these dudes are noted standout offensive players."
Brandon Ingram negs kd
"Brandon Ingram always looks high, and he seems like the type that gets locked in when high"
Ah you got me. We mortgaged Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram who still can‚Äôt make the playoffs or the play in game with Zion. A Mickey Mouse ring and 1st round exit is still more than you‚Äôll see with Zion before he starts demanding a trade
"By all means. Please explain what puts Brandon Ingram on the same tier as guys like brown, Bam, Donovan, shai when we are talking about young talent.  Dudes the second best player on a lottery team and Pelicans fans act like he‚Äôs untouchable in a Cade Cunningham trade."
"We had just drafted Brandon Ingram the year before at #2 and were really high on BI. (I still am)  Lonzo seemed like a great piece alongside BI and the rest of the young core.   Now had we gotten the first pick the year prior and got Ben Simmons, I think Tatum would 100% be the pick."
"Sure, there is never any guarantee of a draft pick being an MVP candidate, but if there was, it would cost a hell of a lot more than Brandon Ingram and a couple of firsts."
"If everything breaks right Cade's ceiling is definitely higher than all star. If everything breaks right he becomes a perrenial MVP candidate. That's why the trade makes sense for the Pels, and why the Pistons probably say no. You don't get many shots to acquire generational talents, and if you get one you don't pass on it for $160M of Brandon Ingram."
"Shooting and defending will most definitely make the hawks better, especially if he is able to do it more consistently. If you can shoot and defend well for 7 games straight, you can win a series. And If long-term investments wouldn‚Äôt work then players like Jimmy Butler, Brandon Ingram, Giannis, and other hard-working slow-to-come-along players wouldn‚Äôt have a place in the NBA."
"Yeah was thinking about Brandon Ingram with this, word was it was the young Lakers whom SVG didnt always have the best relationship with. But BI just had absolutely no idea what he was doing as a help defender kept making the same mistakes and did exactly the type of things that would piss off SVG the most. Type of things SVG probably yelled at him for a million times and made his whipping boy, all that shit will screw up a relationship. By the time they started simplifying things it was probably too late.   I also think it was pretty obvious Eric Bledsoe came into last season deciding he wasnt gonna give a shit and when the veteran ""all NBA defender"" you bring in is doing that the ability to get buy in elsewhere erodes. Dont think it was lost on others that Bledsoe point shaving wasnt treated to the same standards as when young guys made mistakes."
"Yes, or Brandon Ingram. Still going to be pretty tough even given their improvements the last few years."
Brandon Ingram is literally an all-star
Brandon the slim Jim reefer ingram
"Pushing what ""needle""? What are you talking about? The simple truth is DeRozan hasn't exactly brought success to the Spurs and now he's poised to leave. Personally I'd rather have Brandon Ingram just cause he's still only 23 and is actually under contract for the next 4 years. It doesn't matter how good DeRozan was cause it didn't bring any playoff success, and it matters even less how good he might be in the future cause he'll probably be playing for another team."
"‚ÄúSuper well‚Äù is an interesting way to describe passing up on Jaylen brown and jayson Tatum for Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram. Not a correct way, but definitely an interesting way."
"Lebron could have dragged a team composed of Tyler Ulis, Marquese Chris, and Dragan Bender to the playoffs? If he couldn't drag Lonzo, Kyle Kuzma, and Brandon Ingram then what more that Suns team imo."
"Brandon Ingram is getting progressively better each year but I don't think it will be a leap, same with Ja Moran. They have super high ceilings"
What would you think about Brandon Ingram??
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
My guy Brandon Ingram!
Tell Brandon Ingram to stay off the weed-duh.
"This is not a simple question because we don't know the options. I'd test the value of Brandon Ingram, but I don't know if there's a market for him or not. Same with Lonzo's SnT value.  Shedding Bledsoe is probably a high priority, but even that's hard to conceptualize. Maybe Charlotte takes him if you throw in Hayes too? I honestly don't know.  The #10 Pick though isn't too tough, I'm hoping they go for Franz Wagner. Versatile 3&amp;D wing, should be available at #10, easy pick unless someone crazy drops."
Offer Brandon Ingram and a king's ransom package for Dame
"Look, if you shoot someone in the face it doesn't make it OK cause you were facing them, but clearly it's more despicable to attack someone when their back is turned than it is to fight them straight up when they know what's coming. But it should go without saying that attacking anyone is bad and can always have dire consequences. I'm not the one who brought up Brandon Ingram, that other guy did, but IMO you can say at least he came at him straight ahead when he could see what was coming. Chris Paul didn't get hurt in either instance, but I think it's worse to attack someone when their back is turned when they have no way to prepare themselves."
Do you consider what Beverley did to be worse than Brandon Ingram sprinting halfway down the court to swing on CP3?
Do you consider Beverley running to push Chris Paul in the back to be worse than Brandon Ingram sprinting halfway down the court to swing at CP3 or are you just whining because it's Beverley?
"Brandon Ingram ran over to join the fight, swung on Chris Paul while he was being pulled away, and he got 4.  You guys want to give Bev 5 for a shove lol."
notice how he never said anything about brandon ingram   confirmed ingram wanted SVG out
"This is my draft order: Jaylen, Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram, Ben Simmons.  Tbh you could probably swap between Jamal and Ingram depending on what a team needs. Jamal's shined a bit brighter so far, but I'm confident BI will still end up being a great player."
&gt;He also made one thing clear: Zion nor Brandon Ingram was the reason for his exit  ESPN: SVG said Zion nor Ingram pushed him out but curiously didn't mention Lonzo Ball.  Was there issues between Ball and Van Gundy?
I ain‚Äôt no pelicans fan it‚Äôs just undeniable that Brandon Ingram and Zion are good players idk why u wanna argue about this shit. It‚Äôs widely accepted.
"? What‚Äôs the point of ur argument. That he played a career high amount of game son his second season? The whole reason this thread even started is cuz u said Brandon Ingram was garbage, and now ur claiming Zion Williamson is somehow garbage. When both are like top 15 at least in the league in scoring. You really should watch the league before u talk about something you clearly don‚Äôt know anything about."
"Kyrie leaves the Cavs. Paul George doesn't want to team up with Lebron. Narrative was definitely people didn't want to team up with Lebron, lol. Oh, you probably thought Lebron was going to single handedly carry a 3rd year Brandon Ingram and sophomore Lonzo, Hart, and Kuzma to the WCF minimum, right?"
"2018-19: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Luke Walton fired)  2019-20: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Alvin Gentry fired)  2020-21: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Stan Van Gundy fired)  2021-22: ?  Lot of coaches getting fired for no one being the reason.   These players heads must be spinning with the coaching carousel they are on."
I would take Brandon Ingram first.
"Kuzma‚Äôs game doesn‚Äôt fit well with Lebron and AD. His growth is also stunted on the Lakers. If he gets traded, he might be able to improve like Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball."
Lol ok garbage but they‚Äôre each an all-star. Do u watch the games? Randle was putting up 23-10-5 all year and Brandon Ingram is a top 10 scorer in the league undisputed. DLo was hurt half of this year and is on a trash team but still puts up numbers.
No no no you want to trade Myles for Brandon Ingram. That is what you want to do with Myles.
"Lol, we believe that because we have a 60 yr track record of winning, why wouldnt players want to come to a competent winning organization? U act like our reputation isnt deaerved.  Look at our draft picks that we have up when lebron came....julius randle, dlo, brandon Ingram, lonzo ball, when we sucked we drafted incredibly well.   We traded for kobe draft pick, somehow its bad we are a better organization?   Your bucks team hasnt had anything close to that level of drafting.... and you have the expierience o being a lottery team. The lakers didnt and still was a top level team in terms of drafting.  Sorry r yall suck"
"An Embiid sized handful of macadamia nuts would be like 1,000 calories.   There are some calorie dense stuff out there.   I once made a mock meal plan for Brandon Ingram that was only 3 normal sized meals and mostly vegetables that was 6,000 calories in a day.  One of the issues with getting some people to bulk up is they just can‚Äôt fathom eating all the time.  And for athletes you can‚Äôt just pump them up with sugar or like pork belly tacos then have them playing 5 on 5."
"So, his Lakers stint completely invalidates everything from 2012-2018? You're acting like players don't want to trade their teammates for upgrades. You should keep the same energy when you traded Lou Will for Rondo. Or Kevin Durant trading Levert and Allen for Harden.     [Did Lebron not help Kuzma up during the same series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbf5NcCtcw)? You clown on Lebron for walking away from Kuzma, but I know for a fact you call Kuzma trash and if he was on your team, you'd be wanting his ass traded as well. I bet you were calling Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram busts in comparison to SGA. Try to be consistent instead of coming across as an idiot."
Brandon Ingram maybe? Even though I don't think that would do much to help either team overall.
"Zion is already part of the list - https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/zion-williamson-joins-brandon-ingram-usa-basketball-olympic-finalist      He was previously on the Select Team. Not sure if he quietly withdrew himself this year or just didn't make the Olympic roster.  Not sure about LaMelo, I know there was talk about him before injury, so maybe with the injury he decided not to get involved this time.  Ja is also part of the Team USA pool but didn't make the cut this time around. https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/11/ja-morant-c-j-mccollum-not-among-team-usa-finalists-for-tokyo-olympics/  My understanding is the Select Team is for guys who aren't part of the main pool."
"&gt;If the Knicks arent putting RJ Barrett on the table and the Pelicans aren't putting Brandon Ingram on the table then neither team will get him which is what makes the chances equal in my eyes  The Pels would include Ingram in a heartbeat, but I‚Äôm more unsure of the Knicks actually vying for Lillard. Particular because he‚Äôd be on a worse team than before. But idk, they‚Äôre a weird organization."
"&gt; I know the Knicks are the Knicks, but do they really want to trade their future away for Dame?  Not to say either team **will** offer their blue chip young guy, but discussions both start and end with them. If the Knicks arent putting RJ Barrett on the table and the Pelicans aren't putting Brandon Ingram on the table then neither team will get him which is what makes the chances equal in my eyes"
Thought Brandon Ingram was in the building to get his back
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."

"Yeah, should have kept Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart, and traded Lebron James for AD smh"
"Brandon Ingram. Everyone told me to bring 3 recorders because he speaks so softly and so low you're not even going to be able to hear him. Everyone told me it was a mistake to profile him because he's so soft-spoken and it won't make a good profile. Brandon is the total opposite. When he trusts you, he really opens up. He's goofy and fun and extremely thoughtful. I ended up profiling him a second time once he got to New Orleans, because I felt like he had so much to say."
"&gt;	Presumably, the Pelicans would understand that you have to give to get, and as such would have Brandon Ingram available as a potential centerpiece for the Blazers, along with another legit young player. New Orleans has a couple that fit the bill ‚Äî perhaps a Naji Marshall or a Kira Lewis.  Who would you guys prefer? Simmons or Ingram"
Brandon Ingram will be an MVP
"Barrack Obama, Shaq, Russell Westbrook, Nick Young, Brandon Ingram, Powerpuff Girls. Then Kobe‚Äôs wife, then Kobe. üíØüíØ"
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
Tip: always research your topic before making absolute statements. Both [Draft Express](https://247sports.com/Gallery/DraftExpress-releases-updated-2016-NBA-mock-draft-45538898/Amp/) and [Kevin O'Connor](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/22/12001638/nba-mock-draft-2016-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-lakers-76ers-celtics) had Simmons at #1.

"Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I would rather have Brandon Ingram than Simmons. Sure, u can say Ben Simmons is a better defender and playmaker but his playmaking ability is hugely overrated by this sub ( only great in transition, but his passing in half court offense is average to decent quality). But if we talk about scoring then Ingram is one of the deadliest 3 level scorer on good efficiency and that part, Ingram blows past Simmons and it‚Äôs not even close. Offensive firepower is always gonna be greater than defense so give me Ingram. Ingram is also a pretty decent playmaker and can play defense with his long arms and length( just needs the right coach to make him play like that). We have seen countless times that great offensive talent is more important than defensive minded players so give me Ingram who shot 46/38/88 efficiency this season and 59% TS with garbage spacing since Bledsoe, Zion, Adams are not 3 pt threats."
It shouldn't swap Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram and the 76ers beat the Hawks.
I guess I'll start:  PG: Jordan Poole (Never been a consistent starter)  SG: Gordon Hayward (Hasn't made an all star team in the past 4 years)  SF: Brandon Ingram (Brandon Ingram)  PF: Draymond Green (Currently doesn't average more than 11 PPG)  C: Karl Anthony-Towns (Has never played a series that went to 7 games)

"Brandon Ingram 43.2% catch and shoot 3's     Devonte Graham 42.3% catch and shoot 3's     Trey Murphy 50-40-90 in college, (56, 44, 100 in the the SL)     Jonas Valanciunas 36% from 3, 55% 16ft - 3, 50% 10-16ft, 17ppg on 63 TS%"
"you‚Äôre taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton‚Äôs age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn‚Äôt do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than SextonüòÇ he‚Äôs passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you‚Äôre talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton‚Äôs entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
Brandon Ingram could be Wiz Khalifas brother and no one would bat an eye
"nah man, Murray isn‚Äôt even efficient as the secondary player. why would he get more efficient as lead ball handler? something he hasn‚Äôt done since he played for Canada?    Look at their non-bubble stats and it‚Äôs kinda clear:  2019-20 tracking stats:          Catch and Shoot.      Pull-up     Murray     39% 2.33PA     32% 3.03PA     Sexton     42% 2.23PA     35% 1.73PA  Sexton is the better shooter already, Murray getting worse looks and more attention isn‚Äôt going to increase his efficiency at all  yeah Murray might go up to 24 a game (something Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt even do) but i find it hard to believe anybody thinks Murray could do that while increasing how often he makes shots. he would easily be the worst 24 point scorer in the league.   for reference: Kawhi Leonard averaged 24.8,Trae Young averaged 25.3, and Sexton 24.3. you‚Äôre asking for a huge leap from Murray off an injury when his career high is 21.2 in a bubble year"
Brandon Ingram already has that trademarked
"Emoni‚Äôs dad is kind of a head case in that he basically demands his kid be the focal point of everything. He‚Äôs good but he‚Äôs be asked to probably give up a little for the sake of defense, and one of our other young guys got booted from Emoni‚Äôs prep team and found more success elsewhere. Sounds like his dad basically is pulling the strings. Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt end up like Brandon Ingram has (not to say BI is a bad player id love to have him, but I just hope he‚Äôs not just another long scorer who can‚Äôt play D)."
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown/Ben Simmons
"I know everyone thinks the Lakers were tanking all those years, but as a long time Lakers fan I can tell you that was all just legitimately due to horribly incompetent front office management. They were actually trying to win, especially while Kobe was still playing, they were just awful at how they went about trying to do it.   Part of the problem was that they'd gone all in with the trades for Dwight and Nash, giving away a bunch of unprotected picks to do so, and part of it was that Dwight left immediately afterwards and Nash and Kobe suffered career-altering injuries that year, and were never close to the same players again. They bet it all and it blew up about as spectacularly as possible.  After that the Lakers approached every off-season like just cause they were the Lakers, eventually a star would sign with them, so every year they would only sign guys to one year deals so they could keep cap space for the next season. And then when nobody would sign the next season, they'd do the same thing again. They finally stopped doing this in 2016 when instead they blew all their cap space on Mozgov and Deng, which obviously was a terrible decision.   And then on top of that, the guys they picked in the draft were never home run selections. They'd show hints of promise, and have gone on to be good players since, but none were prodigies right out of the gate. D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball are all pretty solid players now, but they were mostly kinda disappointing when they were on the Lakers (especially before LeBron signed).   Like I said, they weren't trying to lose, they were just absolutely awful at trying to win."
Slim Reefer (Brandon Ingram) will always be one of my favorites
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernang√≥mez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."

I take either Brandon Ingram or SGA
"The reason people still think like this is because up until recently most players were rags-to-riches stories, but now many of those players who were rags-to-riches have kids who are grew up rich and with opportunity, now there's more access to camps and there are more junior coaches with some form of pro ball experience. Now it is much harder for a rags to riches story unless you are from an area like Kinston (where Brandon Ingram is from) where they just produce professional level talent at an abnormal level"
If you truly believe Rondo was a superstar then you may have brain damage. How he gonna be a superstar when at no point in his career was he even a top 3 guard üòÇ you just handing out superstars huh  You think Brandon Ingram a superstar?
"The Lakers had LeBron, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball, and more, and managed to not even make the playoffs."
"Yeah I don‚Äôt necessarily think a team can become good on defense with both Zion and Brandon Ingram on the floor, but Lonzo would help with that  Edit: I think the best path to success for the Pels is just fully realize the offensive monster the duo of BI and Zion have the potential to become. I‚Äôm not convinced they fit that well together but If they figure it out the offense would be a monster."

If Lebron had a guy as good as Ingram in his first Cavs stint they would've had a chip. If they had all the young players and assets we have they would've had a dynasty.   Y'all are wilding calling it a hot take honestly. The Pels not becoming a long time contender would be a major fumbling of the bag.

Brandon Ingram may not be that much of a reach but he really is one of my favorite guys and the correct answer to the question is Gary Trent jr.
Brandon Ingram. I think he could be just as good as jayson tatum if he was in a similar situation.

Thanks for posting. Good work.  This Pelicans fan is happy to see either Brandon Ingram or Zion Wiliiamson looking pretty good in every one of your charts.
Zion is at the exact trajectory that was expected. Also one former #2 pick became an all star for you. Y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt make Brandon Ingram shit lmfao he‚Äôs a talented hard worker. Same goes for Lonzo. The pelicans FO isn‚Äôt special dawg lmfao
"I think Brandon Ingram deserves more credit. He‚Äôs been a significant positive for the Pels but their lackluster performance gets him overlooked.   He has good/ great defense, decent shooting, helps space the floor, and is vicious in the paint. Not to say he doesn‚Äôt have faults, but he definitely is better than he gets credit for and is getting a chance to ball out on the Pels."
Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram
"I feel like Brandon Ingram gets 0 respect by NBA fans, and im convinced it's because he plays in New Orleans."
"The Pelicans turned one of LeBron's rejects, Brandon Ingram, immediately into an All-Star and the Most Improved Player in the league.  They turned another LeBron reject, Lonzo Ball, from a .315 three-point shooter into a .376 three-point shooter (without which Ball would have had to sign for the free-agent minimum).  And Zion Williamson has certainly blossomed very quickly into a far more well-rounded player than almost anyone else in the league expected.  The current Pelicans front office knows what they're doing."
I always felt like this award should go to the lower drafted dudes or guys that come from the G League. Brandon Ingram is a beast but he was also a #2 pick. Devonte Graham went from a 2nd round pick averaging 5 points and 3 assists his rookie year. Next season he goes for 18 and 7.5
"Not like LAL can develop talent to save their lives anyway...  Outside of Caruso, and *maybe* KCP, what players drafted by the Lakers have actually blossomed there?  Julius Randle - After leaving LA, he gets huge MIP noise, and even some MVP discussion after leading NYK back to the Playoffs.  D'Angelo Russell - After leaving LA, he becomes one of the centerpieces of a young Brooklyn team that made it back to the Playoffs after a decent absence.  Jordan Clarkson - After leaving LA, he wins 6MOTY on UTAH, is instrumental in putting The Jazz in the position to make the (admittedly disappointing) post-season run they did.  Lonzo Ball - Has greatly improved his shooting to become one of the more coveted 3&amp;D guys on the market (4yrs, 85mil coveted).  Brandon Ingram - Turns into KD-lite, shows flashes on Tatum-level ability. Very impressive young guy.  Point is, even without Lebron not allowing some of these guys the chance to grow, which of them were even likely to grow when The Lakers talent development is such booty?

"I like Brandon Ingram, but he hasn't proven anything yet, either.  I guess you're impressed by Orlando finishing #8 in the Eastern Conference. In my opinions the Pelicans would have played .500 if they were in that conference."

Hate it when they call Brandon Ingram BI. It doesn‚Äôt even sound cool
"Exactly. MPJ is an elite play finisher, but Murray is way ahead of him in other aspects of the game like playmaking.   MPJ had one of the worst assist percentages in the league last year at 5.2%, good for 487th in the league.  For reference, the two players immediately ahead of him are Willie Cauley-Stein and Taj Gibson, and those right below him are Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford.  To compare, before the injury Murray was 111th at 19.7%. Other similar shotmaking wings also rank a lot higher, like Tatum (113th, 19.6%), PG13 (67th, 23.9%), Brandon Ingram (87th, 21.8%).  On top of that, 79.2% of his made shots were assisted on. Other elite wings can create for themselves much more reliably, which is a huge part of being a top option.   To compare again: Murray (41.8%), Tatum (40.8%), PG13 (42.9%), Ingram (48.5%)  He's gonna be elite as a shotmaker, but to really be a 1B type guy he needs to make some big, big strides in other areas of his game, like playmaking and creating his own shot vs. it being created for him."
I genuinely thought he was Brandon Ingram for a bit yesterday from a post I saw lol
"&gt;1) Zion and Brandon Ingram will not work out as a duo. Ingram is good but his lack of defense is too much to overcome.  tbh I thought this one WAS popular. it's clear that zion needs to be next to a playmaker, not another scoring big."
Hahahaha we have drafted 2 all time greats in magic amd Kobe.   Didn‚Äôt the lakers draft brandon ingram? Didn‚Äôt he make the all star game last year?   Most of what I say about Boston is just laker/Celtic bullshit trash talk. Take a deep breath and you‚Äôll be ok.
"Jayson Tatum is overrated, BUT is still a good player. I think he, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown are all about the same."
"Brandon Ingram is one of, if not the most, underrated player in the league, and Zion is a worse defender than him as well."
"&gt;Zion and Brandon Ingram will not work out as a duo. Ingram is good but his lack of defense is too much to overcome.  is Ingram a bad defender? he was legit really good at it as a Laker?  &gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He‚Äôs going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  What has MPJ done to prove that he's better than Murray right now?  &gt;The Bulls have turned themselves into the next Pacers. They have a bunch of good players but no great players. They‚Äôre not going to win a playoff series with this core.  That's just common sense, THe bulls aren't a top 4 team in the east by any measure  &gt;NBA‚Äôs G-League Ignite is a waste of money. The G-League system as a minor league makes a lot of sense. However, competing with the NCAA is looking a gift horse in the mouth.  How is it a waste of money? if they can get better talent, then more people will want to watch those games."

"Not a good playmaker. Dude you dumb as rocks, DLo is not only a good playmaker, he's a great (but not elite) playmaker. He's a comparable or better playmaker than Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram. Some of these guys benefit from having a more aggressive scoring game and being the clear focal point of their team (Dame, Ja, Fox), and some of these guys numbers are depressed because of the team and system within which they play (according to my eye: Donovan Mitchell for sure, maybe BI)."
"&gt; The Pelicans are the Lillard wild card, with Brandon Ingram and oodles of future picks from several teams.  Interesting scenario I never thought about.  I guess if they / Zion are really serious about winning now this trade would make sense."
"i love zach lowe, but (trying not to be a homer here) the pels coverage is a bit odd in this article.  he says we moved ""down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry"". that's not true, we traded from 10 to 17, thats 7 spots. but regardless, in that deal we also moved eric bledose, who he doesnt talk about at all in the pels section. talk to anybody who watched this team last year, he was a total weight around the neck of this team, so that trade did a TON of addition by subtraction, in my view. he then says that if we improve next year ""it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram"", which could be true, but not having bledsoe or adams will absolutely help.   he also says ""The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic."" remind me which two picks we burned? we sent a lakers pick to the grizz, but the other we traded one for graham in the s&amp;t, but that one is lottery protected, after which it turns into two seconds. so if we don't make the playoffs next year, we dont trade a first rounder at all. i get zach needs to be concise, but thats fairly large context.  im totally open to calling the pelicans ""losers"" when it comes to free agency. we wanted lowry, we didnt get him, that's an L. not trying to nit pick, but i just have some issues with the context provided here."
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Lebron, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo."
"Intereting he still has Draymond this high. Simmons also although Im not surprised by that. SGA is too high for me feels like he's doing the thing alot of people do where players are largely just defined through like 2 variables, very often PPG/TS% and nothing else. Conley also too high for me and I dont see the reason for the disconnect between Ja and Fox's ranking to that degree.   I would disagree with Jrue being in a tier higher than Beal for sure. I like Jrue alot but the way his postseason play is talked about is largely just the benefit of having the privilege of playing with Giannis because nobody is talking about how cool his defense looks while he was a mess offensively most of the Suns/Nets series without Giannis and other stuff happening. This also means he has Bam a whole tier higher than KAT which is interesting.  &gt;In an informal poll of some league folks over the first few days of summer league, I learned there was some consensus that, ignoring contract status, Siakam would be more helpful to a team with genuine title aspirations than the forwards in Tier 4 such as Randle and Brandon Ingram, which is the entire point of this endeavor.  I agree with this."
"First of all, LeBron went to the Lakers to play with Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram. There was an assumption but no guarantee that they would be able to find him co-star(s).  Second of all, this sub has shat all over Westbrook for not being a winning player since the year he won NBA. He hasn't posted a TS over 50% since 2017. Before the Lakers completed the trade for him the majority opinion was that they'd be better off with Buddy Hield. Now he's on the Lakers on a horrendous contract and that supposedly makes them a superteam. lol  We can talk about Cleveland too if you want."
"If he turns out to be Brandon Ingram that's a really, really good outcome. Still a long, long ways from getting you to being a contender. And Ingram took til year 4 to really be a star."
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d‚ÄôAngelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You‚Äôre just talking out of your ass üòÇ"
"first of all we never got that offer and also the Pels got Ingram, Lonzo, and Hart as well as having Zion fall to them through the grace of God and have been worse than us every single season and Zion already wants out. Sure Brandon Ingram would be nice but i‚Äôm happy with our 3 years of DeMar and Jakob and Keldon, BI ain‚Äôt taking us anywhere"
"The Lakers problem was in not recognizing that Deng could only play the 4 when they signed him, because they gave him that huge contract to play small forward instead. Back then the Lakers had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr at the 4, but only had just-drafted Brandon Ingram at the 3, so they signed Deng to be the starter there.   But Deng was not a good enough shooter, nor was he quick enough defensively on the perimeter to play SF anymore, so the Lakers ended up just wasting all that money. If Deng wasn't on such a gigantic contract they easily could have traded him to a team looking for a small ball 4, but nobody wanted him at $18 million per year, and the Lakers didn't want to just bench one of their promising young PFs, so Deng ended up getting squeezed.   So it wasn't that Deng couldn't play, it's just that the Lakers wildly overpaid him when they had no minutes available at the position he played."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

Brandon Ingram (2016 draft) is younger than Chris Duarte.
"If you're playing defense on someone who is a bad shooter, you don't owe them any respect from beyond the line. If a defender doesn't have to guard the perimeter as adamantly, they're free to ""sag off"" closer to the basket, stuffing the inside and making it harder for the offensive team as a whole. If I'm guarding someone who excels in the paint, like Zion, I'm going to have trouble and I'd probably receive help defense. However, if the help defender's assignment is a shooter like Brandon Ingram, he'll get a wide open look. Replace Ingram with someone like Westbrook, who isn't much of a shooter, and there's less risk of leaving them wide open because they might not be able to capitalize. If LeBron is driving and is doubled, he'd usually pass out to a shooter like KCP, but he has to settle for Westbrook, who is also at his best in the paint. By then, there's already two defender's in the paint, who might be able to contest every shot."
"Outside of the OKC anomaly season‚Ä¶this guy is realistically worth around $12-$15 million a year. It‚Äôs simply baffling what he was asking for.   $25-$30 million per year is Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Brandon Ingram, etc money‚Ä¶aka bonafide all star. Just a perfect example of not knowing your worth and horrible risk assessment."
Brandon Ingram should be a top defensive player in the league with his height and wingspan.   6‚Äô8 and same wingspan as Giannis and Kawhi. Durant might be only forward with a larger one.   He‚Äôs not bad but he shoud be elite
Yeah but right now Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram are better than Jalen Green. It‚Äôs all about how much he is willing to work on his game. No doubt he could be a very very very good NBA player if he puts in the necessary work.
"Definitely. We have seen high risk high reward rookie wings in Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, they took 3-4 years to figure everything out. Green already made tremendous strides since he joined the G League, I am optimistic about him."
It's a great gameplan by New Orleans. Trade Zion to Minnesota and he'll be begging to go back to New Orleans. When he hits free agency sell him on the idea of teaming up with KAT and a *hopefully* improved Brandon Ingram lmao
"Yeah but that‚Äôs still one HOF level player. The best player on the pre-Lebron Lakers was Brandon Ingram, who wasn‚Äôt what he is now and certainly never will be Paul Pierce."
"The Pelicans weren‚Äôt even bad with CP3, yet everyone acts like we missed the playoffs every year with him just because he requested a trade, and he requested the trad ebecause of how our past owner ran things. We were bad with AD with a bad FO, but we still almost made things right with the Boogie trade, until he tore his Achilles.   Now we have a new owner (old one died) and a totally new FO except for Fred Vinson who is a great assistant.  I know everyone wants to act like we massively failed this off-season because we lost the next great star PG in Lonzo Ball apparently, but if you watched the Pelicans and know that Lonzo was just a good role player for us, you‚Äôd know that the Pelicans were in a good position. Even if they only made the play-in tournament this year, we have no bad contracts, and a ton of good young players and picks, not to mention a top 10 center in Jonas Valunciounas, and a solid PG in Graham, and a All star in Brandon Ingram.  Everyone thinks the clippers will be fine with Paul George and role players like Reggie Jackson, Batum, Morris etc. this year, so shouldn‚Äôt the generational talent people are claiming we are wasting be able to be just as good with Valunciounas, Brandon Ingram, Graham, and good young pieces around them?  I know since your a Lakers fan your used to teams being able to make themselves better immediately by signing a difference maker that wanted to play for them. The Pelicans tried to do that, but no one wanted to play here from free agency. And you may want to say that small market teams can be successful because of the Bucks, but it took the Bucks a few years to get there too. It‚Äôs crazy that y‚Äôall already decided we‚Äôve failed Zion when he‚Äôs played basically only 1 year with us.  And we are going in the right direction considering we‚Äôve gotten better every year, and our core consist of young players who will continue to get better, and a veteran who won‚Äôt fall off soon. Not to mention all the picks and lack of bad contracts we have for flexibility in the future."
New Orleans has like 9 or 10 first round picks available to trade. A more likely trade may be Brandon Ingram and a couple picks or a bunch of picks and a couple decent young players
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"&gt;Your answer is just for small market teams to‚Ä¶ be better.   Well obviously being better is good advice for anyone. But how about just ""don't be terrible"" as a standard to try to meet? Keep in mind, the Pelicans went years without a medical or training staff dedicated to the team, and they just fired a coach after one season. And that's before even getting to the stupid signings and trades they've made.   &gt; The truth is, large markets will always be able to draw way bigger talent   This is definitely an advantage that big markets have, but this doesn't mean small market teams are incapable of competing. There's really no substitute for great ownership and management, and big market teams definitely do not have a monopoly on that.   &gt;Most teams don‚Äôt get to turn Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, and a couple of draft picks for an MVP candidate  Two #2 overall picks, the #4 overall pick, two unprotected picks and two pick swaps is some kind of shit return now?  &gt; LeBron is already there because of the brand opportunity.    #1 the Lakers deserve all the credit for building that brand, and they did it through great ownership in Dr. Jerry Buss and great management in Jerry West, and they did this over decades. It didn't just magically appear. #2 the Lakers didn't just have ""brand opportunity"" they also had two max cap slots and the assets to trade for a third star. That's the kind of situation that is appealing to lots of players, even if the team isn't in LA.   &gt;Players don‚Äôt force their teams hands to leave for Milwaukee or Sacramento.   Like Jrue Holiday? He just wanted to go to a place where he could win, and after being traded from one small market in New Orleans to another in Milwaukee, he immediately signed an extension, and the reason is because the Bucks are run well.   My basic point is this: the Pelicans can't keep being poorly run and expect good players to want to play there. This is true for any team, even the Lakers. When Jim Buss was the Lakers' GM they were rejected by a whole slew of free agents and had Dwight Howard walk away in free agency. So even the Lakers can't expect to just get whomever they want if they're a poorly run team."
"Your answer is just for small market teams to‚Ä¶ be better. That‚Äôs it. That ‚Äúmargin for error‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about is so much bigger than you‚Äôre making it.   Was OKC poorly run for PG to force his way to LA? Toronto for Kawhi to go there? The truth is, large markets will always be able to draw way bigger talent and small markets have to 1) hit on the draft with a lot of luck, 2) immediately form a huge team around a rookie or 2nd year player, and 3) hope that they don‚Äôt run into buzz saws like LA, Brooklyn, or Golden State.   Most teams don‚Äôt get to turn Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, and a couple of draft picks for an MVP caliber player, knowing that someone like LeBron is already there because of the brand opportunity. Players don‚Äôt force their teams hands to leave for Milwaukee or Sacramento. It just doesn‚Äôt happen."
&gt; he traded two lottery picks for DLO (read: more than what the Lakers paid for AD  are you counting max contract wiggins as a lottery pick but not counting brandon ingram and lonzo ball as lottery picks?
Brandon Ingram Jonathan Isaac Paul George Karl Anthony Towns
"I think KD definetely changed the way teams draft now, GMs in the draft are now more frequently drafting Tall Lanky guys with Guard like talents in the draft to get a big swing and I think some of that can be attributed to KD.  Kristaps Porzingis, Brandon Ingram, MPJ, soon Emoni Bates/Victor Wembanyama."
&gt; or we start seeing a bunch of 7 foot ball handling shooters.  Brandon Ingram? He fits the KD mold of a Very Tall Shot Creating/Ball Handler.
"We can‚Äôt say Griffin hasn‚Äôt tried to help Zion. He gave him Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Steven Adams, SVG as a coach.   I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough."
"What star player could be traded for Simmons where the team would be happy with getting Simmons in return though? Like if Lillard or Beal asked out and were traded for Simmons, I seriously doubt the Blazers or Wizards would feel like by just getting Simmons in return that they'll just continue on as they were before having swapped one star for another.   Now lower it to the next tier down and say someone like Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown or SGA got traded for Simmons: would New Orleans, Boston or OKC be happy with that swap? Cause I don't think so. I think they'd feel like it was probably still a step down for what they want to do. It's only when you go down to the next level below that where I think the team receiving Simmons would feel happy, but then the Sixers probably would feel like they weren't getting enough in return."
Brandon Ingram is a better offensive player than Tatum is my hot take.
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"

"There were a few games down the stretch where Brandon Ingram tried to score in the clutch and took horrible shots. It then turned into this exact narrative you are talking about.   In the second part of the year, he stopped handling the ball so much in the clutch thanks to a coaching change from SVG.   Calling him a black hole on offense because he was their first option in the clutch and did a horrible job doesnt change the fact that he holds the ball less, dribbles the ball less, and passes the ball more than most small of the elite small forwards in the league. Not only is your take outdated because he like ‚Ä¶ stopped, it just ignores the 3 quarters and 10 minutes of other basketball.   It‚Äôs a narrative that went too far. Ingram is a solid passer and is certainly not a black hole in general. So when you tell me ‚ÄúI watched a bunch of pelicans games‚Äù and then reiterate the same false narrative/outdated narrative that most Pelican fans would roll their eyes at, I have a hard to believing you."
"Brandon Ingram, I just never get to catch pels games and barely saw his laker days"

"Hard to know for sure, but for what it‚Äôs worth, here are some relevant quotes from the athletic.  Pelicans beat writer‚Äôs response to the question ‚ÄúWhy wasn't Van Gundy a good fit?‚Äù  &gt; Van Gundy was hired to change the culture in New Orleans and bring a new mindset focused on accountability and defensive tenacity to a young and upcoming group. He ended up failing on both fronts. The Pelicans finished 23rd in defensive rating after Van Gundy's first season, and there were stretches when they looked absolutely lost on that end. A huge part of it was Van Gundy's inability to get Williamson and Brandon Ingram to fully buy in on that end. The players weren't fond of his coaching style and it was only a matter of time before things went sour.   Same writer on the top priorities for a new coach:  &gt; There has to be work done to mend fences with Williamson and Ingram. They weren't thrilled with the Van Gundy experience, and keeping them happy has to be the No. 1 priority for New Orleans  There was also an article written jointly by Shams, that same beat writer, and one other writer. Relevant quotes on Ingram and Zion(‚Äòs family) -  &gt; Sources indicated that Brandon Ingram, an All-Star under Gentry, was not a fan of Van Gundy‚Äôs coaching style. Ingram openly talked about the way Van Gundy used Williamson and him in certain offensive sets and how they rarely worked together to get each other easier looks.  &gt; for most of this season, certain Williamson family members voiced displeasure with the organization. Among the targets of their criticism was Van Gundy, who they felt was too rigid and demanding as head coach, but also with the organization, which they claim did not live up to what they felt should be the standard for a star like Williamson. Numerous opposing league executives had heard the complaints, and they were confirmed by Pelicans officials."
"Well what is the point in bringing up Trezz at all? The Lakers had to trade him to get Westbrook. He‚Äôs no longer on the Lakers roster. Why does the fact that the Lakers previously had a player with similarities to Faried have any bearing on potentially signing Faried now?  That‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúWhy should the Lakers sign Ariza, Brandon Ingram was so much better!‚Äù"

After what I saw Jamal Murray do in the bubble...he gets the number one pick. Jaylen Brown 2nd cause of his two way skills but he still can't get a bucket like Jamal. Then it's between Simmons and Brandon Ingram depending on what you're looking for. Defense or offense. Actually you'd be better served with Siakim at 3rd or 2nd and then Simmons and BI can fight for that 4th pick.

Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
"This isn't really true. For one, he plays 50% of his minutes at the wrong position, he would be a better defender if he played 100% of his minutes at the 5. He's also a decent defensive player, idk why people think he's a liability. He's also a much better defensive player than Brandon Ingram."
"It was pretty stark watching Jrue and Brandon Ingram play defense on the same team. Ingram has gotten a little better, but in that season he would just die on every screen, but Jrue would beat screens almost like they weren't even there."
Brandon Ingram has never been in the playoffs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   Same shit with Giannis' playoff failures. People were saying Butler was better and more valuable yadda yadda yadda.  He's still an all star level player even with his limitations
"Hell no give me jaylen brown, Brandon Ingram sabonis and Jamal Murray over simmons right now"
Nor is he much better than Brandon Ingram but nobody pays attention to him cuz he's in NOLA lol
"This is an interesting draft cause there are 4-5 guys with arguments here. Between remaining potential, what they‚Äôve done so far, fit, it could still be Ben, it probably would be brown, but there‚Äôs also arguments for Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram and Domantas Sabonis"
Did brandon Ingram leave or am I missing something
"Ingram, WTF? Lol. Brandon Ingram?"
"Look all Imma say about this, is that New Orleans was probably the worst place Zion could go. Smallest market in the league and front office that doesnt seem very competent. The only saving grace is he gets to play with Brandon Ingram. Everyone is aware just how much the hype of his college season has died down despite him proving that the hype was warranted. I think instagram followers is a pretty good way to measure how popular a player is and Zion's has been trending downwards instead up, despite his fantastic season. Just look at his social blade. https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/zionwilliamson/monthly This is in stark difference to his contemporaries like ja morant, lamelo ball Nd Luka doncic whose social media are still climbing at a consistent pace. Although Zion is also not the best at marketing himself. Players care about this stuff more than you would think. If the Pelicans don't show they can build a consistent playoff team around him, I think it's entirely possible that he might want out earlier than expected."
Ignoring this fact is the biggest issue. Tip toeing around subjects like race and avoiding how race plays a factor in alot of things isnt doing anybody any favors. Nobody is actually colorblind and we have to stop pretending like we are. Im not saying everyone should be a proud racist but we should be able to acknowledge our biases.  And Luka is elite. Its not too far fetched to have him as a favorite. It gets weird when a middle of the road player like Tyler Herro gets hyped to the point where people are legitimately wanting him over James Harden. You‚Äôd never see something like that said about more promising young talent like Brandon Ingram or Devin Booker.

"De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony (take note, OP) Towns.  The underrated starting 5."
Lebron wasn't going go give up better chances for a ring if Kyrie stayed vs. playing with 2nd year Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram lol
"Brandon Ingram, rondo. Either morris brother."
"Actually, that lyric was about Jerome Robinson and Brandon Ingram. Unfortunately, Ye was wrong üòî"
Not Brandon Ingram? Those are some strange choices
"Yeah! You know what this world needs more of? Violence. That would really make things better.  The fights you see now aren‚Äôt like this. All they are are little quick 5-10 second tussles. No one really takes them seriously, even the announcers, unless someone sucker punches someone or cheap shots someone, in which case they *should* shit on that player for doing something like that.  Just look at the way TNT handled the secret tunnel saga and the CP3/Rondo fight. It was 90% jokes and 10% trashing Brandon Ingram for the running sucker punch."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
You clearly don't watch the games because why would the Best Wing Defender not be guarding Brandon Ingram  Lonzo's own stats prove you're wrong
"I agree. That was so stupid with the Knicks part. I get the Celtics part atleast, but the Knicks? Come on. We traded fucking Brandon Ingram who became an all-star instantly in Pels"
"Brandon Ingram's best attribute is his scoring ability and I dont think Ingram is one of the best 10 scorers in the NBA.  Where as Ben Simmons is probably Top 10 in defense, playmaking &amp; athleticism."
"Kidd / Marbury was kind of like if you traded... maybe Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram last year (before Simmons's perception tanked)? Or Collin Sexton with a much higher profile on a marginally better team.   Kidd had gotten way farther in fixing his garbage jumper by then than Simmons has, and he'd been The Man on some good teams, but he was still an extremely unusual star player who hadn't gone deep into the playoffs yet (and the domestic violence case was very much on the Suns' brass's minds). Marbury had put up big numbers and was definitely a star in terms of his public profile, and he was meaningfully younger, but his teams hadn't done anything yet.   If you think about Simmons for Sexton, you can see the outlines of the version the team getting Marbury wins‚ÄîSimmons is just too weird to build a team around and we've already seen him at his best, Sexton thrives on a good team‚Äîand you can see what actually happened if you're able to imagine Ben Simmons hitting threes sometimes and having a full personality transplant."
Still Simmons. Whatever they get for him in a trade will still probably be better than Brandon Ingram.
Brandon Ingram and his defense
"Brandon Ingram isn't a centerpiece player on a roster ? Just made his first all star team  Julius randle isn't a centerpiece ?! He just made all NBA lo  What are talking about lol  So lebron says something, and you don't believe it....i get it, you just have something against lebron, that kind of brings context to all of the other ridiculous things youve been saying  Clearly you don't watch basketball, you just watch skip Bayless and bring his takes back to here"
"Brandon Ingram got a max, D'Angelo Russell got a max, randle got a bag, Nance is a great player, Josh Hart is a great bench player, Kuz just got us Russell Westbrook lol  We drafted great players, even our second rounders like Jordan Clarkson hit , Thomas Bryant is starting for the wiz, this idea of disappointing players is garbage   &gt;I highly doubt magic was the dominant factor there, but ya never know I guess.   Literally gave an article with lebron saying why he went to la, and it had nothing to do with the movies or the night life, he could have stayed in Miami if he just wanted the nightlife   &gt;And no, nowhere was I talking about Pelinka specifically there.  That's why it's a garbage statement, lebron and AD were not products of the previous FO, so it's just you saying general statements that have no context   The Lakers were bad for a period of time , what does that have to do with the reason lebron is here now? We had the assets and the cap space and lebron saw that as well"
"People really dont remember how good that CP3, D-West, Tyson Chandler, Peja team was huh?  Or that the Pels were a Boogie Cousins injury away from being pretty special with Ad and Jrue and Mirotic  Anyway, none of those guys had a talent like BI on the team with them. A young ascending all-star with the ability to be a great.  Zion has played 85 NBA games. After Steph Curry's first 85 games he had won 30 games. (dame=35, Giannis=17!) Think if all  the media teamed up to say he (Steph)  should go to the Knicks. How insanely premature would that have been as we would have been robbed of an all-time great team. We are about to go into what should be the first full 82 game season of Zion's career. He will have the best Center he's ever played beside, an ever improving Brandon Ingram, and more shooters and spacing he's ever had to work with. Either have some patience as Greatness isnt rushed, or admit that you're own of those fans that only supports, the Lakers, Celtics, whatever team Lebron is on etc  &amp;#x200B;  (Edit: I typed ""CP#"" instead of CP3 cause I'm a dummy)"
"I don‚Äôt like the messaging. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt have a good supporting cast around Zion‚Äô. Geez are fans that easily influenced. He‚Äôs played 2 years!! He himself hasn‚Äôt even arrive yet. He has an all star Brandon Ingram.   It‚Äôs crazy fans and media are so impressionable they‚Äôre like robots, trying to force Zion into a cp3 , AD, lebron storyline. They aren‚Äôt alike. Not to mention the Suns getting to the finals, and the jazz being a 1 seed with pretty typical supporting cast, pretty much kills all those lazy ‚Äòno help‚Äô narratives. Look at Dallas they have squat but Luka wills them.   So yea man this bothers me, Zion hasn‚Äôt done shit but media and fans are aiding him in this lazy ass con job to leave Nola."
"Pelicans are about to start with bad record (3-15), Brandon Ingram &amp; Zion won‚Äôt get along, meaning BI will be leaving at the end of the season."
"I think that Don Nelson was just REALLY high on Billy Owens and wanted a power forward (which is odd, because Owens ended up playing SF most of his career).   Owens was a solid player. No doubt.  But when you have an All-NBA calibre player, you don't dump him for the 3rd overall pick.   Can you imagine the Warriors trading Klay Thompson at the age of 25 for a Dragan Bender, Krish Dunn, Brandon Ingram, or Jaylon Brown?  It's a little different, sure, but still...   I don't think it was a cap issue.   Certainly, in 10-15 years, kids will look back on the James Harden trade and, being unaware of the cap situation, will think ""That was stupid."" A one-year rental on Kevin Martin and Steve Adams for James Harden?  And that was a BAD trade, even given that it was done for cap reasons (though Kevin Martin was expected to play better)."
Brandon Ingram too
Lotta people in this thread ignoring the fact that they could have gotten Brandon Ingram...
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2783443-lakers-trade-rumors-brandon-ingram-named-as-part-of-possible-kawhi-leonard-deal.amp.html
Parrot this: Call me when Brandon Ingram plays some defense.
Brandon Ingram never lost to anybody that didn't win the title.
"The only basketball reason to talk about him more would be if he had a unique style (he doesn‚Äôt, Trae was like this and Zion is like this) or was eminently gonna outperform a max contract (Luka was like this, Embiid was like this).  if he‚Äôs just a max contract player there‚Äôs room for 90 of them in the league, and he‚Äôs definitely getting talked about more than Middleton or like‚Ä¶ Brandon Ingram. It‚Äôs cool. We talk the right amount about Edwards as a culture."
I mean they know that as long as the Lakers are at full strength the chances the Suns reach the Finals again are as slim as Brandon Ingram so who can blame him?
"Brandon Ingram and lonzo are ""trash"" lmao, as usual Chuck with the great takes"
Hinkie said he would have taken Brandon Ingram over ben Simmons so there is that... I liked Ingram more then and I think obviously would have been a better fit with joel embiid.  Simmons just doesnt put effort in getting better on the offensive front.
Brandon Ingram is better than Brown.
"&gt;  it‚Äôs simply that the Lakers had the best offer for AD by far due to good drafting,   Huh?  they had the best offer because AD said straight out he wouldn't re-sign anywhere else.  So every other team was bidding on AD on a 1 year deal lol.  Just another way they benefited from being LA  &gt; None of those young guys were in their primes yet on the Lakers, so to judge them as a ‚Äúnon playoff team‚Äù when all the guys were 19-22 is not a fair statement, especially since they are all being paid big time now for other teams.  It's not fair to judge a team that failed to get even close to the playoffs in 7 years?  You know what we call those teams normally?  The Kings and the Timberwolves. The Hawks rebuilt in 2 years.  The Lakers just sucked, and having 3 number 2 picks and getting Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, and Dlo is really not good.  A lot of teams haven't drafted that high in a fucking decade.  Let alone 3 times"
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
&gt; Brandon Ingram has never been an all star.  He was literally all-star in 2020.
"Brandon Ingram has never been an all star. You‚Äôll know he‚Äôs an all star when the pelicans are actually good and on pace to make the playoffs. It‚Äôs like last year with Julius Randle, before the season nobody ever thought he‚Äôd be an all star, but the he won game after game for the Knicks and his play had become elevated to that level. Big numbers aren‚Äôt enough to get your first all star selection, you need to win games."
They let him go because for the money he makes it‚Äôs not worth it. The pelicans got a lot of mediocre talent in exchange for a top 10 player. Packages centered around Jaylen Brown from the Celtics or RJ Barrett from the Knicks would‚Äôve probably worked out better for the Pels than Brandon Ingram. Jaylen Brown is flat out better than Ingram and RJ Barrett is on the same timeline as Zion and would make an actually good sidekick to him unlike Ingram.
"They got Brandon Ingram who turned out be an all star player. Lonzo who is a serviceable PG, and Josh Hart whose a good role player. And they got a bunch of draft picks. The Pels got a good return for AD. Their management just sucks at building teams around high level talents, which is why you have ominous signs from Zion and Lonzo skipped town for Chicago."
"I feel like this is revisionist history with the AD trade. At the time, it was seen as a great haul by NO. Brandon Ingram blossomed and became an all star, Lonzo had a rough first year but showed his potential in his second year in NO, Josh Hart has continued to be a quality rotational player, and they got three first round picks including the 4th overall...they fucked up the 4th pick by trading down and not simply taking Deandre Hunter but that's on NO. It was a quality deal, Boston or New York wasn't going to offer more than the Lakers."
Brandon Ingram is going to be as good as Tatum you heard it here first.
In 3 years Brandon Ingram will be more relevant than AD
Yeah Brandon Ingram isn't trash lol
"We meed THT to be our last young long boi. We lost Brandon Ingram and now Kuzma so Laker fans needed a replacement.   Beyond that who the hell else can Laker fans really overhype, the team is filled with old dudes who are already well established or on a serious downturn in their long careers. We going to hype the promise of Melo and Rondo turning into stars?"
So you didn‚Äôt enjoy Rondo spitting on CP3 then hitting him with the two piece? Or Brandon Ingram coming in with the go go gadget jab?
"&gt; Lou Williams has had a much, much better career than Caruso. He‚Äôs 34 now, of course a dropoff was coming lol. Remind me who averaged 23 a game as a sixth man on the Clips? I get PPG isn‚Äôt everything but Caruso topped out at uhh‚Ä¶ 6 a game.  Cool. We were talking about who'd be better in the 2020 playoffs and Caruso provided elite defense, elite off-ball cutting/screening, pushed the pace in transition and just straight up helped the team.  Lou, as he literally has in every playoffs of his career except 2019, disappeared in the playoffs, shot an abysmal % from everywhere, was hunted defensively whenever he touched the hardwood, and provided nothing off-ball.   Every impact stat already had Caruso as the better player but this sub refused to admit it.  &gt; Lonzo is a bust. He‚Äôs not playing like a #2 pick, nor has he ever. He‚Äôs not bad but he‚Äôs extremely flawed at the same time.  Incorrect. People massively overrate the value of draft picks. Lonzo is an above average no2 pick.  &gt; Don‚Äôt ever remember Ingram getting called overrated. Everyone said he could be KD-lite if he got a bit less skinny and developed a bit more.  In his first 2 seasons in the league, the most upvoted comment about Ingram I've ever seen was ""challenge : explain to me the difference between Brandon Ingram and Travis Outlaw"". Every reply was along the lines of ""damn, I actually can't"" and other shit like that. You'd have gotten downvoted to hell and back for calling him a future All-Star, especially during his rookie year.  &gt; As for the other three, fully disagree with you on all counts. People thought Clarkson could be decent, which he is, people thought DLo would be better on another team with room to shine, which he was, and people thought Randle could improve if he lost his tunnel vision, which he did.  People called Clarkson an overrated inefficient chucker, definitely didn't say D-Lo would shine elsewhere, and Randle did lose his tunnel vision his last year in LA but nobody would accept it.  &gt; You‚Äôre proving me right with this comment  Ironic, you're proving me right. I guarantee you in 2 years if THT is a fringe All-Star, all we'll see on this sub is ""lmao Lakers fans and their victim complex. Everyone knew THT would be an All-Star if he cleaned up his jumper a bit""."
Brandon Ingram
I think it was the season after the KD/Dray thing Brandon Ingram and Rondo swung on Chris Paul
Reminds me of when Brandon Ingram grew after his rookie year in the league
I‚Äôve been salty since we drafted him dude I wanted Brandon Ingram to begin with but blaming the sixers for this is so dumb just stop. What favors has he ever done them ahahahaha. Yea not gonna do the team that pays me any favors by improving my own worth wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.  He never did them favors to begin with. You‚Äôre a clown. Bye
"&gt; TCC: The biggest drop I‚Äôve noticed was Brandon Ingram. Dude claimed he was 6‚Äô11‚Äù, then the re-measurements dropped him down to a 6‚Äô7‚Äù  &gt; sp0907: I've never seen him claimed to be 6'11. It was 6'9 for the longest time.  &gt; TCC: Yeah you‚Äôre right, I was misremembering.  Smh"
"Right and by that logic New Orleans should have traded Anthony Davis to a team that could give them role players they could flip for late firsts instead of just taking the young star in Brandon Ingram.  Those late 1sts could have been anything, even Brandon Ingram / Eric Gordon."
Brandon Ingram finna be 2x
"Yall had really good defense though, plus the pels did a good job of hiding their most consistent plays - swing ball and kick out to Graham &amp; Brandon Ingram PnR to get him free going into the paint. I anticipate the pels to look pretty nice going fwd and for their young guys to start stepping yo. NAW is rly nice with it. Imo yall win that IF BI didnt hit those two airballs, seemed to shift momentum and deflate the pels &amp; arena"
The pels did hold him back and the answer is brandon ingram and eric bledsoe. The difference with the bulls is that only derozan is a ball stopper and even derozan is a more willing passer than bledsoe bi or zion. The pieces just dont fit in NOLA.  Their players play similarly to the stars in boston where iso ball dominates the way they play.
"Brandon ""DeMar DeRozan"" Ingram"
Mine was Brandon Ingram is too skinny/doesn't have the frame to put on any muscle to be great in the NBA
Brandon Ingram what the fuck?
Brandon Ingram used to be on the Lakers so that‚Äôs close enough
Brandon Ingram vs Atlanta
I lowkey forgot Brandon Ingram was still around but damn that dude gets buckets
Brandon Ingram is a problem
he's older than Brandon Ingram who is playing his sixth NBA season
idk Brandon Ingram is still a stikk
"Ain't working for Brandon Ingram. I'd say Zion is even taking has share, too."
"Well depending on when Zion comes back and how he plays, that‚Äôs another open spot. But I don‚Äôt think Wiggins gets it or deserves it over Brandon Ingram unless Pelicans have 3 wins"
Wtf  That's like when I believed Luka was too hyped coming into his rookie year  Or KD would be washed after his injury  Or Randle peaked with LA  Or Embiid couldn't stay healthy enough to do anything impactful in the NBA  Or Brandon Ingram would be an all-nba player by now
Brandon Ingram should start being in these list again
I remember debating this so much with my friend. When Brandon Ingram and DeAaron Fox were rookies i said these 2 will be better than Ben Simmons soon if Simmons stayed the same.  Fast forward to today... I throw my hands up *I told you so*
"yeah it's almost like lebron isn't interested in waiting for lonzo and brandon ingram to develop into the all-star caliber players they are right now, whereas zion is literally still on his rookie deal and has all the time in the world"
"brandon ingram has been a 38% 3 point shooter the last two seasons.   he's shooting 50% from 3pt this season so far.   NAW is raw but shows a ton of promise.    Devonte graham is 36% and can easily improve from range.  Ingram is an all star and a better caliber of player than anyone luka has or lebron had his first time in cleveland.    End of story.   This crazy narrative that the pelicans aren't giving zion good teammates is straight up false  you're basically saying zion is a bad fit with the center position, there's like 2 centers in the entire league who you actually think would be a good ""fit"" with zion and they are superstars on max deals.   I don't think you actually understand what it means to build a roster that fits, or really anything else about basketball.   He just isn't going to fit with anyone if he can't even stay on the floor or bother to play defense  &gt;Zion also didn‚Äôt get to chose the Pelicans. He doesn‚Äôt owe them shit.   he chose to enter the NBA draft because he wants to be a famous basketball player and earn hundreds of millions of dollars.   in doing so he agreed to abide by the drafting structure"
"-The NBA contracts need to change in some way that doesn‚Äôt allow players to secure a bag and then force themselves out. James Harden or Ben Simmons wanting out is fine by me but there has to be some sort of disadvantage to leaving your team like that. It just seems too lopsided in the players favor.  -Grayson Allen to the bucks was one of the best off-season acquisitions. As a SEC basketball fan I don‚Äôt like him but damn, he can play D shoot 3s and doesn‚Äôt commit costly turnovers. I would say he might be the 3rd most important acquisition behind DeMar and Lowry.  -speaking of DeMar, no one talks about how he just got a career high in assists last season because he was in SA. He is an all star.   -Brandon Ingram and Zion don‚Äôt work well together.  -the second half Anthony Edwards rookie season showed he‚Äôs most likely all-star bound sooner rather than later  -Russ was right about P Bev. He‚Äôs just running around fooling everyone. He doesn‚Äôt really bring anything to a team.  -Dwight Howard was elite in Charlotte"

He‚Äôs fitting fantastic with Brandon Ingram.
You sign good players. He can shoot. Who else is the unicorn player the Pels could have put next to Zion. He‚Äôs fitting just great with Brandon Ingram yet no one is acknowledging that.
# BRANDON INGRAM IS SPECIAL üó£üó£üó£
Brandon Ingram is a killer. Great game from the pels.
Brandon Ingram is an assassin
Brandon Ingram better be an all star this season. Those 4 straight shots to seal the game were just insane  Edwards went NUCLEAR in the 3rd so glad he didn‚Äôt do that the entire game.  Tell me again how Graham and JV were terrible moves for the Pels.
Brandon Ingram
"so you think lonzo, brandon ingram, josh hart and 3 first round draft picks (including #4 overall) were an underpay?  lonzo BI and josh hart are all playing extremely well right now.  the #4 pick was deandre hunter who is playing extremely well, even if the pelicans flipped him for a bad return"
"I know this isn‚Äôt official, but I always wished someone would call Brandon Ingram the Grim Sleeper"
"I'm so tired of being a Pelicans fan. Its not being a small market. We just suck.   A team of Zion, Lonzo, and Brandon Ingram plus all the other talent we have is unreal. I'm done trying. We might as well just GIVE our next #1 pick to LA. Save us the heartbreak."
"With the disclaimer that I think it's highly unlikely on a case by case basis that any of these guys would be available.  Guards: Dame, Beal, Kyrie, Conley, SGA, LaVine, FVV  Forwards: Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Gordon Hayward  Maybe I'm missing someone but that's 11 guys. I'd say there's a small chance at least one of them is available at some point. That's what we're playing for."
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
More like Brandon Ingram. Zion is on a rookie contract
"Brandon Ingram is not a floor raiser, and not worth a max contract"
When everyone thought Brandon Ingram was a bust
Brandon Ingram is pretty smooth getting to the rim.
"Thought he looked really good tonight. Thought we may keep him around when we got him in the off-season, just too deep at that position. NOLA is mismanaging talent, but I saw some games last season where Bledsoe looked completely washed. Same with adams. Something in the water down there. Brandon Ingram is a superstar with that transitive logic."

"I found the full quote I think you're talking about:  &gt;‚ÄúWhen guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it‚Äôs hard to bite your tongue,‚Äù Rondo says, ‚Äúbut I tried to get \[James\] to focus on his body language ‚Ä¶ Those young guys were looking at everything he did.

I'm also curious about the other dude's cited article about LeBron apparently doing antics that almost got him removed from Olympics consideration one year, as there was no detail about what exactly he was doing.  I presume whatever it was didn't demoralize teammates and relegated to off-court shenanigans, as even in his first Cavs stint the players were much better with him than after he left."
"Oh boy, the Pelicans look bad. Feel bad for Brandon Ingram and all those young guys. On the other hand, KFC in the state of Louisiana are doing pretty good."
Free Brandon Ingram.
Free Brandon Ingram
It's kind of wild he's older than Brandon Ingram.
"Zion Williamson's routine after the national anthem included eating, fake jell-o shots and twerking Brandon Ingram with his butt HARD. Then he prayed."
Brandon Ingram. Dude tilts his head back on the drive and gets a blocking foul more often than not
Brandon Ingram probably. Dude is such an efficient scorer but he's playing with legit scrubs. Since the AD trade the Pels have been going south

I wouldn‚Äôt trade Ben for Brandon Ingram straight up.   It just feels really good to say that for some reason

"No one is talking about it, and maybe there's zero chance of this, but I'm wondering if the Sixers might be able to pry Brandon Ingram away from the Pelicans in some kind of Simmons trade.   I don't know how Simmons would fit with Zion, but it has become pretty clear that Zion and Ingram aren't a great fit, they have like a -3 net rating when on the floor together overall. It's not like Ingram was ever their guy, he was part of the AD mess so maybe they could be convinced if the price is right. I do think he could work really well at SF on the Sixers, though one wonders of he and Tobias would be competing for similar lanes at times on offense. Regardless I think he would be an improvement over the current roster without Ben, has all star potential, but hasn't reached his full potential not unlike Ben, but in different ways."

Yes...he wasn't that good. He'd be Brandon Ingram in today's league.

"The primary positive (from Bens perspective) difference between this game and Ben games is that Brandon Ingram had a lot of possessions he just walked up the court and scored, the beginning of the third was just him and embiid trading buckets. When Bens there, for all his flaws, he makes the other teams #1 guy live through hell, no easy pull-ups. Of course, in the 3rd and 4th Matisse kind of got his act together and clamped up Ingram the same way Ben does and that was that."
"The Lakers right now could have: 1) Lonzo Ball, 2) some SG they could‚Äôve drafted probably, 3) Brandon Ingram, 4) Julius Randle, 5) Ivica Zubac, Caruso off the bench.  I wonder if they‚Äôd prefer that to the ring and what they have now."
that tech on embiid is weak but Brandon Ingram hasn't gotten a single free throw this game despite his constant driving so i'm not gonna argue it
"I‚Äôm down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric ‚ÄúThe Actual Devil‚Äù Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn‚Äôt land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can‚Äôt fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn‚Äôt even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We‚Äôre also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we‚Äôre better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
I think he‚Äôs just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they‚Äôre not on the Lakers. Examples:  -	Julius Randle -	Jordan Clarkson -	D‚ÄôAngelo Russel -	Larry Nance -	Brandon Ingram -	Lonzo Ball -	Alex Caruso -	Kyle Kuzma
Brandon Ingram? Not sure if that counts because he wasn't an all star yet.
"Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball died for one Laker ring...the years after LeBron will be very rough."
"Imo he‚Äôs a good coach still, terrible front office guy though.   I think New Orleans has a lot of stuff that will come out eventually regarding bullshit behind the scenes. Firing a guy after one season, after they kept Alvin on for no reason for one year, Gayle Benson seem like she dying, Zion upset at them not winning despite him playing like less than half of all available games or so, Brandon Ingram still can‚Äôt defend the chairs they use in practice, let Lonzo walk for basically nothing.   I doubt anyone gonna make New Orleans look good over the next year or two."
Can someone tell me why Brandon Ingram hasn't reached his ceiling? Wasn't he projected to be like KD lite
Jamal murray or brandon ingram
"A lot of young guys are not max guys, but still get max deals. For instance, I don't think Brandon Ingram or Ben Simmons are max guys, but at the end of the day, the Suns need Ayton."
"Kevin Love, Brandon Ingram, Isaacs, Gary Harris, Donte DiVincenzo"
"For those saying wiggins is a good contract, let's look at the contracts within 3 million of wiggins aav.   KAT  Klove   Brandon Ingram  Jamal murray  Cp3  Gordon Hayward  Wiggins  Embiid  Jokic  Dlo  Julius Randle  Kyle lowry  Demar derozan  Al horford  Jaylen brown  Of these players I think there's only kevin love and al horford that wiggins is definitely better than"
For every Jahlil Okafor there's a Brandon Ingram so I'm with you. I usually try to avoid judging players before they're out of their rookie contracts.
"As a Lakers Fan I disagree. They weren't going to build around him. They were in rebuild mode with tons of high draft lotteries. There were tons of young talents but no direction and terrible coaching. They had Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Julius, Kuzma etc. Nobody was able to pick up the torch and stand out consistently.    They were switching up the chemistry by switching him as a starter or coming off the bench over multiple seasons. Nobody is going to develop correctly like that. I'm glad he was able to go to another team. He was able to mature his game properly."
Brandon Ingram has struggled with it too.
"&gt;So if we don‚Äôt want players leaving teams by asking for trades   For me, I much prefer the extension and then trade option. A lot of fans get to complain about the likes of AD and PG leaving NOLA and indy, while they tune in to watch Brandon Ingram and Domantas Sabonis with stunning cognitive dissonance. If the Blazers got some pieces back for Aldridge we might have had a deeper team right now.   I actually think the system is fine how it is, but there needs to be a streamlined way to get these trades done. Maybe a time limit whereby GMs must strike a deal or it goes to league office for arbitration or something."
Nope.  Take Brandon Ingram Lonzo and a draft pick. Not extend Derozan and Lamarcus and do this middling mess for 2 years
"what pride has to do with it. going out there and try to do the best and win is simply the coach's job, whether you team is bad or a contender. we won't be very good this season, as you said, but pop literally doing his job and not tank, so intentionally lose, has nothing to do with pride.   also add the other comment over pop and our fo laughing at us for taking that offer because it was a ""win-now"" move when the offers on the table weren't much better and we do not even know what was behind. kawhi tanked his value like crazy and nobody offered much. we got a solid package considering the situation. you would come out with that brandon ingram and first package aren't you. yeah, it might have been better, maybe not. we got ourself jakob poeltl that is a top 3/5 defensive big man, we got gold medalist keldon johnson (pick given by the raptors, maybe the lakers one would have been the 30th instead of the 29th and maybe we couldn't have picked keldon) and he showed ton of potential, and we turned derozan into thaddeus young and 1 1st and 1 2nd and thad can maybe be traded for another 1st. might not be the best ,but it's definitely fine and not intended as ""win-now"" mode."
"Look at the past succesful 2nd picks  Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, D'lo Russell, Oladipo. Hell even look at Liangelo Ball who was chosen right after Wiseman and is showing much more potential. All of these players got the ball in there hands and solid minutes, much higher than 20.   Wiseman situtation is far from 100% ideal lol."
A is like Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle. Let me roll the dice with B.
I'd say Brandon Ingram is every bit as good if not better than Lavine. Both are overrated though
I feel like 538 systematically overrates teams with Brandon Ingram.   I'd short their Pelicans prediction.
"But you are dealing with extreme body types. It isn‚Äôt just size.   Look at Brandon Ingram, dudes been on a weight gain program since he entered the league.  Do you think he just has trouble eating?"
"&gt;generally  You shouldn‚Äôt use generalizations of the standard population for major extreme outliers like Zion.   Look at Brandon Ingram, that dude was eating 8K calories a day and he has major issues putting on size. And that‚Äôs with NBA strength coaches and dieticians.   I agree that Zion likely did over indulge in eating, but it‚Äôs not nearly as simple as calories in calories out in his case."
Dang guess Brandon Ingram doesn‚Äôt exist
AD (just definitley the best player of those 3 healthy)  Jokic (healthiest and best)  Brandon ingram (we get to see him with competent spacing around him this year)  Keldon johnson (best player rn)  Westbrook (i think lowry is getting too old)
"It's kind of weird, since I wouldn't really consider any of those 4 to be at the same level or good comparisons between each other.  I think with Luka Jayson Tatum would be better example of being a young player in the similar level.  With Trae it would be someone like Bam Adebayo, although it's very possible if not even likely that Trae will take the jump this year to a higher level if he can limit his defensive liabilities a bit. (or his team uses him in different kind of defensive role). In his current state it was kind of difficult to find other players of similar position and size to him. I'd say he's somewhere comfortably higher than Kemba, but at least based on last year a step or two behind Holiday. Good comparison of his ideal future would be someone like Lillard who is also relatively (although not quite as) short point guard who's negative on defense but major positive on offense which is basically Trae's profile right now.  For Ja Morant maybe someone like Brandon Ingram could be more fitting comparison of someone that provides similar value overall.  Then for Herro I think Kuzma example already given in this thread was great. Also names that float around him that  I'd bring up are Markelle Fultz or Svi Mykhailuk."
"I was in grizzly game threads last year and Memphis fans were saying that themselves. Obviously Ja is the better player, but at times he wasn‚Äôt playing like it, and JV was.   I guess I made it seem like I was saying JV was the better was the better player last year, which isn‚Äôt true.  There are times Brandon Ingram was the best player on the court for us, but that doesn‚Äôt make him our best player."
"Wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I‚Äôve met NBA players but, I worked at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee before they tore it down around 2016-2017, and where I had to clock in was right next to the Bucks locker room where all the bucks players and away players would pass. I walked right pass Russ, Jimmy Butler , D Rose, Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Brandon Ingram and much more. I saw Giannis and waved to him everyday lol (dude is fucking huge!). It‚Äôs so weird seeing them that close in person. My cousin was also the security guard for the locker room so he stood right outside. He was my ride to and from work so I had to wait for him to be done to go home, and he had to wait until all the players left the arena. The cooks in the arena would make food for the away team, and at the end of the night I got the left overs shit was great. Best job I ever had!"
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a hot take. I would probably take the pels 2-8 guys over the guys Luka is playing with. Has he ever had a teammate as good as Brandon Ingram when they were playing together? Yet everyone thinks Dallas is a dark horse if Mr Big Collars doesn‚Äôt fuck it up. If Zion is that dude your guys should be in the play-in
Brandon Ingram idc
Brandon Ingram is a ny hipster
Brandon Ingram had a higher ceiling than Ben Simmons
"KOC was wrong about Killian Hayes, but he was right about Brandon Ingram being better than Ben Simmons."
"No disrespect here. I've seen a lot of blacks wear Metal and Hard Rock t-shirts. And at times, its vice-versa! White ppl. also wear a lot of hip-hop shirts like Tupac, B.I.G., Snoop, Eminem, etc....  But hey, the difference between other races from most black ppl. (I'm not saying all, don't misinterpret what I'm saying) is that they're flavor is only rap. While Whites, Asians, Latinos, a few middle easterns, do dig all types of music.  For Example: If I ask blacks here if you know Tosin Abasi, I would guarantee you most, if not, NONE will ever tell me who the fuck is Tosin Abasi from Animals as Leaders. Maybe a few would answer though.  BTW, I've seen a lot of regular old folk wear Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" t-shirt. Typically, they answer why they took it, its b/c of the artwork. But like Brandon Ingram, they don't know the music."
Is Brandon Ingram a basic bitch?
"Misread this as Brandon Ingram wears different ""Hard Rock Cafe"" T shirts from each city which is something I did during the 90s"
"It's likely way more common than I realize but once a kid makes it to the upper crust of college, work ethic/effort needs to be considered more than it has been (or appears to have been). Simmons is an easy recent example, but Jamarcus Russell is one too. With Lonzo and Brandon Ingram maybe being counter examples. The hype around natural athletes and splashy plays makes sense but at that level you're not getting many non-athletes and the risk that the college star will coast and/or plateau seems higher to me than banking on someone who has shown they'll work at improving and growing. Don't want to shit on Zion, but it does seem like the gifted dude who has been a star his while childhood may not have the healthiest, smoothest transition to the pros and reach the level expected.  Maybe I just watched *Hoop Dreams* again and got disillusioned."
"The Pelicans do not have a shooting coach. Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, and Jonas Valunciunas all had their shot naturally improve as a result of the humid weather and spicy food here in New Orleans. Please stop referring to and inquiring about some guy named Fred (who I can assure you I've never heard of)"
"Brandon Ingram with a quiet 27 under JV. When he‚Äôs the second option, he plays really well."
Brandon Ingram will always be my fav baby laker. I hope Zion can stay healthy so Pelicans can make a legit playoff push
"Jaxson Hayes yelled, ‚ÄúThere he goes!‚Äù Jonas Valanciunas gave a look of horrified surprise. Brandon Ingram belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking unit now.‚Äù And before Zion Williamson got stuck trying to enter the locker room door, ex-NBA player, now coach, Willie Green hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so fat.‚Äù"
Could you imagine if someone had a team of players like:  Lonzo Ball  D'Angelo Russell  Brandon Ingram  Julius Randle  Kyle Kuzma  ?
"Fun fact: The lakers drafted Julius Randle, Jordan Clark, Lonzo Ball, D‚ÄôAngelo Russel, and Brandon Ingram. All of them got better the second they left the lakers so Bridges is a lucky man. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs saying thank you Jim Buss for saving his career."
The lakers Brandon Ingram plats are the best by far
"Not really. Steph is the goat and he‚Äôs at 64%. People have a warped perception of how much people shot unassisted threes. Guys like Dame are the exception and even he‚Äôs at around half of his threes being assisted.  Like I said earlier, Klay is always well above 90%. So Lonzo is shooting a Klay-like percentage and volume from 3 but doing it with less assisted 3s.  Other plays for reference:  Brandon Ingram has 92% of his 3s assisted.  Duncan Robinson has 97% assisted   Of the 6 players ahead of Lonzo in 3 point makes this year, only 2 of them (McCollum and Steph) take a higher percentage of unassisted threes. The other 4 are significantly higher"
"I just think it makes more sense to be mad at the sports media, or the Lakers themselves for spending so much money, leveraging their position in LA to attract players. As far as I can tell, Laker fans are pretty well behaved on this board.   Lakers fans are actually pretty laid back compared to other fan bases. And Caruso actually being good should give us some vindication that we‚Äôre not just making stuff up.   In the last decade, we signed Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng to massive deals, were horrible for a long time, then traded away our entire future for one bubble ring. And now we‚Äôll need to rebuild. We‚Äôre stuck with Westbrook next year too, and he‚Äôs owed 50 million. Our roster could be Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Zubac, with Alex Caruso coming off the bench. Instead we have the retirement home.  It‚Äôs been a tough run for the Lakers too."
"I mean, they can swap him just to balance the roster out, but in my vision, you have to trade Nurk too  like CJ for Christian Wood or Brandon Ingram type deal and then Nurk to a big deprived team like Toronto, Sacramento, Dallas, San Antonio, Nets to fill in the gaps"

"Trae Young's impact would not go down due to the new officiating roles.  Brandon Ingram won't be a winning player without Zion.   Evan Mobley will be the best looking rookie (defense gives him the edge over Barnes)  Golden State will look like a championship team.  Now, ask for my pre-season thoughts on Kevin Porter Jr. and Jalen Suggs if you want some wrong thoughts."
I am also reporting that the Pelicans are unwilling to part with Brandon Ingram or Zion in any Fox or Simmons deal
Brandon Ingram needs to give it a try

Crazy to think he‚Äôs older than Brandon Ingram
I think this describes multiple young players right now lol   Brandon Ingram for example. Dude wants to get his stats and be the star and doesn‚Äôt give a damn about team record
"You know why this trade is on everyone's mind? Cause there's like one dude with a dozen alts posting it in every discussion remotely linked to the Sixers.    Sicxers somehow win? Brandon Ingram should be traded to the Sixers!   Lowe talking about Sacramento's troubles, in the replies ""TRADE FOR BI, MOREY!!""     Historical musings on the Libery Bell? HOW ABOUT THREE TEAM SWAP OF BI/FOX/SIMMONS?"
"Just pathetic. And to think the Lakers once had Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart - all of whom are decent to good players. All traded away."
People said Brandon Ingram was trash because he was trash when he played for the Lakers. I promise you that Lakers fans did not predict  that he'd show probably the greatest shooting improvement in the history of the league.
"Based on his play: His utilization of his length on defense (defensive potential), the craftiness with which he finishes going to the rim (finishing ability), his footwork plus the arsenal of moves he possesses as a 21yo (offensive skillset), his aggression and the confidence he plays with (overall mentality), and his court vision (though he doesn't make a lot of passes at the moment. That's what those of us who actually watch him play (instead of following his lowlights through reddit) see. He has the tools, but like with any young play, consistency in scoring will come with time, training, and experience. We saw a lot of the same stuff with Brandon Ingram, who was trash according to people like you."
I am 4th in both. LOL(I was 1st and 2nd in my league before Brandon Ingram got hurt who was carrying me in both of my fantasy leagues)
Okoro has good defense and is quick on offense but has no jump shot and not great handles. At this point I want to see him work on a midrange shot because I don't think his three will ever be there. He's way too young to give up on though unless it's trading for a good player.  Brandon Ingram would be perfect for this team. Good shooter and passer and fits a position of need.
Okoro is ass.  Brandon Ingram would make this team instant top 4 seed I think
"What were the suspensions for this? I genuinely can't remember. But maybe it's just me, but I think the fights like this one where punches are actually thrown deserve like extreme severe consequences. Fighting is like super dangerous. I had a friend get into a scrap with another random dude one time and he hit the guy the wrong way and dude got brain damage and was in the hospital for a really long time and my friend did prison time. Saying Brandon Ingram rush in for a haymaker is just really dark and disturbing to me after seeing that"
My god this sub is insufferable today. Brandon Ingram got 4 games for running across the court and throwing a punch at CP3. Lebron was never going to 2.5x the punishment of that for what he did.
The funniest one was Brandon Ingram flying in with the go-go gadget haymaker during the Rondo-CP3 fight. He looks like he's asleep half the time and a fight breaks out and suddenly he's trying to knock CP3 out lmfao
When is the last time anyone has broken free so they can actually swing at someone? Brandon Ingram against the Rockets?
"At least when this era is over it will be fairly easy to photoshop Laker jerseys onto future free agents like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and Alex Caruso."

valanciunas better than brandon ingram? bold take
Brandon Ingram?
"I think it's pretty much already reversed. Oladipo made an all star game, as has D'Angelo Russell, and Brandon Ingram. Lonzo Ball is clearly not a bust, and if he keeps improving the way he has, all star games aren't out of the question. Bagley has been shit, but hes been the first truly bad, already out of the rotation player in a few years. Morant looks great, Wiseman hasn't played nearly enough to be judged, and even Jalen Green has shown flashes of great potential.    This is assuming the curse was due to the shit run after KD (Beasley, Thabeet, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, etc)."
I would love  to see John Stockton play his game in modern times as a juiced up  trae young who plays far better defense.   James worthy is another name.   Wondered what  Kobe of been like if he didn't have shaq from 96 to2004. What would his numbers be.   So far for future tense is Brandon ingram. He was killing it and the pelicans were closer to the playoffs before zion started playing again.
Yeah Brandon Ingram was on some insane diet while on the lakers dude was eating 6 plus meals a day
"Fox is in a weird spot value wise. He's not gonna command a superstar in return because he's not at that level, but at the same time there aren't many teams IMO that wpld view him as the missing piece would give up prospects/potential for him.  Brandon Ingram and Jalen Brown would make sense from a positional perspective for both squads."
"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
I personally really appreciate them taking Lonzo Ball &amp; Brandon Ingram over Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown

"Given that the 76ers needs a PG role and that they already have bigs drafted thus, #1 Jamal Murray.  The Lakers at #2 is drafting for assets to attract free agents and selecting Brandon Ingram is a good pick.   At #3, the Celtics have scorers in the likes of Isaiah Thomas and I would take Domantas Sabonis."
Brandon Ingram?
Indeed he has been. However he's on the last year of his contract and I know the blazers need to make a swing move ala brandon ingram or something
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Brandon Ingram looked so bad when he was younger. Thank god he picked it up, I loved him in college."
Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart are crying rn
Brandon Ingram lmao
Chris Bosh (that season after LeBron left before the blood clots)  Brandon Ingram   Kuzma (so far)  Danny Green (post first Cavs stint)   Kyrie Irving before he absolutely meltdown after his injury that first season   Schroder so far is looking as if he‚Äôll have a career year   Korver   I‚Äôm not tryna give an entire list but these are prominent examples of players who were ‚Äútrash‚Äù and slandered a lot for being no help
Brandon Boston got that sheepish look like Brandon Ingram
"Buddy Hield , Russel Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle. And that's just on the Lakers. LeGM is LeBrons worst enemy."

Lol you acting like they were gonna win the chip with AD that they got robbed of. Ok let‚Äôs say AD stays and leaves in FA? How they feeling now with no Brandon Ingram? AD had all rights to request a trade off that garbage ass team and use his leverage to not go to another bad team. Like why would he try to help the Pelicans? It‚Äôs a business.
They had Brandon Ingram back for the first time. Recognize the nuance in the world.
"After watching Lonzo, Brandon, Josh and Alex today and in previous games this season here is my ranking of the 2017-2019 Lakers ""core""  Brandon Ingram  Kyle Kuzma = Lonzo Ball  Alex Caruso = Josh Hart"
I think dude is asking which player impacts their team the most instead of just the worst team. The largest dropoff.  &gt;obviously the Pelicans would still be horrible if you took away Brandon Ingram
"I don't think this thread is necessarily typical. Mobley and the Cavs are generally well-liked at the moment, but look at any similar thread about a Laker, James Harden, Kristaps Porzingus, etc and you'll see a whole different thread.  In years past I saw some of the worst, most reactionary takes ever in similar posts about rookie Trae Young/Brandon Ingram/Lonzo Ball/Jaylen Brown. I'm sure Hawks and Celtics fans haven't forgotten those. I think these posts usually feed into the worst parts of this sub's collective psyche and drag down the level of discourse."
Brandon Ingram should give his FGA‚Äôs to JV. Let the Lightning loose!! 20/20 on the season lets go
Brandon Ingram shot 19 2s and missed 12 of them
"Only Brandon ingram imo, to be a 2nd option on a championship team you have able to shoot efficiently, fox is a garbage shooter and is bad off ball,  32% from 3 and 71%FT is not close to be a 2nd option, sabonis and harris arent good enough shooters and cj mccolum is closer to louis williams than middleton, cj is not even close to be a 2nd option"
"That was last year, and that doesn't make these easy teams the Suns played during this streak any harder.   And at least 3 of the games in this streak other teams had missing players.  No John Wall in both Houston wins, no Zion or Brandon Ingram for New Orleans, no Halliburton in Sacramento, etc.  So that evened out some of the games a bit."
"Yall make fun of Brandon Ingram for being too skinny, and Zion for being too fat. What do you people want? Not everybody can look like Corey Maggette, we need to embrace all body types and abandon our toxic body standards. A player‚Äôs size has no correlation with his abilities on the court. Kevin Durant and Jokic are incredibly brave for defying the dogmatic expectations of what perfect health looks like."
Brandon Ingram as well. People always comp him to KD but his shots out the midrange are more like Kawhi/Kobe
"You mean like how they flipped on:  ""Nance is a bum that can only dunk"" to ""Nance is a quality, versatile role player for the Cavs""  ""Clarkson is a chucker that can never meaningful contribute""(this continued with Lebron) to ""Clarkson is such a great 6th man, just a flamethrower""  ""Brandon Ingram is such a bust and one pick before Jaylen Brown. He's a stick, can't finish through contact, can't shoot, Travis Outlaw"" to ""Ingram is turning the corner and living up to that Durant lite comparison""  ""Lonzo Ball is GARBAGE. I can't believe Lavar got the Lakers to believe he was worth the 2nd round pick"" *proceeds to post literally every negative statline and bad highlight from his rookie season"" to ""Lonzo's defense is amazing and he transformed his shot, amazing""  This list can go on and on. Zubac was maybe one of the few that didn't get shit while on the Lakers."
Go for Brandon Ingram
"Well yea theyre 100% not busts right now, how are you a bust 6 and 12 games into your career as a teenager?  Do you know what a bust is, or what player growth and development looks like? This shit ain‚Äôt 2k.   It took Brandon Ingram 4 years to look like the #2 pick, for example."
"*Protagonist Brandon Ingram after his triumphant return just in the nick of time to save NOLAs season*  #""Nice holding out, senpais. Our counter attack begins."""
"And just like that, when Brandon Ingram returns, they win. Crazy concept. What do we think will happen when Zion returns?"
What happen to Brandon Ingram? Wasn't he turning into a super star?
Brandon Ingram having a really underapperciated year.
"Brandon Ingram was MIP a 2nd overall pick, Oladipo as well  Nope"
"I don‚Äôt think you thought this through. Who to trade for? What star is available?   No, Ben Simmons is not a superstar. Dame or Beal would be the dream but they don‚Äôt want out.  Neither is KAT nor does Minny want to move on from him yet.   Another thing is salary matching, Wiggins is the only contract that they use as salary match so the guy netting in return has to be of that value.  Also fit, does that guy they trade for even fit with what they try to do?   Let‚Äôs say Brandon Ingram, ok he‚Äôs a better scorer and passer than Wiggins but they actually need Wiggins better defense and actually reliable availability over Ingram who‚Äôs a poor defender and often miss games due to injuries.  Even the lesser guys like Myles Turner and Christian Wood as names get thrown around don‚Äôt make sense.. because salary matching, and value in return doesn‚Äôt move the needle to be a significantly better team. Wood can‚Äôt defend a PnR, Myles is inconsistent and a weak rebounder. Wiggins are far more important than Myles Turner plus Jeremy lamb in return"
"We haven't had a (non-traded) FRP since 2018, but the last three that actually played for us were:  * Mo Wagner: 43 games, 446 minutes played  * Lonzo Ball: 52 games, 1780 minutes played  * Brandon Ingram: 79 games, 2279 minutes played  Granted, two of these guys were Top-3 picks, but we still played Wagner more than everyone but Vassell."
"Yea there was the same discussions with Lakers fans about Luke Walton having Brandon Ingram play point. Russell WestBrook became the player he is today from playing so much point too, he was a 2 on ucla."

They did that alot for Brandon Ingram his rookie and sophomore year
"It really hasn't been a slippery slope. Most of the issue is due to unprofessional management.   When Anthony Davis let it be known he wasn't going to re-sign in free agency and requested a trade, the Pelicans should've been grateful AD did them the kindness of letting them know with plenty of time left on his contract so they could work out a deal where both parties came out ahead. Instead Dell Demps decided to throw a tantrum and ultimately got fired because of it.   Kawhi let the spurs know and Pop threw a tantrum too. They ultimately got a couple of years of Derozan Instead of Brandon Ingram long term because of Pop's lack of professionalism.   The Rockets let James Harden's teammate walk in free agency or traded them away, they let his coach go, his GM go, and were surprised when James Harden didn't want to have a 50% usage rate as a 32 year old. You can't drain all the life out of a player and complain he's playing lifelessly.   I would argue Simmons is the only guy here that's behaving unprofessionally. Simmons isn't fully at fault here either. Why did Doc have to air our dirty laundry by saying he wasn't sure if Simmons was a championship caliber PG? You're not under oath, a-hole. Just fucking lie. ""Ben Simmons is the greatest PG to have ever walk the earth."" How hard is that? Tell him to fix face he's gotta switch positions, but don't do that shit in public. And why didn't Morey trade him? Dude's been in every possible trade rumor since Morey took over. At some point you gotta just deal the guy. This is what happens when it's both parties that behave unprofessionally. Usually, it's only the front offices, so it typically doesn't get this messy."
"If we re-draft 2016, where does Ben even get picked?  Hypothetical lottery re-draft:  1. Jaylen Brown 2. Jamal Murray 3. Brandon Ingram 4. Domantas Sabonis 5. Pascal Siakam  IMO these guys all get picked before Ben. Would you guys take Simmons over someone less talented but with fewer glaring weaknesses, like Brogdon or Levert? In a playoff series it's something to consider."
BREAKING: a team missing Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram is not competitive
Why would he go to New York. They i‚Äôm not going to be contenders in the east even with Zion. In New Orleans he can make more money and he gets to play next to another All Star Brandon Ingram. Also we have Valanciunas who has been balling out all season. Problem with the Pelicans this season is everyone is goddamn hurt. If you were 100% healthy you would have a better record.
"Thank god Griffin is going.  &gt;*Maybe he'll trade Brandon Ingram for elite floor-raiser Ben Simmons to try save his job.*  get off the crack, sir."
*****‚ÄùWe‚Äôve cloned Brandon Ingram three times. Does that sound like something you‚Äôd be interested in?‚Äù*****
Brandon Ingram just won it as a #2 overall pick in his first all-star campaign.
"I think last year's roster was loaded but it just didn't work. I mean lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Zion, and Steven Adams. That's a pretty good fuckin starting lineup. When do we start to look at coaching and offensive schemes? That team did not play up to what they could have"
"I don‚Äôt think third year players should get MIP. Ja was drafted #2 overall, this is natural progression   I think the limit should be fourth year players &amp; up. Guys like Brandon Ingram etc"
"Have you seen how well D‚ÄôLo, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball have been playing since they left LA? The Lakers are a farm team too!"
Or Trae Young or Brandon Ingram
"Brandon Ingram was dubbed ""the worst player in the NBA"" his sophomore season, so I'm not too worried about these guys barely 10 games into their rookie season"
Brandon Ingram.
Either him or Brandon Ingram
"I think this has been my feeling said in as few words as possible. Everything about Ja screams that he wants to be *that guy*, the face of the franchise. He‚Äôs willing to build something organically over time and be the first option to take the team as far as possible. I honestly don‚Äôt think Zion wants to be *that guy* nearly as bad down here, maybe he would if New York drafted him but can‚Äôt be sure.   Even small things such as Brandon Ingram going to meet Willie Green in Phoenix during the playoffs, but Zion being nowhere to be seen, have really started to bother me personally. I just see a kid who can hoop, rather than a guy who wants to be *that* guy for this city"
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valanƒçi≈´nas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"Brandon Ingram. His fat co-star doesn't even play in games because he shows up to training camp fat and then injures himself because he's too fat. Also even if Zion comes back, he is going to force his way out soon. Free Ingram man"
"Yup you‚Äôre absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
"Teammate Brandon Ingram dropped an efficient 49 on the Jazz, Booker dropped an efficient 70 on the Celtics and countless other young players have dropped more efficient scoring games and came up with a W, yet you‚Äôre not calling them generational scorers. Are you seriously going to sit there and act like Zion‚Äôs 35 on the Lakers is the greatest scoring game by a 19 year old of all time? Sounds rather stupid to me"
That one dude that compared Travis Outlaw and Brandon Ingram. It got like 200+ upvotes and shows this sub doesn‚Äôt watch players play. Their games are nothing alike
Brandon ingram is travis outlaw 2.0
Brandon Ingram also showed that he is not a winning player
Brandon Ingram shows that hard work pays off.
"Pelican received Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the draft rights to De'andre Hunter and 3 unprotected first round picks. That's a decent haul considering AD refused to play and let it be known that he only wanted to go to the Lakers."
"Brandon Ingram is an all nba caliber player. He‚Äôs not AD, but that‚Äôs not ‚Äúbasically nothing‚Äù"

Take a run of the mill low end all star level guy like Dipo, Middleton, Brandon Ingram, etc. They  can all do their thing nearly anywhere. Simmons needs specific things out of the roster around him because he doesn't contribute in as standard of a way. He's a super high end Draymond where he's not gonna shoot because he knows he can better impact the game doing other things that'll definitely help you win, but someone still has to take shots."
Willy Cauley Stein and Kevin Durant had a child and that child's name is Brandon Ingram
My bois really doing great tonight  Brandon Ingram is unstoppable  Josh Hart is now a legit 3 and D guy  Lonzo
God I love Brandon Ingram so much.
"The Spurs weren't planning on rebuilding even if that might have been the best way forward for them. So no, they didn't value Brandon Ingram as the best asset."
"Brandon Ingram is only 23, gonna be more than just an all-star caliber player"
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"Because Brandon Ingram was objectively a significantly better asset than DeRozan. The Spurs preferred DeRozan because he was better in the short term, which is not how you should make trades when you are rebuilding, which is what you are as a franchise when you are trading the lone star on your team."
"Ok, I'd say a year ago if Jokic didn't want to stay in Denver with a year and change left in his contract, Lonzo, Hart, Brandon Ingram and 3 picks including #4 in an average draft class would be enough to do it.  Obviously Jokic has immensely raised his game this year and is younger, but we're underrating AD a little. I do agree Jokic should be in that top tier though due to age, but just saying that's the god tier package and I don't think Jokic would get more"
"Paul Millsap, Brandon Ingram, and Drew Eubanks"
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"Is it time for the weekly r/nba ""let's overreact about a young player"" post? Yeah RJ has been bad but he's played half a season so far, with pretty bad spacing for the most part. Let's let him develop, brandon ingram had pretty atrocious early numbers and now he's looking like an all-star."
For a second I thought it was a Brandon Ingram thing and has to check his jersey number.
"See: _the entire 2016 draft class_  Nearly every single prospect from that class was looking like boiled ass their rookie years. Like, they were all _horrendous_.  From the lottery, not a single one of Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, or Domantas Sabonis managed to break past averaging 10 ppg their rookie years, without much positives to show besides maybe the very occasional ""oh look at this huge game/huge play he just had! See, he has potential!"" game."
"&gt;Both trades got back an all star or perennial star player (Brandon Ingram and Alex Verdugo probably would've made 2020 ASG if it was played)  &gt;or perennial star player  &gt;Alex Verdugo  You know, I was with you in this post for way longer than I thought. But that's where you lost me."
"&gt; Couldn't take his team to the playoffs even with rondo and all star Ingram   This alone is evidence that you have no idea what you're talking about. Brandon Ingram was only an All-Star last season after probably the greatest shooting improvement the league has ever seen. Before last season he was a below average shooter on from three, most of the mid-range, and the line for years.   The rest of this shit is not even worth replying to since you revealed your own ignorance with your first idiotic point."
"&gt; because of their trades, they automatically win   Not in the Lakers' case.  They win one every four years historically, so the mere fact that that won another does not necessarily mean they won a trade.  And even for the other franchises, you have to consider that they may have won more rings either without the trade, or with a better one.  For example, in the unlikely event that Brandon Ingram leads the Pelicans to 3 titles, and the Lakers win nothing else for the next decade, are you going to try and claim that New Orleans didn't win that deal?  Of course not."
Brandon Ingram.
"I think this is very true. It‚Äôs like when Rondo said he had to stay on Bron to change his body language his first year in LA because when the young guys made mistakes and Bron got down on them they would be hurt and it would effect their play, because they didn‚Äôt want to let him down.   ‚ÄúWhen guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it‚Äôs hard to bite your tongue but I tried to get [James] to focus on his body language‚Ä¶Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn‚Äôt want to let him down. But if LeBron said one thing positive to Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma, they immediately were back to their old selves.‚Äù"
"In other news, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball are not suiting up for the Lakers tonight."
Who‚Äôs leaving though? They‚Äôre locked in for 2 yrs minimum and the nets are the heavy favorite to go to the finals this yr and next tbh so I doubt harden will want to leave once his deal is up after 2022. Rockets have hope in like 25 and beyond maybe but they didn‚Äôt get one franchise asset here. Tillman sabotaged them out or the best possible return. They didn‚Äôt even get a Brandon Ingram here under team control lol
"&gt; Shai is a better playmaker than PG.  Of course he is, but PG is also a wayyyyy better shooter and defender than Shai is. Also, Kawhi wants to win *now*, he doesn't give a shit about a younger player developing and doesn't have the patience to wait around for that, none of these superstars do. Brandon Ingram is a much better playmaker and he's a better #1 option and offensive player than Anthony Davis, that doesn't mean that LeBron wanted to wait around for him to develop.   &gt; George is better, much better, than both, but he's not such a good player he's better than both combined lol.  He is and he isn't, because he's such an inconsistent player. Peak PG is absolutely good enough that he's better than both, however he does have low lows where he's not. He's such a confounding and frustrating player for that reason.   &gt; What Clippers are missing right now is a playmaker  Yes, that's true, but it's not like you can't get that player whilst already having Kawhi + PG. The Clippers failed to adequately surround Kawhi + PG with the necessary pieces in order to win, namely at point guard and at center. They fixed their hole at center with Ibaka, however they didn't fill their point guard hole, although Batum has helped them significantly in that regard so far as an Iguodala-ish playmaking wing.  &gt; past accolades  PG just had his peak year right before the Clippers traded for him..."
On what planet is Keldon Johnson equal to Brandon Ingram?
"Pelicans simply have to be up there.   Brandon Ingram is ridiculously underrated. He‚Äôs 23 averaging an efficient 24/7/6. And he‚Äôs creating his own shots, not just catching lobs or shooting open corner 3s. He‚Äôs the real deal.   If Zion becomes even a mid tier all star player, which would by *no means* would be a shocker, the Pelicans will be quite good."
Would Ben Simmons still be picked first out of Jaylen Brown &amp; Brandon Ingram in that draft today?
"im an amazing turn of events, The lakers have acquired brandon Ingram mid season"
"Reason Jamal Murray is that low is because I don't think that the Nuggets are willing to deal him while he appears to be in his prime.    I don't think the Celtics will deal Jalen Brown either when that team clearly has some amazing synergy.  Brandon Ingram and Ben Simmons aren't fixed in those spots, but given both seem to be stranded on a strong team mid-slots seemed appropriate.  Herro and Pascal could be the Toronto style swap needed."
Trade bait rankings for Harden best to worst (not offered):  * Tyler Herro * Pascal Siakim * Brandon Ingram * Ben Simmons * Jalen Brown * Jamal Murray
Brandon Ingram  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Tyler Herro
"Jaylen Brown above Brandon Ingram, Bam, Booker, Simmons lmfao"
And Danny Green will leave the Sixers to team up with Brandon Ingram on the Pistons in due time
"Brandon Ingram went public recently about how the constant media attention during LBJ's first year was a detriment to the team and to his teammates  Eddie House has accused him of politicking, Mario Chalmers couldn't stand him (and vice versa), Mo Williams who was one of his closest friends in his first Cavs stint confessed they're not tight anymore. And going back to your post, those are just the ones who went *public*.  Now obviously neither you nor me know what happens behind doors, but it's safe to say that this type of environment isn't enjoyable for players, particularly when you're not winning and you might be the next one shipped off by Bron/Klutch.   Winning solves everything, but it can turn ugly when they don't win. Imagine if the Lakers gave up all those assets and went out in the 2nd round of the bubble?"
Holy fuck the disrespect to Middleton. Jaylen is not better than Middleton in anyway currently. Brandon Ingram is good but he is also benefitting frrom being the first option.
"Brandon Ingram would be an improved defender if he was on the Celtics with multiple other playmakers, defenders and wasn't the first option either. I don't see why people don't take team into account, Brown is more efficient because of his team. Can you imagine Ingram playing next to Tatum under Brad Stevens?  IMO Ingram is simply the more skilled/talented player with more tools and can do more with the ball in his hands."
"When he said this, Brandon Ingram was averaging 16 PPG and Juan Hernangomez was averaging 3.3 PPG. And being wrong wasn't the worst part. When called out on it by LFR, his response was ""If you ever wanna work in media, you'll have to be more professional."" LFR now works for the Lakers. Nate Duncan is still routinely saying idiotic things."
Nate Duncan said similar things. But Nate Duncan is an idiot who also said the following:  &gt;Juan Hernangomez is a better prospect than Brandon Ingram.  -2018
Stats like this bring me back to a time when Brandon Ingram was literally the worst player in the NBA
Brandon Ingram 2020  Julius Randle 2021   Lonzo Ball 2022   It‚Äôs been written.

"You can't really define it, but I think genetics define your floor and your ceiling, and your work ethic determines where in that range you fall. Shaq's floor was higher than a lot of people because of his height and athleticism, but at some points in his career you could argue that he did not meet his ceiling because of his work ethic.  Brandon Ingram is another example of the genetics being there but the work ethic really driving him into success.  Nate Robinson might be another good example of a player whose genetics defined his floor being very low but a pretty alright ceiling, and then his work ethic making him fall high enough in his range to be a viable NBA player for a while."
"While I'm at it, here's who I think for the West:  * Nikola Jokic * Paul George * CJ McCollum * LeBron James * Brandon Ingram * Mikal Bridges * Anthony Davis * DeMar DeRozan * James Harden * Luka Doncic * Steph Curry * Kawhi Leonard"
"That‚Äôs stupid. Brandon Ingram was suspended for coming off the bench when he was a laker. The answer is: No, because he came to help break up the fight and de-escalate"
"Gotta give the Lakers a pass on that one in hindsight.    If we drafted Tatum over Lonzo, we likely would've drafted the best PG available instead of Kuzma in the second round since we no longer had DLo Russ. The front office chose the Lakers greatest need (they had no PG) over potentially best available.    And while we now know for sure Tatum alone is better than any other combination of choices the Lakers made in that draft, it still worked out perfectly for them because...   A} Tatum would've been traded to the Pelicans along with Brandon Ingram for AD, which would've made New Orleans a threat in the Western Conference for years if they still drafted Zion, and...   B} In the end, the Lakers won a championship anyway, which is what matters the most."
He‚Äôs been great at creating space for himself and has really nice handles   He‚Äôs like a stronger Brandon Ingram
Brandon ingram got ejected for a swipe to the head in an okc game earlier this season if im not mistaken. It was dumb bc he hit the ball before reaching the head.
"Me too.   I miss Brandon ""5mg of Melatonin"" Ingram."
Then we're gonna get a post about how Brandon Ingram dropped 50 on Rudy Gobert's head with the whole sub following the narrative until one person actually bothers to look and realizes Gobert held Ingram to 0-6 and a turnover when defending him
Brandon Xavier Ingram wants to bust everyone‚Äôs ass ifykyk
"Damn! Brandon ""Frank Castle"" Ingram"
"Brandon Ingram gone, Big Crip is in that slim-ass body now"
"**[Guillory] Brandon Ingram on what he needs to do to improve his game: ""Just bust everybody's ass. Kill everybody in front of me. Make sure that I don't let anybody off the hook.""**"
"This is an enormous overreaction. Edwards is 19 and has shown great flashes. We are all excited about this kid. James Harden did nothing in his first four seasons in the league and still became a star. Jimmy Butler was a terrible rookie. Bradley Beal had a very ho hum rookie year. Brandon Ingram looked truly awful his rookie season. Look, players take time and we are only a few games into the season. LaMelo just not so many games ago played awful and this sub was calling him a bust. Can we chill and let these kids grow up? Come back in 2-3 years on this. None of these players were expected to be generational talents. I am very confident in our selection of Edwards based on what I‚Äôve seen from him already. Great handle, good vision, very strong moves to the rack, good ability to create separation, hits big shots in the game. His efficiency isn‚Äôt there yet but he‚Äôs also being told in the second unit go ham, so he is volume scoring. Let‚Äôs relax."

God I am so attracted to Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram vs Donovan Mitchell last season
is Brandon Ingram the most effortless scorer in NBA history? ... i mean he's putting up 30 points in his sleep
Brandon Ingram. No bias tho /s
how did Brandon Ingram stagnate in his second season
Luke Walton is good at developing young players. Y‚Äôall can hate his in game decisions but he‚Äôs really good at developing.   He was the one who made Brandon Ingram into a PG to give him more playmaking and ball-handling responsibilities.
"Luka struggles against long lanky defenders but he's always gonna find his spots. I remember there was one game where Brandon Ingram just shut him down, he couldn't figure how to get past him."
"Players are all over social media, Brandon Ingram talked about it, looking themselves up"
"Equal *over the aggregate of the entire year. A next to pointless statement when discussing the current quality of players. Siakam is nowhere near Tatum's level, since about this time last year. He's not near Jaylen Brown or Brandon Ingram or Devin Booker's level.  Also just because their slash lines and similair doesn't mism their contributions necessarily are. I would recommend watching basketball occasionally."
" I think last week they covered a game and was like ""Steven Adams led the win with 9 points and 9 rebounds. Oh some dude named Brandon Ingram also got 26 points btw"" lol"
‚ÄúOk Mr. Brandon O‚ÄôConnor‚Äù  - this sub when Ingram was averaging 6.5 ppg on 39% FG in his first 10 games as a pro

It‚Äôs kinda crazy to go back and look at the first round ‚Äúbusts‚Äù the lakers picked Julius randle D‚Äôangelo Russell Brandon Ingram Lonzo ball Of the 4 three could be all stars and lonzo is solid af at worst.
"Which Ingram, Brandon or Andre?"
Probably not an ideal offensive scheme to be having Lonzo Ball take more shots than Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson but I‚Äôm not an NBA coach.
Lord Brandon Ingram is a beast
Imagine if the Warriors add a Kevin Durant-esque player in Brandon Ingram. They would probably have a chance to three-peat.
"Well call me delusional pal . Again, if talent is pretty even, the PG position is more influential than SF. Ie look at bubble Jamal Murray. Is Jamal Murray better than Brandon Ingram? Eh. Maybe , maybe not. But by way of the position he plays and the pressure he puts on the defense with the ball in his hands, that team went that far. They wouldn‚Äôt have with Brandon Ingram or any comparable wing.    If you replace Ja with Ingram on last year‚Äôs grizzly team they‚Äôre sniffing 20 wins."
Think Brandon Ingram will be clearly better then both by the end of this season
Brandon Ingram so he can be where he belongs.
Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown
What have kyries former teammates said about him? When have durants teammates talked poorly of him? Did you not hear Brandon Ingram talk about how lebrons clear tampering messed with the team. Kyrie is cool with tatum just like lebron is cool with love
"Yeah, it's hard to figure out. What would be the most fair 1:1 trade?  Jaylen Brown? Brandon Ingram?  Am I too low on Towns?"
"I'm saying when he made the decision, Houston was coming off a conference finals and had two great players. Philly had Embiid and Simmons. The Lakers had Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram."
"I can promise you Peyton Manning did not leave because he thought the Colts would be a train wreck. And in general my point still stands none of them forced their way to Big market teams.  This argument is hilarious. LeBron's soul goal was to win, he could have gone to Houston or Philly. Neither lonzo ball nor Brandon Ingram are good enough to get you to the playoffs in the West."
"Before the Raps even lost a game they were getting boo‚Äôd at ‚Äúhome‚Äù and since then there have been MVP chants for Brandon Ingram, chants for Tacko Fall, etc. I‚Äôm not asking for that to change but if the league goes to Toronto to ask questions about Tampa in preparation for a potential expansion, Toronto will have nothing but negative things to say. Players will say the fans were shit."
"Brandon Ingram is an all star and Lbron still couldn't make the playoffs with him this is a fact no matter how much you keep crying about it lol. Lakers were a .500 team with Lbron wouldn't call that above average, chief. Classic Stan with the Lbron had no help calling everyone on the team trash except him LMAO and Lbron hasn't won shit without Wade Bosh Kyrie Love Ray Allen. KD will always be the better player, even on ONE good leg he's still better than him. That's why he SWEPT him. Steph is the only help KD ever had only help he ever needed. He'd easily win with Wade Bosh Ray Kyrie Love."
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."
"Brandon Ingram is an all star who played 55 games and rondo is a good player Lakers were definitely an above average team, they could've made the playoffs but their supposed superstar failed them pretty bad in every way. My favorite part is when he activated playoff mode and went 3-12 losing to lottery teams lmao whatever you say, casual."

"Bruh, Embiid out there averaging 23/12 and balling on the best record team. Jokic is literally averaging a triple double as a center, and you think 13/8 CP3 and Brandon Ingram are winning the race?"
Brandon Ingram did absolutely nothing to help his team in anyway in this whole clip
"A ridiculous comeback win which we had no business winning. I loved the effort and determination of Oladipo and Turner down the stretch. Both had missed a couple easy opportunities in the last few minutes of the game, with Turner missing a layup and Oladipo missing a good look at 3 iirc. But they did not give up and kept playing their game and came up with those clutch plays in the last 25 seconds of the game. You have to question Van Gundy's coaching in overtime for the Pels; with both our bigs fouled out they didn't get it inside to Zion enough. But Pacers had all the momentum through the overtime period and Brogdon, who has sometimes been prone to late-game lapses in focus/judgment, was able to hit the winning bucket. For the Pels, Brandon Ingram is looking more and more like an elite player in this league every time I watch him play."

"The GOAT is whoever you want it to be.   Here: Brandon Ingram is the GOAT.     Nothing changed. The world is the same, and basketball is still basketball"
Idk but Brandon Ingram seemed like he‚Äôs fucking done on this game. He didn‚Äôt rush to JJ and Lonzo when they were struggling to dribble the ball and didn‚Äôt try to challenge that Turner trey.
They called Brandon Ingram just another Travis Outlaw
Refreshing to not see a Brandon Ingram iso play for once
If you take KD's outlier IQ and athleticism and regress them he's basically Brandon Ingram
Blazers: give the ball to our best player. Pels: BRANDON INGRAM!
"Why tf they don't give Zion the ball in the last possession. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we got the win but it felt a little weird. He was carving Blazers up the whole game. Instead we get Brandon Ingram doing... something?"
"Brandon Ingram is trash. Screw him man. During the final quarter when only Williamson was on the court the Pelicans were in full flight, but then Ingram came back on, took all those garbage shots like he doesn't want to be outdone by Williamson or something and they started losing again. There was a even a moment where he saw Zion was wide open, fake pumped to pass to him but then decided to go for an extremely difficult shot right in front of a defender (and missed). He's a horrible horrible team mate."
Someone needs to talk to Brandon Ingram. He has to pass the ball in some of those tuff shot situation. And SVG has to know no one has stopped Zion all night. At least let him touch it. Horrible hire.
Zion could go 80/80 and the final minutes of a close game will be nothing but Brandon Ingram Isos.
brandon ingram stinked up the whole second half and thats who you end the game with
I did not watch the whole game but what I saw in this last quarter from Brandon Ingram was damn unimpressive.
Brandon Ingram is frustrating to watch.
Can Brandon Ingram stop taking those garbage shots? Jesus christ he's so bad right now. Williamson was wide open
"Probably the fact that the Pelicans are having a mediocre season while having on their roster Brandon Ingram, Zion, and a relatively good supporting cast, has the result of Zion getting less attention"
"I enjoyed this answer from the 268 pound Kelvin Benjamin when asked about guarding his buffet tray: ""I don't really believe in that smaller food stuff, man, because at the end of the day, if you believed in that, Brandon Ingram would be the MVP of the NBA"""
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"Larry Nance is not the starting PF for the Cavs Kevin Love is. He's a bench player filling an injured slot.  Zubac isn't a starter for the Clippers, Ibaka is.  Brandon Ingram was MIP as well as an all star which is important."
The Lakers once had all these players together: Julius Randle/Jordan Clarkson/Brandon Ingram/D'Angelo Russell. Possibly three all-stars and one 6th man of the year.
"Fit between two players is generally overrated, but main problem is Brandon Ingram is not nearly as good as his raw numbers"
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
Uhhh Brandon Ingram is a better offensive player than Zion is right now
"Okay? What‚Äôs your point? It‚Äôs different from player to player, consistently Zion will have 20-24 points going into the fourth quarter of a tight game and then won‚Äôt be passed the ball for the rest of it, because Brandon Ingram wants to be the star."
"1. LeBron 2. Steph 3. KD 4. Harden 5. Luka 6. Giannis 7. Jokic 8. Dame 9. Beal 10. Embiid 11. Kawhi 12. Trae   Are all unquestionably better offensively than KG was. From there I think you could make fair debates with guys like AD, LaVine, Brown/Tatum, Booker, Zion, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Brandon Ingram. I'd take some of those guys over Garnett offensively but not all of them."

"Well AD technically joined LeBron, and people are still pretty pissed about it, but it wasn‚Äôt like they joined in free agency and New Orleans got fucked. New Orleans got Brandon Ingram and lots of picks"
Simons look like a young Brandon Ingram
&gt; couldn't even make the playoffs with the greatest player of all time  The Lakers were the 4th seed until LeBron's groin injury on Christmas when they beat the Warriors. Brandon Ingram had a blood clot that looked to be potentially career-ending. I think the outcome of that season is different had those events not occurred.
Brandon Ingram style player.   Not that i think he will be a star but he could be a Wiggins-caliber player within a few years if given the opportunity imo
"fat hitler, kobes apprentice, and a better brandon ingram"
Brandon Ingram is dropping 24/5/5 on 47/40/87 and you're telling me Zion is the CLEAR CUT man on the team? This dude can create from anywhere on the court and his playmaking has only gotten better from last year.
"Brandon Ingram  He could do a little bit of everything playmake, shoot, iso, pass, rebound. When he was on the lakers and he wasnt the main option on offense he showed he was capable of being a good defender. 12 of him I'm pretty sure could win it all"
10 bradley beals. 10 ben simmon. 10 tobias Harris. 10 brandon ingram.
"idk how everyone is acting like Ben Simmons isn't a top 30 or so player. he finished ahead of Embiid in DPOY last year and he's one of the games most efficient passers and finishers in transition. anyone who thinks, say, Brandon Ingram is better and contributes more to winning than Ben Simmons is wrong.   Jamal Murray isn't even close outside of one playoff run. if Murray could even be a regular star on a nightly basis, you might be able to talk but he isn't even that. there are a lot of guys who can blow up every couple weeks. he's the odd man out in that list more than Simmons lol"
Brandon ingram
brandon ingram
I watched most of this game. I can‚Äôt believe Brandon Ingram has 24 points I hardly noticed his skinny ass.
I heard Zion can bench press Brandon Ingram.
Brandon Ingram
Lebrons agency made that happen.  The whole deal with AD.   They weren‚Äôt a good team before he was injured.  With Brandon Ingram.  He played some of the worst defense in the league that year.   Full coast mode.
"This post quote made me chuckle because Brandon Ingram who is always called ""baby KD"" basically said the same thing. ""I'm in my room studying tape all the time anyway so I don't think I'm as affected as my teammates."" Hoop already lyfe."
Brandon Ingram plays defense. And this might be lame to some of y‚Äôall but I just don‚Äôt like Zach Lavines body language half the time
Remember when Brandon Ingram was one of the worst players by advanced metrics his rookie and sophomore seasons?
"They should give Lonzo ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart a ring too. Those guys had a bigger contribution than Cousins. If it weren‚Äôt for those three the Lakers wouldn‚Äôt had gotten AD."
You don‚Äôt see Brandon Ingram being a top 10 player ?
"And why is Tobias Harris ahead of Brandon Ingram, and Jalen Brown?"
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."

Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
"god *damn* Brandon Ingram, someone's feeling confident"
He's basically turned himself into Brandon Ingram minus a bit of the play making but with really good defense.
"95-96 Warriors were my first season watching the NBA, and I'm pretty sure Donyell was on that team. Memory is hazy, but man was lanky AF. Think he was a bit of a 3/4 tweener. Basically the broke man's Brandon Ingram. He could shoot a little bit and could post a little bit, but IIRC he didn't have much in the way of quickness or handles. He was also relatively light/weak, so could cause problems with length, but wasn't going to get physical with anybody.   He was one of those ""tease"" type of players who had a couple interesting qualities, but overall was just missing some pieces.   I remember Thomas being the typical 90s power forward inside muscle type. Maul you for some rebounds and play aggressively in the post. Nothing too fancy.   Marshall was with the Warriors for a looong time and they never won anything with him or even qualified for the playoffs, so I'm just going to say he's not really a guy you want on your team if you're actually trying to win stuff. Thomas was no superstar, but I'd rather have him."
"I feel like at least Wiseman and Ant aren't straight up misses -- they're more raw, so it'll take them more time to develop (vs. LaMelo, who came from pro ball in Australia), but the potential is clearly there.  I mean look at Brandon Ingram -- just absolutely god awful shooting splits his rookie season, in subsequent seasons got better but never _quite_ put it all together (partially because of injuries but also because that's just being a young player)...but now 5 years later he's blossomed into an amazing scorer, and pretty knockdown from three/the free throw line.  Some great players just come out firing right out the gate, and some need to develop a little more. Only time will tell."
"&gt;I already said he could have been great but to call him a star player is just bot being true. He is a ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù player who had the talent to be amazing. But he wasn‚Äôt a star player.  &gt; &gt;The ‚Äúcomparison‚Äù was an explanation. You used losing 2 players as if no other team lost a player ever.  &gt; &gt;I forgot about Reggie Lewis. He was already in his mid 20‚Äôs when he passed and was a 1 time all star. I wouldn‚Äôt call him a star player.  &gt; &gt;4 HOF players vs 8 HOF players. You don‚Äôt see the difference there?  &gt; &gt;You can call bullshit all you want but the fact is that legally the clippers are the rightful owners of 13 of those championships. If the clippers chose to claim them, legally the Celtics would have to give them to them.  &gt; &gt;What does Rambis # not being retired have to do with anything? Do you know how the Lakers retire #‚Äôs? &gt; &gt;I called the Celtics an improved Celtics because both teams have stayed competitive for the last 20 or so years and regularly make the playoffs but neither team can go all the way(minus 2008). That is a great comparison. Your comparison for the Lakers and Cavs is weak. LA is beautiful and is a vacation location. Cleveland is well, Cleveland. And they have sucked for most of their history. Make a better comparison.    for all intents and purposes Len Bias was a franchise cornerstone. Like Imagine if Brandon Ingram died on draft night. Suddenly the AD trade never happens and your championship drought continues for 10+ years or again with my Kobe comparison and could be even longer.   Yes and when teams lose players they usually don't win. Ask the Bulls Thunder and Magic why they don't have chips to name a few. An all star has the word star in it. I'm talking caliber buddy. there is HOF and then there is GOAT candidate. The Rambis thing is just an example of Lakers hypocriticism where they accept the Minny Chips but not the players almost like they pick and choose their history. Yes I root for the Boston basketball team players coaches and staff not the ownership entity which again apparently has more chips than the LA Lakers do and beat the Lakers in quite a fair amount of Head to Heads in the big game if you're going to make this argument. you'd be following the inferior LA franchise.  I called the Lakers Cleveland because they just happened to be in a location that was meaningful to LeBron not because of their basketball acumen in this last decade so they could tank their way to a title."
Conveniently forgeting Brandon Ingram who more of us said had star potential while r/NBA was calling him Travis Outlaws 2.0 lol. Only the really hard homer Lakers fans were saying Kuz had more potential than the younger Tatum &amp; Brown.
the way he moves and uses his arms is scarily reminiscent of a second year Brandon Ingram  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to be as good as BI but if he gets that mid ranger Horton Hears a Who would be a fantastic championship piece
"&gt;this sub thought Brandon Ingram was a ""glorified Travis Outlaw""  Thats ridiculous. One dude said that, this sub has its share of stupid takes, but that wasn't some 12k upvotes post."
"I'm still low on Brandon Ingram, but I know I'm on an island with that one"
"Uhh... Jayson Tatum was the best player for the Celtics in the playoffs and carried the team to game 7 in the ECF against Lebron(and boomed him) when he had just turned 20. Brandon Ingram was averaging 16/5/4 when he had just turned 20. I don‚Äôt understand the comparison you‚Äôre trying to draw there, there‚Äôs other players you could‚Äôve compared him to."
"Not for a 20 year old. He's shooting 35% on spot up 3s &amp; 35.7% on pull up 3s. He struggles on catch &amp; shoot in motion, but thats a question footwork &amp; experience. Even if he never masters that, given his ability at the rim &amp; defensively, he still has star potential. Like I used to tell ppl who doubted Brandon Ingram, you can't teach his physical gifts or drive to improve."
"you shouldn't really take r/nba's opinions on Laker players that seriously, this sub thought Brandon Ingram was a ""glorified Travis Outlaw"""
"There are some really bad takes in here. Let me just tell you all this. Before you start talking about it is just the lakers and other nonsense, just watch him play for a few games. The kid *just* turned 20 two months ago. He has forced the best team in the league to move him into the rotation with his play. Think about where Brandon Ingram was when he just turned 20. Where Jayson Tatum was. THT has a long way to go, but he has a really amazing ability to get to the rim and is showing some good defense, as well.  Bottom line is, before you go acting like all the professionals in the league  taking notice of him are so stupid, you should watch him a bit yourself. Nothing in the future is guaranteed, but he has looked very good considering his age and experience."
"Bruh there‚Äôs a difference between discounting the rookie year and acting like it didn‚Äôt matter by somehow comparing it to college years like you did. Go back and read what you said. Apparently to you Duke is the same as Year one in The nba lmao   No I wouldn‚Äôt be over here. You tried to send a shot at a player on my team by acting like RJ Barrett is on track to somehow be above him. Fucking Knicks fans man. I know you‚Äôre lost in the your own shit but that‚Äôs what you were doing bro    Alright then send me the ‚Äúsomeone else who made the comparison‚Äù because all I see is you.   Naw you could make comparisons but again as I just said the way you said it you meant for it to be a shot, don‚Äôt get mad when people see it that way. You‚Äôre too smart for that   And you mention ‚ÄúAge,Draft Pick, College‚Äù what about Brandon Ingram then? He‚Äôs Duke too, what so because he was the #2 pick instead of 3rd you decided to go with Tatum? Knock it off you had Tatum on your mind    And thanks I know I have an all star and all nba guy on my team. When he wasn‚Äôt that though, I didn‚Äôt spend my time saying ‚Äúwow look at how much better Tatum‚Äôs numbers are than *insert player on a team in which I hate*‚Äù"
Lmao if we got a top 3 pick there's no way in hell rosas trades if for Brandon Ingram.
&gt;Why would you trade a top 3 pick in a stacked draft and who for?  Our GM has constantly said that the goal is to trade for stars and as who I would trade for? Hmm. Brandon Ingram is probably the only realistic target
"Id throw the Pels into that ring too. They got 2 potential superstar talents in Brandon Ingram and Zion  Lonzo could be a nice role guy on a contender, Hart is a nice off the bench piece, NAW and Kira got pretty good upside, and Hayes has at least show flashes of being better recently and is only 20   They also got a ton of picks so they got flexibility there as well"

"&gt; However, in those situations where you absolutely have to get a bucket, do you want Brandon Ingram to take that shot or Zion?  Depends on the situation. But in general I would want the 3-level scorer to take that shot."
Anfernee simons and Brandon Ingram
"&gt;*and they said Ingram takes shots away from zion and Ingram acts like it's his team.*  Players don't get to bogart shots. If it's a close game and Brandon has the ball at the end, it's because coaching staff asked him to take closing time shots.  Brandon's always been really supportive and complimentary of Zion (even to the point where it became a controversial Lebron story about him complimenting Zion lol.) With this year's insane schedule, it helps both guys to have another person on the floor who can help carry the offense so they aren't by themselves.  They haven't had a training camp together (Zion was hurt last year) and this is Zion's first real season playing with the team.  &gt;*I already know he don't really play any d but how has he at other aspects of the game?*  Yeah, the defense is bad lol.  We need a year of actual practices to work on team defense and we need a 3&amp;D Wing who can take those assignments on. (David Griffin was looking into Larry Nance Jr. who isn't available, but hopefully, that means he's looking for similar guys.)  Brandon's offensive load is still a lot and the bad spacing makes him expend more energy to get to the rim. So that probably takes away from the defense a bit too. He also needs to put on actual weight to stop getting shuffled around at times."
Brandon Ingram. Guess there‚Äôs no hope for Wiseman!
"Oh, I completely agree that having a guy with his skill set is important. However, in those situations where you absolutely have to get a bucket, do you want Brandon Ingram to take that shot or Zion? Ingram seems more interested in calling his own number in those situations instead of feeding Zion the ball."
"I don't think your defense was that bad, some of our guys just couldn't miss. Also what's up with Brandon Ingram passing up open looks? Not sure why he didn't just snipe out of the zone and force the defense to open up"
Brandon Ingram needs to get sooooo much better
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"I agree. Lonzo is having a great year but Trae fans took this as a slight to Trae and it is what it is. Fun fact, Brandon Ingram is tied with Trae Young for three‚Äôs made"
But did you know Bam Adebayo has more assist per game than Brandon Ingram?
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
"The only issue I have with this is it focuses too narrowly on an individual. When the team is what really matters.  Perfect example: Kyrie. Maybe Kyrie makes this list on his own. But we‚Äôll never know because LeBron came back. And it‚Äôs like...maybe that counts, as Kyrie was a talented enough player to lure LeBron back. But without LeBron the odds of those Cavs teams doing anything was pretty slim.  Then look at Carmelo. In 04-05, he was the top scorer, but had the lowest Win Share of the starters and worst Vorp. He was at .5 compared to 2.6 (Camby), 2.0 (Miller), 1.8 (Martin), and 1.7 (Boykins). Even 34 year old Byron Russell had a higher Vorp (.7)  Obviously Melo being there let the other guys thrive. I doubt if you take him out the team is suddenly stronger. But it wasn‚Äôt just drafting Melo that made the difference.   I think that‚Äôs the case with most of these guys. The odds of a lottery pick = playoffs has more to do with the rest of the team than the pick. There‚Äôs probably a world where Brandon Ingram ends up with Embiid in Philly and is on this list while Simmons gets Luke Walton‚Äôd then traded for Anthony Davis.   I think circumstances matter more than this analysis allows for."
Yep.  No Brandon Ingram nor Zion.
'#5 recruit coming out of highschool.  1. Ben Simmons  2. Skal Labissiere  3. Brandon Ingram  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Henry Ellenson
Brandon Ingram game winner on Philly sophomore season.
"Bam is criminally high on this list. Above Brandon Ingram, Vuc, Julius Randle, Ja and SGA? Cmon"
Rj barrett and Brandon ingram still existing
Brandon Ingram is a Hanlen guy as well.  Even the last list of guys fancy themselves as skilled players. Their teams just don't agree
"Hayes is awful and Zion struggles defensively and clearly isn‚Äôt ready to play center. Moreover Adams is an experienced pick and roll partner for Brandon Ingram to work with and Adams is also a good outlet passer which should be important for a team that wants to be fast-break dominant. Adams at 17 mill a year is totally fair for a team with lots of cap flexibility, people just hate the idea of paying bigs.  Somehow Dlo being on a max is fine to everyone but giving Gobert a max made people want to turn in their graves."
I automatically assumed Brandon Ingram didn't last year but apparently he scored a cool 2 points
Brandon Ingram deserves more credit for his improved playmaking
Trae is 2nd on my MVP ladder right behind Brandon Ingram
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He‚Äôs better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn‚Äôt easily."
Add in Brandon Ingram and the world isn‚Äôt ready for playoff Sexland
"People say the roster construction is bad, but Zion isn't an easy player to build around. Getting shooters around him won't make him a good playmaker. He's not Lebron, he's Zion. Maybe he can grow into a player like that, but I wouldn't count on it. He needs a great playmaking point guard with three level scoring ability. Brandon Ingram isn't an amazing fit to me and there isn't many centers that can compliment his skill set that they realistically can acquire. Maybe like a Porzingis? He's always injured and that contract isn't great. I don't think Zion is really the kind of player that can elevate his teammates. At least not yet."
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
People acted like his last game wasn't a rarity for him. He's one of the most clutch players in the League but people pretended he was suddenly Brandon Ingram because of one shitty game
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
"Funny, you are the non-hooper telling him to develop random skills he has no intention of developing so you can eat your own statement.    The way he is playing is the way he wants to play and he understands its the right way to play.  The league is run by analytics and nerds coaching smart nba players to do the mathematically efficient plays and that will never change.  Nobody is jacking 22 foot middies any more, nobody is shooting jump hooks other than jokic, everyone is shooting 3s, all teams are playing in drop coverage, zone and switch defense.  Those are all coached and require skill development for high level execution.  Brandon Ingram, your guy, is a great example of someone whose impact on winning is marginalized due to his shot selection, and why Zion is the future of the Pelicans and Ingram is an attractive trade piece.  You live in the past, go turn on a 2001 celtics game and watch some ugly basketball."
"I agree on the conditioning aspect of the early 2000s basketball.  Early 90s Shaq aged to the modern game without weight gain and a 12'4 max vertical was who I was referring to.  The trend around the league, however, has been in opposition to your point.  There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%.   Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan and Brandon Ingram are all guys who were positionally terrible from the free throw line and made record breaking improvements after working with modern free throw coaching. Even Tacko Fall is finding time on the floor for non-meme minutes after being unplayably bad from the free throw line at USF.  Shaquille O'Neal did not focus as much on free throws, this is known.  He had one good free throw season in LA and basically said ""Im good."". Better coaching and general social pressure would force him to do so today and he wouldn't be one hand scooping the ball like he did with Miami."
"The dude is better than Brandon Ingram right now based upon eye test and every impact metric available.  Ingram is a defensive sieve whose playmaking is mediocre and ability to get to the rim leaves a lot to be desired.  The only difference between Ingram and MPJ on the playmaking front is MPJ isn't allowed to playmake and for good reason, there are better playmakers on the team.  Ingram ruins end of game situations and runs the offensive only when lonzo is hurt or when svg decides to hemorrhage point differential."
"Dwane wade, Kevin love, isiah thomas, tristan thompson, bosh, illgeskias, snow, jr smith, kyle korver, AD, Brandon Ingram, Julius randle, mike miller, ray allen,   Every player I named has an NBA career achievement award, weather that be an all start, 3 point contest, 6 man, etc... Lebron has had all of these, and keep in mind he picks his team.  KD never picked his team, he was recruited.  Lebitch still picks all these players, and still can't win.  There is a lot more I forgot too"
Cuz we're rained on even more bro  Sports media been trying to get All-Star Brandon Ingram traded all year so that Zion can be the sole reliable bucket-producer on the team
"The thing is even if he is what you're talking about   he's still worth $25 million.  Make a list of every player in the league that is taller than 6'7"" and can give you 18-8 on high efficiency.   Even if he doesn't become a superstar his comp is what, budget Brandon Ingram?   A less strong but more athletic Gordon Hayward?  That's still a pretty damn good player."
"Grizzlies and Hawks both have widely hated players in Grayson Allen and Trae Young respectively, however Grayson Allen is hated because he is a genuinely dirty piece of shit and Trae cuz gets a lot of fouls called on him and he gets to the line.   Pels have a hyper popular and exciting young core in Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and some fat guy from Duke. Honestly both an exciting future and also a future that I'm pretty sure they'll fuck up somehow so follow the Hawks, unless you want to be happy in any way."
"yeah, you have Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. Why not go with either of those two?"
"Also drafted Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Julius Randle, Kyle Kuzma in that time. I think Lakers fans just confuse normal rebuilding struggles with questionable moves because they arent used to losing for that long"
"From when the previous owner passed away up until the bron signing they were definitely ran poorly.  Power struggles, no real direction while having multiple top picks, poor coaching, all that.  If Lebron didn‚Äôt go there they‚Äôd likely still be struggling cause there‚Äôs no guarantee guys like Dlo, Randle, Hart, Ol dude who always looks high, would‚Äôve been as good there like they were after going to a different situation.  Oh it was Brandon Ingram how‚Äôd I forget his name"
Zion is special and the Pelicans got him when everyone wanted him.  The team isn't configured correctly.  Bledsoe and Adams are terrible fits next to Zion and Ingram is far from the ideal running mate.  Lonzo who was the only piece that fit well with Zion has been in trade rumors constantly this season.    I honestly thought Griffin would do better than this.  The fact that they wanted a second round draft pick over appeasing a 15 year vet who they KNOW has a popular podcast is ludicrous and insane.  They proved me wrong on some fronts.  I thought Brandon Ingram was a complete dud. He is now a high volume above average starter who they maxed.  They did a good job recruiting that doctor from the Suns to work on Zion's landing mechanics.    But they need to build faster for a serious top 4 playoff push by next season or they are squandering a generational talent.  That treasure trove of picks needs to be turned into Karl Anthony Towns.  They could even get Myles Turner or anyone who isn't Adams. Stretch Bledsoe - they guy is done and all impact metrics have him as a solid negative contributor.
"True. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, who says no?"
This is probably just me but Brandon Ingram always looks to me like the guy in a pickup game who's a very good player but at the same time isn't as good as he thinks
Brandon Ingram plays really similar to Tobias Harris
&gt; empty stats player Brandon Ingram is incredible.  Just slipping that in there at the end
Him and Brandon Ingram are like a hot dog no condiments
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i¬¥ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren¬¥t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
Both Ingram and Randle are substantially different players now than in LA. I remember Ben Taylor saying Brandon Ingram last year had the single greatest shooting performance in one season in nba history I don‚Äôt blame anybody for calling those who said he was doing that in LA homers. These same people are the ones who were pretending Ingram was a good defender in LA because they were grading him on such a massive curve when he‚Äôs been a complete joke on that end now

Brandon Ingram
"I for sure thought Westbrook was going to miss both lol.  Sloppy win, Wiz couldn't make any open 3s.  Brandon Ingram is nice for the Pels, as is Zion obviously but tonight a lot of mental mistakes but he's still a beast.    Gafford is looking to be a good addition for us.  Rui had a cold game.  I wish Deni would get more calls to be more involved.  He's not a corner 3 player lol.   The last play before regulation was terrible.  Not sure why Beal is shooting a step back 3 for it.  And honestly Westbrook got very lucky on the foul for the end of OT because I groaned at that play too lol.    Regardless we fucking on the wizards bed tonight boys!!!!"
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
Buddy Hield and Brandon Ingram is an interesting one. Their difference in age Hield 28 vs Ingram 23 is greater then the difference between them taken in the lottery of the same draft at 2 and 6.

"Imagine being an elite athlete and having blood clots. LMFAO, sounds a lot like illegal peptide use (performance enhancing drugs). I mean it's obvious right? People will be hesitant to comment about someone like Brandon Ingram but it's obvious.

"Jordan Clarkson, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram"
"&gt; It's more the ex-Lakers stack that seems to have issues with Stan. Luke Walton and Alvin Gentry were very lackadaisical coaches and Gentry had 45 minute practices and often didn't run plays and just let players do what they wanted. Stan wants less turnovers/more defense.  This I can definitely see. Brandon Ingram in particular I can see this playing out and Hart/Lonzo contract situations looming was always in the background with them. This all just comes down to the results next season, if they make the playoffs I dont think any of this meaningfully affects SVG, if they dont then we'll see what happens."

"No they didn't üòÇ. D'Angelo Russell sucked in LA, Jordan Clarkson got traded for scraps and Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram did NOT live up to expectations."
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars. Jordan Clarkson became the 6th man of the year, Lonzo Ball became a good point gaurd and even guys like Ivica Zubac are thriving."
"Living in Southern California, there's just a big mix of legit Lakers fans who know what they're talking about and another giant population of Lakers fans who are obnoxious bandwagoners.  I saw a *lot* of people with Warriors merch popping up around the area during peak Curry/Thompson/Green/KD era and way fewer Lakers jerseys than usual. But the moment LeBron signed, it was like a sea of purple and gold overnight. I can't blame everyone for that, but so many act as if they stayed Lakers fans the whole time. Then you ask them who Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle or Jordan Clarkson or Timofey Mozgov were and they're clueless lol  I guess you can't knock them for wanting to represent, and at least there's real fans of the team who actually did keep with the team when they struggled. But it's a headache sometimes"
Brandon Ingram
"I come in peace.  Looking back now,  how do you feel about them keeping Kuzma over Brandon Ingram in retrospec?"
It certainly often turns into that in the comments that‚Äôs for sure. I asked who you would rather have  between Brandon Ingram and SGA last year and It became a weird SGA hate fest.
Simons looks so much like a non-tatted Brandon Ingram
"Sigh....  Jay Williams, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon, Carlos Boozer, Elton Brand,  Corey Maggette, JJ Redick, Sheldon Williams, Gerald Henderson, Josh McRoberts, Jason Tatum, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Jahil Okafor, Grayson Allen  Clearly you don't understand what the word TYPICALLY means. Now you have been schooled. Enjoy the L."
*Brandon Ingram
Bullying works  Brandon Ingram Please eat something
Brandon Ingram feels like someone plausible they could get that would fit in well.
"1 to 2 years if they do this Wiseman trade.  If I'm the Warriors, could I get Brandon Ingram for Wiseman and Wiggins? Maybe you would'nt even have to trade the Minnesota pick."
"Eh, that seems like revisionist history. Then again, maybe r/nba is the frame of reference and this is completely accurate. I thought Ayton was good from jump with great offensive feel but just needed work defensively. He's become much better on that end, a legit positive, and he's still got decent touch and finishing ability along with elite physicals. To be fair, I also drafted him in fantasy basketball his first two years and tuned in for parts of many Suns games. He wasn't exactly a franchise changing player ala Luka (which will always be the comparison), but he's not a bad pick by any stretch of the imagination. Been real solid.   I just don't feel the same about Wiseman thus far. He just doesn't look like he has a good feel for the game overall and is keeping up via physical talent alone. More an athlete than a basketball player to me, I can't remember the last top tier prospect I've seen look so lost out there. And it doesn't even come down to stats. Like Brandon Ingram didn't look good for much of his rookie year, but we Lakers fans saw the flashes of potential and his growing understanding as the months progressed. His boxscore numbers sucked, but his feel for the game was getting better and better and he looked way better in March than he did in November.   We'll see if Wiseman breaks out of it and becomes better, but I just don't have high hopes for super raw big men with how the NBA is played nowadays. The deck is already stacked against them, and in this case he seems like he doesn't really know how to ""play big"" as a default."
"Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo and Steven adams should be enough to get to the postseason. I'm not saying they need to be a top seed here but how much help does he need.  Pressure should 100% be on zion next season to make a postseason appearance."
"They drafted julius Randle, dlo Russell, brandon Ingram. All three have been all stars. Plus Jordan Clarkson who is going to win 6th man of the year. Why are we acting like their rebuild/tanking was unsuccessful?? Obv lebron and ad won them a chip but they were set up for the future"
"Wisemann,Wiggins, some picks for Brandon ingram"
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion‚Äôs? Fit is one thing, but he‚Äôs playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"I mean you‚Äôd think with all their talent they‚Äôd be able to scrape up something but nope.  Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball as a young core  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, (formerly) JJ Reddick As your vets. A lot of talent on paper."
"Don‚Äôt be fooled, Brandon Ingram only made the ASG cuz the usual players were injured. Doubt he sniffs an all star game for another 3-4 years."

"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here‚Äôs just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

If he had taken Brandon Ingram and tanked for a year or two he might have a Zion or morant/Ingram core right now.   If he had made the decision based on basketball and not pride he might have gotten one more run in
"If knicks are proof of anything it is that no quagmire is eternal. But I agree Lebron made us what we are. But I watched the baby lakers and seeing what they have all developed into you can't say they wouldnt at least be a competitive playoff team this year even without lebron. We would have Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle Lonzo Ball Kyle Kuzma as well as out other pieces currently on the roster. Maybe Randle needed to leave to become what he is but even if he was close to it on the lakers that is a tough team that I think could be a finals threat in the coming years."
Brandon Ingram in shambles
"Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram"
Brandon Ingram
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
Definitely. He's a much better Brandon Ingram
Your team didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs 2 seasons ago. With Lebron James Kyle Kuzma Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball on the roster.
"3rd year brandon ingram lol. No way. Players usually have higher TS% when playing with Bron too. You gotta be kidding me if you think any of those lakers 2nd year player was even better than JP. Or Ingram, Zo, Zubac, KCP, etc are better than Draymond, wig, oubre, looney."
"As someone who watched damn near all our games- I thought we were absolutely fucked when Mitch went down with his broken foot. Nerlens stepped it up the first time Mitch went down, but the second time around he completely carried us defensively for the rest of the season. There is no guaranteed bucket when you are driving to the rim when he‚Äôs around. He made several momentum swinging blocks in the 4th quarter of games this year that made a huge difference, imo the best one was the Brandon Ingram block in over time against the Pels, which essentially ended the game. He‚Äôs been everything you could want and more from a backup center defensive specialist, and I really hope we can hold on to him."
"&gt;  In my lifetime I can not think of a player who has made this much of a jump in his shot so suddenly.  Brandon Ingram had a pretty crazy jump, going from ~33% on ~2 attempts a game over his first three seasons to 39% on 6 attempts a game his first season with the Pelicans, plus he went from below 70% to 85% from the line. Still, you'd probably have to give Randle the edge."
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1. Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Brandon Ingram - 24  **Most games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. James Harden - 16 2. Malik Beasley - 15 3.

Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
Naji ‚ÄúSquint and you might see Brandon Ingram‚Äù Marshall
"I think this guy is better than what a lot of people say, but Brandon Ingram."
Yeah because having to be a fucking reserve allstar behind brandon fucking ingram means he‚Äôs praised right?
I have literally watched 20 hours of Brandon Ingram game film this year   That‚Äôs more impactful than 50 full pelican games
"I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt watch all 72 games of every team?   I watched plenty of game film on Brandon Ingram, normally a dozen or so games in a row.   I‚Äôm not watching a shit Pelicans team play below their talent level every night."
"The wizards have 2 better offensive players than Brandon Ingram   My team is gonna win with extremely switchable defense and the ability to play in multiple different ways. Ben will be the #1 some nights, some nights it‚Äôll be Clarkson, or Powell, etc.   Warren at the 3, with the ability to run a lineup of:   Simmons, Murray, Warren, Wood. Ibaka that‚Äôs 4 good defenders s and 4 that can reliably switch, also 4 solid outside shooters, also very good defense."
Zion's career is going to look a lot like Blake Griffin's at the end. A few dynamic years and all star appearances but he's not a guy I would build around. The Pelicans would be better off trading him now while his value is high and build around Brandon Ingram.   I also said this a lot when BI was drafted that he was a better player than Ben Simmons and I think over the next few years that's only going to become more and more apparent.
brandon ingram will be one of the best players in the league in a few years.
Ingram can easily be a number 1 on a playoff team. I‚Äôll make one like you did.  PG: Malcolm Bronson  SG: Lonzo Ball  SF: Brandon Ingram  PF: Bobby Portis  C: Myles Turner
The hawks and Wizards have 3 total players better than Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram went from a 62% FT shooter to a 82% FT shooter.  I don't know how you don't go with him.
Ben Simmons is a role a player. Brandon Ingram can be an important piece on a contender
Will Brandon Ingram ever impact his team as much as a DPOY level player   Hmm.  Ben and Zion flat don‚Äôt work tho
"Hart, Lonzo, and Brandon Ingram.  Donovan Mitchell and Gobert."
"&gt;Buddy Hield won the Naismith in 2016. Would he have deserved a USA roster spot over Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram?  Of course not, he's Bahamanian"
"Lol this sub is incapable of nuance I swear. Buddy Hield won the Naismith in 2016. Would he have deserved a USA roster spot over Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram? Of course not, because he was clearly a worse player despite winning that award."
"Dame, Beal, Embiid, Jokic, Brandon Ingram"
"I more meant that it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect that we can get Dame without giving up RJ. If Portland wants young talent, they‚Äôre gonna demand all of our best young talent bc we don‚Äôt have one young all-star like Jaylen brown, Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram to offer"
"From a Lakers fan that has 2 Julius Randle jerseys and a Brandon Ingram jersey, this hurts."
Brandon Ingram.  Joel Embiid.  Victor Oladipo.
"Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe, and three 1st. Flock up Pels!!!"
Brandon Ingram will never see the playoffs if this happens
Brandon Ingram + several 1st round picks
If he had Brandon Ingram as his 2nd option he would have made the playoffs both years.
"Pelicans only because they cant get worse than what they are rn. They have a bunch of picks, young star(Brandon Ingram) other young players(S&amp;T Lonzo Ball, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker) to trade for Dame. Dame + Zion a better duo than Ingram-Zion."
"The Harden trade was a terrible return though. Presti got Shai plus a ton of assets for PG-13. The Pelicans got Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick, plus two more first round picks. The Rockets really didn't get young talent and most of the picks will probably suck (3 1st from the Nets and one 1st from the Bucks that conveys next year). You may never get equal value because it depends on drafting a superstar but you don't have to lose as bad as the Rockets lost."
Brandon Ingram needs to do something in the playoffs before he can be considered anything other than a good stats bad team guy
Brandon Ingram/Jaxon Hayes/2FRP
"I‚Äôm not saying they need to get a superstar, but they sure need to get way more than timelord and smart. Maybe they could get Brandon Ingram, or Tyler hero and Duncan Robinson, or Simmons and maxey. There‚Äôs gonna be way better offers than what the Celtics would give if they keep brown, if the Celtics offer brown than that is obviously an offer worth highly considering."
"How about making an open layup once in a while? Or a shot? You can‚Äôt always count on steph curry to shoot over 3 people all the time to win lol. It baffles me how some nba players can‚Äôt shoot when they dedicate their whole lives to the sport. If dray could actually make a bucket once in a while then the whole warriors team would improve 10 fold and then they would actually have a legitimate big 3.   I usually don‚Äôt comment and try not to sound like a hater but god damn draymond irritates me the most. Talks like he‚Äôs on Lebron James level or something. Look at demar Derozan, couldn‚Äôt shoot, pass, dribble or defend when he got into the league. Now he has improved that tenfold, same with Tatum, same with Brandon Ingram, same with siakim . List goes on bruv. Draymond is really good at defence but he‚Äôs one dimensional. Get better at other parts of your game then talk"
The Brandon Ingram vs Ben Simmons debate for the sixers was very prevalent
Ben Simmons and a first to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram

I wouldn‚Äôt have traded lonzo and Brandon Ingram for Magic Johnson
"Hahaha, the Brandon Ingram fan (typical street basketball guy that will never play in championship contending team) obviously can't see the impact made on the court by an important role player."
Well then the Cavs could still reroute Beal to a 3rd team and get a much better offer than KP out of it.  How about to Toronto for the #4 pick.  How about Orlando for #5 and #8.  How about NOP for Brandon Ingram.  Literally any trade is better than the Cavs trading for KP.  I dont think I'd even trade Love straight up for KP right now
Would a sign and trade for Brandon Ingram work? Is he good enough?
The Brandon Ingram/Travis Outlaw take from a couple years back
They would‚Äôve lost Brandon Ingram if they waited for free agency. They also won the championship last year.
Not youth at a premium but a factor more so play style. Example being Brandon Ingram or jaylen brown in my mind are first option scorers where as gobert is a defensive stalwart so I‚Äôd take those younger guys not necessarily because age but because their games can evolve more. Whereas with Zion I‚Äôd be hard pressed to say I‚Äôd rather have him right NOW because idk how his game will translate to playoff basketball yet and long term health so if I wanted to win now I‚Äôd take gobert over Zion even though Zion is probably better than all 3 guys mentioned long term.
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they‚Äôd take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
Brandon Ingram with more PG skills is who I see in Cade
devin booker and trae young killed the narrative  its time we pivot to EMPTY STATS BRANDON INGRAM
"Trade Ben Simmons to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball &amp;Brandon Ingram, &amp; let Zion and Ben Simmons work together."
"Brandon Ingram isn‚Äôt super athletic, but he‚Äôs a great shot creator because of his length and ability to make difficult shots. Cade seems to have some of those same skills, so I‚Äôm not worried about it."
i wouldn‚Äôt trade wiseman yet. I feel wiggins and a few picks is enough for a star. They could try and get Brandon Ingram probably for just wiggins and the 14th pick.
Brandon Ingram would be perfect
"LeBron missed 1/3 of the season that year. Give him a full year with the current versions of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams and he's gonna make the playoffs."
"Potential wise I would say Green. If based on current skills and game, Cade Cunningham is a scorer and playmaker. His game is mature for his age at the offensive end. He keeps it simple with rhythm jumpers and step backs. He doesn‚Äôt rely too much on athleticism for his moves which is always great for a young guy. Though people worry about his too droopy eyes. He gives the Brandon Ingram impression where you‚Äôre hesitant to interview him because he might be high."
"Probably #1 and no way he slips past #2 as he would be better than at least 17/20 (Ja and LMA are toss-ups imo) out of the last 20 years of #2 picks  2020 James Wiseman, Memphis - Golden State Warriors  **2019 Ja Morant, Murray State ‚Äì Memphis Grizzlies**  2018 Marvin Bagley, Duke ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2017 Lonzo Ball, UCLA ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2016 Brandon Ingram, Duke ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2015 D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Ohio State ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2014 Jabari Parker, Duke ‚Äì Milwaukee Bucks  2013 Victor Oladipo, Indiana ‚Äì Orlando Magic  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentucky ‚Äì Charlotte Bobcats  2011 Derrick Williams, Arizona ‚Äì Minnesota Timberwolves  2010 Evan Turner, Ohio State ‚Äì Philadelphia 76ers  2009 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut ‚Äì Memphis Grizzlies  2008 Michael Beasley, Kansas State ‚Äì Miami HEAT  **2007 Kevin Durant, Texas ‚Äì Seattle Supersonics**  **2006 LaMarcus Aldridge, Texas ‚Äì Chicago Bulls (Draft rights traded to Portland Trail Blazers)**  2005 Marvin Williams, North Carolina ‚Äì Atlanta Hawks  2004 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut ‚Äì Charlotte Bobcats  2003 Darko Milicic, Serbia &amp; Montenegro ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2002 Jay Williams, Duke ‚Äì Chicago Bulls  2001 Tyson Chandler, Dominguez HS (Calif.) ‚Äì L.A. Clippers (Draft rights  traded to Chicago Bulls)"
"Ya'll can get Kuminga, though you'll probably have to wait more than 3 years to see All Star results even if everything goes well. Think a Brandon Ingram, Jalen Brown situation. Kuminga is that type of project."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22. Giannis Antetokounpo 23. Khris Middleton 24. Jrue Holiday 25. Trae Young 26. Clint Capela 27. Lamelo Ball 28. Jimmy Butler 29. Bam Abedayo 30. Russel Westbrook 31. Bradley Beal 32. Nikola Jokic 33. Michael Porter Jr 34. Jamal Murray 35. Karl Anthony Towns 36. Deangelo Russel 37. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 38. Damien Lillard 39. CJ McCollum 40. Rudy Gobert 41. Donovan Mitchell 42. Steph Curry 43. Klay Thompson 44. Draymond Green 45. Paul George 46. Kawhi Leonard 47. Lebron James 48. Anthony Davis 49. Deandre Aston 50. Chris Paul  51. Devin Booker 52. Luka Doncic 53. Christian Wood 54. John Wall 55. Dearon Fox 56. Ja Morant 57. Dillon Brooks 58. Zion Williamson 59. Brandon Ingram 60. Demar Derozen  And that list really minimizes controversial choices.
"Yeah, he could have picked Simmons and Fultz with 2 top 3 picks. Or Jhalil Okafor. Or Marvin Bagley. Or Brandon Ingram. Or Lonzo Ball  Just because you have a top 3 pick doesnt mean youre guaranteed an All-Star. And Ainge absolutely deserves all the credit in the world for getting a franchise defining superstar and at worst an all-star level complentary wing player with those picks."
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
"Keep in mind Curry had Klay and Draymond, while KD had guys like Westbrook, Ibaka, 6MOTY Harden, and some other good role players before joining the Warriors. Zion is doing this with Eric Bricksoe, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Steven Adams as his best 4 players."
"When it happens it will be something randomly crazy like Sixers getting Brandon Ingram and Lou Dort, and some guys you aren't familiar with and giving up Ben,  Shake, Seth, Maxey, and picks."
Pelicans probably. If only because a rookie Brandon Ingram or a rookie Jaylen Brown is still an upgrade over Solomon Hill and an injured Quincy Pondexter. But Demps would have been criticized even more for passing on the LSU guy.
"Is his own fault. I'm sorry to say but that's the truth.  He has been in the league for 5 years.... He came in with Brandon Ingram and was a sophomore when Lonzo came in.   Ingram won MIP, Lonzo changed his shooting style 2-3 times while Ben remained the same.   This is why he is getting all the hate right now. His shooting issues were raised during his 2nd year I think.... But he did nothing to improve himself.   Add on the fact that he signed a 177milliom contract.  Just looked up his stats for the playoffs.  2017/18  16.3ppg/9.4rebounds/7.7assists  48.8% shooting on 12.5fga  2018/19  13.9ppg/7.1rebounds/6assists  62.1% on 9.7fga  2020/21 11.9ppg/7.9rebounds/8.8assists  62.1% on 7.9fga  Only number that went up is his assists. Everything else went down. Those numbers aren't worthy of a $177 million contract."
"1. Jaylen Brown   2. Jamal Murray   3. Brandon Ingram   People live Ingram I know but the thing people have to remember is we‚Äôve never seen Murray or Brown as a #1 full time, so everything we‚Äôve seen from them is actually only a portion of their potential. Murray‚Äôs ceiling is bubble Murray , 1st team all nba caliber. Brown for those few games Tatum was out was ‚Ä¶putting up the same numbers as Tatum. He‚Äôs a 27-5-5 type wing . They are all-nba, alpha , lead a team to a title type studs   Ingram? Imo is a notch down. A true #2. I like him but he‚Äôs kinda on the flip side as far as opportunities. We‚Äôve seen him as a #1 and we‚Äôve probably seen his max level. He‚Äôs good, very good, but not as high a ceilings the other 2‚Ä¶  Oh and since it‚Äôs relatively close I‚Äôd also factor in his demeanor. I don‚Äôt see Brandon ingram as a leader of a team, whereas I see Murray as a good one and Jaylen brown ascending to a GREAT one"
Brandon Ingram
"Genuine question...what should we have done different?  We weren't gonna pay Bryn, Kyle, Dedmon, J Simmons, or Bertans what they ended up getting in FA and only Kyle has actually lived up to his contract.  Kawhi tanked his value leaving us almost no options. We can talk about hypothetical Lakers trades but is Brandon Ingram really the difference maker in San Antonio? I don't think we're all the sudden an automatic playoff team with him over Derozan/Poeltl.  The biggest ""mistake"" we made was sending Danny with Kawhi but I'm sure there was a salary reason for that and who knows if we even keep Danny when he would have hit free agency."
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: DƒÅvis BertƒÅns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting BertƒÅns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
"Idk you‚Äôre forgetting about guys like LaMelo, Fox, Ben Simmons, Bam, SGA, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, MPJ, and Ja."
Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakam
I know at least Kevin O'Connor had Brandon Ingram over Simmons that year.
Say my Wiz happened to get top pick every season for 5 straight seasons and having the hindsight of how players turn out‚Ä¶  C: James Wiseman (2020)  PF: Zion Williamson (2019)  SF: Brandon Ingram (2016)  SG: Donovan Mitchell (2017)  PG: Luka Doncic (2018)  Cause looking at what Ernie did to the team‚Ä¶it hurts too much to think on all the Players we missed due to horrible drafting.
I'd take Brandon Ingram over Brown. Well id take both over Simmons.
"Imagine this sixers team with Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray"
Remember when we got shit on for believing in Brandon Ingram over Ben Simmons?  Simmons ain't a hooper man.
It's crazy to me to think what the Sixers might have been with Brandon Ingram or Jamaal Murray instead of Simmons.  Simmons would be fine with a group of shooters but this has always been questionable
"Every Laker young player magically learns how to shoot the moment they leave LA and people pretend ""they were destined to become good all along had they just stayed in LA!"". Ben Taylor called 2020 Brandon Ingram the biggest single season shooting jump in NBA history last yr. Larry Nance and Julius Randle werent even taking 3s in LA. D'Angelo Russell literally finished 2nd in most improved player of the year voting after leaving LA."
No one is stopping KD or is a stopper of him. The only player I‚Äôve seen give KD problems actually was Brandon Ingram a few years ago. It was like KD was looking at himself üòÇ.
"Yes, exactly. Lebron joined a Lakers team with superstars such as Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and KUZMA."
Lol you describing Linebacker LuDort like he‚Äôs Brandon Ingram??
"Lot of them traded to New Orleans to get Anthony Davis - specifically Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple first round picks."

Isn‚Äôt Brandon Ingram an absolutely awful defender and has been his whole career? Lol
Do you remember Brandon ingram?
"At this point, is Brandon Ingram a better player than Ben Simmons? I would think so, right?"
"This dude has really barely played a full season of games and is already bitching about losing. People have got to stop gassing these kids before they actually do anything, the entitlement is absurd.   Zion's out there with Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Steven Adams, etc. Compared to some of the absolute bums that some of the league's stars started their careers playing with, how tf are you really complaining about that. Even SVG and Alvin Gentry, for all their faults, are at least legit coaches.   I get wanting to hold the FO's feet to the fire, but if he's actually already fed up, he's nuts."
"&gt; Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.  Not peers, but Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler were also two guys you wanted the ball far away from while on offense, and look at them now. Avery Bradley is another..."
Because its his 2nd year. He has a costar in Brandon Ingram and a 3rd guy in Lonzo along with young talent sprawling everywhere lmao  Imagine if Lebron had anyone close to BI's potential to develop with in Cleveland. Even he gutted it out for 7 years before dipping  Idk why ur trying to defend a dude who wants to leave in his second year lmao I know the mentality rn is fuck the ownership but this is too far
Trade Brandon Ingram for CJ McCollum and RoCo Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball for Lauri Markannen  Sign Kyle Lowry in free agency Trade Steven Adams for PJ Washington   Lowry CJ RoCo Zion Lauri  PJ Hayes Bledsoe NAW Lewis Jr
"As an okc fan, we‚Äôll eat the 2 years on Steven Adam‚Äôs extension in exchange for the 2022 first rounder, swap picks in 23, pelicans and lakers 1st rounders in 24, a smattering of 2nds, Brandon Ingram, and josh hart  Come on presti, make the magic happen again"
"‚ÄúWhat he‚Äôs doing‚Äù DG doesn‚Äôt need anyone defending him, but he‚Äôs got as many hits as he does misses. It doesn‚Äôt help the misses - Bledsoe and Adams - are his most costly. But other than Zion, he drafted Jaxon Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and both showed some promise and potential as bench contributors. Kira Lewis can be electric as well. The trades with the Lakers and Bucks both were net positives for the team. Brandon Ingram still has room to grow and could be a great compliment to Zion. What they end up doing with Lonzo will be fascinating and arguably his biggest non-coaching move. He‚Äôs worth keeping around, but only at a certain price. Cutting George Hill instead of Bledsoe was a bad move, and signing Adams to that contact only made sense with SVG as head coach. He‚Äôll now have to unload some of their draft capital to get anything of value in return for Bledsoe and Adams which is unfortunate. And the hiring of SVG wasn‚Äôt great either. Yes, they needed defensive improvement, but there are plenty of individuals that are qualified that could connect to the team a lot better.  Tl;dr DG‚Äôs misses have been more costly, but he‚Äôs still had more hits overall."
"This is absurd. You have Brandon Ingram and Zion both under 24 years old, you have plenty of time to add players to the roster. Just look at Booker with the Suns granted that took longer than expected but demanding a trade 2 seasons in is ridiculous."
"Anyone who says Luka is going to demand a trade is crazy, but IF he did, Brandon Ingram + 11 FRPs would be quite the haul. Luka + Zion would be filthy, and you could still hold on to Lonzo, Alexander-Walker, etc‚Ä¶  11 FRPs sounds crazy, but it‚Äôs also a 21 year old  with all-time great potential. In a world where Luka demands a trade, that‚Äôs probably the best offer on the table unless OKC wants to unload all their picks"
"&gt;Brandon, Ingram and hart are   Those three guys should be coached by Mike, Dan and Tony."
Before injuries he definitely had some fast twitch to his game that‚Äôs now all but gone.  He was euro Brandon Ingram before injuries and surgeries essentially. Still really good of him to reform his game around skill and game feel like he has
"Check out his bb-ref page: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/simmobe01.html  He's not improving significantly on a year to year basis. In some areas, he is regressing. If you scroll down to the shooting section, you can see FGA % by Distance. He actually attempted more mid-range (10-16 feet) shots his rookie year as compared to the last 3 years he's actively avoided them. It's even worse when you view his playoff shooting stats.  Last season in the playoffs, 70% of shots were from 0-3 feet away, 25% were 3-10 feet away. This season, its 28%. 98% of his FGA are occurring only 10 feet away from the hoop. Opposing teams are aware of this and can take him out of games. Sure, he may get some easy transition dunks but in the half court, they can literally help off him or sag off on the ball cause he is just not a threat. He's a great defender. And good playmaker. And very flashy. But he is unable to take advantage of his mismatches as an oversized point guard. If he had taken the time the last 4 years to develop a jump shot, he could consistently shoot over smaller defenders.  For comparison, here is Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown's bb-ref pages:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/ingrabr01.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02.html  You can see a clear progression and improvement in their stats across the board. I'm not saying Ben Simmons needs to develop a 40% 3P shot to be an effective player. If he developed an elbow jumper that would significantly alter his game and the way opposing defenses had to play him and open up for the floor for his drives and passing lanes."
It‚Äôs been two seasons in Memphis with significantly less draft assets and tradeable capital and they built a playoff team around Ja in two years.  Ja doesn‚Äôt even have a Brandon Ingram to play with and he made the playoffs because he has a competent FO who has players around him that compliment his skill set.  These two years nonsense is stupid.  Philly made the playoffs with their young talent once they got healthy.  Utah did with Mitchell.  Not everything is long drawn out.  Franchise defining talent with other fitting pieces around them should make the playoffs.  If they don‚Äôt and those guys are playing ta an all star level chances are it‚Äôs not the talents fault.
Starts don't always tell the story. A lot of people were saying Devin Booker was an empty stats guy but once he got decent pieces around him they started to turn it around. And I'm not talking about this here if you look at last year after DeAndre Eaton came back from his suspension the sons were above .500 . Now look at Brandon Ingram who puts up pretty similar stats to Devin Booker but had a monster in the paint and Zion Williamson who I'm sure most people would say is better than DeAndre Eaton and a decent point guard in Lonzo ball and they where the 11th seed...
I checked Brandon Ingram vs Ben Simmons stats and its night and day dude.
"Please don't bring the Brandon Ingram into this, he is so overrated. Him, Lonzo, and Zion couldn't even make the play-in game."
Its kind of sad that the 76ers could have taken Brandon Ingram and they would have been a young dynasty with Joel and Ingram.  Ben Simmons has been a bust so far going #1 overall in the draft.
If you have a Zion on your team with a Brandon Ingram and can‚Äôt realize that you need a floor spacing center along with wing defenders on that team to be competitive then you don‚Äôt deserve to have a Zion.  From the moment he was scouted Steven Adams shouldn‚Äôt have even been on the radar.  You are supposed to know these franchise level players skill set.  Wonder why we don‚Äôt hear about this with Memphis.  Because they were competitive and built a good team around Ja from the moment they got him.  Even their bad moves in hindsight like the Winslow trade was made in the effort to build a better team around him.  Hell even the Mavs with Luka realized that they have to build a playoff team around him immediately.  Can you imagine drafting Luka and punting on years to get extra lottery picks and build through the draft.   That almost never works ever.
"I just don't understand how he has a clearly identifiable weakness and hasn't made any improvements.      Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.      I guess if I finessed my way into a $160 million contract I'd just play COD and PUBG knowing my life is set regardless."
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It‚Äôs one of the better drafts we‚Äôve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"Because you're making so many assumptions. You literally used him dating IG models as a reflection of his work ethic. Brandon Ingram and jaylen brown careers In the first four years haven't been as good as Simmons. They can shoot better but Simmons passes, plays d, runs offense better, better handles. Simmons is a really bad shooter but pretty incredible at a lot of things. Again, I dont even like his game that much but many off your attacks just seem oddly personal and assumtious. My man, Simmons made all nba and first team defense at 23 in his third year. Lol. That's an improvement. 6 out of the last 15 number one picks never made one all star game and 8 of them never made an all nba team."
"My man, you're throwing out things like winning Rookie of the Year and all star selections as why Ben Simmons has a great work ethic. I'm using his career statistics to make a case that he is not developing as you would expect a #1 pick and someone you just gave a $200,000,000 extension too. Brandon Ingram (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/ingrabr01.html) and Jaylen Brown (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02.html) drafted 2 and 3 behind Simmons in 2016, are developing into more rounded players. Simmons is REGRESSING. In multiple categories. Like I've said 3 times so far in which you continue to ignore the main point of my argument in which you've yet to address, instead throwing things out that are meaningless to the point I'm trying to make like All Star games and Rookie of the Year (which is why I said MCW won it. I'm not comparing Simmons to MCW, I just used that example to show how it can be a meaningless award if that player doesn't continue to...develop).  In any of my comments have I said Simmons need to learn to shoot contested deep 3s at a high clip like Durant does or he needs to become the next LeBron? No. I dont expect him to because like you said, not every player is those guys.   &gt; Excelling at things at the nba level is a different beast.   Exactly. I'm stating that Simmons, regardless of his All Star appearances, isn't excelling. I'm stating that his inability to develop a jump shot is actively hurting his team. I'm stating that after 3 years of actively avoiding shooting midrange jump shots since his rookie year is hurting his team in the most high crucial time of the year because teams can pack the paint because they know he isn't a threat.   LeBron and Durant aren't LeBron and Durant because they were born and woke up as the greatest basketball players in the world. They both have worked incredibly hard to develop their games once they got in the league. LeBron is a far more deadly and efficient player in every aspect of his game than when he entered the league. KD is the same. Simmons is showing, through statistical analysis, no significant improvement year to year especially when comparing him to the players taken directly after him in the draft. It's not hyperbole."
"It's because he's on the Lakers, it's literally that simple. When Lonzo was on the Lakers, twitter would blow up after a bad game. There'd be 30k trending tweets an hour after a game. Same thing with Brandon Ingram, same thing with Danny Green, Julius Randle, same shit with Quinn Cook, Josh Hart too. literally any time a Laker did something bad they would get blown up on social media. Guys on other teams don't have 30k tweets about them every night if they put up a stinker unless they're a superstar. If you're an average roleplayer on the lakers you get as much attention as a star on a small market team."
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
"What I love is that your probably right, there must be so many inside jokes and shit that we aren‚Äôt privy to. Like, imagine how these dudes were probably crazy DM‚Äôing each other when Brandon Ingram put hands on Chris Paul."
So does Brandon Ingram have to ceremoniously fuck him up too? Or nah?

"It took Khris Middleton a few playoff runs, but finally this year he looked like a legit championship-caliber second option. My eye test on him the two previous playoff runs when Giannis won mvp he would miss crucial shot after crucial shot. This year, bucks need a bucket? Khris calmly gets to his spot, makes a move, bang hits a contested jumper. Now, Brandon Ingram I think has more potential than Khris due to just better physique, but he hasn‚Äôt even made the playoffs yet much less help carry his team to a championship. There‚Äôs absolutely no question Khris is the better player for now and for at least two more playoff runs when we can finally see what Ingram can do."
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.

"That was really only based on his physical attributes, which wasn't that farfetched. There were plenty of people calling him trash his first few years. Brandon ""Travis Outlaw"" Ingram üòÇ"
Put Brandon Ingram on the Bucks and they get worse by a lot
Brandon Ingram is my favorite player in the league so I think I can speak honestly about him here. That‚Äôs not a joke either. Ingram is not as good as Middleton right now. Middleton is a more complete player in the sense that he can get his shot off anytime he wants. Ingram can as well but he‚Äôs not as good at doing it as Middleton is. Middleton is also a much better defender and a better playmaker. Ingram can be better next season but as of today Middleton is the better player

"That‚Äôs not the fucking same lmao. We‚Äôve seen rookies struggle who end up becoming stars. I have proof from past situations. Jaylen Brown who‚Äôs on my team. Brandon Ingram, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Bam, just to name a few.   Really weird that you‚Äôre so down on a 19-20 year old kid from overseas who got drafted to dysfunctional organization during a global pandemic and surprise surprise didn‚Äôt hit the ground running."
"By the way, Zion was forced to sit that game out. So Nickeil and Brandon Ingram were the Pels' only scorers during that game. In the second half, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George took turns trying to stop NAW. Didn't happen.  Alexander-Walker is so, so, so much better than the player he's replacing (hint: now a 3&amp;D wing in Chicago)."
"&gt; This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making. Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Wiggins I get and CJ I could sort of be talked into, but are you really suggesting there‚Äôs a world where David Griffin could offer Brandon Ingram for KP straight up and the Mavs would say *no*?  We‚Äôre talking about the same KP who looks like he can barely move his knee anymore, right?"
"You have to be a nephew to think KP has no value. This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making.  Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Let's not even get into about 10 guy that have straight toxic deals like John Wall, Tobias Harris, (formerly) Kemba or Simmons.  THJ, especially on the new deal, and Kleber have more value than DFS."
"Unfortunate for them they don‚Äôt need to build for the future, they have a young superstar that literally is looking like the next coming of LeBron James. He gets to the rim at will and nothing really stops him. They have a second star player in Brandon Ingram. They thought Zion would take longer to develop and Zion is ready to make the playoffs now. Zion is literally a Luka level talent, easily has MVP potential and a sky high ceiling. Zion wants to win now and they actually would‚Äôve been better off getting George Hill from Milwaukee instead of looping in the deal for Steven Adam‚Äôs. It‚Äôs complete incompetence."
"Brandon Ingram and what? You want Brandon Ingram next to CJ? That‚Äôs not it, man lol. Dame‚Äôs age matches Embiid‚Äôs timeline. Not sure Dame matches Zion even with the inferior package they‚Äôd offer.   Remember you‚Äôd be getting Thybulle, Maxey and more back as well."
"Yeah Brandon ingram. Simple example.   Hard workers stat lines don‚Äôt look exactly the fucking same from the 1st year of his career to the 4th. Hard workers get better. Ben Simmons is what he is, and has been.   &gt;	And you have to be kidding me. You think he or his agent would leak the socialite line?  That seriously your defense? You read that report and go ‚Äúhe would never say socialite! That means it‚Äôs all fake!!‚Äù Like goddamn. Crazy idea but maybe the reproters source told him Ben Simmons wanted to be in a flashy market, or not in these two places he‚Äôs been rumored to, and Dumars was expounding upon it while talking."
"Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakim, and probably Sabonis.  You could talk me into taking him ahead of any of those last three, but there's no scenario where he's ahead of either of the first two."
"Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Jordan Clarkson would like to have a word.."
"Brandon Ingram being a ball hog shot chucker, and Eric Bledsoe still being a good defender"
Well Ben Simmons is still better than Brandon Ingram so idk about that
They haven‚Äôt accomplished as much as him. There‚Äôs a lot of recency bias that causes people to underrate him right now. Brandon Ingram has never played on a winning team. He‚Äôs a 1x all star 0x all nba. Same with brown on all star and all nba. Murray 0 of either.   Simmons isn‚Äôt anywhere close to as bad as he‚Äôs shown in the playoffs. The sixers are an awful fit for him he would be looked at a lot differently if he had a more compatible star and supporting cast to play with.
Brandon Ingram was playing well with Bron. I honestly believe he‚Äôd be good with Bron now.
"I'll actually give myself credit for this one  I nailed ""Brandon Ingram should have gone number 1""  Of course I also thought Jaylen Brown going 3 was a joke and an awful pick so...  Win some, lose some  That said the red flags were there for Simmons. Especially about that LSU team not even being bad and the academics"
I love how there have been certain posts on this sub that were so wack that they are still referenced years later. The Lebron gave Kevin Love depression and Brandon Ingram/Travis Outlaw posts are some that come to mind üòÇ
It was crazy at the time but imagine if they drafted Brandon Ingram instead.
Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
heard pascal siakam and brandon ingram are clearly better than randle. id like to see either of them elevate a team on their own the way randle did. they could be better but give me a break that it‚Äôs a clearly obvious take
"Not the best one obviously, but wouldn‚Äôt mind starting my team with   Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Jaylen Brown"
Brandon Ingram needs to start winning regular season games. He's on his way
I mean I wouldn't mind CP3 playing with Zion and Brandon Ingram.
"Coaches: Willie Green, Mike D'Antoni  Center: Jonas Valanciunas  FC: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram  BC: Devonte Graham, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  NO Bledsoe, Adams, Lonzo  Still moves to be made too... it's looking a WHOLE lot better than last year  P.S. fuck r/nba"
"Brandon Ingram is better at every single thing that involves jumpshooting from every part of the court, man. If you're talking about spotting up, Lonzo was **80%** assisted 3s. Dude can pretty much only shoot 3s from spotting up which is one of the biggest criticisms of his 3pt%: he's only good at it if other people get him open."
"&gt; after losing their beat shooter,  Brandon Ingram is still on the team, dude."
"Based on what scouts have been seeing and how he's played lately, he's looking more like Brandon Ingram rather than KD but he's still young, hopefully he does reach the potential everyone expects of him."
"Did‚Ä¶ did you just compare 21 year old Brandon Ingram to 26 year old Kyle Kuzma? Beyond that, Kuzma has no reason for Lebron to have held him back. He‚Äôs an off ball player. He should have thrived next to Lebron if he were a good player."
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
"Reminds me that the Lakers are as shitty as any other Team in drafting.  2015 #2 D'angelo Russell  2016 #2 Brandon Ingram  2017 #2 Lonzo Ball  Couldnt form a young competitive team around three successive #2 Picks.  Lebron bailed them out, so they got another timeline."
Brandon ‚ÄúTravis Outlaw‚Äù Ingram  That‚Äôs when I decided that people have Laker hater blinders on that cloud their judgement
that AD haul is looking shakey after losing lonzo. It‚Äôs brandon ingram and a bunch of late lakers firsts
"But everything else they got is worthless, they‚Äôll get MAYBE one lottery pick in 4 years and Brandon Ingram.   After all the circlejerking that was done you‚Äôd think they got prime Magic prime Bird and 5 lotto picks."
Brandon Ingram good
"Yeah, so that nullifies him talking about a player in a basketball sense who plays the same position as him. I imagine guys like Brandon Ingram and everybody else also knows worse than you pseudo analysts on twitter who come up with 2k terms every week"
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."
They essentially got late first round picks and Brandon Ingram now that Lozano and soon Hart will be gone.
Brandon Ingram is the only valuable asset. I ain't losing sleep over not having Lonzo when we have Dejounte.
Pop was spiteful and acted on emotion when he sent Kawhi to Toronto. He could of had Brandon Ingram and Lonzo.
This is when they were actually playing together.  16 in total.  Zydrunas Ilgauskas - 1  Mo Williams - 1  Shaquille O'Neal - 0  Antawn Jamison - 0  Ben Wallace - 0  Wally Szczerbiak - 0  Carlos Boozer - 0  Dwyane Wade - 4  Chris Bosh - 4  Juwon Howard - 0  Jerry Stackhouse - 0  Ray Allen - 0  Rashard Lewis - 0  Kyrie Irving - 2  Kevin Love - 2  Shawn Marion - 0  Kyle Korver - 0  Deron Williams - 0  Isaiah Thomas - 0  Derrick Rose - 0  Brandon Ingram - 0  Tyson Chandler - 0  Anthony Davis - 2  Dwight Howard - 0  Rajon Rondo - 0  Marc Gasol - 0  Andre Drummond - 0  Russell Westbrook - 0  Carmelo Anthony - 0
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, and now Alex Caruso all we‚Äôre done terribly by the Lakers who dumped them the first chance they got to get a star. They probably did Caruso the worst.   Good job ignoring 5 of the 6 players you fucked over though."
After leaving the lakers Brandon Ingram went from a 33% 3pt shooter to a 39% 3pt shooter and a 67% FT shooter to a 86% FT.
"This is horseshit man. These new players  are weak af. You have fucking Brandon Ingram. You now have Valenciounas. Lebron had Ira newbill. The Pelicans are not in a bad place: if anything, Zion isn‚Äôt good enough. Stay in shape and play 82 games before you start the cliche ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have help‚Äô. How is Memphis better than you when Ja‚Äôs co-‚Äústar‚Äù is Dillon Brooks. Dearon Fox has a rookie Haliburton.   At the end of the day Zion‚Äôs fat ass isn‚Äôt good enough. He has no voice, he wants to start acting like a star but he‚Äôs still a shy quiet kid he doesn‚Äôt even remotely know how to lead a team. And that‚Äôs fine. But you cant have it both ways. How you mad your team hasn‚Äôt arrived when YOU haven‚Äôt arrived   His ‚Äúcamp‚Äù just wants a bigger market this has nothing to do with basketball."
"The original long boi, brandon Ingram, extends 4.5 inches longer"
And Brandon Ingram.
"He was a major talent and despite that didn't show much material improvement from the time when he was 19 until he was about 25.  His biggest jump in efficiency came after his second stint in China.  Partially this had to do with off court problems.  Partially this had to do with being shuffled between playing the 3 and 4 for wildly different ball clubs.    The Heat desperately wanted Beasley to be a 3 and play face up more.  It was a tough transition for him, his ball handling wasn't up to scratch, his release is a bit slow for a 3, he had to play outside in instead of inside out.  His first step against wings was no longer considered elite.  He was faster, stronger, more skilled than every player he faced in college and he was probably faster and more skliled than most bigs in the NBA, but he would get killed on defense because of his lack of size at the 4 and his lack of lateral mobility at the 3.  When the Heat jettisoned him for Lebron, the Wolves picked him up as a 3 to play along side Kevin Love.  This would become a huge shit show.  Beasley needed good PnR partners to succeed in the modern NBA.  The Wolves had the chance to draft a lot of great point guards and blew it.  So Beasley would get isoed on the wings a bunch and he would score in bunches, but with pedestrian percentages.  After awhile wolves brass gave up on Beasley after yet another weed possession incident and sent him to Phoenix where the wheels really fell off.  The transition from college to pros was not nearly as smooth as Beasley and his camp envisioned.  You can tell he never really played a full time man to man scheme in college or high school.  He sucked at it and Miami's team defensive scheme is one of the most complicated in the league.  He wanted to stay in school and have more fun but most of his huddle wanted him to go out and earn as quickly as possible, and frankly he wasn't ready.    From Houston to New York, his career went in the right trajectory.  His shot chart changed.  He took less dribbles before he shoots, he took less mid range shots.  He knocked down his open shots in NY and had a respectable 52/39.5/78 in NYC.  He also took very difficult shots near the rim and made more than his fair share.  He had some good tutelage about help D with Milwaukee, mostly under the mentorship of Greg Foster and co, then he went to the Knicks where he had to play man to man under Jeff Hornacek's schemes, and this time the lessons seemed to stick.  Beasley had a bad bad year with the Lakers.  If you look at the roster you would see that between Brandon Ingram, Lance Stephenson, Hart, Lebron, Kuzma and Svi all played the 3/4 spots and Lakers brass was trying to show case Ingram, Kuzma and Hart to get AD.  By then between a clearly ill defined role and his mom dying from cancer, his percentages dropped way off.  In order for Beasley to have a job in the NBA, he must be one of the top 30 scorers in the league.  He wasn't that in the Lakers and the rest of the league went to look elsewhere for microwaves.  He had a rumor with Detroit, another try out with the Nets but he came down with covid at the bubble.  And after that the teams quit calling for awhile until Portland signed him to a summer league deal."
why in the FUCK would you trade Brandon Ingram for simmons who can't even freaking shoot?
"Again, Jrue requested a trade *because he knew the Pelicans were on a different schedule*. They literally did the Jrue thing perfectly; they traded away an older vet for a shit-tonne of picks to help them rebuild. They didn't end up keeping Lonzo, but they still got Brandon Ingram - who is a great match with Zion and they have been developing alongside him - and a shit load of picks *for the rebuild*.  &gt; and other assets are shipped out just to get rid of the self inflicted Steven Adams extension.  Oh, that horrible trade that cost them... One first rounder, and moving down 7 places, in exchange for ditching Bledsoe (who had to be attached to the haul of Bucks' picks) and getting a centre that fits them better? Extending Adams was dumb, but is this that shipping out of assets that appears so far to have actually been a good trade?  We're literally coming off the back of a championship won by a guy drafted into a small market who the media told to leave over and over. We literally had five years of Jason Kidd head coach like decisions way worse than not expecting your young guy to get a $85 million contract from another team and matching the offer not being within the plans for the cap-space.  The stuff about Zion forcing his way out is just complete hysteria that completely contradicts the cycle of NBA teams between contending and rebuilding."
"He has a better roster than he had last year and he has an All-Star teammate in Brandon Ingram, it has nothing to do with him ""dragging"" anyone anywhere and much more to do with if he's going to come into the season in-shape and ready to play defense"
sign and trade dennis for Brandon Ingram next lol
And then at age 25 Zion can have Brandon Ingram on a Supermax and a bunch of bad players on huge contracts on his team
"always thought he had that Brandon Ingram look but after watching this, mans is definitely a stoner üòÇ"

Jaden McDaniels bout to be Brandon Ingram next season
"We did get Keldon, but that's it really.   I'd have rather not had DeMar and or Poetl these last two years than had them honestly. DeMar is the reason why we were halfway competitive.   We could've had Brandon Ingram. Simple as that."
"What I think most folks don‚Äôt completely understand yet is the importance of what the team does after drafting such guys.  The Lakers and their batch of young guys in the last few years are an excellent example.  The following guys were all on the Lakers roster: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball  The Lakers, when they had them, weren‚Äôt really about player development. So these guys faltered and were considered bench/role players at best. Now they‚Äôre all bonafide starters in the league.  The Spurs spent years developing Kawhi into the beast he is. Raptors have slowly but surely developed the non-lottery likes of OG, VanVleet, Siakam. Denver got an injured Michael Porter Jr falling to them, and, that‚Äôs a multiple time All-Star in the making.  Some teams are just better at player development than others. So yea, Jokic‚Äôs amazing in Denver, but had he been drafted by the Kings or Detroit, maybe he‚Äôd never have reached this point.  All this to say, the Kings suck, and should be relocated to Seattle. Thanks for reading."
Dates article but I always think of this whenever I'm reminded of Ingram's time in LA  https://everythreeweekly.com/2018/03/lakers-continue-to-lead-nba-in-points-scored-by-brandon-ingram/
"&gt;Ingram was going to be a good player and I think everyone saw that his rookie season.   Might've just been trolling, but either 2018 or 2019 summer I saw a post here saying that Thon Maker was better than Brandon Ingram and it had way more upvotes than I was expecting. I'm still salty about that."
"We know how this goes. Same people tried to tell us Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram were garbage and the moment they left it was a mistake. Only Ingram really makes me sad about being gone"
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
"That's what should happen, that's the end goal of this acquisition period but the market's thin right now. LaVine's contract is too short, KAT seems content, Zion is impossible. The only two guys who could make sense would be Brandon Ingram and Ben Simmons but those are hard deals to swing."
"Trezz: Cool, i'll take someone who can give me easy buckets during the regular season so that LeBron and AD don't have to average 30 ppg against scrub teams. Can Westbrook average 15 ppg on low usage without shooting 9% below league average? The answer is no.  Kuzma: Bad player, but again, relatively low usage on offense and defensively he did ok against non-elite offensive wings. He was exactly as good as you'd expect a low draft level pick with low usage on a small contract to be... Maybe even better than expected. For some reason, Lakers stans wanted him to be Brandon Ingram or something...  KCP: Exactly the type of player to surround LeBron and AD with. Low usage guy that's a very capable 3&amp;D player but also has some value in transition.   Westbrook: Trash.  This isn't even debatable..."

Brandon Ingram.
Simmons for Brandon Ingram.  NOLA makes a run at Beal.
"What type of player could such a package get? Let's assume it's Sexton + Garland + Okoro + Nance + Windler + 3 FRPs.   I think Brandon Ingram would be gettable for that, for example. Maybe Bam."
Brandon Ingram best weed in town.
"The Lakers should not have drafted Buddy Hield instead of Brandon Ingram.  Drafting Brandon Ingram is fine, he is 19, he‚Äôs a project.  Brandon Ingram is younger than at least one player being drafted this year."
Brandon Ingram would become great. I still remember this sub calling him a bust and making fun of him for having a horrible rookie season.
He‚Äôs older than Brandon Ingram
Lillard needs Brandon Ingram I swear that is the answer.
Brandon Ingram
2018 Lonzo Ball  2018 Brandon Ingram  2018 Kyle Kuzma  2018 Josh Hart  Whatever year Ryan Hollins
"SGA isn‚Äôt a first option either and JRUE GETS BUCKETS. If you wanna say he‚Äôs the first option for OKC ok Jrue would be too. Who else is shooting on that team. He‚Äôs been that guy look up his stats in New Orleans. Was the second option after AD and got to the second round of the playoffs with a dog shit roster. Regular season and playoffs he steps up when he needs to. Only reason AD stayed in New Orleans is cause of jrue. Only thing SGA does better than jrue is playmake. Jrue is proven. You think they let bums shoot 15-20 times a game? On top of that SGA and Ingram, two of my favorite young players, do not bring it defensively. Brandon is High side of average and sga is low side of average on that end‚Ä¶. They get more shots on test teams. They MIGHT BE BETTER later on. But not right now."
"Brandon Ingram for Hield, Bagley, and the 9th?"
We will take Brandon Ingram or a first pack thank you.
Is Brandon Ingram hounding Chris Paul and Devin Booker over screens? No bro. Jrue was definitely the best player on the Pelicans. 100%. He‚Äôs not gonna get in the young guys way. And he guarded the best guards in the world so he had some dead legs‚Ä¶. But no way
"Most of the answers in this thread are multi-time ALL NBA players who likely would already be in the top 15 likeliest players to win MVP coming into the year. (PG13, Embiid, etc)  Guys like Trae, Tatum, Booker, Lavine, Beal, etc are all good answers as they have proven to be elite players, but they arent too exciting as ""dark horse"" candidates.  I think guys like LaMelo Ball who are in that next tier down (at least coming into the year) are more fun to take a guess at.   If i was spitballing some ideas of high quality players that could thrive with experience or with a new team situation that make for good 'dark horse' options:   **LaMelo Ball**   - CHA could finish a top 4 seed in theory. LaMelo is a great talent and likely has voters attention off of RoY campaign  **Pascal Siakam**   - could be the leader of a team that makes solid playoff spot. Good mix of counting stats   **Brandon Ingram**   - if hes in the mix its likely because of Zion being an MVP himself, but if they elevate NOP to a high seed and BI elevates his game he could be worth keeping an eye on  **Ja Morant**/**Jaren Jackson**   - Memphis has been an exciting team and can fight for higher seed. Both players are great young talents. JJJ could sneak in if he has great block numbers to go with his scoring"
"The expectations really aren't the problem, it's the fact that his role constantly keeps changing:  * His rookie year the Lakers had Brook Lopez, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr, and Brandon Ingram in the front court, so they asked Kuzma to fill in mostly as a backup 3, with a little 4.  * His second year they only had Javale at center, no longer had Randle or Nance and now had LeBron to go with Ingram, so Kuzma was asked to mostly play 4 with some backup 5.  * His third year the Lakers had Dwight and Javale at center, AD at center and PF and LeBron at SF, so Kuzma was in a vastly reduced role trying to fill in wherever he could, even sometimes at 2.  * It would have been more of the same this year, just with Gasol, Drummond and Trez at center, but LeBron and AD were hurt, and the Lakers had Markieff Morris and Wesley Matthews as well, so Kuzma's role again was all over the place.  I think if Kuzma was on a team where he could play more consistent 3/4 minutes (where he wasn't backing up All NBA guys at those positions), then he'd really blossom. I honestly don't think the spotlight or expectations bother him, I just think it has to be tough to know what the team needs him to do when whatever that role is is constantly changing."
"Khris Middleton, Paul George, Brandon Ingram  The reason being they all kind of remind of Tracy McGrady (or players like Tmac), big SG/SF‚Äôs who can shoot over people, pull up from almost anywhere or get to the mid range for a fadeaway bucket. Overall I just enjoy watching ‚Äúbig guards‚Äù that have smooth game, but that‚Äôs just one of the many aesthetics you‚Äôll get to enjoy from the NBA!"

"Jakob Poetle as the best player on the Spurs isn't even as crazy as having him, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray all above Brandon Ingram. Also Kawhi's comp this year is Paul George from last year, and the 40M less valuable PG's comp this year is Larry Bird from 89... that doesnt make any sense to me.   But hey Nate's a total math nerd so I will just accept this highly intellectual and math based prediction of the future, the best thing about math is the numbers are numbers, they cant lie."
That‚Äôs Brandon Ingram
"Put it this way, if Beal or Lillard suddenly want out, what's the superior trade package to Ben Simmons? Jaylen Brown maybe? Brandon Ingram if the Pelicans suddenly want to move the timeline up? Everything that GSW or Knicks have left? Honestly I think the 76ers can realistically assume they would be in the driver seat in those scenarios, still."
"The 76ers are getting rid of Ben for a good reason, what is not reasonable is the package of picks and players in exchange for Ben. Like you‚Äôre not going to keep him around especially after the Embiid and Doc said what they said after the playoffs. Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram straight up is a fair deal IMO."
New Orleans and Brandon Ingram?
"&gt;Look at the Harden trade - Rockets didn't get anyone back to build around.  2 things wrong with this  1. Rockets gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks to the Thunder in the Westbrook trade so that is why they had took the Nets deal which replenished. Portland has all their draft picks except 2022 which is lottery protected until 2028 so they dont need a pick centered package 2. Everyone litterally says that the Harden trade was awful and the Rockets made a mistake lol  Portland can get back a bunch of picks if they trade all of CJ,Nurkic,Powell,Covington and Nance but from a Damian Lillard trade they need a star they can build around like Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown"
"I remember KD was so hyped and like you said, teams were (and still are to a large extent) really focused on the dominant big man archetype. That lead to a huge boost for Greg Oden, who in his defense, was really dominant in college. It‚Äôs crazy to think that Embiid has also had some terrible lower body injuries and Oden and Embiid‚Äôs bodies just recovered so differently. Oden‚Äôs athleticism was completely sapped from all his injuries. Embiid somehow has staved off that kind athletic decline.  To your point, as dominant a scorer as KD was in college and even though it was thought he could maintain that in the pros, it seemed like scouts were looking for holes for him. Famously, he was unable to rep 185 lbs at the combine even once (compared to the 225 that NFL players are asked to rep at the NFL combine) and that was seen as a possible red flag that he may not be as dominant on the drive or in the post as he clearly is. If you look at other skinny players coming in to the NBA, it is always interesting to see how their bodies evolve. I always think Alonzo Mourning was a huge example of that. Dwight was really thin growing up and he‚Äôs talked about that a lot. More recently, Brandon Ingram is still trying to beef up a bit so he can drive more consistently. That said, KD definitely put on a lot of muscle in his years. Yao was also famously weak and then became really strong over the years. That kind of thing can really distract folks in the drafting process."
How does Memphis even come close to winning a Brandon Ingram sweepstakes?
from most likely to least:  1. Philly ships out Simmons to Houston for a John Wall package   2. Towns becomes disgruntled ‚Äî Warriors swoop in with a trade package   3. Memphis lands Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram
"TIL Brandon Ingram, the all star and MIP player is a ""scrub"".   TIL that Lonzo ball is a scrub for getting an $85 million contract  You're delusional."
Brandon Ingram is a star. Just in a bad market.
Brandon Ingram seems like he has all the skills to be a superstar.
Brandon Ingram.    He's going into his 6th season and he's only 23.  I see him take a tremendous leap this upcoming season.
"Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Lowry, CP3, in that order. Though I don't think the gulf between Lowry and CP3 is as huge as some others make it out to be.  Also Chris Boucher, Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant.  Also Cade Cunningham, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic."

"You're going to see more future All-Stars than ever before with a negative win shares during their rookie seasons. De'Aaron Fox and Brandon Ingram both had negative win shares during their rookie year but both turned out to be All-Star performers. Yeah, Fox hasn't made an All-Star team yet but he's due. Most highly  touted prospects these days only play one year of college ball. Back then, these type of prospects were in college for like 2-3 years, so they are more NBA-ready with them improving on their games before they get into the NBA."
where tf r Zion and Brandon Ingram
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year‚Ä¶ Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year‚Ä¶ why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
You weirdos tried telling me Brandon Ingram was gonna cap out at Travis outlaw.
Shorter more uncoordinated Brandon Ingram
"Exactly, we have Brandon Ingram locked into a max deal. Zion is a max player. We have the flexibility to trade for a third star in the future. That‚Äôs how we have to land a third star because they won‚Äôt be coming to us in FA"
"Smh, I said free agents not All Star free agents. It's also incredibly short sighted to think that a team with two All Stars already in Zion and Brandon Ingram can not be seen as an attractive situation for some guys. This team is not nearly as helpless as most of you nephews seem to think."
"Who would you pick to fit next to Zion?  Maybe a wing that can space the floor, play off ball, and run the pick and roll? Maybe one that can iso out of a sticky situation if Zion gets walled at the rim? Maybe one that can pass well to Zion too?  Oh shit I just described Brandon Ingram"
"slimmer than Brandon Ingram.  &amp;#x200B;  But I would like to see the chaos if he does decide to say ""fuck it"" and go for it"
"Calling that Brandon Ingram would be an all-star one day partway through his rookie season, when r/nba thought he was ""objectively the worst player in the league"" (because VORP lol) and was the next Travis Outlaw"
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
"\- How in Garland 17th?  \- No MPJ? You must be banking on injury.  \- No Murray,  Ayton, Collins, or Brandon Ingram?  \- Fox over Trae is pretty bold  \- Banchero over Jokic is absurdly bold. Jokic is a 26 year old MVP whose game doesn't require athleticism."

Brandon Ingram
People have been talking about Brandon Ingram like he's one upcoming leap away from being Durant-lite but I don't think he has it in him.
"lol really?  As a starter in the front court he‚Äôs not popular than  Lebron, AD, and PG.  As a reserve he‚Äôs not getting a forward spot over Jokic, Rudy, and Zion.  He‚Äôs not eligible at guard which I‚Äôm assuming is penciled in for Steph,Luka, Dame, and Chris Paul (?).   Which means (barring injuries) he‚Äôs competing for one of two spots with Russell Westbrook, Devin Booker, Ja Morant, Mitchell, Brandon Ingram, Fox, CJ, KAT, and  Draymond"
"This is an interesting post, but I think going back 20 years is a BIT too far since the criteria in the 2000s was entirely different than the criteria in the 2010s. In the 2000s, the award generally favored guys that were drafted mid-late first round or in the 2nd round. Basically they were given to guys who weren't really expected to be good coming into the league but ended up breaking out. Players like Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, Boris Diaw, etc all fit that bold - guys who were drafted outside of the lottery who had an amazing season for their standards.   If we're looking at the past 10 seasons, every winner for the award was either a first time all star/all NBA or played a very key role on a playoff team. The only winners that didn't make an all star team/all NBA the team were Ryan Anderson, CJ and Pascal Siakam.   Ryan Anderson was a typical 2000s MIP, 21st pick who reached a career high in scoring (at that time) and played a critical role in his team's success. However, if we were to pick the award based on today's criteria I'd wager that Andrew Bynum most likely would've gotten the nod over him. CJ despite being a lottery pick increased his PPG from 6 to 20, and Siakam went from a stiff to a 2nd option on a championship level team despite not making an all star team that year.   If I'm a betting man looking at next year's potential winner based on the pattern for the past decade, it's going to be someone that either makes their first all star/all NBA team or someone that plays a huge role on a playoff level team whose numbers improved tremendously.   Zion/Zach - I'm going to write these guys off because they're already too good, and have already made an all star team. I don't think we've ever had an all star level player get the MIP even if they made a jump to a MVP worthy season. Steph Curry didn't get it, Derrick Rose didn't get it, I don't see the case for Zion or Zach Lavine.   Shai - He's already putting up 24/5/6 on great efficiency, basically numbers that Brandon Ingram put up when he won it. He can obviously get better, but how much better can he even get at this point to get MIP? The opportunity is there, but it just feels so unlikely that he improves SO much from last season that he wins it IMO.   MPJ - Probably has the best odds to make it IMO. He has the talent and most importantly the opportunity with Jamal Murray out for most of the season. If he can take on more of the scoring load and put up around 25PPG on similar efficiency &amp; improve his defense while making the all star/all NBA team the award is as good as his.   I'm not going to bet on any of the sophomores, because historically you need to see a HUGE improvement to win MIP as a sophomore. Improvements from lottery picks like Edwards/Williams would be expected, and Bane would have to average 20PPG which I don't see happening given his role.   Guys like JJJ/Garland/other top 5 picks would really have to get their first all star selection in order to be in the conversation for MIP. I just don't really see it for those guys right now. Injuries aside, I just don't see JJJ make the all star team this upcoming season over Ja, and I DEFINITELY don't see the Grizzlies have more than one all star player.   I really like OG at those odds, he just fits the criteria the NBA is looking for in their MIPs IMO. The only things he really needs to be a good offensive player at this point are tighter handles which he has reportedly been working on all summer. It's really hard to judge the Raptors right now because their season in Tampa was so unorthodox, nobody knows how much playing away from Toronto has affected their player. If the Raptors look good before all star break and OG is putting up 20PPG + great defense, he could very well sneak into an all star game and end the season on an all defense team. +5000 odds I feel like this is a no brainer.  In regards to NAW, I love NAW but I just don't see opportunity for him to take a huge leap like that. The Pelicans already have two stars in Zion &amp; Ingram, how many minutes/shots are realistically going to be available for NAW? I guess not having Bledsoe/Lonzo on the team anymore helps his case, but we also have to consider that they also brought in JV who's going to command a LOT more touches than Adams. I feel like the minutes might be there, but the opportunity might not necessarily be there. But then again, his PER 36 stats do look good so at +3000 it's still pretty good.   Anyways, my picks for MIP so far is probably MPJ/OG/NAW."
"Brandon Ingram might have a peak year, like suddenly getting a lot of hype but fall off to being pretty good again in 22-23"
Brandon Ingram = Karl Willets confirmed as well.
I mean depending on the age of the person yes it would be. Brandon Ingram is 24. Jay-Z's first album is 25 years ago. *Appetite For Destruction* by Guns N' Roses was released the same year I was born and would have been considered old school when I was 24. *Master of Puppets* by Metallica was released a year before I was born.

"The Plumlees always seemed 8ft tall on the dance floor at Shooters.  Once saw Mason walking a tiny dog around our apartment complex and the size difference was hilarious.  Also once saw Marshall about 90 minutes before an afternoon tip-off eating a burrito in the Bryan Center.  It was his redshirt season, but he probably was supposed to be over at Cameron by then lol  Quinn Cook wasn‚Äôt huge but was the coolest guy, folks would come and dap him up or chat for a minute, and he just chilled in his booth at Shooters, holding court, giving time to everyone.  Brandon Ingram was impossibly tall + skinny."

"None of Bill's opinions are based on evidence or rational analysis. Everything is based on how he ""feels"" as a sports fan watching some player or some team, which can be a good change of pace but it definitely doesn't make him the ""only legit voice in NBA media."" He will draw connections or comparisons between two or more unrelated events because the association just popped into his mind, not because he actually thought about it and concluded that it makes sense. The narratives that he comes up with are rarely based on anything more than his feelings. I will end with two of his brilliant opinions to demonstrate my point:  * When Christian McCaffrey got hurt, Bill said, ""could this be a case of the Ewing Theory?""  * A few weeks ago he said, ""I don't know if Zion and Brandon Ingram can fit because they play the same position. The Pelicans should trade Brandon Ingram for  Ben Simmons."""

"Umm of his draft classmates, I'd take jaylen brown before him. There are arguments for siakam and Brandon Ingram as well"
"The Suns have no resources to get anyone at Ayton's level, and Ayton has no real leverage to leave the Suns, so a ""list"" of players that the Suns could replace Ayton with is irrelevant to anything.  If you want to do that exercise, it's more like ""Ayton + replacement SF"" v. ""replacement C + Bridges,"" because the team must use the same resources to fill all the positions on the roster.  Just saying that someone is a top 10 center doesn't say much; Jokic is a top 10 center, too, but he's clearly worth much more than Ayton (just like Durant is worth much more than Brandon Ingram).  Ayton is closer to players like Capella/Vucevic/Wood than Jokic/Embiid/AD (to the extent he's a center)/Gobert/KAT.    Imagine what Ayton, a traditional center (albeit with nice perimeter defense mobility), could do?  Why, though?  Is that how Phoenix is going to win in the playoffs?  Not really.  And Ayton's post game is not exactly an Al Jefferson barrage of post moves.  He's an elite play finisher, but he's not a playmaker.  The value of traditional centers has probably never been lower.  Ayton's issue is his archetype, not his talent."
"you speak like a middle schooler but besides that it‚Äôs not like they got Brandon Ingram next to him, a fresh dependable coach, and flexibility going forward. you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong but okay. And yes NAW is going to step up huge. JV provides spacing and offensive capability unlike Steven Adams. Trey Murphy is a ready shooter. Graham is replacing the spacing Zo gave.

"&gt; People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   You're apparently one of those people, pretending like this argument existed. This is such over the top hyperbole that I again feel like you're just doing satire here.   What happens is Laker fans get excited about their young players, just like fans of any team do with their young players (like you're doing with this post after one preseason game üòÇ), but the Lakers have so many haters that the pushback is overwhelming. As a result every young Laker just ends up getting memed to death, and dumb shit like ""Kuzma is better than Tatum"" which one idiot probably said once years ago becomes the narrative that all the haters cling to and run with as their justification for saying ""he's *sooo* overrated!"" and constantly trashing him.   But then literally the second these players are no longer on the Lakers, people stop just blindly hating on them due to being a Laker and realize ""hey, this player is actually pretty good, I think they've been underrated!"" when in truth the only people who were underrating him were the people who've spent his whole tenure with the Lakers mocking him endlessly just cause he was on the Lakers.   This exact same thing happened with D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram and now Kuzma. The prevailing consensus among all non Laker fans was these guys were overrated trash when they were still on the Lakers. It's just funny for Laker fans to see this happen over and over, where as soon as they take off that Laker uniform then suddenly everyone else is like ""this guy is really good, the Lakers fucked up by letting them go."" This shit is like clockwork üòÇ"
"Both are 24 years old, but Brandon Ingram (2016 draft) is 3 months younger than Chris Duarte (2021 draft)."
Brandon Ingram
Oh yeah definitely I‚Äôm 100% sure he‚Äôs not gonna be that lanky his entire career. Once he gets to the league he‚Äôll get a training regiment. Even a player like Brandon Ingram has bulked up a lot and he‚Äôs nothing but skin and bones at Duke
I just don‚Äôt see it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶ seems more like a Brandon Ingram type of player to me tbh
LeBron and Lonzo don't mesh well. The 6'9 Ellen Degeneres sucks and Brandon Ingram.
" &gt;Brandon Ingram, went from all star to a pretty lack luster season, need to see if he‚Äôs truly going to be a long term piece to work next to Zion and make a contender.   BI had essentially the same exact stats he did when he was an all star. I just think his play looked lack luster next to zion."
Brandon ingram
"Porzingis. Needs to show he can have an all star season again.   Kemba. I want him so badly to show he‚Äôs still a star.   Brandon Ingram, went from all star to a pretty lack luster season, need to see if he‚Äôs truly going to be a long term piece to work next to Zion and make a contender.  And I don‚Äôt know if this fits with the theme but Klay Thompson. It‚Äôs been 2 years and I really think everyone just wants to see him succeed."
How has the ‚Äúnext Kevin Durant‚Äù Brandon Ingram experiment gone so far?
"Like I mentioned in another comment, his body type doesn't look like it will be conducive to adding enough to be able to absorb much contact when driving. Brandon Ingram was the example I used, he's 4 years in and still is only 6lbs heavier. Him being the size he is doesn't help here because his center of gravity will be easier to throw off given he's so frail."
"Bench pressing a certain number or being hulking isn't the issue, it's being able to finish when he drives or not being knocked off balance, etc. Brandon Ingram had major issues with that his first year or so with us because he was extremely thin, just like Chet. Everyone pointed to KD being wiry strong and Giannis putting on muscle, but Ingram wasn't that at all. He's been in the league 4 years and is only listed 6lbs heavier than he was at Duke."
I never did. And Kuz wasn‚Äôt a point. He‚Äôs just a forward.  Edit: I did say that about Brandon Ingram though.
"Did he though? The key take-away here to me is that Chauncey Billups would take Brandon Ingram over Ben Simmons. At the moment, Simmons has 3 all-star appearances over Ingram's 1, has won 3 playoff series to Ingram's 0, better defensive rating, assists, rebounding, bpm, etc.  Besides shooting and the present rodeo clown show, Ben Simmons is the more impactful player so far and it's a coach's job to work with the GM / Front Office to evaluate talent and this clip mostly demonstrates a poor job of that. He'd make an interesting color commentator or TV personality for sure though."
The only other person even kinda in the discussion for #1 that year was Brandon Ingram. Ben was a consensus pick.
"""Brandon Ingram ... he's gonna grow into his body."" Nope."
Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
The last two winners were Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. They were both drafted and played for the Lakers.  That means there are two candidates that can potentially win next year. They are both on new teams with roles that are a better for for them and could be ready to take a leap.  Lonzo Ball - Chicago Bulls  Kyle Kuzma - Washington Wizards  Jokes aside I think they are very solid possibilities and have shown flashes of legitimate potential. I‚Äôm excited to see how they do.
"Let‚Äôs say instead, Philly drafted the player that was immediately picked after their pick. Would this be a better team? Ben McLemore Steven Adams Aaron Gordon Zach Lavine Kristaps Porzingis Brandon Ingram London Ball"
Could be related to the fact that Marc Gasol just wore #14 for the Lakers... And before him Danny Green... And before him Brandon Ingram.   Interesting how this may be the first year in the last 5 or so that they don't have a #14 on the roster haha
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
He's gonna make fat harden look like brandon Ingram
Will Kuz be like a Brandon Ingram type scenario?
Really bad player comparisons don't go away and it's annoying. Someone out there is probably comparing Julius Randle to Zach Randolph right now. Or Brandon Ingram to KD. People were calling Schroder the German Rondo when he was drafted. Even the so-called experts will regurgitate this stuff.
20-24 ppg / 8 rebounds is his floor without any on-ball improvement. That's easily a tradeable contract especially given the number of players who sign a 5-year rookie max extension and then want out to a contender. I could totally see us sending him away with picks in a Brandon Ingram/Lonzo type package for a star in the future. Unless he gets injured (and that's a big if) this is a pretty tradeable contract in the future.
Him or Brandon Ingram i agree. Personally I'd like to see how B.I. would pair up with Embiid.

Brandon Ingram over Buddy Hield in the best 5 from 2016
Can anyone explain to me why Brandon Ingram is an honorable mention and not higher on the list?
Brandon Ingram could be a top 15-10 player
"How did OG just miss the cut, but Brandon Ingram is just an honorable mention?"
"&gt;*all ingram does is score, and in a league where there are an abundance of scorers, ingram does little to stand out. ingram isn't a championship level player, simmons is*  Man people have turned on Brandon Ingram...  He's a three-level scorer who can also playmake pretty well!!!!!!!  You could argue he does a lot of things most stars in the NBA do, while being less good at defense which is also common in the NBA now.  Many stars in the NBA aren't great on defense, but you wouldn't say Dame, Luka, Jokic, and Trae could *never* be championship-level players?"
"Pelicans have won the last three championships, but does Brandon Ingram getting more than 15 ppg point towards Zion being disgruntled with the way things are going?"
Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram
A trade involving Brandon Ingram... I think New Orleans should try Zion and Simmons together
It‚Äôs actually quite shameful how Brandon Ingram isn‚Äôt at least 220 pounds yet. That‚Äôs someone that‚Äôs not dedicated to full improvement.
Morey now offering Simmons to the Pels for Zion plus Brandon Ingram plus 2 unprotected 1sts.
Back in the Bubble Zion weighed considerably more than one hundred pounds more than Brandon Ingram.
Brandon Ingram is the perfect weight at that height...for a girl.
Kyle Lowry weighs more Brandon Ingram despite being 8 inches shorter
Well the players were germinating because they're young players.   Brandon Ingram learned how to facilitate and be playmaker at a NBA level under the lakers. It took years for him to knock down shots because he had a skinny body. In his last year under the lakers he was coming along as a scorer and a defender before the pelicans screwed up his defense.  Randle developed to be a point forward under Luke Walton and got a taste at it. He got a few triple doubles and Luke Walton cut down his minutes because they were trying to trade Nance. At the end they let Randle go to make cap space.   I can go on about the others but I wont. They weren't seeds. They were germinating once they left.
Brandon Ingram
Brandon Ingram was about it lol
It‚Äôs wild how quick it happened. Then on the flip side there‚Äôs guys like Brandon Ingram and Aaron Gordon who simply have been early 20s for decades now

"Do you think Brandon Ingram shoulda won it?  I personally think Bridges should get it if he keeps this up but if Ja finishes at 25 ppg, that‚Äôs a +7 increase and more than worthy of MIP"
Free Brandon Ingram!
Brandon ingram kinda
"My dream is to package him, Love (for salary match) and picks for Brandon Ingram.  Grland/Okoro/Ingram/Mobley/Allen lineup would be a dream."
pelicans gotta be the easiest. zion being out is already enough. but as of right now we have brandon ingram out and herb jones out who's our best defender. without these three guys we're a junior varsity team lead by jonas
I come from 2026 and it's Brandon Ingram
Have you seen Brandon Ingram lately? Dude looks like he might have trouble lifting the gold standard protein jar
"Some of our fans think he has superstar upside because he dropped 30 in a fucking preseason game lol. Caruso has an *actual* NBA thirty piece and as much as I love him he isn't exactly a scoring machine.  I see THT's upside as a shorter, worse-shooting Brandon Ingram."
Y'all really acting like mild mannered Brandon Ingram didn't swing on guys not 3-4 years ago.   Everyone has a limit.
If they had to trade kyrie the only player that'll soften the blow for me is Brandon ingram cuz I always loved the mf for some reason but it'll neva happen
Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram.
Brandon Ingram would fit this team perfectly
Well that's misleading. They're also without Brandon Ingram. Who almost beat your team on national TV recently
lebron had a 49% true shooting as a rookie. rookies will have bad numbers. Brandon ingram was historically bad as a rookie. There are countless examples of guys who sucked and improved efficiency wise. its usually more about seeing guys develop parts of their game they can sustain.

Simmons for Brandon Ingram. Get it done.
He‚Äôs not wrong. Pop literally took derozan and Poetl instead of Brandon Ingram who and picks lmao
"I love when a guy like Duarte comes to in the league. ""Yeah, I'm a rookie with a clean, refined game. I'm also a few months older than six year vet Brandon Ingram, what of it?"""
"Bruh...  Brandon ""bring me that zip"" Ingram"
"Not really. Other than Ja, and that one great year from Dipo, the last 10 years of second picks have been about 50% bust and 50% good but not great.   2020 James Wiseman  2019 Ja Morant  2018 Marvin Bagley  2017 Lonzo Ball  2016 Brandon Ingram  2015 D‚ÄôAngelo Russell  2014 Jabari Parker  2013 Victor Oladipo  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2011 Derrick Williams  2010 Evan Turner"
It's getting to the point where I think Brandon Ingram could fit inside Zion and wear him like the Hulkbuster suit
I love Brandon Ingram as well - but you're right about the rest.
"Herro ain‚Äôt KD. Brandon Ingram wasn‚Äôt KD despite being the same height as Bates with a favorable wingspan. Bates will be fine, I just think the KD comparison needs to be retired."
"I actually was really upset when Dan Gilbert let him go.  I thought David Griffin was a great piece for the Cavs, really valuable.  His time in New Orleans has been fulllllll of head scratchers though.  I feel like I‚Äôve never seen someone struggle with a #1 pick so much.  I was really excited for that team when I saw they were gonna draft Zion and trade Anthony Davis.  I thought Lonzo had a real opportunity to show his value and Brandon Ingram would get a chance to prove himself.  This was the core result to strive for right, these are your key pieces for the future.  I don‚Äôt really know that I‚Äôm happy about what‚Äôs going on with any of these guys AND he hired Stan Van Gundy too?"
"What about Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and 3 firsts? You'd think that's better than a single player, right?"
"I wouldn't consider Westbrook to be a superstar at this stage of his career.   I think the better comparison is Anthony Davis. The Lakers gave up Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first round picks.  Then promptly won a title."
Smoothies are literally why Giannis and Brandon ingram are all stars
"If Zion isn't able to play this year or he comes back and plays like absolute shit, I would probably trade him for players and picks and build around Brandon Ingram"
Don't forget Brandon Ingram
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I‚Äôm not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It‚Äôa a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he‚Äôs been with the Hornets he‚Äôs drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte‚Äô Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"Brandon Ingram. Decision making. He doesn‚Äôt see the open guy often enough, he doesn‚Äôt attack certain mismatches and coasts way to much for minutes at a time considering his age. Once he gets better at the mental aspect of the game I think he can reach MVP considerations level."
I have been impressed with Dillon Brooks defense while his shooting is inefficient I value him pretty high.  I have been pretty unimpressed with Brandon Ingram pretty much every time I watch him play. Lots of mediocre iso possessions and bad team play.  Now I haven't watched a ton of either player so I can't give any strong opinions on them but that's how I see those two.
You think Dillon Brooks is better than JV and Brandon Ingram?
Dude. Chris Duarte is older than Brandon fucking Ingram
"for the ones saying pelicans:   we might be in the worst position, but we definitely don't have the least optimism. our team just played their ass off last night without brandon ingram and zion. i'll wait to see this team fully healthy before i can judge. there's plenty of optimism going around after last night especially around herb jones and jv."
"Pelicans. Zion is ruining himself, even if he does get himself together, he is likely to leave. Yeah, they have Brandon Ingram but is he a player you can build around to make the playoffs? David Griffin is a joke and so is the ownership."
"""NOLA has good food""  me: *stares* at Brandon Ingram"
"I agree with this, we have yet to see him be doubled as much as the top guys, he's not there yet. Guys like Dame and Harden get doubled at half court while Steph has to do cardio off-ball just to free himself up.  Right now, SGA is definitely seeing some more attention this year so he has to prove himself. To me, he can be Harden-lite (he's already one of the leaders in isos per game this year and drives per game last year) in a sense that Brandon Ingram is KD-lite or Trae being Steph-lite"
I legitimately thought Kevin Knox would be better than Brandon Ingram so there you go

Brandon Ingram could easily be a 3rd option on a title team.

there are like 20 teams with worse #2 options than Brandon Ingram

CJ McCollum? Brandon Ingram?
"I‚Äôm not that biased, they traded for a worse version of Jason Richardson. It was mind boggling at the time!   How good is Brandon Ingram right now? You wouldn‚Äôt think itd be stupid if Luka Doncic was traded for Ingram and Steven Adams right now? Ingram is arguably better than Eric Gordon right now too"
Brandon Ingram isn't as old as Buddy yet.
Steven Adams is the fucking man. So is Brandon Ingram
How bout Brandon Ingram being 14 lol.
"Outside of the players you mentioned, I think Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, John Collins and Brandon Ingram would play. Myles Tuner or James Wiseman would be solid if USA needed more depth at Center."
Same thing happened with kawhi but these people want to axt like everybody was in on it so to criticize is hypocrisy. Meanwhile circa 2017 if you mentioned Harden being just as good as curry(historic offense first guard)  you were laughed out at downvoted or made into a meme.  Salt has built up and its flowing now.  Same thing we Hawks fans and and fans of Brandon Ingram have had to go through.
"Brandon Ingram, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson and Jaylen Brown have all started the season playing well"
Brandon Ingram is basically KD without the stigma
Yeah the pick got ripped by smarter people at the time it's just been 5 years can be hard to remember. [The consensus take was Jamal Murray&gt;Buddy Hield](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2016/6/23/12016970/nba-draft-2016-mock-draft-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-kris-dunn-jamal-murray-dragan-bender). Multiple [sources had ths same conclusion](https://www.tothemean.com/tools/draft-models/#/2016/dv2/all).   It's kind of a microcosm of how NOP was run in the AD era always looking for the short term fix. They didnt want to wait and try to develop a player like Murray. Especially after 2016 which was frankly a disaster year for them they were looking to try to turn things around ASAP wherever they could find a quick fix. Hield was a known quantity they wanted to just get a guy whom they thought could help day 1. The irony was Hield wasnt actually good in NOP as a rookie. The DeMarcus Cousins market was alot worse than alot of people anticipated especially on here. Frankly if Hield had actually looked like some high quality prospect as a rookie Im not even sure NOP wouldve been willing to include him.
Brandon Ingram and trey Burke knicks legend
"Brandon Ingram, that you?"
As a Jaylen Stan from day one I appreciate the gesture and I‚Äôll join you. I thought Brandon Ingram was never gonna take the jump and grow into his potential but I was definitely wrong.
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
Or Brandon Ingram :3
Brandon Ingram acting like he‚Äôs trolling his friends at a pickup game at the park and I love it
So who's better Brandon Ingram or Ben Simmons?
Don‚Äôt forget Brandon Ingram.
I LOVE the player that Brandon Ingram is becoming
What??? John is about as chill as it gets outside of Brandon Ingram
"But why? Coaches, players and fans have called him BI for the longest. If you‚Äôre not used to seeing it, that‚Äôs you. Also this post is talking about BRANDON INGRAM so who else would I be talking about when I say BI under this post."
Brandon ‚Äúnever missed a free throw in high school‚Äù Ingram
Not anymore. I am the change I wish to see. He is Brandon Ingram.
"Brandon ingram looks like dollar store bizzy bone on the after christmas 70% off sale, 30cent bizzy bone"
Everyone knows BI is Brandon Ingram tho

Brandon ingram is so smooth that it fools you.  Sometimes it feels like he is going off. And he is 8/19
"Lol didn‚Äôt see that post, in my defense the post if about Brandon Ingram so it makes sense that I was talking about him when I said BI"
what has brandon ingram does that makes him an asshole
‚ÄúNOP Smoke‚Äù version of Brandon Ingram is a beast
"Normally we‚Äôre the team on the shit end of fouls, and despite all the raps fans I‚Äôve seen crying, I‚Äôve seen a lot also realizing most of the Calls were actual fouls. I know what it looks like to get shafted, and this ain‚Äôt it. Teams foul Zion, it‚Äôs the same strategy everyone had for shaq, oh and then there‚Äôs Brandon Ingram too."
It‚Äôs fine but we should be striving for better than fine. That‚Äôs just not a good nickname. It‚Äôs lazy. Surely there‚Äôs some fun pun involving Brandon or Ingram or both
"I mean Brandon Ingram murdered us today and looks like an All Star, and is making the same kind of quick, smart decisions, attacked and drew a foul to ice the game... I don't think lumping BI in with Melo is fair anymore."

Brandon Ingram: 1st team allNBA
I felt like last year Brandon Ingram was stepping back a bit when Zion get healthy and was on the court. Seems like now the team understands he‚Äôs the man and they‚Äôre better for it.
What about an inberweener like BI for Brandon Ingram?
At least Brandon Ingram still has the unofficial Slim Reefer lmao
"The trade may have turned out to be one of the most fair trades ever. Truth is that for it to work out for the Lakers it had to result in a championship or it would‚Äôve been a loss. They got the chip and the peels now have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart plus picks to go with Zion. The Pelicans may come out ahead in the long run depending on how good of a job the FO does to keep this squad together and win championships.   Either way it worked out pretty well for both teams"
I hate that Brandon Ingram is B.I. I assume they‚Äôre tryna play it like A.I(?) but it just sounds so bad on the play by play.
Brandon Xavier Ingram is legitimate.
Idk who the fuck this dude is but this Brandon Ingram guy might be good.   Raptors well we might not be good.
"Brandon Ingram? He IS 23 so not a huge step up on the age curve. But the salaries work since he's already gotten his max, and boy oh boy the KAT/ Zion pairing is match made in heaven (offensively at least). Maybe Ayton? His perceived value seems to vary a lot across the league though."
No Brandon Ingram? Weird
BRANDON  üó£INGRAM  üó£
"I felt the same with people calling Brandon Ingram, BI. But guess he earned it now."
"THANK YOU for bringing this up. I've also been hearing BI a lot. I remember watching the pelicans play and heard ""BI something..something.."" and was like AI? What?  Brandon Ingram. Announcers refer to him as B.I.  It sounds bad, kinda tacky and really forced."
who cares about Siakam and the Raps  BRANDON MOTHAFUCKIN INGRAM BAYBEEEEEEEEEE
Brandon Ingram. Zion Williamson.
Brandon Ingram is so good   28 free throws in one quarter is ridiculous. That‚Äôs an entire quarter‚Äôs worth of points just in free throws.
Brandon Ingram is playing like a top 20 player right now
I love Brandon Ingram. Stud.
"The only thing that still bothers me is when he brings the ball up, it's like he completely changes the way he plays. He had 2 possessions like that tonight, 1 where he stared down Embiid and allowed a turnover on the entry pass, and another where he tried to dance and take it to the hole and it ended in another turnover.    But overall, I love that he's playing faster. That's the key. Don't be Carmelo or Brandon Ingram. Be quick, shoot off the catch, and you're at least a positive player and not a drag on the lineup"
"You mean when he was with Brandon fucking Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Kuzma, Rondo, KCP, and co? They were at least proven NBA players who had couple of seasons under their belt, we are fielding undrafted players, rookies ans G-leaguers, come on man."
Brandon Ingram seems pretty well liked ! Keeps to himself......improves every year.....Doesnt flop and has no pressure yet ! Itll come soon once the pelicans are a top team
That‚Äôs an insane take. The difference between Harden and AD‚Äôs trade value is not this deal. Harden is an MVP caliber player with 2 years on his deal. You‚Äôre not getting him for some young role player quality players and a few picks that‚Äôd be at best low lottery. As a Pelicans fan I think you would agree that Brandon Ingram inclusion is turns the AD trade from great for the Pelicans to almost laughable without him.
"So you are suggesting the Rockets trade Harden to the Pelicans for the package they got for AD, minus the most important piece Brandon Ingram?"
"There are multiple young second options I‚Äôd rather have over John Collins lol. Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, DeAndre Ayton, Brandon Ingram, just off the top of my head. He‚Äôs a good player but he‚Äôs not a superstar."
&gt; [The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks)   At the time I thought it was stupid they didn‚Äôt take this package. In hindsight it looks even worse for the Spurs given his good Ingram has become
Brandon Ingram got ejected for literally that
"/r/nba in Brandon ingram's first 2 season: he's Travis outlaw and he's a bust   /r/nba when ingram is thriving in NOLA: WHATTT who said that?  I'm with you bro, one of the things I hate most about this sub and why I rarely come here anymore."
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
"If domantas is top 20 then where are the other young players like Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Fox, Kristaps? Or even older players who still play at a high level like Kyle Lowry, Demar Derozan, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker.   Domantas isn‚Äôt above any of those players, calling him top 20 is just straight stupid lol"
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
"Blake Griffin? I think he doesn‚Äôt look good at all. It just makes me sad watching him play now and seeing the way he moves. He‚Äôs lost so much of his fluidity and explosiveness it‚Äôs crazy.  My list is KD, Lebron James, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, and Jayson Tatum."

"Reporters also said Brandon Ingram had grown to 6'11 in his sophomore season and the next year was listed at 6'7.  I don't trust anything besides official measurements. It's all speculation, rounding and guessing."
"lmao the lakers refused to include brandon ingram in any way shape or form for kawhi, no shot we're sending him to our own conference for a shit deal? we got a fantastic guy in derozan and 2 picks that turned out great + poeltl, we just need a main man now (which we have cap for) and we're solid"
"Yeah 100% - he fouls too much when the D is set up for man to man, he would be okay at SG but getting bullied by Brandon Ingram is a signal that something is not right."
"He played half the season, didn't box out and got bodied by Brandon Ingram. He lost minutes to Powell who was stronger defensively and Simons who is lights out as a shooter. He might have more luck this season, but could get traded too."
"Ben Simmons is taller, has better defense and is a better playmaker then Brandon Ingram. Is he better?"
"Great example is when Brandon Ingram came in listed at 6'9 and after the first summer, reporters kept saying he grew to 6'11. A year later, the league measured real heights and he's now listed at 6'7."
"Well I think that Brandon Ingram has potential to become a more than average defender, same with Zion since he's a freak of nature. Jonas isn't a terrible defender unless we're talking PNR, but he's a solid rim protector. The offensive talent that the three bring together is quite impressive I will say, albeit the lack of perimeter shooting from the front court. I believe as long as you can keep a 3 pt threat like Lonzo or get Lowry, pair em up with an elite 3 pt shooter, this isn't a bad team, again assuming that BI and Zion step it up defensively."
"Brandon Ingram is capable of average/good defense. I dont know if he'll play it, but it's possible."
"For real. Zion, Brandon Ingram and JV is a pretty sweet frontcourt as well"
Green is the likely second pick and you want him to develop into what Brandon Ingram is. I don‚Äôt do that trade

"According to this Woj article, Ingram was on the table:  &gt; The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks"
Brandon Ingram is not a good defender so no idea what you mean by ‚Äútwo way‚Äù wing.  He‚Äôs also pretty ball dominant and hasn‚Äôt shown to be effective playing off ball with Zion playing more of a point forward role.
"Brandon Ingram is a legit All-Star player, that package is downright disrespectful   &gt; They would be better fits next to Zion as they are dependable shooters.  BI is a better shooter than both of them (38% on more attempts and much more difficult shots), is a good passer who can run a P&amp;R with Zion, and is a good defender. Legit the perfect fit next to him. He‚Äôs also younger than Cam and Mikal üòÇüòÇüòÇ  The Suns should run it back and the Pelicans should NOT trade their best player"
Who would you fit around Zion though? An efficient shooter who can play off ball and also create his own shot? Maybe with some playmaking sprinkled in? Oh shit I just described Brandon Ingram
2 important role players for 1 Brandon Ingram?   Robbing Peter to pay Paul here
"Brandon Ingram gets so disrespected and I hate it. That‚Äôs an embarrassing offer for him, it might be even worse than the heat fans thinking they can get him for herro robinson and a first."
You guys need another star. CP3 can't be reliable at this stage of his career.  I would try to package Bridges and Johnson for a star wing. Somebody like Brandon Ingram.  Thoughts?
If Brandon Ingram is getting traded I‚Äôd like golden state to get involved with that
I always thought Brandon Ingram looked cool as fuck.
"Brandon Ingram close to getting overrated, people acting like the Pels shouldnt trade him and the 10th pick for Beal or that he would be worth being the foundation of a trade for Cade. Good player who just really isnt that franchise foundational piece the way he gets described and the way people will act like he is when they frame it like ""Puts up 24 a game on 58% TS and is still young what's not to like""."
"KD is a bit leaner now but he has always been skinny fat. Like he is not Brandon Ingram or Jerami Grant.   Tatum being only 205lbs seems off, which is why I think KD is still around 230lbs now. That weight is really nothing at 6'10. Jrue can't be 6'3 and 230lbs and Tatum 6'8 205lbs."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, and a good handful of others have achieved mediocrity at best on the Lakers(with maybe the exception being Brandon Ingram), only to flourish and improve once they left the Lakers.  The Lakers have done some pretty solid drafting the past six years or so, but they have done a terrible job at actually developing the players they draft."
"it‚Äôs absolutely a slight against him   i can help on a brandon ingram drive if i don‚Äôt have to worry about zion on the perimeter bc he can‚Äôt shoot or dribble with his right hand   just bc he‚Äôs good doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt something he needs to work on   personally, it‚Äôs why i think he will struggle to be the #1 on a championship team   he‚Äôll have to be as good as Giannis and he‚Äôs not even close on defense"
"Shoutout NC  PG: Chris Paul, Devontae Graham   SG: Steph Curry, Seth Curry  SF: Brandon Ingram, TJ Warren  PF: PJ Tucker, Montrezl Harrell  C: Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside"
"&gt; Idk, I mean I don't think it's that hot of a take. How many 24-year-olds are averaging 25/6/3 on 40/48/76?  At 23 Brandon Ingram has 23.8/4.9/4.9 on 47/38/88 and you'd be wild to say top 5 is his ceiling  At 23 DeAaron Fox has 25.2/3.5/7.2 on 48/32/72 and you'd be wild to say top 5 is his ceiling  Last year, when LaVine was 24, he averaged 25.5/4.8/4.2 on 45/38/80 and you'd be wild to say top 5 is his ceiling  And it's not like Brown exploded in the playoffs either. He was consistent going from regular season to playoffs"
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De‚ÄôAron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
"[Woj reported that the Lakers offered Ingram and a first ](https://www.hoop-ball.com/nba-fantasy-news-and-advice/fantasy-nba-player-news/woj-lakers-offered-brandon-ingram-and-first-round-pick-for-kawhi/), and we had seen from previously reported trades like the Paul George one that the Lakers kept under balling the other teams under the guise that they could just sign those stars in free agency. The counter offer Pop came back with was probably akin to the one that was given for Anthony Davis, so it probably wasn‚Äôt absurd but was more suited for Kawhis true value. And for your second point, you forgot to mention that we would‚Äôve had to give Ingram a max, so it wasn‚Äôt just Demar Poetl and a pick, it also included having the most capspace out of any team this offseason. Ingram has done absolutely nothing on the Pelicans while playing with a player that is far superior than anyone on the Spurs in Zion, and is also a terrible defender, so I‚Äôm a bit bullish on him anyways. The Keldon point is moot because it‚Äôs possible that if the Raptors kept their pick they would‚Äôve taken him among many other scenarios."
"You literally do not know what the negotiations were. Reports were that the Lakers made an opening offer, then Pop responded with [a counter offer so absurd](https://thespun.com/news/spurs-lakers-kawhi-leonard-trade-package/amp) that it gave the Lakers the impression that [he'd slammed the door in their faces.](https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1009885902435278848?s=19) Reports later came out from Woj that Pop had taken a stance that [he would not have traded Kawhi to the Lakers under any circumstances.](https://news4sanantonio.com/amp/sports/spurs-zone/spurs-reportedly-would-not-trade-kawhi-leonard-to-lakers-no-matter-what)  So if you're wondering why the Lakers never got beyond that initial offer, now you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say all the Spurs got was Brandon Ingram and a pick. Isn't that better than Poeltl and a pick? Ingram is a 23 year old All Star under contract for the next 4 years. Wouldn't you rather have Ingram? DeRozan is likely gone, and you could have drafted Keldon Johnson with the Lakers pick just as easy as you did with the Raptors' 29th pick. Who else is left? I'd rather have Ingram personally."
"Luka, Jordan Poole, Brandon Ingram, Giannis, Ayton"
"(Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart)"
"Fuck off. The 2nd pick in the draft is going to one of the best teams in the league and dies before he ever touches the floor. Imagine if the 73 win Warriors had added Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown and they died 2 days after the draft. That would be memorable, wouldn't it?  Fucking troll."
"Neither, he's healthy and the Pels FO said they would be happy to see both him and Brandon Ingram potentially play in the Olympics. The select committee just been on them good bath salts this year with some of their choices."
OG Brandon Ingram
Chris Duarte (2021) is older than Brandon Ingram (2016)
"&gt;and if he says he will only resign in Boston  Keep dreaming lol. The BR article about him possibly requesting a trade already said that if he does request a trade he would ""welcome joining teams such as Boston, Golden State, Miami or Philadelphia.""   Even when AD (also on an expiring contract) was sitting out of games and openly trying to get to LA, he got traded for Brandon Ingram (#2 pick a few years earlier), Lonzo (2 years removed from being the #2 pick), Josh Hart, the #4 overall pick, and 2 more future first round picks."
Pelicans could offer Brandon Ingram and the 76ers can offer Ben Simmons.  I‚Äôd take BI and Ben over wiseman and picks no doubt
"The Pelicans can offer Brandon Ingram who‚Äôs a young all-star, and they have like 13 first round picks over the next 7 years too. I doubt they‚Äôd be as willing to go all-in as the Warriors are though"
"full text:  #29 NBA teams are poverty franchises right now  As I sit back and watch the aftermath of the 2021 NBA Finals, I can't help but feel pity for the city of Milwaukee and Bucks fans all across the Earth.  The Milwaukee Bucks are a poverty franchise.  Imagine being a dry, parched traveler in the desert of championships, on the quest for gold. Finally, you stumble across a gold nugget. Is this any reason to celebrate? Is this any reason to jump in the streets, shout, and cry?   Winning one championship does not merit celebration. What matters are *dynamics* - a history of SUSTAINED dominance in the NBA! Championship franchises understand this. True fans of the Los Angeles Lakers understand this. Poverty franchises do not.  But what's more, it's become evident that 29 of the current NBA franchises are all poverty franchises. The only exception is the Los Angeles Lakers.  ""But what about the Boston Celtics? They also have 17 championships."" yes, but they frontloaded 11 of their rings in an era with just eight teams. The Celtics have won 1 championship since 1986 - 35 years ago. That is not sustained dominance. That is what we call a fluke.  The Los Angeles Lakers have won in every era. Fast pace, slow pace, high parity, low parity, the Lakers have won it all.   When the Celtics began the trend of artificial superteams 2007, it was Kobe Bryant who stopped them from being remembered as a dynasty.   When the Spurs formed a natural dynastic franchise, it was Shaq and Kobe - and later Kobe - who made sure to knock them out in the playoffs in most of their meetings.  When Larry Bird was looking dominant and won 3 MVPs in a row, it was Magic Johnson who made sure to limit him to only three rings.  When the NBA just started, it was George Mikan who established the Lakers as the premier franchise from the get-go with five rings.  A winner's mentality is about the long-term, not the short run. This is why I'm still adamant that the AD trade was a bad trade - sure we got *one* ring out of it, but we gave up a future GOAT contender in Lonzo Ball, a future 3-time MVP in Brandon Ingram, and a future 5x All-Defensive 1st Team player in Josh Hart. With AD, we get maybe one or two rings. With the aforementioned 3, we get 6 or 7 rings.  But no matter! Bucks fans should be CRYING right now - because the Bucks just won a ring at the expense of the weakest Western Conference Finalist since 1986, since Bucks fans seem so overjoyed, Giannis no longer feels a sense of duty to Milwaukee. He will thus demand a trade to the Lakers by the end of August, and will suit up for the Purple and Gold at the start of the 2021-2022 season alongside LeBron, AD, Dame, and Lonzo, starting an 8-ring Laker dynasty."
"Yeah I mean at that point I think I would just stay aggressive and try to get a 3rd star and get your big 3 for your window to be now. And think there's still enough asset wise you could probably do that, wouldnt require some top 12-15 player either to fill out that 3rd star spot either.   I have a feeling this is GSW's race to lose though and a central part of it is I suspect the league is still a fair bit higher on Wisemann than people on here are. I actually would be very interested to see the leagues perception of Brandon Ingram and how exactly they value him if he were to ever hit the market."
Terance Mann is older than Brandon Ingram
Lebron and Lonzo Ball/Brandon Ingram as his best players is not winning a championship lmao   BI was decent but Lonzo was not good in LA
OG Anunoby is the same age as Brandon Ingram (1997)
  &gt; How is Brandon Ingram only 23?  Borning 23 years ago.
"It's so odd. There's no one with a contract around his size that makes sense. Either he's way better than them and you're downgrading (think Harrison Barnes, Kristaps, D-Lo) or he's not as good as them/doesn't make sense for the other team (McCollum, Brandon Ingram). You can't really flip him for assets either, and teams might actually ask for sweeteners themselves to take his contract.  Doc doesn't run an effective offense. I watched just about every regular season game and noticed a pattern: the man doesn't have a non-iso, go-to play. If they are stuck in the mud, he adds more dirt and water. Any time the offense stagnates, he kind of just leaves them to fend for themselves. It's like he expects hero ball to save the day every time."
&gt;How is Brandon Ingram only 23?  2021-1997=24 (he‚Äôll only be 23 for a couple more months)
How is Brandon Ingram only 23lbs?
"I‚Äôd propose a three way trade with the Pelicans to bring in Brandon Ingram for Randle and a pick, send Lonzo and a couple picks to Portland, and Derrick Rose to NO. Then I‚Äôd try to sign a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Derrick Jones Jr in free agency."
"Okay Brandon, but how many times did you made it through the playoffs without the guy named Lebron? I remember that season where he had that groin injury and had to be out for a while and it fell on Ingram to be the main guy in LA and lakers nearly fell from playoff race.hahaha"
Maybe because Brandon Ingram came into the league when he was only 19 he didn‚Äôt spend 3-4 years in college he spent a year in college that‚Äôs why so you‚Äôve gotten used to seeing him in the league for like 4-5 seasons therefore making him seem older even though he was only 19 his rookie season
"Bro even both parts after are so accurate. Lebron ends up winning, does a ‚Äúrewrite‚Äù trading Brandon Ingram. Jokic pops up, and he just won mvp lol"
"Remember when lakers were just lonzo ball brandon ingram and Kyle kuzma then 2 years later lakers were one overhaul trade from landing a big 3 of kawhi AD and lebron? Maybe its unlikely but goddamn it , im not gonna say its impossible"
Jaylen Brown Brandon Ingram
"Honestly, I like the 2016 draft a lot with a small lineup. Go with Simmons, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, and Sabonis. Still behind the 2012 lineup, but that's a good team to surround Simmons with a bunch of 3 point shooters around him."
Probably like Brandon Ingram
"As a Portland fan I literally just want at least one legit piece to build around and if possible some picks on top of it. Ben Simmons would be great, Brandon Ingram would be great. This warriors offer has no legit pieces in my mind it‚Äôs just a collection of assets that could all be trash (unless you believe in wiseman but after last year I definitely do not). If Golden state had drafted lamelo last year I would literally do just lamelo and Wiggins straight up and not even need any picks. But the centerpiece of this is supposed to be wiseman? I‚Äôd rather just wait a year and see what other potential packages there are."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De‚ÄôAaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De‚ÄôAaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he‚Äôs on a team that hasn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2006 and isn‚Äôt exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He‚Äôs not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you‚Äôre the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn‚Äôt going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven‚Äôt made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn‚Äôt have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn‚Äôt go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am completely off the ‚ÄúBen Simmons has superstar potential‚Äù bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It‚Äôs been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he‚Äôs going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it‚Äôs not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He‚Äôs their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He‚Äôs a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton‚Äôs contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6‚Äô1‚Äù shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it‚Äôs not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks‚Äô title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that he wasn‚Äôt the most deserving candidate. He‚Äôs a great player don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can‚Äôt help but wonder if that Jazz would‚Äôve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he‚Äôs consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I‚Äôd believe DeRozan‚Äôs role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he‚Äôs still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he‚Äôd be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn‚Äôt able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He‚Äôs going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he‚Äôs still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn‚Äôt play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year‚Äôs draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga‚Äôs Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we‚Äôre already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"That's so stupid, the guy's barely played over a full season in his entire career and couldn't drag his team to the playoffs with an all star teammate in Brandon Ingram.  He's been killing it on the court, but there are still SO many things that he could still improve on. 20 year old players should stop worrying about what the FO is doing, and focus on improving their own damn game. Threatening the FO to make win now moves when you aren't even close to ready to lead a team is not a recipe for success."
Brandon Ingram was the #2 pick thats reasonable value
You do realize look who running you‚Äôre team. Since ad trade griff has only gotten rid of talent jrue left now lonzo about to leave and josh hart as well. Brandon Ingram will be next. Once that happen Zion will look to leave in like 3 years.

"Seems like they gotta try, as the threat is pretty high, apparently, that Zion will want to leave soon if they miss the playoffs.   KOC thinks if they don‚Äôt land Lowry, that‚Äôs the team that needs to trade for Dame, maybe using Brandon Ingram &amp; a ton of picks to get the trade done."
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
"Brandon Ingram, Bradley Beal, Paul George, or Dame. Please"
"They should get Brandon Ingram, Bradley Beal, Paul George, or Dame. Hey or just get them all I don‚Äôt know"
"I don‚Äôt know how some late FRPs, which they‚Äôre gonna be cause dame will make a team that much better, and Brandon Ingram, or Ben Simmons, or Jaylen brown is gonna put portland in that much better of a situation than just having dame."

"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There‚Äôs already been reports about Zion‚Äôs family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
