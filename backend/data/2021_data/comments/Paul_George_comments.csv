This is the first time Paul George has had a good interview answer *that you've paid attention to*
"They gonna be chasing Paul George next, the Palmdale prodigy"
"2007-2011 Melo was seriously amazing, I'd argue he compares favorably to the likes of Tatum, Brown, Middleton, Paul George and Butler in his prime.   this is a 6x All-NBA selection who averaged 25+ on playoff teams for 8 years straight. He also would have thrived in a more open playstyle IMO. Plus, his defense was definitely better overall than a Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Beal, etc. I think you're really sleeping on what he did in Denver, he went punch for punch with Kobe in the 2010 WCF and averaged 30 in the playoffs."
"Ok fine you want to do this? I was not going to dignify this with a response while I was on my phone but I have the time now.  &gt;Simmons  You're whole argument of ""he was just boxing out and Simmons jumped"" might hold up, but Lowry moved back into him while he was in the air...he was trying to take out his legs. And yes whole weird incident happened directly after where they both acted like bitches...Lowry shoved his ass in his face on purpose (not dirty but weird af) and Simmons elbowed him in the balls..its a good thing I'm not calling Simmons the clean player here, or else you might actually have an argument.  &gt;Paul George  The Paul George one is 100% an intentional and dirty play by Lowry, and by far the most dirty play on this whole list..as he was going down, he locks PG's arm up intentionally knowing he was going to fall with all his weight onto it..that was fucked up and the most damning example on his list..its embarrassing you're trying to duck this one. If you aren't willing to concede this one, you have zero credibility..although that was already obvious.  &gt;Aaron Gordon  You glossed over it but again, an extremely damning video of him putting a guy in an extremely dangerous situation, and it ended up injuring him exactly as you'd expect. His lack of remorse and tough guy attitude after only solidifies that.  &gt;Bradley Beal  Flagrant and dirty, if it was a one off and the only incident on this list, fine..could write it off, but its not and Lowry is always going way too far and then tries to act all innocent. He wound up and aimed straight for his head.  &gt;Porter Jr  If you ever played basketball in your life, you'd know that if you are not going to go up for a rebound, then you clear the hell out from underneath the guy jumping or else you are going to take out his legs and hurt him. He makes no effort to get out of his way here. He literally stops, looks at Porter, then runs to the spot he is landing...he has really mastered the art of ""accidentally being at the wrong place at the right time"".  &gt;Delly  Great you agree, elbowing a player in the face is dirty, cool. Even though you still feel the need to qualify it lol like you really can't concede an inch though...""ya it was dirty...but he started it!""  &gt;Lebron  Of course you try to get out of this one, he literally latches onto his arm and then once the play is clearly dead, and then he purposefully tries to throw him to the ground and trip him. Just because it didn't result in injury doesn't mean a play isn't dirty..the fact that Lowry is constantly looking for plays like this only solidifies that he is dirty.  &gt;Last Video  He blatantly shoves the guy while he is mid air...did you not just see the Lebron-Embiid play a few games ago? That will always be dangerous and needless...just because the guy didn't end up losing his balance and falling doesn't change the fact that Lowry is once again, looking for a chance to put a guy in a dangerous position...like why make that shove at all? Answer me why that would be a basketball play in any scenario?  And then there is the hipcheck on Ennis...and the close outs underneath shooter's feet and probably countless other instances that weren't captured in a clip.  You think one other Raptors fan chiming in is me getting ""dumped on""...dude you asked what other examples there were and I gave you a whole list and you think I'm the one getting dumped on? lol You and your thin skinned Raptors buddies should just call it a day and keep quiet when your precious players do questionable shit and stop trying to defend their bullshit. I never thought that Raptors fans cheering after KD's injury was a fair representation of your base, but honestly its starting to seem like it is, you guys seem to get off on this shit.  Anyway, I hope you have fun watching the playoffs from the sidelines this year."
Actually the reason why Kyrie was the primary option today was because Paul George and Kawhi mostly defended KD and Harden. Kyrie had the best matchup and took advantage of it

"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
This is like that guy on here who admitted he hates Paul George because his girlfriend lied that she was going to see family but went and slept with him.
Paul George bout to turn into PTSD P once the playoffs arrive
"Paul George is technically at 49,8%."
I click on every Paul George post just to see the evolutions of Playoff P.  I’m so excited for the next ones
"Shaq and Kobe really didn't like each other, it's just that they were years removed, and I think that Kobe had developed a separate relationship with Shaq's kid by then, who still lived in LA. Shaq lives in Georgia. Kobe still resented Shaq for not always being in the best of shape even after their sit down. Westbrook probably really hates Beverly, and maybe even Embiid. I think that it was hard from him to maintain that sort of hate for Durant,because they have so much history. Also don't think Lillard cares for Paul George, a lot of the stuff that he said was personal. He views him as a disloyal frontrunner always looking for the easiest path."
Too far. More like the gap between Giannis and Paul George.
The gap between Curry and Dame is the gap between LeBron and Paul George
"All-stars Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Nicolas Batum"
"If PG said “i feel like I should’ve had more free throws” after a win this sub would call him a complainer or whatever. A ton of players say they feel the refs were unfair after losses, only reason people care is cause its paul george."
George Paul with another humble comment
i agree Paul George!
Paul George is the Dolph Ziggler of the NBA
"Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Paul George, and idk um Embiid"
"Obviously I want the Nets to win a chip, but if they lost to the Clippers I'd be happy with Paul George and Kenny Atkinson getting rings."
"I always feel like these comparisons should include shots they were fouled on too. Hear me out and tell me if this has been covered before or if it's nonsense.  If Kawhi went to the line 9 times, add 4 to his Field Goals Attempted (assuming there was an and 1 to get to 9 which counts as a FGA already). Paul George, going 1-1, has none added because it was a technical, and 1, etc.   Works out to 59 points on 52 adjusted shots vs 90 points on 60 adjusted shots.   Still a big disparity here but not as huge, and if Kawhi and Paul George shot 8 more attempts combined to get to 60 adjusted, their max point total could really change things. for example, say they shoot and make 8 threes (+24 points)  to get to 60 adjusted shots, even with the trio.   Works out to a much more respectable 83 points on 60 adjusted shots vs 90 points on 60 adjusted shots.   Is there a stat for this? I would think so but don't have a clue."
I think people are confusing clear paths with offsides because Paul George was the most ahead of the play
paul george was ahead of the defense tho was he not?
paul george was ahead of all of em tho
"PAul George even if you get the steal, what's the chances of a full court 3 point for win?"
It's cause no one is ahead of paul george on the fast break
Paul George :0
That’s a big time shot by Paul George
Part of me thinks Paul George will slump in the playoffs again.  Lakers win in 5.
Gut is telling me that Paul George will awaken
Paul George will never be the norm
How do you call that on harden but not on Paul George on the and 1
"Prediction: Paul ""No OT Tonight"" George misses the game winner in this one."
"Anytime someone clearly takes a screenshot of a video but does not post the video clip, I ignore the point.  Still images never tell the story.   [Maybe they didn't post the Simmons video because doing so proves 100% Lowry didn't undercut him, and that Simmons jumped while Lowry was boxing him out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM&amp;ab_channel=CliveNBAParody).  But yeah, the guy who threw the elbow to the balls is the clean player in that sequence, gtfoh.  Also the Paul George thing being Lowry's fault is crazy to me, consider George falls and ends up taking Lowry with him (I'm not blaming George for it, he had no intention of bringing Lowry down, but I'm not sure how Lowry is supposed to avoid that).  First video is Gordon, already discussed.  Second (and third) video are a play on the ball, catches Beal in the head - flagrant, not dirty.   Fourth video, are you serious? How do you watch the last replay and call that play dirty?  Lowry is running for the rebound, sees Porter and tries to slam on the brakes to avoid contact, ends up clipping him.  How do you see any intent there?  Fifth video...yeah, a little.  Delly is being a pest and reaching/poking after Lowry calls the timeout, he's got his face deep inside Lowry's space, and Lowry gives him a little love tap.  There's no intent to injure or hurt Delly.  Sixth video...come on.  Really?  Not even dignifying that with a response, if you think Lowry is strong enough to throw LeBron like that.  Seventh video is nothing.    Did you just search ""kyle lowry dirty"" and post the first 7 links without checking what they showed?"
"Hey, Clippers fans, have both Paul George and Kawhi been playing back-to-back games?"
im amazed paul george has 0 free throw attempts despite driving aggressively for half the game
"Of course teams hunt mismatches. That’s true regardless. The Nuggets hunted mismatches of Paul George/Kawhi Leonard onto Jokic last playoffs, but that doesn’t make them defensive liabilities."
Kyrie is defending Paul George surprisingly well
"While I don't think it's too much power, be realistic lol. Harden, AD, Paul George twice, Kawhi, Kyrie have all happened in the last 5 years."
paul george has been blocked like 10 times this game
Is Paul George hurt?
James Harden fans 🤝 Russell Westbrook fans 🤝 Paul George fans 🤝 Giannis Antetokounmpo fans     Finding a new player for r/NBA to slander
"Lowry flops, but he doesn't whine like Paul George"
"Harden, KD, Ibaka, Jeff Green, Paul George, Patrick Patterson, and Reggie Jackson all played for OKC at some point. Am I missing anyone?"
"At no point in the last five years did I think I'd watch Reggie Jackson, Paul George, Ibaka, Harden, Durant and Jeff Green all on the court at the same time I hate it"
Paul George stole Kawhis haircut.
"He loves the Raptors and thinks they can do no wrong, so you probably don't see it as much.  Other than some gentle criticism of Pascal's play lately, he rarely ever criticizes anything going on with the Raptors.  Same with the Heat.  He just loves those organizations, so you only hear positive things about them.  You'd imagine if Lowry was on another team, he'd at least catch a little heat from Zach about his flopping.      To me, Zach also clearly has some sort of bias against the absolute elite superstars and teams.  He fawns all over scrappy, upstart teams that are a couple games over .500.  He professes his love for young players that casual fans don't really know about like Pascal a few years ago or Bam, and latches on to stars who aren't quite the elite superstars e.g. Paul ""Is a Boss"" George.  Meanwhile, he never really paid much attention to the Warriors during their run and the past few years, he's shown little interest in the Lakers or Clippers.       It seems like he just kind of feels like he needs to balance out the scales of how the league is covered by media and consumed by fans by caring about less popular stuff.  To me, that counts as a bias."
"This is gonna be good. Hopefully Paul George continues to step up. If he does, I think Clippers win because their defense will reign supreme."
"Devil's advocate, but arguably this is what the Lakers did with Paul George and it ended up backfiring."
"In before this gets removed because you are not allowed to criticize Luka, even though this is the same sub that ragged on Paul George and Pat Bev for weeks"
"In before this gets removed because you are not allowed to criticize Luka, even though this is the same sub that ragged on Paul George and Pat Bev for weeks"
Paul George lower
I would say Clippers. Paul George is gonna cook.
"He’s not a playoff choker, but he’s a bit too streaky and inconsistent to be a teams undisputed first option. That’s why pairing him with Paul George didn’t work. They both got the same issue. As a second option in his prime- he was great."
"What Paul George has to do with Westbrook shooting 40%?  Russ was just as bad in 2017, 2019 and 2020.."
Maybe if Paul George wasnt the worst player on the team game 6 they would of won the series
Bro Westbrook came back from a Meniscus tear and came back jumping out of the gym. Durant ruptured his Achilles and looks to have lost zero speed or mobility. Paul George suffered a complete compound fracture of his leg and came back with no loss of athleticism. These are all injuries that at the very least should be career altering if not career ending. These guys should have come back and had less athleticism instead they had more. And that is just the bigger name guys off the top of my head. NBA players are on PEDs just like every major athlete aside from the MLB players and only because the MLB players have already gotten caught red handed.
Paul George
&gt;I get more of a young Paul George vibe.  Tatum reminds me of PG more than JB. JB is a super uber atheltic wing that is dangerous at the rim similar to a modern day Clyde Drexler
It's a Playoff P joke  (Paul George said that post-game after Dame hit a walk-off three in his eye)
"Ultimately, it's because he's a good player. You can talk as much shit as you want and the general public is fine with it so long as you show up in the game. That's why major clowning only happens after losses. That's why Pat Bev and Paul George got shat on when the Clippers disappointed last season. Same thing with Juju Smith-Schuster. Klay definitely got hate in the 2016 Finals once he made his shots at LeBron and then the Warriors lost, but otherwise he hasn't faced much in-game failure following his trash talk.      It's not a mystery. The hate for players is only really prevalent when they've failed in game. Haters feel safe/vindicated to let it out. There's obviously some exceptions, typically for the biggest and most polarizing figures, but in general, if you're a top player and you play well, you don't see much hate. And this isn't justifying it, it's just explaining how it is."
You and Paul George
Ya I agree it was a good attempt at trying to keep AD however they couldve probably traded for Jimmy or Paul George both of which would've been better investments.
Bet if Harden or Paul George said this shit you and all the other GSW fans would be singing a different tune but because it's /r/nba golden boy Klay Thompson it's a completely different attitude.
Beal reminds me a lot of a mini Paul George actually.
Paul George to the Lakers
"To compare Lillard to him, it is a sin. That’s like comparing Paul George to LeBron."
"It's not generational or a modern thing. Individual accolades a lot of times go to superstars. Dame Lillard is a superstar over Klay. So is Paul George. No one would've called Klay a superstar back in the day. You're probably in the vast minority of people that have definition of a superstar in which Klay Thompson fits. You think you know what a superstar is, but you actually just don't know. Who's been as good a two way player as Klay? What does that have to do with him being a superstar? I'm genuinely confused as to what you think a superstar is."
"Ok, so then I can spin this back on you and say that Anthony Davis is only 2 years away from requesting a trade from the Lakers if they don't build an adequate roster around him in the event that LeBron suffers a serious injury and is never the same player anymore.   Do you realize how stupid that sounds?   I don't expect Anthony Davis to leave LA. I don't expect Kawhi Leonard or Paul George to leave LA. You shouldn't expect Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown to leave Boston."
"Tell tale sign of someone who wasn’t watched the Clippers recently. PG is showing out as one of the best (if not the best) second star in the league. But Kawhi is on a whole other level right now. Saying Paul George is playing as good as him right now is just categorically wrong in pretty much every way. That’s not to take away from PG, just shows how amazing Kawhi has been lately  Also how come that didn’t hurt Lebron last year with AD playing as well as he did last season?"
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn’t Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De’Andre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in terms of ceiling
Paul George disagree with you
Paul George has not been playing as good him...
"I get more of a young Paul George vibe. He seems a little more vocal, and he has this energy and hustle on both sides of the court that spreads to the rest of his teammates."
"Paul George has cooled down recently if you watched the actual games, and kawhi's defense has been much better than his. Do you literally only look at box score stats?"
I don't get Kawhi when Paul George is playing as good as him. What makes Kawhi a MVP candidate but not Paul George?
"I changed Curry to Paul George because Curry shoots super efficiently on super high volume, he breaks the comparison like he breaks the NBA."
"It's better to score more very efficiently than score less super efficiently.  I appreciate you did some math, but it's already fairly clear why Bertans can have a higher 3pt% than Paul George but not be as valuable a player."
Doc Rivers - Paul George
Players I like such as Dame Lillard and Klay is allowed to talk shit  Players I don't like such as Paul George (Playoff Piss xD) or KD is not allowed to talk ever
Yeah imagine if someone like PG13 said that. It's actually so much worse than anything Paul George has ever said and PG13 is constantly hated on for his cockiness.

Yeah I'm sure the raptors fan knew more than the player on the court. Like Lowry hasn't tried to hurt another player before while trying to hide it as a basketball play (Paul George).
Over Melo or Paul George ? I can’t put him over Horford cause he never played the 5 ..
"How do you not have Paul George in your top 10? He's been better than AD for sure this season, although Davis is probably the better player in the playoffs."
"&gt;Do some of you literally wait for an opportunity to shit on players, hoping they'll fall temporarily so you can post your shitty takes  *cough* this sub and paul george"
"Simmons, Paul George, Gobert, prime draymond hate, and that one year Lebron didn't reach the playoffs with the Lakers. That's about it."
"This sub, that hates shaqs ""rangz"" talk, has a lot more in common with him than everyone wants to admit.   Bring up Giannis, Dame, Paul, Harden, George... r/nba:  RANGZ!!!"
Good thing they didn't receive Paul George instead
"No no, this is all Lowry's fault. It all started with his armbar against Paul George a couple years ago, according ro reddit tonight at least."
"“He’s got a lot of package” - Paul George on Immanuel Quickley’s Penis, probably."
If the modern NBA has taught us anything it sure isn’t that stars can’t force themselves out of contracts or teams. Or is Paul George still on the Thunder?
That was a good shot  ~ New Paul George
haha paul george said package
And it was Paul George the whole time
1000%. The difference between Jokic and Embiid is the difference between LeBron and Paul George.
"Ask Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Paul George about the playoffs"
It doesnt take much to piss off nephews on r/nba.  Look at Paul George who just had a few bad quotes and ended up being hated real bad
Paul George goes in reverse
"Assuming this is about Oladipo, but I have a hard time believing the warriors wouldn't give up Wiseman for someone like Paul George or KAT"
"Most people don't like Kawhi because he's done some shady shit over the years, starting with the Spurs.  Lied about the medical staff, leaked rumors to give himself leverage. Gave up on us while we were getting shitted on in the playoffs. He did everything to tank his value by saying he only wanted to play for the Lakers. So we sent him to the Toronto for DD.  Cock teasing the Lakers and switching for the Clippers at the last minute. Now Laker fans hate him (they hate everyone tho)  Then the whole Clippers/Jerry West drama and allegedly attempting to circumvent the salary cap. And demanding the Clippers trade for Paul George who had just signed a 4 year contract with the Thunder.  Plenty of people have some good reasons to not like him."
Paul George knows.... that he isa bitch.
Because it's annoying seeing everyone praise Dame for this.  Like what?  They were **BOTH** immature children.  Paul George apologizes and Dame is basically saying I accept your apology.  Just answer a simple question: do you think Dame was also petty in the whole saga?
"And the clippers don't have anyone else on their roster other than the two guys that I said, Paul george, Kawhi and Ibaka. Pretty empty roster 🙄"
"Ok who’s a player that moves the needle that isn’t Giannis, KAT, Embiid that realistically could be available in the next few years?  Paul George maybe?"
I could see it with Paul George.  He's been hurt a lot in the recent years.    He's been prone to bad shooting nights.
"Paul George is so close he hits his hand just after release, like what are you even talking about."
"I think you should rewatch the clip, Paul George didn't have a hand in his face.  At least not by NBA standards, so this was not a ""low percentage"" shot for Dame.  PG was 6 to 8 feet away even before Dame give him a little step back, and the camera angle most people watch this clip from is even generous to PG given the direction of Dame's step-back.  PG covers a lot of that ground due to his size, but for an NBA player that is a clean open look."
Paul George 🔥
I mean I think Paul George was basically saying dame made an amazing shot and he played good defense. I know it’s dame but that’s a low percentage shot that was defended pretty damn well
"lmao if LeBron can recruit the best players in the league, any team should be able to. Y’all stacked af and have two top 5, TWO TOP FIVE PLAYERS. This aint no kawhi leonard and paul george parity, it’s like Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon teaming up. They showed their dominance in the playoffs and the Nets responded, lakers improved their depth too by adding DENNIS SCHROEDER, GASOL, HARRELL to an already OP team. Play your cards right cause i know youd be cheering if your team had these pieces (Harden etc)"
"Yeah- Paul George is the “most hoopiest player of all time,” what does it mean? We don’t know!"
I am sure most of those didn’t have 6 foot 9 Paul George with a hand in his face.
"Man, that Pacers team with prime Hibbert and Paul George was so fun."
"There are stratospheres to superstardom. Being better than Paul George does not put Butler in the convo with Lebron, Durant, Curry and Harden."
&gt; And then he said it felt like the Pacers gave up on him lmao  Same as Paul George but since 99% of nba fans don’t watch the Pacers it works in re-writing history because you get garbage like the SB Nation collapse video that completely glossed over PG tanking his trade value intentionally and making him be a victim to bad management and the same perception will happen with Dipo.
"His stat line doesn't look as elite as other guys, but do I think the Clippers would've made it past the Nuggets if they had Butler instead of Paul George? Absolutely."
"I didn’t realise that about Paul George, that surprises me tho as teams like the Clippers, 76ers maybe Celtics etc all seem to be one star away from really competing so I don’t understand why the owners don’t go all out for someone."
"In myCareer on 2K; Charlotte ended up with a starting five of Lamelo, Paul George, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, and Boogie. I’ve had an irrational fear of the Hornets ever since they whipped me."
"Nothing. He literally did nothing to them. But you have to realize the internet is a spot where people can go and express their jealousy and envy and actually get applauded for it by likeminded people.   Paul George fucked up with a stripper, tried to handle the issue, and then immediately did the right thing?"
"Plus 25 points great defense Paul George, almost a starter jaylen brown, DPOY gobert, and versatile big man sabonis. It also helps that team Durant lost embiid, booker, and Durant which was replaced by Conley, while team lebron lost just Ben Simmons"
Lmao and Paul George is on the bench getting signature Dame wave high fives
"Correct.  Paul George made a deep playoff run 7 and 8 years ago.   5 Years ago he even had a respectable opening series.   **Since 2016, PG has shot just 38% on 530 attempts.**"
What does that have to do with Paul George?
"My LeFan friends who previously had zero opinions on the Clippers or Paul George were talking THE MOST aggressive shit for months after that game. I think the anti-Clipper vitriol from Laker fans fed into it.   Though some of the Clippers are pretty good at looking like dicks, so I get it to some degree. I just ultimately don’t really care, cuz they weren’t a threat to anybody I cheer for and they aren’t the “other team” in my city"
Also that awesome clutch contested three over Pat Bev and Paul George IIRC. We ended up losing that one though.
"Okay, 4 years ago then.   Swept in the first round by the Cavs, 106-102  **Paul George scores 15 points on 5-of-21 shooting.**"
"Is that where we are on the Paul George narrative?  ""He only had two bad post seasons!""   ""Here are my excuses why he was bad in the other ones tho."""
Paul George still thinks it a bad shot.
"Paul George had his hands up too, you can tell he been on the other end haha"
"Oh man, it almost looks like he was waving at Paul George... bringing back memories"
"They just missed the point of All-Star completely. KD chose a bunch of ISO guys who focused on getting shots like what they can normally get in games.   LeBron chose guys who would play off each other well and they were getting crazy opportunities as a result of it. He had all the best playmakers and off-ball players.   They had facilitators like:  * Luka, CP3, Jokic, LeBron - 4 generationally great playmakers  And then on the end of those plays they had:  * Giannis, Curry, Gobert, Brown - Really efficient off-ball players  And then you've still got Lillard and Paul George in the mix...   Hell, the reason Giannis went 16/16 is because he was mostly being fed good opportunities and he's so good on capitalising on them. CP3 + Giannis was killer.  Whereas Team KD came down to ISO ISO ISO. Even at the end you could hear Doc saying ""when Kyrie and James [Harden] get the ball clear out and give them space""."
As Paul George would say “That’s a bad shot”
Rooting for dame and paul George was a great experience
Does Paul George still think that Dame's shot was a bad shot
I love when Paul George dominates he’s just too nice man

This comment is embarrassing.   What Paul George is saying has no ties to what Bron is doing with his family.
Paul George is a 7x All-Star? Huh?
Found out Curry was in the final and turned into  Paul George
"So would you say Donovan Mitchell has top 10 player potential since he’s leading the Jazz to the best record in the league? What about Devin Booker? Personally I think Beal is and will continue to be better than both of them, but your logic would place them ahead of him in terms of ceiling, correct? Is Paul George a top 10 player? No way he leads a team as the number one option.   I agree he probably isn’t capable of being the guy on a championship team (although look at who he’s played with throughout his career...he hasn’t benefited from playing with all around great teams like others have), but I still think you can be a top 10 player and not be capable of being that guy. Melo was top 10 for years and never good enough to be that guy. Neither was Chris Paul. I’m cherry picking players but you get my point."
I think the westbrook trade will easily end up being better imo. Present day Paul George is a better player than Westbrook and there’s a much better chance those Houston picks end up being high lottery picks than the clippers picks.
Paul George: DNP (Room spinny)
"They could pop Paul George on pushoffs every possession too. You can call anything on any possession, and by choosing the right sequence of calls you can swing a game however you want.  Put me in a ref’s uniform and I can put the T-Wolves over the top against the KD Warriors without making an incorrect call."
"Paul George with dizziness, oml"
Yeah i remember when he hit that shot over Paul George
Tompa Bay My Spurs Paul George turned into George Paul
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d’angelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
So Tatum is Paul george?
"Keep this same energy if Paul George, or Patrick Beverley ever get dunked on that bad and say some shit like this. Would bet the mortgage these comments would be so different lmao"
Not really I remember joking about it with people years ago how it's the madden curse where guys if anything tend to regress or something unfortunate happens like getting hurt alot the following year. Even if they end up progressing long term and getting better after that the season after winning MIP players either tend to stall or regress slightly. Which also highlights how improvement isnt linear like its made out to be.   Only other recent ex I can think of a guy really actually improving after winning MIP is Paul George in 2014. Note if Bam had won last year he wouldnt win MIP this year but I can see him finishing like 7th in this years voting.
"Are you really going to bet on a team with Derozan/Murray/Walker as your big three over Lebron/Davis/Schroeder, or Mitchell/Gobert/Conley, or Kawhi/George/Ibaka, or Harden/Durant/Irving, Embiid/Simmons/Harris, or Giannis/Middleton/Holiday, or Booker/Paul/Ayton,  or Steph/Draymond/Klay?  Sorry, but you aren’t. Doesn’t mean it won’t happen, but you are banking on a miracle at that point. Murray and Walker have the potential to be that third guy. Derozan is ideally your third or second guy. You figure out your stars first and fill out the supporting cast later. Sorry, but as of right now Walker/Keldon/Murray are supporting guys and your third banana at best"
George Paul (as Skip would call PG13)
"It totally does. If Dame missed that game winner a couple years ago that Paul George called a bad shot, you can't tell me people wouldn't have thought it was dumb to shoot a contested 35 foot fadeaway. People only call it a bad shot if you miss it."

"Totally agree that it would be great to get actual analysis. Shaq's being dumb here but I'm also dumb and don't understand why pre-switching doesn't work. Or even what that really means. NBA analysis is all drama and dumb conversations about if Paul George has what it takes or whatever. The NFL is much better about this, every play you get a replay where Tony Romo explains what just happened from an Xs and Os angle and how the quarterback read the defense. Give me a halftime segment called ""who messed up"" and show clips and the panel debates which defender didn't rotate or which offensive player didn't space right."
if paul george said this id request a security detail be sent to his house
"Yep, this exact situation happened to Paul George in 2014. He was the frontrunner and the Pacers were dominant till the ASG, both fell apart after, and George wasn't even in MVP discussions by the end of the season."
"Paul George hit the side of the backboard in a Game 7 where the Clippers were down double digits after blowing a 3-1 lead with multiple second half double digit leads. And Milwaukee was already eliminated by this time. So yea, when the two teams thought to be better than the Lakers were eliminated, people knew they would win."
Do you genuinely believe the duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is better than the duo of Lebron James and Anthony Davis? That Clippers team also had so many chemistry problems all season long and could never get it right.
"The moment Paul George hit the backboard, everyone and their grandma knew that the Lakers were going to win the championship."
"While technically not a true LA boy, Paul George fits the bill"
"&gt;It begs a question - are Duncan Robinson, Paul George, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Joe Harris less known or have they all been simply unavailable for the 3PT competition?     Joe Harris already won the 3pt competition before and has been outspoken about being against this years All-star weekend. I'm sure he got invited but declined it"
Or he might just drive and get a layup cause you know he’s superhuman in his prime. Does anyone remember the Indy series when lebron blew by Paul George for the gw layup?
"Tatum has the great combination of being on a team with a huge fanbase, being a wing player, and having an aesthetically pleasing playstyle all which led to him being crowned as the next great star.   He's more the next Paul George than the next Kobe or whatever the fuck casuals think he is."
"I'm not acting like they had a much better team, I'm pointing out that a team that was supposed to be a ton worse after losing their MVP and guy who was in the discussion for MVP, Paul led them to have more wins, which ultimately is the measure of a good team. It's not that I think the Paul Thunder were categorically better than the Westbrook/George Thunder, it's that by all accounts at the time they were supposed to be significantly worse. For Paul to lead them to a better record is insane given those expectations"
"I think the okc one doesn't do justice because that was a .300 team after blowup of Westbrook and George, the team last year would be kind of like what we see today.  They went from Westbrook team to sell everyone for tank. But they got Chris Paul who is the anti tank god and got them to the playoffs.  That was the biggest accomplishment from bringing a trash team to a playoff team."
"Wow. Imagine a team with a 60% new roster and basically no training camp starting off an early season game poorly against a supposed championship contender that's been with each other for 2 years. The Suns knew like 2 plays from Monty's at that point.   Also, 10+ point differential means very little when it's at halftime. The NBA is a game of runs. Suns outscored the Clippers 63 to 48 on the second half. I wouldn't call that game a blowout. Especially since the final score was a 5 point difference.    And It's not our fault you guys failed handle the Suns halftime adjustments. The only Clipper that played well in the second half was Paul George."
Paul George does this every year.
"He can be the best offensive player but if he's far and away your best player not much will result, I think u pair him up with like a 2-way star around his level like AD or Paul George that works"
I want them to get married so PGs name can be Paul George-Paul

"Yeah a team with Pat Bev, Marcus Morris, Paul George, and Rondo were probably just trying to have a nice friendly match"
"&gt; This is going to sound incredibly stupid, I'm sure, but in some ways his offensive career for that era is a blend of Durant and Curry.  Yeah Ive heard this before. Around the rim touch, quickness of his release, movement, and how he had a clear impact beyond the box score on team offensive productivity I can see the Steph comp. The gravity stuff he talked about.   With Larry he was never the seamless scorer Durant was. Durant its a little bit of the opposite in the sense that Durant has plenty of nights where I think he overall has a C/C- game for his standards and still drops 30. But if you just talk about size and ability to get jumpers off at a high level then yeah there you go. If Paul George was a better playmaker, that's the comp I would go with in some ways."
Lol a Paul George fan saying another player is crying
Debated between Paul George and Khris Middleton. Ill be nice and pick the lesser option Khris Middleton.

After Paul George drained the dagger in Aytons face
He didn’t even win 50 games either of the Paul George years and then got bounced handily in the playoffs in large part due to his inefficient play. I love Westbrook but there’s a reason why triple doubles have become a watered down achievement and he’s to blame.
" ""I watch every single Mavs game and he never takes open 3s""  Sounds like either a strong exaggeration or you have a different definition of an open shot to them.  I don't know so that is just a guess and a question, but I have an impression Second Spectrum measures how far away the defender's feet are when the shot starts. ""Tight"" three-point shots are generally very rare in their tracking stats. Maybe 20% of all shots for some players, maybe closer to 0% for others.  But yeah, Doncić has to be the number one in the league in amount of step back threes he's taking. Below 38% is nothing special in itself (Curry made above 47% for example, Paul George 57%), but he's made twice as many as Curry and 50% more than Lillard."

"Got drafted by Orlando  A very, very incompetent Magic FO traded him for a half season of Ibaka (stupid move)  Paul George wanted out so OKC traded him  Had one fantastic season in Indy, but didn't return to form and still fancies himself a max contract or playing in Miami so when Indy found an opportunity to get off of him for a cost-controlled asset in LeVert they jumped without hesitation.  A very, very incompetent Houston FO couldn't flip him for an asset and sent him to his choice of destination."

Looks like Paul George with a less melted head.
You don’t need stats to know Paul George is not the same player in the playoffs compared to how good he is in the regular season. If he performed how he did in the regular season there’s no doubt OKC goes further and the Clippers make the WCF.

PAUL GEORGE
"Paul George putting the Suns to sleep, I love it."
Paul George for sure. Have you seen his hairline?
"This is fair from looking at box scores... but if you watched the games you’d have a different opinion. I defended the lack of calls until about a month ago, but the last month has been absurd. He’s getting hacked all the time and had 0 FTA in almost half his games. Paul George literally landed on his shoulders and knocked him to the ground on a layup with no whistle. It’s really, really egregious at this point."
Might have to lean on paul George to edge this win out. Clippers seem out of sorts so far
"It seems like any team that was a number one seed in the east over the past decade, fit this criteria, it's pretty much been accepted that LeBron's teams haven't always made the regular season a priority, nobody bought that the DeRozan Raptors, the Isaiah Thomas Celtics, the random ass 60 win Atlanta Hawks or the Paul George Pacers were going to the finals"
&gt; Paul George has been lighting it up  There's your answer.
Paul george with the insane shot making
Paul George revenge season!
"&gt;He’s trying to recruit Curry when Curry is a FA in like 3 years lol.   Not sure if you've followed the NBA in the last few years, but being under contract doesn't preclude guys from being recruited. Star players have more power than ever before to force a trade to their desired team. See: AD, Harden, Kyrie, Paul George, etc. And if Klay is unable to fully recover from his injuries, Steph would definitely be available for the right price."
Defensive P + Offensive P = PP  Basically I'm begging for Paul George to show his PP.
Paul George
"For me, he was arguably the best but i can see how curry has a strong argument for it. Russ regressed a lot when they acquired paul george. Probably tried way too hard to let paul george fit in and it all went downhill from there"
Story out about how Lebron is recruiting Steph Curry right now.  lebron tried to recruit Paul George and Kawhi and successfully recruited AD.  100% he would recruit Harden if he could.
"&gt;The percentage of shooting fouls as and 1's is a complete garbage cherry picked stat.  I don't even understand your complaint or how this could possibly be cherry picked. It's a fact that Jokic gets fewer free throws per shooting foul than Embiid/Trae/Lillard, and part of that is due to his higher and-1 conversion rate.  &gt; his percentage is only high because he doesn't get shooting fouls called at all   Jokic getting relatively few shooting fouls does not explain why he converts a high percentage of and-1s. That doesn't make any sense.  If refs were only calling the most egregious fouls, while letting the less egregious stuff slide, that would *reduce* his and-1 conversion percentage.  &gt;You think Embiid or Giannis get absolutely tackled with a bonus elbow to the head by Paul George and don't get a call? Try telling me with a straight face any other superstar doesn't get that call.  I doubt either Embiid or Giannis has been tackled from behind by PG without a call, though I'm sure they've both been egregiously fouled without a call.  Also, Jokic is lucky he even got 2 points out of that play given that he should have been called for a foul on the entry pass when he was [holding the defender's arm down](https://streamable.com/65icsi)."
"The percentage of shooting fouls as and 1's is a complete garbage cherry picked stat.  He is 34th in the league in and 1's, his percentage is only high because he doesn't get shooting fouls called at all (36th).  He gets absolutely hammered going to the bucket several times every game with basically zero calls shooting.    He draws non-shooting fouls well, since he basically forces the opponent to double and swipe and grab to stop him.  And the fact that the refs allow him to be mugged every time he drives to the basket makes players feel like they can get away with anything against him.    The fact of the matter is he doesn't get calls that every other superstar in the league gets with consistancy.  You think Embiid or Giannis get absolutely tackled with a bonus elbow to the head by Paul George and don't get a call?  Try telling me with a straight face any other superstar doesn't get that call."
paul george Indiana Pacers run
Or trading for paul george
"I think Paul George abs Hayward wanted to leave if there was a super max or not , but also if there was no super max drafted stars would probably just leave for bigger markets bc they can get a max anywhere"
i mean a lil while back paul george got you an ecf visit out of nowhere. So you have had those times in the last decade
"Not really. Klay has done it 7 times, Harden has done it 6 times, Dame will have 7 after his next game, Paul George has done it 3 times, Kemba has done it 3 times.  I feel like people give Curry waaay too much credit for the 3 point revolution.  He didnt start it, he was just the best at it"
when he played next to paul george in 2019 and harden in 2020 (before bubble when lakers trapped harden every possession) westbrook shot less jumpers. if he’s shooting that many it’s cause his teammates will probably do worse
No he is talking about seventh game of 2021 finals of clippers vs nets in which paul george infamously finishes an ally oop right before the buzzer that was thrown to him off the backboard by kawhi Leonard giving the clippers our first championship and then we finally get bullied less by lakers fans
That's a bad shot.   -Paul George  For reals though. Happy to see that shot.
Paul George level
"I'd be shocked if Kawhi didn't resign with the Clippers, but there may be some intrigue if the Clippers fail to get out of the second round again and it's due in large part to PG not showing up. By resigning with the Clips, he's tying the rest of his prime to being paired with Paul George (zero other teams are trading for that unless it involves salary dumping AKA not a move that would actually help LA.)"
People seemed to be convinced on here during the offseason that the Clippers were done for and that the Thunder were going to be rolling in lottery picks after Paul George and Kahwai left their hometown team for mystery team with the cap space to sign them.
"Honestly, if that happens, I think Paul George is more likely to pull some Paul George shit."
his mid range isn’t undeniable like kawhi’s. If you put a real stopper on him he can’t really do well in the playoffs. Paul George completely shut him down in that first round series in 2016
I genuinely think it depends on how his team performs in the playoffs. He’s a competitive guy and I don’t think he wants to strap himself to a serial playoff under performer in Paul George &amp; a team with almost no flexibility due to large almost unmovable contracts at every position with almost no future assets if he doesn’t believe that they can win or at least compete with the best. He was already linked to the Knicks during the Spurs trade &amp; they are in both a position to pay him &amp; compete. Especially if they do a sign &amp; trade which I feel he will do for the franchise. I just know he wants to compete and if this team has any sort of post-season meltdown it will compound their all time meltdown last season &amp; I don’t know if that’s how he wants to end his career.
"&gt;Opinion: I think we all expected this.  So you're going to make me go back through all the comments about how funny it would be when he doesn't re-sign with the Clips after the Paul George trade, huh?"
Paul George is always hated on by our fanbase.
"It’s a very interesting issue indeed, jokic is plenty physical he bulldozes over guys in the paint all the time. The other day he didn’t get a single ft, there was a moment when Paul george literally jumped on him and knocked him down and the ref saw it and nothing, same against Magic he gets whacked in the face right in front of ref and nothing, there are plenty more samples that I obviously can’t list but I believe he’s had 4 or 5 games without a single ft which is insane considering his style. Why isn’t the nba doing something? It’s quite ridiculous."
Probably Paul George and Kawhi
"I do too, to an extent. I’m always caught off-guard by the visceral hate Kyrie and Paul George receive."

"&gt; The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   That's a result of a salary cap system where you have four players taking up $130 million in annual salary, with a salary cap that is only $109 million.  The league is literally set up to make sure it becomes impossible to effectively construct a winning roster over many years. It's the sole reason why we do not have perpetual dynasties in the NBA.   &gt;They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn’t get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  I mean, the only pass that isn't a clearly good pass there is Jimmy Buttler, and with his history of ""locker room issues"", that's hardly something you can blame them for. I'm not sure anyone other than Pat Riley could have gotten him on the right track.   &gt;He’s never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who’s the risk?   AD has absolutely been an MVP candidate.  Neither KAT nor AD are risks, but I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that AD is significantly more valuable than KAT.   &gt;Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That’s sad.  Of course it is. One ring is obviously *much* more important to a franchise that has never won one. Only 19 of the 30 teams in the NBA has ever won a championship. 10 out of 30 has won more than one.  Winning *a ring* should be the number one priority for almost every team in the league, without question.   &gt;Part of the Lakers “history” is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Yeah, good thing they never shafted someone like Shaq.   Oh, wait.  &gt;Oh and you know who cited Thomas’ situation as a reason he didn’t want to be in Boston? AD.   He sure did, but literally everyone knew his only destination was the Lakers. He also pretended like he was interested in Knicks, like literally every single major free agent player does. And none of them *actually* have any intentions to play there.  It's almost as if the publicly released statements celebrities make aren't always the truth.  Almost.  &gt;How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ?   So you're talking about *the one time* Krause actually said *organizations win championships, not players*? The statement which Krause clearly and sensibly explained in a rational matter literally the next day.  &gt;At this point dude, you’re in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye.  I'm not in denial, you're just trying to argue revisionist history like you're on the Fox News editorial staff."
"Paul George, I get why a lot of people don’t like him but they try to down play how good he is."
"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
"You need to look at Randle’s efficiency. His counting stats are inflated because of his minutes totals. He is at average efficiency. He’s had a wonderful year but I can’t see him as anything outside of third team given Paul George is a guard. Lebron has been amazing this year, especially defensively, I don’t think there is an argument for that flip existing. Finally, Butler has had a wonderful year but team record when out is extremely noisy…who else was out when he didn’t play? I have him third team with George as a forward. Irving and Trae Young have had fantastic years for guards. Beal’s season is very overrated because he scores a lot of points. I see him more similar to LaVine’s season as opposed to something that would get him to third team. Harden and Irving and Trae are the biggest omissions. I’m gonna assume Durant not playing half the year is the reason he missed your cut (perfectly fine with that but you didn’t mention it in your “left off” list). I don’t think Paul has been good enough to make an All-NBA team with how stacked Guard is right now, his team doing better than last year seems to be leading the charge for his contention but that doesn’t really play out when comparing his stats and watching him play compared to other guards (Irving, Harden, Young). Otherwise pretty solid, seems like the easiest center year to rank in a while. Gobert is the entire defense by himself basically, the on/off stuff for him on that end is extremely good. I don’t think Bam is close to him."
we traded Tony Bradley in the George Hill trade with OKC lol you’ll be seeing Mike Scott (downgrade) or BBall Paul (slight upgrade) tonight
Jimmy is better than Paul George &amp; Dame
Paul Pierce is to Kobe as George Karl is to Gregg Popovich
yeah he’s really taken the pressure off of kawhi and pg to play make so they can just do their own thing. it’s what paul george said doc did to him last season (forcing him into a role he’s not really right for) and everyone clowned him lol

"They were 50 win teams because of CP3. Simple. Blake and deandre were talented. But they couldn't shoot. The lane was clogged at the end of games which in the modern NBA is just so hard to overcome in the 4th quarter. Those clippers teams were talented, but the way that roster was constructed was flawed.   If you replace Blake Griffin/DJ for Paul George for example, I think that would've solved so many problems for those clippers teams with spacing plus perimeter D."
What about Paul George?

I mean at least he got names right lol. And it’s not like he said Anthony Davis and Paul George or something. The guys he said are at Least candidates
"Giannis is absolutely a superstar. Only 2 other players have won MVP+DPOY and they were MJ and Hakeem.  I would say Paul George is a good example . He has a signature shoe (which is a big deal tbh) and nights where he has superstar performances but he, to my knowledge, has never been the best within his role. His biggest accolade is finishing top 3 in MVP voting."
Sounds like Paul George.
"Paul George 23/7REB/5AST on 47/41/88. Jimmy 22/7/7 on 50/21/86. They’re on the same tier for me, but PG edges him out slightly earning him the 2nd team spot. He’s shooting 20% better from 3."
He wasn't a top 3 player man lol. He did finish 3rd place in 1994 but that's like Paul George finishing 3rd in 2018. Great season but calling him a top 3 player.. nah
"paul george will suck again in the playoffs, the man plays scared as fuck, TO and bricking machine, i don't know how you expect to win a title with a second option like him. Why the fuck did Kawhi chose this bum as his co star??? i don't get it"
Paul George isn't better lol he's def in their tier
I mean Paul George is better than Tatum/Dame and he’s not a super star. Let alone a zero doubt superstar.
Paul George.
It’s called the Andy Dalton line right?  I remember a couple years ago it was Paul George but I guess now would be like... Jimmy butler? Idk first thought
Paul George
George Paul back just in time
"I always thought if Randle could just get a reliable jump shot, especially a 3-pt shot, then he'd be a max level player. I was not at all happy when the Lakers simply let him go, but I know it was part of whatever their feud was with his agent, Aaron Mintz (who also was the agent for D'Angelo Russell and Paul George)."
okc has a very short history  but if i tries it would be   1-westbrook  2- durant  3- ibaka  4-steven adams  5- nick collison  6- paul george  7- james harden  8- chris paul  9- thabo sefolosha  10- shai gilgeous alexander  11-kendrik perkins  12- jeff green  or somethingh like that
So does Paul George
Paul George was a detriment and showed up for 2 playoff games in 2 seasons.   Adams was an above average role player
He had Paul George and Steven Adams two seasons. And he never came close to getting out of the first round.
"I want some size! **Ben Simmons - Paul George - Kristaps Porzingis** (only for 3-pointers and back-up defender) - **Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert** (for me Mitchell number 1 at Jazz because of usage and his clutch time role). Maybe it's not most powerfull team, but I would watch this team play once!"
"I don’t think we do any better personally. We didn’t lose that series because of Paul George or kawhi choking. The entire team just failed especially on defense and let the nuggets best player exploit a mismatch.   Game 7 our strategy seemed to be exclusively guard Jokic and Murray for 2 quarters and hope none of the other players hit an open shot. And when they inevitably did, the plan just seemed to be “do nothing.”"
I don’t even remember most of it but the stat sheet thing I definitely can recollect. Didn’t Rudy ban teammates from reading statistics but only allowed himself to read his own?   It was something rather goofy along those lines but it only emphasized the lack of solidarity at the time. Analytics and metrics didn’t favour Rudy at all and it wasn’t like the live concert was rather spectacular.  I feel like he was still sort of like a surprising coveted name that we were able to acquire. I feel like it’s easier to get a player like Rudy or even Kawhi than it would be to get a Paul George. It’s a rather interesting concept that needs to be explored.
Take note Paul George
"I mean you think they're doing something wrong. If you're a Clippers or Heat fan and Paul George or Jimmy Butler are about to be pushed off the team because of Embiid, you probably don't like it.  The NBA gives very few instructions with the ballots so there is no ""right"" way. They want different perspectives and takes on how voting should work. It's basically the diversity argument. The more styles of thinking, the better."
Just not professional and it only would kill his value and KAT seems like he generally loves the organization so I dont think he would do that. Eternally that may be a discussion he has with ppl and when it comes out he is traded a couple days later. I dontsee him going the Paul George or Harden Route
"of course, but it’s not kawhi leonard or paul george."
*laughs in Paul George*
Can I have Paul George please? :) With the San Diego Clippers picture too if it's possible
Top of that list would be Zach Lavine however I could see it being Sabonis as well. His lady likes warmer weather and frankly I'm a little jaded after Paul George and Victor Oladipo
And draw Paul George there too?  So a clippers team with less defense?
"Despite his personality, I could see him getting along just fine with a Prima Donna, like Paul George for example. They would compliment each other well enough to crush competition. Let's just hope they don't end up together."
"KAT is the only player who would be worth it for them and could maybe be available as things sit right now.  But they'd need to extend the package to something like Wiseman, the 5th pick, the Warriors own '21 pick,  and 2+ future 1sts or something like that. Plus the salary matching: whether that's Wiggins to a third team for more assets since he's good now, Oubre S+T, etc.  It's so convoluted that I think they just keep the assets though, especially since it's probably not enough. With Giannis signing the supermax, the Wizards winning more (and Beal not really fitting), etc. not many guys are available right now. We didn't see Paul George to the Clippers either though."
"Honestly the only real solution to this is getting rid of max contracts.  It's not big markets vs small markets.  It's LA, NY, Miami and The Bay Area vs everyone else.  Dallas and Houston are big markets but they haven't been that much luckier in attracting and retaining big name free agents.  If you had no max contracts, there'd be no super teams.  How much would the Lakers have had to pay to get LeBron coming off his 2018 run ? 60% of their cap space ? 70% ?  How much would the Clippers have had to pay to get Kawhi coming off his 2019 run ?  Warriors and Steph ? Nets and KD ?  So right there you'd have Kyrie, AD and Paul George NOT on the teams they're currently on, and instead on one of these ""smaller"" market teams."
For sure and he’s never lost in the first round so if they do play the clippers I’m not worried. People forget lebron is a different monster in the playoffs and if Paul George plays how he always does in the playoffs then it’s easy
"The NBA is donating 100k for the winner, and 25k for each finalist. For a total of $200,000.   This is equivalent to half of a game check for Paul George.  &amp;#x200B;  Im not usually one to knock charitable donations, but is this really the best the NBA could do?"
"1st - Doncic, Curry, Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic  2nd - Lillard, Paul, Randle, LeBron, Embiid  3rd - Kyrie, Booker, Tatum, George, Gobert  Butler is a SUPERRR tough cut. Its a complete tossup between the last 2 forward spots on the 3rd team imo. Harden, Mitchell, and Beal are also tough."
"All-NBA 1st Team  C: Nikola Jokic  F: Joel Embiid  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  G: Luka Doncic  G: Steph Curry  All-NBA 2nd Team  C: Rudy Gobert  F: Julius Randle  F: Zion Williamson  G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  All-NBA 3rd Team  C: Bam Adebayo  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: LeBron James  G: Jimmy Butler  G: Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  Notable Snubs:  Tatum, Westbrook, KAT, Harden, Trae, Booker, Beal, Jaylen, Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie."
To this point the only argument for the other players has been that their counting stats all look similar. I would love to hear one argument for someone like Paul George or Julius Randle over Butler.
First Nikola Jokic Giannis Antetokounmpo Kawhi Leonard Damian Lillard Stephen Curry  Second Joel Embiid Julius Randle Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic Chris Paul  Third Rudy Gobert Zion Williamson Paul George Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell
"Well yeah, but to be fair if we don't seem to hit our jumpshots, it gets into the players heads quite a bit and they start panicking. I expect Rondo to bring in a cool head and control the situation on the floors when it matters. Also Paul George, my favorite player by the way, is prone to going hot-cold."
"I didn’t say the fans did that, I meant “they” as in the front office.  I don’t hate the players, I’m not a fan of Paul George, Zubac or Beverley but the rest I do like and think they’re good players  And the fan base was also annoying in the game threads as I mentioned"
1st  G - Curry G - Lillard F - Doncic F - Antentokoumpo C - Jokic  2nd  G - Paul G - Butler F - Randle F - Leonard C - Embiid  3rd  G - Beal G - George F - James F - Williamson C - Gobert
"How did the thunder manage Paul George to Clippers in a deal that netted Okc SGA Danilo Gallinari, first-round Clippers picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, first-round Miami Heat picks in 2021 and 2023, and the right to swap first-round picks in 2023 and 2025 but you're making the Harden trade seem good and they traded away the good thing they got LEVERT.  (Remember PG wanted out)  Westbrook has proven that hes alot better than wall and a first rounder.  ""Got Olynyk and rights to Miami’s first next year for Dipo"" Thats horrendous when you take in Olynk is a FA that's leaving."
"1st - Doncic, Curry, Leonard, Antetokounmpo, Jokic  2nd - Lillard, Paul, LeBron, Randle, Embiid  3rd - Kyrie, Booker, Tatum, George, Gobert"
"Fuck VO, most pacer fans feel the same way about VO as Paul George. He was a player that got so much better too quickly, got an ego, left after saying they wanted to stay, and then talk shit about us after the fact. I wish he hadn't gotten injured, but fuck that guy"
"Biased fan here but I think had he stayed with us the first time around, he would have had a higher ceiling and longer career. Sure he was inconsistent at times while playing for the Pacers, but he embodied the energy of Bankers Life Fieldhouse whenever he played. It's always been a ""what if"" for me had Lance taken that 44mil deal and blossomed even further on the Pacers (instead of going to Charlotte), and how that may have altered the events that led to the Paul George trade. Makes you wonder what other players may have developed their game further had they opted in to the team's contract and not move elsewhere."
Paul George still plays in OKC if this Melo showed up to the playoffs 3 years ago.
"Hard to say. The Raptors were a better defensive unit which probably translates to playoffs better, but the clippers have Paul George as their second option, who is a better scorer than anyone on that Raptors team besides Kawhi himself of course."

And Paul George is an overall better player than Shaq
"I mean there’s no way to measure feel, but we win the majority of the time he scored 30. Almost every single time he’s scored 30 and still lost, we’ve had one or both of Kemba/Jaylen out which is very hard for a not deep team. There are two exceptions which were a twelve point loss against the Nets with Kyrie and Harden and a six point overtime loss to the Pelicans without Smart where they had everyone.   And the wins he’s had are pretty impressive too. There was the 60 points against the spurs without Kemba where nobody else scored more than 17, against the warriors without Jaylen or Rob Williams where Steph scored 47 and Tatum scored 44 on better percentages (64/55.6/87.5), two wins against the Bucks where one was without Kemba, wins against the wizards where we didn’t have Jaylen or smart in one game and no Kemba or Rob in the other, clippers win where they had no Paul George but we didn’t have Jaylen or Smart.  Impact stats pretty much all agree that he’s been having a big impact on the game. The issue is that it often hasn’t mattered because he’ll frequently be in games where only two of all the other players in the game average at least ten points."
Same reason they think Paul George is automatically better
Donavan Mitchell over Paul George 100% wtf
Tatum has just as much of an argument over Lebron as Beal or Paul George have over Harden if Games played is actually a qualifier.
"That’s cold, just like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard during critical moments in a Clippers uniform"
I believe he had for the guards Steph and Luka first team.  Dame and Harden second.  Trae Young and I want to say Kyrie third team but it might be Booker I would need to double check.  As a caveat he has Butler and Paul George as Forwards.  Also he doesn't dock missing games unless its more than half the season like KD.  His thing is basically getting the 15 best players for that year on the team regardless of missed time again unless it's over half the season.
Offense plus defense for crying out loud. Kyrie deserves to be all NBA but Paul George has respectfully been better then him this season
"Yeah I usually think of players like that, because what they’re capable of is what can often be expected in the playoffs/ when it matters. I know what Paul George can do defensively, he may not show it much this regular season but he’s still got it. Kinda like with Klay Thompson, hasn’t played a minute this year, I can expect him to come in an shoot 40% from 3 whenever he comes back"
"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
This is revisionist history   He play with James Harden in Houston thé two where former MVPs in their prime that imo is a stacked team because of Westbrook’s obvious game holes that ended in a dumpster fire.  Westbrook played several seasons with Paul George who made all NBA first and third team when he played with Russ   Westbrook played with KD an all time great and an MVP.  Most MVPs never play with another MVP  Now Russ is playing with a player who will make 3rd team all nba and may win the scoring championship   While Russ has played with two and a first team all NBA player   Plus Russ has played with some great role players Ibaka won a championship with a different cast and was first team all defense when he played with Russ
It’s generally not a 16 game player ranking though.  It’s a regular season ranking.  If it was a 16 game playoff player ranking guys like Draymond and Iguodala would be top 10 and guys like Paul George would be out of this league lol  LeBron is a still a top 5 player in the league imo but his days of being number 1 are done.  He just doesn’t care enough or play enough in the regular season

Paul George in the playoffs
&gt; 2013: Paul George  is this a joke?
"The problem with Paul George trades is what trade are you doing? If you do a star swap, you’re going to end up with a worse star than Paul George because teams aren’t going to trade someone better to downgrade to Paul George. So then why are you trading Paul George?"
"If you’re the league MVP and have Paul George beside you, you shouldn’t be a 1st round exit 3 years straight."
Can’t defend any elite player? Look at kawhi Paul George and ADs field goal percentage the last 2 games lol
"Castro Valley is still clearly East Bay though even if it's not Oakland. It's not like Kawhi and Paul George claiming LA when they're from Riverside/Palmdale, which is technically LA County but like two hours away from the City of LA."
"Yeah, here's my top 10 in no particular order  LeBron, AD, Giannis, KD, Steph, Luka, Harden, Jokic, Embiid, Butler, Kawhi, George, Paul, Booker, Kyrie  I mean...you get my point right? Top 10 is super super crowded and competitive. You can't really get Gobert in there without leaving off someone you'd obviously take over him."
"i'm starting to think that Paul George will have an other disaster playoffs run, the dude is too fucking inconsistant and has a really low iq, large amount of his TO is the sumum of a low basketball IQ, too frustrating player"
The problem is comparing them to begin with tbh. Nobody expects Paul George to get the same attention as KD.  Dame is playing great ball. No need for comparisons in this context.
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, probably Jamal Murray"
"&gt; I'd give the series 60-40 to Warriors with both teams at full strength. Being down two starters is pretty significant. Let's reverse the roles with 2015 Warriors missing Iggy while HOU had Bev+Monti - does that series go past 5/6 in favor of the Rockets?  I’d say Warriors had enough depth for that even in 2015, especially since Monti would be the same or a worse liability on D Terrence Jones or Josh Smith were.  &gt; So what? OKC was a perennial WCF powerhouse that was out of the playoff picture due to injures. 2021 Lakers would love to have the Clippers not be in the playoffs with injuries to Paul George and Kawhi, and for two of Kyrie/KD/Harden be out in a potential finals. But not every run is as easy as 2015.  OKC being a perennial powerhouse in prior years still doesn’t mean they were as good as their 2016 version though. And the 2020 Lakers played an injured Lillard, Westbrook, Bam, and Dragic on their way to a ring. You don’t have to be out to say your injured. It’s not as bad as 2015, but no one puts asterisks on rings because rings are still rings. There are no ‘easy’ runs to rings.   &gt; There is a double-standard regarding takes on Curry's impact - that Curry elevates teams with KD/Klay but is absolved of any shortcomings without them.  What shortcomings do you talk about?  &gt; Curry mutually benefits from Klay/KD, but his fans act like gravity is a one-way street. Now that Klay/KD are not on the team, Curry has a chance to substantiate those absurd gravity claims, but is only scraping by as an 8-seed.  What did you expect the Warriors to be this season? Apart from Dray and Looney, he’s playing with newcomers, a G League cast, and rookies. Expecting them to be a top 4 seed is absurd. Even guys like Kobe wouldn’t drag this team to higher levels. We’ve seen his absolute peak drag a Lakers team as shitty as this one to a 7 seed and that was his absolute max.   &gt; You might say Curry's supporting cast isn't that great. I'm saying it's not as bad as people are describing.   +/- metrics would definitely disagree with you. So would the spacing metrics.  &gt; You might then say Klay will return. I'd then say a rehabbing Klay at 80% of himself isn't going to move the needle toward championship status. So given all this, Curry has a chance the next few years to prove he doesn't need KD. I'm saying he won't even get close to a title.  So basically, you expect the Warriors with one All NBA player in Steph, MAYBE enother one in Klay, and a declining Dray who’s not All NBA anymore, to prove themselves AFTER winning 3 rings? I call bullshit. How often to teams win without at least 2 All NBA caliber guys? There’s Mavs 2011, Spurs 2014, and Pistons 2004 off the top of ny head. That’s 3 teams since the start of 2000, and those were excellently constructed teams. What is with this extremely high bar?  &gt; I already explained why 2015 was another anomaly   Nope, you’re putting asterisks on titles, again. You want to give KD props for his rings, then yes I agree. But keep that same energy. You can’t just call a whole ass championship run an anomaly. There are so many factors that go on a championship run other than just the playoffs? Have you ever thought that maybe being good in the reg. season led to fresh legs for the Warriors in the playoffs? And that decreased their chances of getting injured? Sure their opponents getting injured was unfortunate, but calling their ring anything an anomaly is like saying KD’s rings don’t mean shit. And the thing is, they do.  &gt; Can Curry remain relevant without a stacked team? I'm saying no.  Man was relevant before KD came and relevant is relative. Do you mean relevant by contenders, or by being playoff teams? Because to do that you have to analyze what teams they’re gonna be on. I’m not gonna sit here and think that a team that gives significant minutes to Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee should win a ring. But I’d be shocked if a team with Steph, Klay, and Dray don’t make the playoffs."
"Jimmy Butler, Derozan, Paul George unless they win a 'ship"
"I mean, yeah, but there's a reason the Spurs beat the Heat and it's because of a lot of guys making more winning plays than the other team. that's why guys like Jalen Brunson go in the second round but become extremely useful role players, while uber athletes wash out of the league.   Jimmy Butler should not be better than Paul George, statistically and especially as a scorer. they're similar defenders and PG is usually a more efficient scorer but is there anybody who would rather have him over Butler right now? it's because Jimmy makes ""winning plays"" when it matters and PG doinks shots off the backboard. maybe I spent too much time watching the big three all succeed long past their primes because of ""winning plays"" and I'm just ignorant to how basketball works."
"Maybe perhaps the Heat were more talented? And maybe the 18' Celtics were more talented too? And perhaps Lebron's Cavs in '17 and '16? Or the eventual championship winning Raptors in '15?  It doesn't matter if it's Frank Vogel, Nate McMillian, or Nate Bjorkgren. The Pacers have never been talented enough to win in the Playoffs. Trust me, as a Hawks fan who saw his team go to the playoffs 10 years in a row from '08-'17 and get eliminated in the first round almost every time, I know what that looks like. Like Charles Barkley said about the Hawks on a hot mic during that span ""they just have some nice guys."" That's the Pacers since Paul George left."
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
"Since Jimmy Butler's breakout season in 2014, he has always been a better player than Paul George. People seem to be coming around to this now after the Heat made the Finals, but I think it has been true for most of each's career."
Paul George is having an all-nba season and is playing the best basketball of his career. A lot of people overreacted in the bubble.
"&gt; The point I tried making was that Beverley's defense would provide a bigger help than the Jet's offense, but I don't think it would extend it longer than 6 games.  I'd give the series 60-40 to Warriors with both teams at full strength. Being down two starters is pretty significant. Let's reverse the roles with 2015 Warriors missing Iggy while HOU had Bev+Monti - does that series go past 5/6 in favor of the Rockets?  &gt; And I think you're conflating the 2015 Thunder and the 2016 Thunder. The 2016 Thunder hit another gear defensively that postseason, something they hadn't done as well in prior seasons like 2014.  So what? OKC was a perennial WCF powerhouse that was out of the playoff picture due to injures. 2021 Lakers would love to have the Clippers not be in the playoffs with injuries to Paul George and Kawhi, and for two of Kyrie/KD/Harden be out in a potential finals. But not every run is as easy as 2015.  ---  There are too many rabbit holes to chase, so let me sum things up once more. There is a double-standard regarding takes on Curry's impact - that Curry elevates teams with KD/Klay but is absolved of any shortcomings without them.  Curry mutually benefits from Klay/KD, but his fans act like gravity is a one-way street. Now that Klay/KD are not on the team, Curry has a chance to substantiate those absurd gravity claims, but is only scraping by as an 8-seed.  You might say Curry's supporting cast isn't that great. I'm saying it's not as bad as people are describing. Even if it is, there's not much the Warriors can do about it with being capped out. Warriors fans need to get used to having standard cap rules apply instead of normalizing expectations around the inflated KD situation.  You might then say Klay will return. I'd then say a rehabbing Klay at 80% of himself isn't going to move the needle toward championship status. So given all this, Curry has a chance the next few years to prove he doesn't need KD. I'm saying he won't even get close to a title.  You might then say he already did that in 2015/2016. I already explained why 2015 was another anomaly but will give kudos for 2016, even though they fell short. Curry has become a better player since then, but I'd wager the overall league improved even more. Can Curry remain relevant without a stacked team? I'm saying no."
"Going by this year’s All-Star game:   - Zach LaVine - Nikola Vucevic - Domantas Sabonis - Mike Conley Jr.  My hottest take is that **Paul George** is going to be forgotten in the future, at least how good he was."
"Paul George, when he has braids he would make a great Star Trek character."
"Paul George, he’s a basketball player."
If we got carried by Kawhi why isn’t Paul George an nba champion
Kemba for Paul George
"&gt; Great players don’t give a damn about press and do what’s right.  They don't do what's right all the time though.  Westbrook would've stayed in OKC if Presti didn't find a buyer for that huge contract.  Not many players are toughing through an injury to come back to a 3-12 team infected with COVID.  Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, PG, etc aren't busting their ass for their non-title-contender team to do that.  Westbrook is special in that regard.    It just took this season for all of us to see it.  It was fuzzy as to whether or not he wanted to continue in OKC after George left and pushed his way to a very unpopular team with an even more diva of a star.  He took his lumps, and got traded to a team basically going nowhere this year, played his ass off (like he always has), through a torn quad, and resurrected a team that was 3-12 when he could've just said ""nah""      The narrative swung because of what he's done since the trade.  If he stays in OKC and does this with no help, people still probably come to this conclusion eventually.  If the Wizards trade never happens but Harden still leaves, he'd be doing this in Houston and they'd probably be pissed that they don't tank as well.  This was the first time we got to see Westbrook on his own since KD left GSW, but the rest of that roster still made the WCF the year before and acquired Paul George.  This Wizards team was far less talented, and he still got up for every game he could and dragged them to the playoffs."
Paul George Indy to OKC. Him requesting OKC to LA will work out well for him tho.
&gt; People just focus on the few exceptions where a guy consistently over/underperforms  I don’t think anybody argues these players never exist like I said before I think DeRozan would be one of the first ex people call a playoff underperformer. The bucks are a pretty analytically oriented franchise and clearly thought Bledsoe was too much of a playoff underperformer. It’s just the availability heuristic where these ex cause people to think it’s more common than it actually is   What we’re talking about with Jimmy Butlers playoff track record is basically the last 2 years. 33 games in a 11 year career. We can call it what it is 2 strong postseasons. I don’t 33 games to be that predictive of how he’ll play in the playoffs going forward and that’s where I probably disagree with others. That’s kind of my point with Paul George postseason 2013-17 vs 2018-20   And even with Butler it’s all relative the playoff reputation. When James harden has 12 points in an elimination game vs LA people don’t say “oh he was just too fatigued can’t blame him”. When Paul George averages 22/6/5 but goes 5/14 16 points 1 assist in an elimination game his team loses vs Toronto people will drag him not talk about how good he was.
It's not revisionist. Where's Terrance Ferguson? Where's Josh Huestis? Raymond Felton? Tell me how Steven Adams is looking in NOP?   Only guys doing something off them teams is Jerami Grant who's role was ridiculously diminished cuz he played alongside Paul George. And he didn't even break out fr until going to Detroit via Denver.
He played with Harden for 2 years (and had an insane record on the court together)  The rest of those guys should never be compared in the same sentence.  Like dude you’re genuinely comparing Paul George and Bradley Beal to Crawford and Stojakovic? Or 8 years of KD to Blake Griffin?  Im done here. You’re outta your mind
paul george redemption arc
Has the Paul George redemption arc arrived?
"A lot of insane exaggerations in this thread. Like ""Paul George is a definition of a hall of fame player"". Guys, he's a good player who's had a lot of playoff experience. He's had a few horrible playoff flameouts too. But overall, he's had a great career. But several guys who've had PGs career don't make the hall of fame.   I think there is a good chance he'll make it, because of the long resume he has, and how good of a player he is, the playoff battles he's had. But to call him ""the definition of a hall of fame player"" or a ""first ballot hall of fame lock"" is hyperbolic.   You can praise players without going overboard like this."
"Paul George is the definition of a hall of fame player?  lmao ya'll are insane. There's a chance he could make it, but the definition of one?? calm down"
Both Reggie Jackson and Paul George did deliver interestingly enough without Kawhi they had rly good defense on Mitchel and he shot only 4-14 from 3p Clippers might just go to the finals without their best man and suns might not have CP3 thats going to be interesting
"the world needs at least one elite paul george playoff run during his career, is this that year"
We’ve given Paul george enough shit over the years. A little redemption arc would be a nice change of pace
"Neither has Paul George, and I'm a huge fan"
"what i meant was kawhi was either john or paul, and paul george was either john or paul. i know who george harrison and ringo starr are lmao"
"Paul George on the Jazz fans:  ""They're against me for the right reasons. They are passionate. Very community-passionate state. As loud as this crowd gets, they are up there with the best of them. It's a pleasure to play in front of these fans."""
JINGLED! haha paul george you are joe ingles son hyuk hyuk
hes gonna replace cortana with paul george in the next version of windows
"Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, and Paul George might be the best big 3 in NBA history."
So Paul George didn't have bad performances before? Kudos to him for showing up though.
The Clippers got 7 free points off of absolutely bullshit technicals and flagrants. Clarkson got called for a flagrant off a flop from Batum. Then O Neale gets called for a Flagrant 1 on a regular common foul on Paul George. They get the ball back at Mann hits a 3…  Changed the whole game.
Paul George redemption arc
"Paul ""Playoff P"" George P"
"Tmac Pierce Paul George Melo VC Pierce and PG are the best two way players on the list, and Tmac and Pierce are the best playmakers. Melo and Tmac are the best two scorers, but Melo prob is the worst defender. Carter was weird cause he peaked early then didn’t really get any better. He also has the worst motor out the group"
He has Paul George. Clearly being carried
"Lew Alcindor and Paul Bunyan vs George Marcus and John Henry, who wins?"
Is this for Prime Paul George or Pandemic Paul George? 😅😅
Paul George
I’m happy for Paul George. I still remember watching him smash open his leg playing for team USA. I root for anyone that comes back from that type of injury and plays at such a high level.
"Gobert has been elite in isolation and switches but useless in space. You have to watch the plays where his man ends up with a non contested 3 or when he doesn't do the same scramble drills because he can't. That doesnt show up on the advanced stat sheet. I've been impressed by his defense on Kawhi and Paul George, but I thought he had faster feet than what he has shown because he is not getting out the line or making multiple rotations. Not even close."
As a staunch Paul George defender I apologize for forgetting this.
I mean Paul George had his best season of his career after his injury.
"Yeah. As a Heat fan I hated that Pacers team, but still had a lot of respect for Paul George.   Fuck Roy Hibbert and Lance Stephenson though."
will this go to the top of the nba as it would have if paul george had shot it
Paul George cured my depression.
Paul George P
One of the tweets I remember most of any tweet of all time for some reason is ...  “Lebron is running out of eyes for Paul George to absolutely bang shots in”  He was a dog there.
"Paul George played really well tonight and I’m happy for him. That being said, the rest of the starting 5 shot 25/45 and only turned the ball over twice. I highly doubt that happens again, so I have Utah coming back and winning the series.   Trae is a monster, I think they have all the momentum and the confidence right now, and I think Doc is losing the locker room FAST. If Philly takes it to seven I’m assuming Trae has one of the worst games of his life in Game 6.   Hate the Nets, but KD is unstoppable and playing with all the confidence in the world. I think Milwaukee is being out coached and outside of game 4, Giannis is settling for jumpers way too often. With a hobbled Harden I still think Brooklyn wins the series, but in 7 games."
"This is wrong. People have different definitions of choking but the past seasons Paul George averaged, 23/28/25 in the playoffs. How's that choking? He's been good in every series he's played in his career. He had alot of pressure also playing the heatles"
ive been watching a lot of paul george separation highlights these past couple weeks lmao
Paul George fucking hates Mormons and national parks
"From George Paul to Paul George, Utah with their top level defense cant stop him"
They won't. Paul George is on a roll
"By Paul George being way better than anyone ever gives him credit for, and the Clips being nice and deep with options for shooters"
"Exactly. I'm baffled why people keep saying he's a better defender then Paul George. He's one more dpoy award's sure but given Paul George defense, especially in these playoffs"
Is 2013-2014 Paul George finally back?
Lol what? Paul George is simply a better player then gobert. Any season since they've been in the league
"Is it me or would Paul George be more effective as the number 1 scoring option for the Clippers over Kawh when he returns? I know it’s just one game but PG played more aggressive when he was put in position to be the #1 scoring option compared to when he’s the second option and settling for 3’s. And yes Kawhi is capable of having big games but I think he would be even more effective as a player and for the Clippers if he averaged around 20-22 points and 8 boards along with great defense, it would probably be less stress on his body as well since he continues to get injured."
"If the Jazz end up winning the series i don't think people will give Paul George the credit he deserves for this game, they will just remember it as a good performance."
Both top 20.  Both provide very similar levels of production in different areas.  This was Paul George night but it shouldn’t take away from what Gobert can do when he isn’t surrounded by piss poor defensive players who have no instincts whatsoever.
Lol Paul George is the definition of a hall of fame player. When he's career is over he will be there
Paul George is playing good..... I don't like this.
I love how Paul George is finally getting the respect he deserves.
Paul George has been good this playoffs. He wasn’t great in game 1 this series but after that he has been pretty great and tonight that was a legacy game for him
"of course, even more so! Paul George shutting off the noise is a great feeling"
Paul George really redeemed himself tonight. I can respect that. He finally tuned out the noise and absolutely delivered when it was needed most. This win feels like it will decide the series.
Paul George &gt; French Roy Hibbert
I'm specifically talking about this game though regardless of the series. This was a statement from Paul George
"Paul George easily lol, his player archetype of scoring wing that’s an elite defender, ballhandler and a decent playmaker is the most valuable in the league and he’s one of the best players in the league"
Paul George
*Insert Paul George Apology Form Here*
Paul George choked big time... he is a Playoff Pee Pee Poo Poo
Paul George is the best player in the world
"Paul George has been playing amazing the last few games, but his handles still suspect."
Paul George and it isn't close
"Paul George. Capable of near DpoY defense and also elite offensively. Rudy is the best defender yes, but he’s one dimensional on offense."
"This Clippers team is so easy to root for tbh...it’s scary. How can you not love Mann, Zubac, Kennard, etc...and Paul George, who is in the ultimate redemption arc right now."
"The Clippers came out ready to fight without Kawhi and the Jazz looked like they were expecting an easy win. I would really like to see Conley back or this might be over next game. Paul George was really good, as much as I hate say it, and Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann have earned my respect for stepping up big time in this series. Here's hoping it goes game 7"
Paul George is better and has been for a while
Paul George carrying y’all to the title by himself would be so cool
Like yeah the role players deserve some credit but this game tonight was all Paul George. Magnificent defense and stellar offense
Can we get a Paul George vs. Kevin Durant finals with their star teammates on the shelf and watch this sub spontaneously self-combust?
Crazy uPsets today..  Perfect Playoff Performance by Paul George.
"So many choke jobs these playoffs, lol. Paul George had a great game, can't hate on him tonight."
I love when Paul George plays basketball.
"There was no beef, Paul George always plays well against Utah even in that series they lost Paul George played well"
"Paul George comes up big! Sure he had some bad turnovers and questionable shots in the 4th, but he stepped up big time without Kawhi. Morris and Jackson did their thing too"
PAUL GEORGE STUNTED ON THESE HOES
"100 comments and cant find a single Utah flair.   Just putting these out here:  Paul ""doesnt perform against Jazz"" George  Paul ""Ingles' son"" George  Rudy ""worth the max"" Gobert"
Everybody talks about how Paul George had 35 and put the team on his back without Kawhi. But nobody talks about the other players who stepped up like Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson. Also shout out to Terance Mann for putting a DPOY Gobert on a poster.
Paul motherfuckin George
Letting Paul George come to town and have maybe his best performance against them
Paul George and Trae Young competing for the playoff villain crown
Paul George should've just gave up like Lebron.
Paul George has the most to gain by winning a championship this year
PAUL MOFOKKING GEORGE
"Paul George stepped up huge tonight, respect to him."
The son of Paul George Sr. and Paullette Ann George
ARE SECOND STARS HOLDING PAUL GEORGE BACK?
"Paul George went dumb, fuck all the haters Clippers to the finals"
"please if there was a reason we never made the WCF ever before, please tell me it's so we can have a Paul George superstar game where Staples Center gets to be back at full capacity"
The Paul George haters are sick.
"I remember a nephew made a thread about Paul George and Ben Simmons swap would be winning for both. What a disrespect to PG13, my man was balling"
PAUL CLIFTON ANTHONY GEORGE.
LETS GO PAUL GEORGE HATERS QUIET AF RN
Paul George is really gonna lead the Clippers to their first Western Conference Finals. Insane
The Playoff P we were Promised   No more slander for Paul George.
"3 straight 30 point games for Paul George, this one without Kawhi. r/NBA hold my dick"
Does anyone else feel like Paul George shows up when he's batman and not Robin?
Paul George showed up tonight. Credit where due.
Paul George is now clutch apparently
[Jazz fans to Paul George](https://youtu.be/lJll_D2o1KY)
PAUL GEORGE REDEMPTION ARC
"Give Paul ""Playoff P"" George his fucking due.     On the road, in one of the loudest arenas in the league against the #1 seed, without Kawhi Leonard, and he balls the fuck out and leads his team to a victory.  Any other star player does this and the number one post on the front page would be about his performance."
"People will look at this as the Paul George game, but the Clippers role players stepped up big time. Also, in the same night, Doc Rivers blew a big lead and the Clippers upset a favorite"
Paul George
It’s not like Russ forced his way out either   Paul George was leaving and the Thunder were getting a treasure trove of assessing. Westbrook doesn’t make sense on a rebuild   The Thunder fully blew it up because they could get CP3 and a bunch of picks too   Westbrook didn’t act like Davis/Harden and force his way out
Watch the clippers game harden played in when he was in Houston. Bro had a healthy westbrook too and they were throwing Paul George and Kawhi fucking Leonard at him at half court.
"&gt;Eh idk man who goes through all the trouble of saying what you said as a joke lol  What trouble? It took 2 minutes to type out haha.  &gt;On top of that it clearly wasn’t really a joke lol.  I dislike the guy as a player sure but it was clearly over the top and exaggerated. It was blatantly a bit of craic.  &gt;You must be a hit at all the parties if that’s you’re definition of funny.  And you must be a hit if you canny have any banter without being triggered.     &gt;Also how am I triggered lmao,  Because you're taking a daft post on **reddit** so seriously. It's the Internet. Nobody is serious here. It's all just banter between fans. Nobody takes it serious. Well, clearly some of you do 😅🙈  If I said ""I hope Chris Paul slips and accidentally bites his own cock off, which sickens him so much he spews it back up into his sons mouth like a mother bird feeding its baby"" are you honestly saying you think this is serious? Have you never watched George Carlin or Dave Chappelle? Have you never seen South Park? Rick and morty? Never had conversations like this with your mates?   Its _obviously_ exaggerated for comedic effect."
Past 10 years? Surely Paul George after the broken leg.  This season : will give it to Steph  Next season : Either one of Klay or Kawhi (hopefully Kawhi)
"The players are freaking dead man! Did you see what Giannis looked like in the Nets series games 5/6/7? He was literally exhausted, gasping for air within the first quarter. I’ve never seen this guy ask for a sub in the first quarter, and i’ve seen him do it 4 times in the nets and suns series alone. Paul george was absolutely gassed in the WCF. Not to mention all the injuries we’ve had are undoubtedly an issue of fatigue. Playoff quality is due to injuries, not rest."
No one is talking about Paul George. We're talking about perpetual crybaby Devin Booker and his excellent tackling form.
Neither Minnesota nor Indiana was interested in trading for CJ. That’s the drawback of being overpaid and undersized.  Other GMs aren’t knocking on your door to give you  Paul George or Butler
"Not fair to compare the Harden haul to the potential Lillard haul. Rockets got that many picks and swaps because the Nets are champ contenders and most of those picks will be shit. Also, Nets had no other major assets. Also, they had to give more because Harden puts them over the top. Kind of like how the Clippers had to overpay for Paul George since he came with Kawhi and they’d become contenders. These other teams aren’t in the same situation at all so expecting the same number of picks and swaps is unreasonable"
"This isn’t context it’s just rationalizations, word context is just devoid of any meaning on here. The rockets had James harden under multiple years left. Not one multiple. Hell Jrue holiday only had one year left. Contenders overpay for stars LAC did for Paul George also which is part of why this is such a joke yhe nets are a win now set up you have an advantage there and instead you get back this junk. Harden had 2 years left 2 years is a lot plenty of contenders can role the dice on 2 years suggesting otherwise is foolish. His list doesn’t matter nearly as much when it’s 2 years left   All teams who trade super stars have compromised leverage to an extent. Houston wasn’t unique. Hell Paul George asked OKC for a trade and they still got a good return. All this is Tillman kicking the can down the road giving himself years to sell false hope and duck the tax. By the time it’s like 2028 all the picks are in and people can see how much this deal sucked nobody will care anymore and people will have moved on. He knows exactly what he’s doing"
Paul George in 2015-16.
I wouldn’t say they were for sure better than the Pacers. Paul George was better than anyone on the Grizzlies and Roy Hibbert was no slouch either
its still just 4 games.  Lebron 2011 Finals didn't negate his whole season as a top 3 player  Dirk 2007 first round didn't mean he wasn't a superstar  Paul George last postseason didn't mean he wasn't a top 15 player  You play a long enough career and shit will happen. He's had long enough a track record to fall back on that this one playoff series shouldn't have people dropping him below 20.
Paul George
I have never once heard of anyone calling Paul George a shooting guard.
Or way before that. Olshey could have traded CJ for Butler or Paul George. You can’t tell me that he couldn’t have competed with Covington plus saris or Sabonis/Oladipo
"That's not true though. Next season, guys like Cam Payne, Reggie Jackson, etc. might come back to earth, and guys like Joe Harris and all of the Bucks shooters might remember how to shoot again.  Or Paul George makes his FTs... or reverts back to his playoff/pandemic P days and never plays good enough to get them into a situation where those FTs matter.   Or Chris Paul might have a healed shoulder, or left wrist, or right hand, or whatever is bugging him... or he's a year older and loses just enough of a step to lose effectiveness.  There are so many hypotheticals you can imagine, but none of them matter. Even less so if we start talking about next year as if it would be an indicator for how things could have gone this year (e.g., if the Lakers are able to shore up their terribly constructed roster, or the Nets are able to get more than a dozen games to work on their chemistry... then clearly one would expect next year's team to be better than this year's)"
Paul George
"The teams still have to make shots. I mean, the refs can't put the ball in the basket for them. Look at the end of the Suns game 2 with the Clippers. The refs were trying to get LA the win, but Paul George misses two free throws and then Ayton completes the out of bounds lob dunk for the win."
"That's part of what causes him to be overrated imo. These games haven't rlly been consistent in the playoffs or regular season, and his game hasn't evolved to the point where he's very impactful when his shot is off the way a Paul George (or even Khris Middleton) still can be - yet there's probably people here who would put Book on PG's level.  The flashes of playmaking are definitely there though and if he can improve his decision-making and limit turnovers then I think he gets much better at helping on those off days."
"Garnett was drafted in 95 thou, Kobe 96, Duncan 97, and dirk was 98. Dwade was a clear miss, Melo for sure makes it, and I think Anthony Davis is there too. I'll throw in Chris Bosh for consideration along with D rose, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Andrew Bynum, Demarcus Cousins, Paul George,  Lillard, Draymond, Klay. I know Pau Gasol started in '02 but he should be on  In a few years switch in Luka, Embiid, and Jokic"
The funny thing is we acknowledge Paul George is a better number 2 option than number 1. I’m ready for us to have that conversation about Damian Lillard
Most people mock him for his loyalty these days and the fact that his team has been a first round exit for a while now. A better example of a guy who’s getting overrated right now is Paul George and the anti-jerk has been so strong this season and especially in the playoffs that even a tiny amount of perceived “criticism” towards him gets downvoted.
"If you go by ones that can be proven false, I’d go with either Stockton’s assist record is just because he had home cooked stats or played with Malone. You can look at the numbers and it just doesn’t add up but you see them all the time.   This is also only including takes people actually believe and not that Alex Caruso is better than Paul George trolling"
Paul George is smooth as hell with his handles
"I agree that Middleton is a 3, but if that’s how he’s going to be listed, so should Paul George."
*every season except his first two. I feel like he was thrown in to start more arguments about the “disrespect” Paul George gets.
1. Harden 2. Booker 3. Mitchell 4. Beal 5. SGA   I really don’t consider Paul George a shooting guard. He’s mainly been a SF his whole career and listed as a SF on basketball reference this season.
Paul George and KD
Hawaii (and other places) may not have had available or appropriate facilities for large-scale basketball activities. Remember when Paul George broke his leg on a crapy hoop support?  Vegas has a lot of knowns for the NBA/Team USA that make it desirable.
"Paul George also broke out really early because of those two Miami Heat series. He was 22 and 23 when the Pacers went up against the Heat.   Then he broke his leg at age 24, which is just insanely sad. he would have been even better than he is if not for that injury."
"they been around for just over a decade. missed the playoffs like 3 times?  been to a finals, been to 4 WCFs, were a serious contender for half the decade. Had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and more play for them. Now they have promising young talent in Shai and a huge number of assets to work with. yeah they never won, but compared to other newer teams they’ve been spoiled."
Paul George exist
"Did you not watch Paul George, Mr I've seen all of the playoffs? Stars get this type of treatment, its always been this way. This is pure thoughtless garbage"
"KD was also extremely complimentary toward all the Bucks after that series ended. He congratulated Giannis, said the organization did a great job building around him, etc. Pretty classy move given how 2 of their 3 stars got hurt and he was a toe away from winning the series.  Imagine what Paul George would've said, for example..."
"You hold him to a higher standard than guys who were better players? How does that work?  Do you also hold Paul George to the standard of LeBron and Larry Bird? Excuse me, a HIGHER standard than LeBron and Bird?"
"Sure, makes sense. I suppose that’s why Kawhi chose greener pastures. But I don’t see what will be different next year. Lebron will be 37 and Anthony will still be day to Davis. Kawhi has been missing a lot of games his entire career. Paul George had a gruesome injury and how many shoulder surgeries? I guess you could say the Nuggets were a fluke with Murray’s injury but are they really that much of a threat if he’s healthy? Suns with rising stars booker and Ayton along with a good organization and coaching staff seems like a good bet."
"Presti is a good GM, and has recently put the Thunder in a great spot asset wise for the future ... and he's made some good trades with Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Paul George, etc....  But goddamn, he could have had Durant, Westbrook and Harden in their primes on the same team had he just given Harden the contract he wanted.....  Instead he traded Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two 1sts and one 2nd.   Oh and then KD left 4 years later.  ...... man, imagine if that core had stayed ...... the Warriors dynasty maybe wouldn't have even gotten 1 ring in the 2010s."
"&gt;LA Clippers - Chris Paul, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo  fwiw Elton Brand has a higher VORP than Blake for both their careers and Clipper tenures"
"&gt; A 6'11"" forward with handles? If he improves his D he can become your counter to Paul George.  Damn, Paul George is old. Weird how they can be similar size players with good defense and handles, and yet different enough that I've never even heard anyone bother to compare them before.  &gt; The only place Paul George is still a shooting guard is 2k  oops"
"Harden, cp3, Demar, Paul George and embid"
"Clippers are far better.  I don't think it is even close frankly.  Siakam was not even close to Paul George, Lowry isn't as good as Reggie Jackson, and neither is the rest of the supporting cast of the Raptors.  Kawhi carried the Raptors team far more than he did the Clippers."
"Completely wrong.  Siakam was nowhere near as good as Paul George.  The rest of the Toronto supporting cast isn't as good as what the Clippers have.  And Ty Lue is a far better coach than Nick Nurse.   Yes Patrick Beverly isn't as good as Jrue, but Reggie Jackson is."
"Sorry all! Forgot Clips traded their first round pick for next year in the Paul George trade, **EDITED** the second option"
"Player hate. I’m not Ben Simmons fan obviously bc my flair, but the dude clearly has stuff going on in his life and I want to see him get better. Same goes for Paul George"
Paul George is a better 3 and D player
"In the same world where Chicago got an aging Vooch for a young guy and two FRPs.  Here's the TLDR - Portland does not have the assets to surround Dame with another All-Star. The best they can do to keep him happy to stay is to surround him with a *competent* team. That means getting rid of the undersized backcourt with CJ and getting a proper 2-way wing.  Unfortunately, 2-way wings are in short supply and players like Paul George aren't available. So that means you have to overpay for guys like Barnes. He's not an All-Star, but he's still a solid player that's worth the contract."
If I can take peak versions with existing rules I am going with:  PG - MVP Westbrook SG - Reggie Miller SF - Pre-injury Paul George PF - Barkley C - Mutumbo   Sixth Man would be Webber.  Who would play the 5 in small ball lineups.
"Absolutely false narrative that there have been many star players available. There have been 3: a Kawhi rental that would have cost Jaylen Brown, AD who would only go to the Lakers, and Paul George who moved for an enormous package that the Celtics couldn’t realistically meet.  People like you love to create this false narrative that Ainge was just passing up superstars to hold onto role players/ picks. There just aren’t many superstar guys in the league, you can’t just force a team to move them or force a guy to want to be in Boston.  What’s your example of all these star players that moved who Ainge didn’t pull the trigger on?"
"People like you act like there have been a ton of available superstars that Ainge was just like “nah I’ll pass” on. Renting Kawhi would have cost Jaylen Brown, AD was only going to LA, very difficult to match the Paul George asking price, and then no other elite guys have moved.  Also, Tatum is 23 and imo you are wrong if you don’t think he can be a true #1 eventually/ soon."
Well Paul’s parents are named Paul and Paulette so George might bot be the worst
"But it's not just limited to USA basketball, take for example Paul George - the threads about him having had a great game generates no where near the traction a thread of him having poorly generates.  Yes what you said is a part of the reason, but I don't think it ends there."
"Booker and Paul is no Kawhi and George, especially on the defensive end.  They are no Durant and Harden (Kyrie is overrated)."
&gt;paths  yeah man the suns had to go through paul george!!!
"They're solidly behind (with regards to the All-Star game, voted on by fans and then coaches) Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard. They're more in the Donovan Mitchell, Paul George range, which means (with regards to making the Western Conference All-Star Team) they're borderline/fringe."
"I always wondered why Manute named his son Bol, when it's also his last name. It's like if Paul George was named George George or something"
"The Cavs barely beat the Warriors in a 7 game series where they needed a Draymond suspension, Bogut to be injured, and Harrison Barnes to forget how to shoot a basketball. Unless the Cavs got Kawhi/Paul George, they were never going to compete with a Warriors team that just replaced Barnes with KD"
"Yeah, Beal would be worth it, so would Dame and IMO even Lavine, but I don't think any of them are truly available right now. Dame would obviously require every possible additional 1st-round draft asset the Warriors can cobble together, and Beal might require a little extra too. I don't think Dame or Lavine are realistic (Dame will demand a trade sometime between now and the next trade deadline, but he won't be angling to go to the Warriors; Lavine I think will remain in CHI for the foreseeable future).  The only two 'all-in' trades I can think of for the Warriors that aren't totally bonkers -- assuming trade availability for all involved -- are (1) for Beal, which makes most sense to happen post-draft Wiggins-to-CLE style so that WAS can get more draft capital from GSW, and (2) a 3-teamer with POR &amp; LAC in which GSW gets Paul George and LAC essentially swaps out George for Lillard (POR obviously gets a rebuilding package, mostly from GSW). The second trade is maybe a little bonkers because I don't think Dame will ask out until well after the draft, which means POR would not be able to actually pick who they want with #7 &amp; #14, plus Dame would have to be open to going to LAC, which he might not, especially after the Kawhi injury. Ultimately I think Draymond convincing Beal to ask out is the Warriors' only hope for a worthwhile 'all-in' trade. Otherwise it's trading 1 or 2 of Wiseman, #7, &amp; #14 (+ Wiggins, as needed), or -- more likely -- just using the picks and keeping Wiseman."
What? Luka put up godly numbers while involving his teammates and being guarded in stretches by Kawhi fuckin Leonard and Paul George lmao not even close and booker is 25
"Yeah but his legacy is immense if he wins.  Name the last non super team to win a championship? LeBron on the Cavs w Kyrie? Dallas before that?  It shows with one superstar (who isn't even good at shooting) and another star (YES Middleton is a star and an all NBA talent I will argue to the end of time he is soooo underrated when compared to players like Paul George), you can win a championship.  Yes injuries played a role. But cmon now. Kyrie hasn't been ""clutch"" since his Cavs days, and KD either unless he has Steph and Klay. Is it REALLY that much of a stretch to say the Bucks could've beaten a healthy Nets team who were shit on defense? I believe it would have been more even than people make it out to be."
Paul George also said Jrue is the best defender he's gone up against
"3-4 years ?  # BULLSHIT !!!!  Most stars leave after 7+ years.  Lebron, Bosh, Melo, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, KG, Durant, Westbrook, Lillard - ALL stayed with their original team 7 years or more."

"I'd still call the '14 Heat a Super team, they were 43-14 at one point before Wade's injuries. Also they went 12-3 in the first three rounds of the playoffs, winning easily and relying solely on star power. Wade was underwhelming in the playoffs outside of the Indiana series, but Bosh was fine, IMO definitely a Super team.  In every series they played outside of San Antonio, they had 3/4 best players. San Antonio just was on fire that series, it doesn't mean the Heat weren't still a super team.   Round 1: Charlotte: LeBron &gt; Bosh &gt; Kemba &gt; Wade &gt; Al Jefferson  Round 2: Brooklyn: LeBron &gt; Joe Johnson &gt; Bosh &gt; Wade &gt; Paul Pierce  Round 3: Indiana: LeBron &gt; Paul George &gt; Wade &gt; Bosh &gt; West  Finals: LeBron &gt; Parker &gt; Kawhi &gt; Duncan &gt; Bosh &gt; Manu &gt; Wade"
Because y’all are clearly blinded by hate   That legendary bubble game winner against the Clippers was over a double team of Paul George and Kawhi.   Y’all don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.
&gt;Paul George at #5  Yeah right behind Bubble Murray and Bubble Jimmy Butler
Paul George top 5 that’s a hot take
"ah yeah, the goat ingram that with all-star zion lead the pelicans to the playoffs, exactly him!   lmao man, might mot have gotten the best deal, but i'm fine with olympian keldon johnson and one of the best rim protector in the NBA in Jakob while having an extremely dope mentor and guy in DeRozan that cemented a nice mentality and culture in the young ccore. and might be able to get some more from him this offfseason. all without destroying the entire league.  and are we sure they would have done that deal? or would they wait like they did with paul george? mh"
Harden needs to get himself healthy and strong together some good games before I give him the nod. Right now I'd put Paul George as #5 given his performance this post season.   If Harden returns to form next year it's his spot though.
He definitely would get a lot of hate for his game and playoff performance but people still liked him. It’s definitely not like he was Paul George (the spawn of Satan himself to this sub) or anything.
"Yeah, I am still a big Jimmy Butler fan. Ironically Middleton is exactly the type of player you'd want to pair him with -- someone who can score on or off ball, but doesn't need to have the ball all the time.  Middleton's skill type is rare, that's why he's so valuable. Klay Thompson, Paul George, Brad Beal -- there's not a ton of guys like that. Sometimes it's harder to find a great #2 guy than a #1."
"So does every other player in the game. Harden, Paul George, Lebron, Jokic all do it on every drive and foul. Im sure you still enjoy watching them play. The Bucks do have less complaining stars but its a little deeper then that people are mad they've gotten lucky and want them to lose so every one can say see they got lucky. If they beat a healthy Bucks team that argument goes down."
CP did the same thing and was called for nothing dont bitch about that.  What Paul George does is bullshit too lmao
Dude couldnt even pick up a tech after a DIRTY play from Giannis..  Booker was in mid-air when Giannis was made contact.   But apparently a whistle being blowed exonerates giannis dirty play?  Paul George is allowed to push off every play but when Booker does its not a foul?
*(they are getting exposed)   Paul George was out there by himself. The bucks are healthy.
"Booker still needs to Mature  Booker plays a role, star volume shooter. For example Damian Lillard and Kobe Bryant also have this role. When you play this role, it comes with responsibility, on one hand you’re a fantastic scorer who has freak of nature scoring ability, but on the other hand you need to know when it’s not your time. For example tonight booker shot great % wise, but was not playing winning basketball. He took ISO’s and chucked up shots when that was obviously not the best play. And wether you like it or not he played a bit role in the loss today. You can’t do everything yourself and as Paul George said “that’s a bad shot” while he may sound salty considering the situation he’s right. While it’s amazing when it goes in it’s tiring when it doesn’t, his teammates shot well today and also want to win a ring, yes he is the superstar but they show up to practice too, they grind too. Part of maturing in basketball is realizing that it’s a team game no matter how great of a player you are, you can’t do everything yourself. Booker is still young and I think he will realize this and win a least 1 ring, but for now he has a hard pill to swallow, he’s no longer on a trash franchise it’s time to look at the bigger picture."

"I think CP3 is obnoxious most of the time, but this is exactly what he meant. He's saying that everyone is expecting the miss, so they need to be ready. He's just adding that even Giannis is expecting a miss so Giannis, a freak of nature, is going hard after the rebound.   It's similar to the Paul George quote in that it's awkwardly phrased, but not a shot at Dame/Giannis."
"I remember a few years ago when analysts and fans were all on the ""Giannis is the best player in the NBA"" narrative. It didn't last long but it was out there. It happens every few years with different players.  I don't understand how you are writing LeBron off. He literally just won a championship. He was injured this year and had an injured team. I don't understand how you are writing KD off either. He was literally inches away from moving on. He was hurt and had an injured team as well. He was by far the best player in that series, not Giannis.   Giannis is a top 5 player but LeBron and KD are 1a/1b. Giannis, Kawhi and Steph are all right there. Giannis isn't the guy yet.  This shit changes from year to year. There was a time back in his Pacers days when Paul George was looked at as being on his way to being better than LeBron. Dwight Howard, Cousins and others have all had their brief moments where people were prematurely calling them the next top guy.  I can see Giannis being the top guy. Just not now and not until both KD and LeBron slow down."
I’m looking forward to chris Paul getting the Paul George treatment.  Ps. Wtf is up with the 2 first name names?
"paul george also got away with pushing off like every time he drove in our series. I can't control whatever the refs decide ""playoff basketball"" is, but he gets called for pushing off ALL THE TIME in the regular season. it isn't unique to him in the playoffs."
Y’all ethered Paul George for saying far less
"I remember he did that to Paul George around the right elbow and then the suns got a bucket out of it, was literally grabbing the back of his jersey"
I thought the same thing.  The way Giannis when flying - almost bashed his head on the basket. Also looked like it could have ended in a Paul George catastrophe.
"Shouldn't that have been a flagrant on CP3? Shoving Giannis while he's in mid-air?  Given where they were, that could have ended in a Paul George situation."
"Like the Paul George trade, it’s what you call a “context trade.” In the context of the team’s situation around the trade, it’s a worthy return."
Jrue Holiday is who Paul George thinks he is.
Definitely he does it as much as Paul George it’s ridiculous
Oh no. Don't do it Giannis. Do not go full Paul George.
Paul George?
Booker turning into Paul George with the push offs lol
"Good one, have u ever watched Paul George or Melo?? Or Giannis? Everyone does it"
Chris Paul is a bigger choker then Paul George
"Middleton in that Paul George,Butler,Derozan tier now."
Jrue Holiday is having his Paul George Renaissance
"Paul George spent seven years in Indiana, made the ECF, tons of All Star teams, etc. Not that different than Mr. Loyalty."
At least Paul George isn't here
"EAST  - Giannis wins a Championship with the Bucks - Bulls eventually trade Lavine - Cavaliers make the playoffs once - Ime Udoka doesn't last as Celtics coach  - Capela is still a Hawk  - The Heat never make the finals again - LaMelo gets 3rd team All NBA honors - The Knicks never win a playoff series  - Jonathan Isaac never gets healthy  - KD wins 2 titles with the Nets - Goga Bitadze is the next Gobert - Isaiah Stewart leads the league in rebounds at least once - Vanvleet will be the only Raptor still with the team - Sixers sign Kyle Lowry - Somehow someway Bradley Beal never leaves the Wizards   WEST  - Lillard never leaves Portland - Paul George is still a Clipper - Jaren Jackson Jr is a bust - Gordon Hayward returns to Utah - The Kings still haven't made the playoffs, Fox gets traded to the East - Lebron surpasses Kareem as all time leading scorer and retires as a Cavalier - Luka and Mavs never makes it past the 2nd round  - Michael Porter Jr leads his team in points - Zion never participates in dunk contest, Pelicans make it to the playoffs twice - Rockets never make it to the playoffs - Gregg Popovich retires in 2 years - Mikal Bridges wins MIP - SGA demands trade from the Thunder - The Wolves finally make the playoffs at least once - Steph Curry leads the Warriors to the finals but loses"
"Gonna be a real hot take but honestly Paul George. If somehow the Cavs had done Kyrie for PG, and they'd had a whole year to jell, I really do think a monumental performance by LeBron could've gotten them the win in 7. Games 1 and 3 were close (the end scores inflated due to playing the foul game), which is weird to imagine given that the Dubs were stacked and the Cavs were historically awful defensively. A guy like PG really could've made a huge difference."
"Was Paul George healthy that season?  If so, then he'd have been a great fit.  Too bad they couldn't close on that trade for Kyrie."
"Lebron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Harden, KD, Kyrie all left their teams to go to those cities."
"Doesn’t help that he beat on those Pistons and Hawks teams that lacked a real superstar. Also, he definitely has a winning playoff record against Paul George so that’s one."
"I feel like he’s one of the best 2 way guys in the league.   Potential 20 ppg scorer while being a dog on defence, feel like he’s worth around what Vic was when he was traded for Paul George.  I’m just higher on Dillon than most."
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"I was sooo pissed I don't watch this live. I had a feeling Terence Mann was gonna go off one of the next few games. I saw the Jazz have a huge lead by halftime, said to myself ""Okay it's getting late I'll stay up for game 7 though"" and turned off the TV.   Wake up next morning to check the box score, Terence Mann has 39 points, and apparently along with Paul George, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Beverley they 3-pt barraged the Clippers to victory and abused Rudy Gobert"
"It goes back further:  July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025.   But what about the Suns, who triggered all of this madness in 2007? Well, they traded Kurt Thomas for cap relief and a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick. They used that 2009 conditional 2nd round pick they received from the SuperSonics to draft Emir Preldžić, who would go on to never play a single minute in the NBA, as is tradition. As for that precious cap relief, the Suns went on in that offseason to sign Richie Frahm who was almost immediately waived, Brian Skinner who would average 3 points and 3 rebounds in one season with the Suns, and acquire a 35 year old Shaquille O’Neal from the Miami Heat, who would ultimately cement his legacy as one of the all time greats with rebirth in his new franchise. Just kidding, Shaq averaged 16 points and 9 rebounds in one and a half seasons with Phoenix."
Paul George is a 1-4 defender. Probably mainly due to his size
"No, I just think he's overrated. He constantly underperformed come playoff time. When the pressure was at it's highest he crumbled repeatedly. His team was the favourite in multiple series that he embarrassingly lost in his years with minnesota. Even his Celtics team should of won more than 1 title and he often talks as if they did. Damian Lillard has already done far more in the playoffs than Garnett did before his single Celtics title, so has Demar Derozan. So has Paul George. So have a bunch of others. It ain't just about LeBron I was just using him as an example because Garnett and Pierce have both made their media careers by shitting on LeBron."
Lowry - No  Lillard - Yes  Carmelo - Yes  Derrick Rose - No  Paul George - Probably   Kyrie - Yes  Kevin Love - No  Rudy Gobert - Maybe  Andre Iguodala - No
"Kawhi, KD, and LeBron at the top level. Depending on LeBron's outside shooting it could just be Kawhi and KD.  After them it's probably Paul George  Guards and bigs inherently lose in this but within their roles, Embiid/AD can do it all for bigs and CP3/Holiday for guards"
"&gt;The lakers were missing their top two for a significant portion of games. The jazz played without Mitchell and Conley for a significant portion of games. Kawhi and Paul George both missed 20 games. The nuggets played without Murray and the rest of their backcourt for over 20 games. The Mavericks got destroyed by covid and injuries all around. Everyone had it really bad  You bring up these other teams yet Utah, Dallas, Denver and the Clippers all show up really low in terms of games lost in the chart you linked. That right there shows a flaw in methodology.   You can't be using those teams as an example and then go at the Wolves fan when he gives you context behind the Wolves' injuries. The fact is, they did lose continuity with their 2 stars missing significant portions separately and together affecting their chemistry."
"One, I would wayyy rather have had Nurk and CJs missed games be staggered. Missing both at the same time was much worse.   And two we literally were missing our 2nd and 3rd best player together for 30 straight games. The lakers were missing their top two for a significant portion of games. The jazz played without Mitchell and Conley for a significant portion of games. Kawhi and Paul George both missed 20 games. The nuggets played without Murray and the rest of their backcourt for over 20 games. The Mavericks got destroyed by covid and injuries all around. Everyone had it really bad"
"The gap between top-five player all-time, and top-ten player in the league in a given year, is pretty substantial.   Like, he was the 10th best guy in the league this year? Lillard? Paul George? Really f'ing good players.   Who aren't on track to make the top 50 all-time.   The fact that Bird could be a shell of himself - and he absolutely was - and still be that good is a testament to how amazing he was when his body worked right."
paul george. khris middleton
"Paul George and Tatum, they are a bit better than kawhi at 3s. Though kawhi is the best at guarding bigger players."
Lmfaooo he does. He also look like Paul George rocking some Jheri curls
Paul George
"LeBron probably still? He's not the best in category, but he's pretty much above average in all of them. This assumes that he's locked in defensively tho. Otherwise I guess Kawhi or Paul George."
Paul George
paul george
"For Jokic to win MVP, he needs a ""better"" second year which means that the Nuggets should be 1st or close 2nd seed in the West .. with Murray being out for what, 1/2 of the season?  \+ People who haven't won the award, get bonus points over him   Curry, Lebron, KD, Giannis, Doncic, AD, Harden would all have better narratives than Jokic.  If someone from Tatum, Brown, Zion, Paul George, Trae have great years they would also get a nod over Nicola for being americans or more charismatic for the general public.  Truth to be told, Jokic winning an MVP was a genie in a bottle. The Media wanted badly to give it to anyone else but Curry didn't made the playoffs, they were ""tired"" from Giannis and everyone else was injured."
"I wouldn't say it's bad. It's just not traditional. We are not talking about a Lonzo Ball jump shot here. His right foot is almost always pointing to the basket. The right arm in straight and firmly under the ball. It's the guide hand/arm that I think makes it look so weird. The elbow points straight to his left because he had such a high set point.   &gt;I would tell kids, when they start, 8, 9, 10 years old, I would do wrist exercises because they could get the ball instead of down here [around the chest], they could get it up here [above the shoulders]  His guide hand never gets play in the shot. The elbow is always super straight and towards the basket, and being 6'9, with a high set point, Larry Bird rarely got blocked. It just looks different because Larry shot more on the right side of his body with a high set point, but those reasons also made him more accurate.  &gt;I said [to Paul George], ‘I see that you finally got the ball in the right space.’ He said, ‘What do you mean?’ I said, ‘Well, you’re starting to knock down shots because your hand’s in the right position when you’re following through. It’s not shooting off to the right.""  I think his jump shot and release look beautiful. It's perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. It's the same as Durant if Durant moved his right arm more towards the right side of his body. I really don't know where else you could release the ball and have your elbow and forearm as straight and facing the basket as Larry does."
"Another follow up to being the best defender for 5 years. Why didn't he win any DPOY's in those 5 years? If you say he got robbed by Gasol, Gasol had a better defensive rating than LeBron. Noah was the one who got robbed that year by someone who wasn't even NBA All-Defense team that year.  No, he did not guard those players late in the game, he guarded wing players Paul George, Lance Stephenson, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Luol Deng, and others. That would make zero sense because it would mean that Haslem, Bosh, and the other bigs on the Heat in those years would've been matched up with the three wing players I mentioned and I don't think I need to explain how much of a mismatch that is. I'm just telling you how illogical your claim is because telling you that you are wrong just because I saw what happened doesn't mean much to people on the internet.   LeBron wasn't even the best defender in those series' in his team. Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, and Battier had better defensive rating in all those series' in those playoffs. I'm not saying LeBron was a terrible defender, in fact, he was a good defender in his Heat days but he wasn't the best in the league and could never guard positions 4 and 5."
"I've seen Rodman play so I'm pretty certain that I've seen LeBron play. Answer my question why was he the best defender for a decade when he only has 5 All-Defensive NBA team selections?   You're telling me he intentionally guarded bigs like Roy Hibbert, Kendrick Perkins, Kevin Garnett, Joakim Noah, and Carlos Boozer? I can remember those series' vividly and I am positive that he guarded Paul George, Paul Pierce, and Luol Deng for most of the time and the only time he guarded bigs was because he was switched unto them. He never intentionally guarded any of the bigs I mentioned because everyone knew he couldn't."
"No, he wasn't better than Hakeem, D-Rob, Barkley, Shaq, Malone, Ewing, Wilkins, etc. He finish top 3 in MVP voting but that doesn't make him a top 5 player. It's like thinking Paul George was a top 5 player in 2019."
garnett  lebron  Paul george (more so in his pacers and okc days but i still like him)  Chris Paul  westbrook
PG: Kyrie  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Paul George  PF: Zion  C: Embiid
"Westbrook won an MVP, teamed up with Paul George, and then got eliminated in the first round twice. I know that PG13 didn't always come through in the playoffs, but how many MVP""s in league history couldn't make it out of the first round with PG13 as their sidekick? And it's not like they just ran into better teams. The 2018 Jazz and 2019 Blazers were good but not great.  It doesn't make sense to hate Russell Westbrook, but a lot of people think he doesn't deserve all the praise he gets. I've seen no indication that he can help your team win a championship. Let's see what happens this year.  I don't hate Westbrook as a person"
"Paul George. His game is silky smooth and having guard skills at 6’9 is really impressive, on top with being a two way player who is a 3 level scorer. Main reason he became my favourite player was after the 2016 first round when my home team the raptors played them and he was looking pretty dominant on both sides of the floor."
they got taken to 7 by cp3 and harden   with good role players a lebron/embiid duo is just as good if not better and then paul george is better than capela too obviously
depending in who they get from simmons they may  embiid/ paul george/ lebron and shooters is a unstopable team in the same level
Paul George redeemed himself these playoffs no one hates him anymore
"The thing is, it honestly was.  As a defender, that's about as good as it gets for final shots. Most NBA players would let Dame shoot that 37 footer 100 times out of 100. It was great defense from PG13 too, just better offense.  But the way Paul George made it sound was just so quotable and poorly worded."
"Lmao the 2014 heat were an old broken wreck. Bron had back spasms in g1 from carrying that shit all year. They almost lost to hibbert and paul george lol, calling them big 3 heat is like calling the 04 lakers a super team"
"Harden shoots 1% better than Luka's last season from 3 and no one is clamouring to call him a top 5 shooter in the league. He's just a good shooter and is extremely good at creating his own shot/separation so he can increase the volume without a dropoff in efficiency. Harden's 3pt% has barely changed season to season whether in OKC or Houston or Brooklyn whether he shoots 3 a game or 13. He's not a better shooter than Steph, KD, Dame, Kyrie, Middleton, Paul George for sure and there are others I would pick to be better that are just coming into their roles such as Zach Lavine who I think will have many seasons of shooting 40+ from 3 on high volume that aren't pure catch and shoot guys like Klay, MPJ or Joe Harris.   If Harden suddenly shot 40%+ from 3 in Brooklyn or had shot that in OKC on lower volume catch and shoot type shots you would have a point but he never has and most likely never will. He's an amazing player and excellent at creating his own shot from behind the line consistently, but he's a not a top shooter in the league. He's a way better passer/playmaker than he is a shooter and that's where a lot of his value on the court comes from."
You feel Paul George underachieved?
Paul George: “It was a bad shot”…..
Where’s Paul George
Paul George in there series against Utah
"Lebron, Draymond, Westbrook, Paul George, KD.   I also think people forgot there was not a time to long ago when Steven Adams entered the league and was classified as a dirty player. He used to get mauled by broadcasters during the game when he got subbed in."
"Paul George actually wasn't necessarily the reason why the Clippers lost that series  Most of the ""Pandemic P"" stuff was against the Mavs and then came back after game 7, but honestly a lot of the other Clippers played worse against Denver, especially on defense"
Paul George had been on waaaay better teams than Dame
Paul George would’ve never been in that situation if they made even one of their 14 shots in the final minute. Jesus Christ
"Oh yah no doubt, it’s a shit pick. The warriors could’ve had Gordon Hayward or Paul George…hindsight. At least the following year the warriors grabbed Klay"
"Kawhi didn't even lead the Clippers past the Jazz in round 2. He didn't play in the WCF, or the latter games of the WCSF.   Seems a little weird to give him credit for that when you could just as easily point out that the stand Paul George made against the Suns in the WCF was more respectable than anything Kawhi has really done in LA."
Hes a guy that people love to hate and he just shit the bed in the playoffs. He is going to get the Paul george treatment until he starts hitting his free throws
"Paul George had a really good post season showing. So they stopped crucifying him but...you know....blood for the blood God, skulls for the skull throne"
"When you want the fame and glory of being a top paid player on one of the best teams for the last 4 years, you better expect the hate that follows when you don't perform.   Young Paul George proved his worth when he was on the Pacers. It wasn't until lately that he bounces from team to team and dealt with injuries.  Simmons? He has had his chance to make his mark and shit the bed hard in a very crucial moment in the playoffs when his team was within range to win and keep their hopes alive. He also has the benefit of playing next to a MVP caliber player unlike young PG had.   Then you follow it up with his comments and not being fully in touch or communicating with the Sixers during this offseason. The hate writes itself with Simmons."
Any Paul George series except the one against Dallas
Paul George in the bubble last season lmao  Literally the entire front page was making fun of him at one point
"Melo, for all his faults, is a top 10 sf and top 50 player. He's better than Paul Pierce, whose only claim to being better is winning ring on a stacked team. I'd even say that he's as good or better than Kawhi. Kawhi has slightly better peak, but Melo has the longevity. Melo was cursed with never getting the chance to play with great players. His best teammates in NY were Tyson Chandler and JR Smith, think about that lol. Meanwhile Pierce be playing with KG, Ray Allen, and Rondo, and Kawhi playing with Spurs core, defensive beast team in the Raptors, and Paul George. Sure Melo chose to play in NY instead of the heatles but I'll never knock someone down for getting his money and choosing to lead a team himself instead of teaming with others. And before everyone cites Melo's defense and inefficiency, sure. He sucks defensively. But his ""inefficiency"" comes from playing in a time where everyone was ""inefficient"". Look at Kobe, all time great yet they have the same fg%. Stats this season are so inflated due to how easy it is to score. Look at all the 20 point scorers this season compared to Melo's era. So many great players would have feasted in this era where you get foul shots for being breathed on."
"How are you telling me it’s factually incorrect when you don’t even have access to the stats?  And win shares, BPM etc are extremely outdated  stats. Jokic apparently had a higher peak than Shaq by several standard deviations. Paul George is apparently better than Kobe. I just don’t think harden was as good as Kd in the playoffs, kds defense on tatum, scoring and efficiency were a lot better.   And here’s an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"
"I watched his entire career, and admitted he was. He was not a better defender than Paul George though."
"The amount of power players have over organisations in terms of where they want to play/requesting trades and even teams trading players so early in their contract is not good for the sport. I’m more inclined to be interested in players that display team loyalty.   It felt more special when players stayed with teams for a long time and them bouncing from team to team now ruins legacies. A good example would be Paul George. Him signing a 4 year contract then requesting a trade to the Clippers a year later just makes me not care about him or his game at all, no matter how great of a player he is."
"He could win a game,but when team USA played king of the court a couple of years back KD was unstoppable and he was going up against Harden, Booker and Paul George. I don’t think Pierce could stop him from just shooting over him , but on the other end KD’s length and athleticism could borrow Pierce who was never particularly fleet footed."
Too premature to say that trae will never win. Paul george also shouldn't be here.

Tatum is better than Paul George and Butler tf.
"Ppl just conveniently ignore how bad Kyrie was when he actually had to be the first option.  Butler, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young should all be ranked higher than him rn imo"
"If Paul George goes down for any significant injury time, OKC and the legend of Presti will grow"
Lol Dame and Paul George have basically the same playoff TS% but their reputations could not be more different  Also holy shit Westbrook lmao
Paul George for next
Paul George taking them to a first round exit. You might call it a success. I’m going to call it a lost season.    We won’t agree. That’s ok. Have a good weekend.
Maybe I’m biased but Giannis does not seem like the kind of guy who would pull something like that   *cough* Paul George *cough*
"They have a great gameplan for Giannis. Leave him wide open outside 20 feet and make life tougher for Middleton and Jrue who can beat you anywhere. It doesn't really matter when it's the most injured playoffs ever though including a Paul George vs Devin Booker Finals, weakest WCF in over 20 years.  You're working backwards because you don't understand basketball analysis and haven't even tried to learn it."
Small market teams either need to bottom out and hit the lottery with a loyal star - Dame or Giannis for example - or accept mediocrity. Seems we’ve accepted mediocrity. Very frustrating to hear reports such as Paul George being willing to stay but ownership not willing to spend to bring in others in.   We’re basically a franchise to develop talent for bigger markets.
Westbrook   PG. LeBron James (2021-2022)  SG. James Harden (2019-2020  SF. Paul George (2018-2019)  PF. Kevin Durant (2015-2016)  C. Anthony Davis (2021-2022)
"Nah, Hayward gets way overrated because of his 1 great year in 2017. He’s never even made the playoffs before that outside of his second year in the league when he was a role player, and since 2017, he’s been constantly injured every year literally. The grizzlies needed a real star player who can score, shoot, and defend well like Paul George to push them over the top."
Paul George
"For me, no. I am not one of those fans. It's hard to enjoy a team that's built that way. At least in the Paul George years we were getting better and better, and I felt like a breakthrough was gonna come soon. Maybe not win the championship, but at least get past Lebron and get to the finals.  It feels like an annual formality we're just going to lose early in the playoffs now, so I don't care. At least make me believe we have a chance, or that we have potential by making some progress, but we end in the exact same spot over and over. It sucks when you know what your ceiling is and consistently live up to that exact expectation, and the changes are so minimal there's no reason to get your hopes up thinking something's gonna be different.  Plus, if we tank, I can at least laugh at how bad we are and get excited at the slightest improvements. Settling for mediocrity with no end in sight gets fucking boring."
"Steph Curry saw something that made him stay. You can't say the same thing for Lebron, Durant, Melo, Harden, Kyrie, Paul George, AD and probably many others."
"""You can't average 14 in the first round"" He had 7 assists and 7 rebounds still, plus the dude was the only person the Bucks were worried about because they knew the rest of the team wouldn't do shit. It was a good bet. Saying ""KD and Kyrie had their way with the BUcks"" is so monumentally stupid as a way to shit on Butler. KD and Kyrie are two of the most gifted scorers of all time. That's like shitting on Paul George for not having as many MVPs as Lebron James. What the fuck even is your argument. It just sounds like you're taking 4 games of Butler's career personally and are salty he was voted as All-NBA over Tatum. And again, no one claims Butler is as good a scorer as Booker or KD or Kyrie, but you know what Butler has that those three don't? Two of the five greatest finals performances in NBA history. Fuck off with this weird sports revisionism. You're the time who critiques every player on the same scale as the media does to Lebron James. Enjoy the sport, stop pocket watching"
"Direct rankings are hard. I prefer tier systems that allow for a bit more fluidity. Otherwise there’s a lot of victim of the moment stuff going on where we just knee-jerk react to the latest stat line. “Oh shit, harden dropped 60. Smh you guys have curry above him.” “Giannis just had 35/20 on crazy efficiency. Imagine putting the washed king above him smh.” Etc  In that same vein, the past 3-4 years I’ve had a tier 1 with only 6 players - up until this offseason where it bumped up to 7.   No particular order: Giannis, lebron, KD, Steph, kawhi, harden, Jokic.  All of these guys have an MVP (except kawhi, who has two finals MVPs), all have rings except for Harden and Jokic. Think they have all proven they can be the best player on a championship level team (even if the latter two haven’t won, they are able to compete at that level IMO). The hardware in this tier is crazy with the MVPs, finals MVPs, scoring titles, assist champions, DPOYs, all nba/all defense teams etc. Some people may object to putting Jokic in this tier, but I think his MVP cements it, personally.  So after the top 7, I’d have a second tier if guys who are incredibly good but haven’t quite reached that top level yet.   again no particular order: embiid, luka, dame, AD and maybe Paul George? He’s right on the edge Imo. I could easily see dropping him down to like the next tier with guys like jimmy butler, gobert, etc.  I think it’s hard to just do a straight numerical ranking when guys are certain levels are just so interchangeable with one another night to night. There are definite tier breaks where there’s a clear line of demarcation, though."
"I mean we’ve done that once in the last few seasons, this year. You can argue that he won’t be better than all the players picked behind him, but you really can’t know that until we actually see them all play and he seems to fit with the FO’s current timeline pretty well. We have by no means drafted well, but we’ve had 4 top 15 picks in the past 12 years. Those picks were Paul George, a trade for George Hill, Myles Turner, and Chris Duarte. I wouldn’t say that’s particularly bad."
"Paul George wasn't a safe pick,  but to be fair that was about a decade ago."
"It’s mostly fine. We have been competitive in the past (Paul George years vs the heat) so I know they can be good. It gets annoying when the FO doesn’t accept when we are bad and let it happen so we can get a better pick but it’s whatever. There are a few things you have to accept though: we won’t get a star through free agency, Lebron and AD type players are never going to force themselves here unless they have some tie already, and we likely aren’t going to competing for a championship unless everything goes right. When you accept that, you just have to set proper expectations."
I remember watching this. We were coming home from a drive from SF. We listened to the whole Celtics/Heat game which was entertaining on the radio. We got home just in time to catch the start of the Clippers/Nuggets game.  I fully expected the Clippers to win but that second half was a thing of beauty. Murray and Jokic just dismantled the entire Clipper defense. I still believed the Clippers would come back until Paul George hit the side of the back board.
I say Tatum has more resemblance. Even maybe Paul George then Booker
Because his name is not Paul George
Yeah he has the size of a SG. He can guard guys like Mikal Bridges but not guys like Luka or Paul George
"Ok so here's my breakdown: 1A) Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis. Their job is to carry teams, even if they're shitty.  1B) Dame, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Embiid, Luka, Tatum, CP3 1C) Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Brad Beal, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young"
"I think the phrase “guys like Dame” is telling. It’s guys that are MVP contenders in their best years, but who nobody would legit argue are the best player in the league. Dame, Jokic, Paul George etc. Giannis, Lebron and KD get crap for losing when the other team is clearly better. The next tier down doesn’t."
paul george did the same thing the year prior lol. and then he stayed
"Well, all the guys who are currently up there, plus Bradley beal, Jimmy butler (I know he was bad in these last playoffs), and Paul George. Booker probably ranks about 20 for me."
I mean we had that with Paul George and ran into the Heatles. Not much you can do there.
"Overall Impact &gt; Prime &gt; Longevity = Accolades = Box Score Stats = Advanced Stats = Eye Test = Context  (Just a note, playoffs are pretty important in the impact section but not the whole thing. Not only that but I also slightly weigh in things like global impact and impact on the game, but not a significant amount. I mean it when I say overall impact.)  That's my system. I think the one thing I hate about GOAT debates or general player vs player arguments is ""This guy is the whole package."" This is literally the very anthesis's of how I rate players. Quality &gt; Quantity, every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year of every century. Of course, quantity ABSOLUTELY matters, and I exaugurated a bit but you get my point. Here's an example.  I think peak Lebron is 2018 Lebron. The reason this is important is 2013 Lebron is near unanimously regarded as peak Lebron, but I disagree. The argument for Peak Lebron being 2013 is ""He checks more boxes."" 2013 Lebron had better shooting and better defense, he checks more boxes, thus 2013 Lebron is better. My counterargument is that Lebron in 2018 was stronger in his strengths, and that resulted in a higher effect on winning than any of the other boxes.  I will always say a player that is 9/10 on Offense and 3/10 on Defense is better than a player that is 7/10 on Offense and 7/10 on Defense. Mathematically, the 2nd is better because 7+7 is 14 whereas 9+3 is 12. But I personally think that the first player will always have the bigger impact on the game. Player 1 is Dame, Player 2 is Paul George.  Overall, I value peaks higher than longevity but both are important and I value impact more than anything. I also value advanced metrics and box score stats, but I believe you have to apply context and use the eye test as well. The reason is because advanced metrics can be noisy, and often don't paint the full picture. Same with box score stats. But this applies for the eye test too. I'm not going to be able to process the information an advanced metric conveys with my own eyes, and while the context is important, the content the context surrounds is equally important.  So, if you're curious, I have MJ as my GOAT based on these values and criteria.   I also think using a tier system to rank players is more efficient than the usual 1, 2, 3, so the top 11 players in the NBA right now for example, I always rank with tiers."
Paul George had two years on his contract.
Likely? Giannis. My MAIN pick: Kevin Durant Sleeper: Paul George
Look up paul george
Paul George was 3rd in MVP voting that regular season. That Thunder team was just devoid of any kind of strategy or synergy.
Yeah I'd say so. Not on this sub tho because they had a massive hate boner for Paul George which has now been transferred to Ben Simmons.
"At his best he’s actually a pretty great player but based on the past couple seasons, it’s a hard ask.  He’ll definitely look better next to Paul George &amp; under Ty Lue though.   He’s a good to possibly great defender, passable shooter but teams stopped respecting that entirely now, solid at finishing and drawing contact, and all this is great but it’s really how he puts it together.   I hope it works out for him, he’s an awesome guy from what I know."
Lmao that same year Paul George had surgery in both shoulders in the off season   Can’t have it both ways
Damn Pat Bev really said he’s better than Paul George?
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
Yeah or westbrook tbh. I think we go with whatever is most unique. Lol no one calling PG Paul. It's PG or Paul George
"Butler, Paul George, Bradley Beal?"
Chris Paul George Hill
wade against the pacers over paul george also left 0.1 on the clock
That's the point. Stats like win shares and vorp are shit. Replace Mikal with any decent 3&amp;d wing and it would happen too. Wouldn't Paul George do a better job than Mikal? He has a lower vorp.   Replace Capela with any decent defensive center with speed and it would happen too.
"You quote TS way too much. When Westbrook shoots a lot, it’s because the rest of the offense had stagnated and they weren’t able to get quality looks for the better shooters on the team and **A**shot, even one from Westbrook on a bad night, is better than no shot.  Basketball is a team sport, and pointing to whoever had the highest usage and lowest TS% and blaming them every time a team loses isn’t the simple determinant like you think it is.  Westbrook was sloppy and his jumper was broken but that happens all the time. What doesn’t happen all the time is Paul George playing with two injured shoulders which were both operated on immediately following the series. In the playoffs (and the latter half of the season) he was not the MVP candidate he was earlier in the season. When a player is injured, teams typically game plan around it by taking some of the load off, often by giving their other stars more touches.  If PG was healthy, he would’ve had numbers like he had when he was competing for mvp prior to the injury. Dame doesn’t go off for 50. And especially not if they had Roberson.  Injuries matter a lot."
"It's from that clickbait article someone posted on here the other day that used Paul George as an example of what would happen if an away team player played in Golden State or something. Obviously people here don't click articles, and once the first Pfizer P comment dropped, the r nba comedians came out and that was that."
You’re talking modern rivals... The person that started the post wasn’t nor other people commenting.   Even still you’d think clippers/Paul George would be higher than Simmons. I don’t know why you give a fuck about Simmons. He’s not as good as Gobert defensively and not as good as Mitchell at all..
"I don't watch post game interviews either, and only really become aware of stuff if it gets posted here and is highly upvoted. If not for this thread, I wouldn't have known Ballmer was even doing press at all today. I read this sub and listen to podcasts and honestly I just skip the ones if they have a player or coach on them because I feel like they won't be fully honest.   Ballmer could have given any answer he wanted though. He probably keeps getting these questions because of these answers that he gives. For all I know he spoke for hours today, but this quote here is all anyone will talk about and remember, just like his comments last week about the Lakers are all anyone talked about with the groundbreaking ceremony. Ballmer could even tell people that if they want to interview him not to ask him about the Lakers. Him giving these answers is not because he's been backed into a corner, it's because this is something he really wants to talk about and that's the message he wants put out there.   It was the same thing with those billboards and so much of what he does. And again, not just him, but so many people in that organization (Jerry West, Paul George, etc). They clearly are very focused on the Lakers. And I understand why, I won't pretend like I don't get it, but I feel like if I was a Clipper fan I'd want them to just start focusing on the Clippers rather than devoting so much energy to the Lakers.   There is a long running perception, right or wrong, that a lot of Clipper fans first became fans of the team mainly because they hate the Lakers and just wanted to be contrarians and root for the team nobody liked instead. That could certainly be a totally false perception, but honestly all the comments from Ballmer and the way a lot of Clipper fans (including the OP) seem to revel in that makes it tough to shake, IMO."
"Kawhi and Paul George aren't getting any younger, since you needed that explained to you."
"Paul George in the losses averaged 30ppg 61%TS and only struggled in the game 1 loss  Russ averaged 20pgg on 42% TS in all of the losses and only played well in game 1  I saw every game of that season and I'm fully aware that PG dropped off after the all star break, but he was the least of the teams problems in the playoffs that series  I also love that you only showed the FG% in your game log screenshots and try to make an argument that Russ had similar numbers  Anybody who watched that series would have said Russ was much worse and the numbers support it"
"His defense wasn’t there. I watched every thunder game that year, for the last 25% of the season and playoffs, PG was not himself what he was earlier in the season. Mid season he was an mvp contender but by the end he was inconsistent and wasn’t as much of a lockdown defender.   And yes, he had good averages for that Portland series, but he laid a few eggs which resulted in losses. PG played poorly for 3 games, which were all losses. You can’t have your best player play that bad on a regular basis and win.  He only played well in one game that we lost. Averages don’t tell the story of individual games. [2018-2019 OKC v Portland Game Log for Paul George](https://i.imgur.com/NurBd3F.jpg)  Russ didn’t play great either but his numbers were similar to PGs. [2018-2019 OKC v Portland Game Log for Russel Westbrook](https://i.imgur.com/HDeOrb3.jpg)  Regardless, PG wasn’t what he was (which was an mvp contender) in the first part of the season after his injuries."
Paul George had surgery on both his shoulders immediately after that series.  Injuries change everything.
Paul George. What a silly question
"Paul George, probably"
"Paul George, he's quite capable if he gains the consistency he's never had."
"I don't really have a problem with the Clipper fans I see on here, for the most part they're pretty cool. We don't like each other's teams, which is fine and to be expected, but they don't generally seem like huge assholes or anything. But it is really strange to me how much the Clippers themselves are always talking about the Lakers. I can't think of any other team that spends this much time specifically talking about another team, except when they're in a playoff series with them.   Ballmer in particular seems focused on the Lakers and their fans to an almost unhealthy degree. Not only did he put up all those billboards around LA targeting Laker fans, but he seems to talk about them in every interview. He just gave some long quote about them at the groundbreaking for his new arena last week, and now here he is again. And of course Doc Rivers used to talk about the Lakers a lot, as did Pat Beverley, Lou Williams and Paul George.   Rivalry between fans is fine, it's to be expected. But it's just frankly a little weird how much the Clippers seem focused on the Lakers. Maybe Ballmer feels like he'd prefer Laker fans are talking poorly about the Clippers than just not talking about them at all? I don't know what his deal is. Are there other sports owners that bring up some other team as much as Ballmer does with the Lakers? Do Clipper fans like how much Ballmer and the Clippers talk about the Lakers and their fans?"
"We’re not the team that chokes a 3-1 lead, has Kawhi with a torn ACL, and traded their whole future for Paul George."
Yeah the deadly duo of Paul George and Eric Bledsoe is gonna go beast mode.
Paul George for mvp
Imagine the memes if it's Paul George lmao
"&gt;Bad read by Doc  Nah, that's just how Doc is. He shit on PG and Lue last offseason, blaming Lue when PG criticized Doc's lack of adjustments vs DEN.  &gt; George found fault with the way that Rivers used him offensively, and he also criticized Rivers lack of adjustments over the course of the series against the Nuggets.   &gt; ""The way I was being used, I felt Doc was trying to play me as like a Ray Allen or like a JJ Redick, all pin-downs. I can do it, but that ain't my game,"" George said. ""I need some flow, I need some mixes of pick-and-rolls, I need some post-ups, just different touches, you know what I mean? That last season was just hard overall.  &gt; ""We went up 3-1. We felt like, we gonna win the next one. We lost. We like, 'Cool, we up 3-2, we gonna win the next one.' We lost. But during that whole process, we never worked on adjustments,"" George added. ""We never worked on what to do differently. We were just literally having the same s--- happen over and over again. It started to play a trick on you, like, man what's going on? We talking amongst each other, the conversations like, 'We gonna be alright.' The conversations should have been like, 'Nah, we need to change this. We need to switch this up.'   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/doc-rivers-responds-to-criticism-from-paul-george-i-think-everybody-needs-to-take-ownership/amp/  To which Doc responded:  &gt; “Hey, listen, I enjoyed coaching him,” Rivers said of George. “So not a lot to say there. Ty Lue was sitting right next to me. So he better hope it’s not adjustments. It ain’t going to be much different.”  https://sports.yahoo.com/doc-rivers-paul-george-adjustments-170037073.html  Now look at how Lue used PG in the 2021 playoffs. PnRs, isos, etc. Not to mention major adjustments like going 5-out, playing Reggie Jackson over Beverley and Rondo, and giving big minutes to Terrance Mann. But yeah - ""not much different,"" according to Glenn.  All Glenn does is choke in the playoffs, blame everyone else, and discredit other teams (eg, ""Celtics are the real 2010 champs"", ""2015 Warriors are lucky they didn't play the Clippers"")."
"If they had kept their core of Pat Bev/Montrezl/Shai, their rebrand would have worked.   But then you get Kawhi(who turned out to be a diva secretly) and Paul George..."
"Yup. As much as we like to sweep it under the rug, NBA Reddit has just as toxic an environment as NBA Twitter. Happened with Paul George too. At first it’s memes and playful banter based on players’ gaffes, and then it quickly turns to legitimate hate."
Dude averaged like a 36 point triple double against Kawhi and Paul George on a very mediocre team and took them to 7 games. He's headed for GOAT contention.  Pretty sure there's an argument over Jokic.
"Lol keep trying to convince yourself Jordan could make the passes lebron can. The star power in the league today is so much stronger than the players during Jordan’s time. Although the 90s did have all time great big men, there weren’t great forwards or guards. You couldn’t name 20 people better than these players: Kawhi, KD, Harden, Kobe, Steph, Westbrook, Paul George, Tatum, kyrie, Luka, dame, cp3, trae, melo, jimmy butler, Klay, Giannis, Zion, booker, mitchell.  Players in the 90s could not score the way these players can, and didn’t have the size/strength combo of someone like Giannis, Kd, or kawhi. Jordan’s competition was trash. Absolute trash. He’d dominate any era but lebrons accomplishments are more impressive due to his competition"
Paul George wins MVP
Paul George will finish top 5 in MVP voting if Clippers are actually decent.
"To me, they’re a top 6 seed. I base that evaluation off the fact that they are a very, very good defensive team even without Kawhi; they have an excellent coach in Ty Lue; they have a star level player; and they have a good supporting cast.  Other teams in the tier the Clippers are currently being lumped into are missing at least one of the above. The Blazers are a meh defensive team, and have a new HC. The Grizzlies are pretty good, but Ja is not in the same stratosphere as Paul George. The Warriors are close to the Clips, but there is too much uncertainty (Klay injury, Wiggins anti-vax, new players fitting into roles). The Mavericks are similar - probably a bit better.  In short, the only proven teams that are better than the Clippers beyond a shadow of a doubt are the Lakers, Suns, Nuggets, Jazz. I’d say the Mavericks are also better, slotting LAC in at 6. The team most likely to thwart the Clips chance of a top 6 finish is GSW due to their undeniable upside, but the risks with them are just as great.  I will always go up to bat for Paul George, because I feel as though he’s the most disrespected superstar level player in the NBA"
Paul George or Ben Simmons   Both are being looked down upon as very good basketball players. A ring would change everything with how they are viewed.
"Dragged poorly constructed teams twice to 7 games against maybe the best wing rotations in the league.  Like seriously the guy has no legit second option his 7’1 Center can’t post up on mismatches and he was being guarded by Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Marcus Morris, and Nic Batum, and Patrick Beverly for both his playoff appearances and still lit them up.  He’s a top 5 player."
Paul George.
"He certainly could.  He would need to surpass guys like Embiid, AD, Kawhi, Dame, Paul George, and Jimmy Buckets.  Definately can see him doing this"
Tbf the level of competition in the East absolutely sucked in the early to mid 2010s  Who was the best player besides LeBron? Paul George?
"Bradley Beal is beneath Paul George?? What has PG done in the past 2 years  Edit: just realizing how low Dame is too, this list is garbage"
There was the Paul George incident. Pretty sure he got fined for that
How TF is Bradley Beal 15?  Kyrie is easy too 15 fucking Paul George at 12 gross
I don’t think Paul George is better than Donovan and kawhi shouldn’t be on this list. The dude load managements 80% the regular season.
"Paul George and especially Bradley Beal are overrated, and Kawhi is crazy disrespected on this year’s list.  Kawhi is still top 5, Paul George isn’t better than Tatum, and Beal shouldn’t be on here Mitchell and Booker are better, I’d replace him with Kyrie"
"Omg, this antivaxx clown is all over the thread with his antivaxx bullshit.  Bet if Lebron says publicly he's fully vaxxed, this clown will switch his flair to the Clippers and Paul George."
"He hasn't won anything yet cause he's busy trying to beat paul george and kawhi leonard with his number 2 being a 7' 3"" bench shooter who gets like 4 rebounds a game. Luka has the ability and skillset to be the best on a championship team, AD just isn't built like that"
Why is Paul George on this list?
"Seth Curry is married to his coach’s (Doc Rivers) daughter, the same daughter that Paul George cheated on with a stripper."
"The Pelicans weren’t even bad with CP3, yet everyone acts like we missed the playoffs every year with him just because he requested a trade, and he requested the trad ebecause of how our past owner ran things. We were bad with AD with a bad FO, but we still almost made things right with the Boogie trade, until he tore his Achilles.   Now we have a new owner (old one died) and a totally new FO except for Fred Vinson who is a great assistant.  I know everyone wants to act like we massively failed this off-season because we lost the next great star PG in Lonzo Ball apparently, but if you watched the Pelicans and know that Lonzo was just a good role player for us, you’d know that the Pelicans were in a good position. Even if they only made the play-in tournament this year, we have no bad contracts, and a ton of good young players and picks, not to mention a top 10 center in Jonas Valunciounas, and a solid PG in Graham, and a All star in Brandon Ingram.  Everyone thinks the clippers will be fine with Paul George and role players like Reggie Jackson, Batum, Morris etc. this year, so shouldn’t the generational talent people are claiming we are wasting be able to be just as good with Valunciounas, Brandon Ingram, Graham, and good young pieces around them?  I know since your a Lakers fan your used to teams being able to make themselves better immediately by signing a difference maker that wanted to play for them. The Pelicans tried to do that, but no one wanted to play here from free agency. And you may want to say that small market teams can be successful because of the Bucks, but it took the Bucks a few years to get there too. It’s crazy that y’all already decided we’ve failed Zion when he’s played basically only 1 year with us.  And we are going in the right direction considering we’ve gotten better every year, and our core consist of young players who will continue to get better, and a veteran who won’t fall off soon. Not to mention all the picks and lack of bad contracts we have for flexibility in the future."
"It's possible but I don't see it happening at this point, it's crazy how much we've been blue balled by this battle , the Clippers have that huge collapse in the bubble , and then the Clippers duck the Lakers in the seeding but then the Lakers get eliminated in the first round anyways if it happens this year with Kawhi Leonard being out for much of the year maybe Paul George carries the Clippers to a six or seven seed and I'm sure the Lakers finished top three but there's no juice if it happens that way especially if Kawhi Leonard just doesn't play at all"
There were games where Luka looked like the best player on the court when kawhi and Paul George were on the other team.
Paul George would be half the compilation
"In what world are old ass Igoudola, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green better perimeter defenders than Paul George, Kawhi, and Pat Bev?  Luka literally made Pat Bev unplayable and Zubac could never see a minute on the court because of Luka.  Luka is a more efficient finisher at the basket, better mid range shooter, better post scorer, and his deep range shooting is as efficient as Harden's."
You don’t remember how paul George sucks? Yea he wasn’t the best but he was still scoring 20+ on good efficiency lol. Damned if you do damned if you don’t
"We've had 3 separate team builds contend for titles in the last 21 years, much better than most of the league. Those being the Reggie Smits squad that ran into Shaq, Ron artest Jermaine O'Neal team, Paul George Hibbert David West squad."
I didn't think it was that crazy t honestly. Depending what sort of additional assets the Clippers could get out of the Sixers. I think they would be selling high on a guy who is not a 100% lock to be the second best guy on a championship team. Plus this season is a wash for the clippers anyway so what does Paul George really do for you?
"Everyone is saying Pacers, but the problem with that is their market size. Many fans can easily lose interest if you tank for too long, so it would have to be seriously quick. If the team is to make money, those shorter playoff runs and hoping they can get a Paul George-type slightly later pick that turn out great is often the best they can do. I understand why people want them to go for the highest picks, but they can't really risk being like the Timberwolves if they want any revenue."
"Take out Dame, Blake, Kyrie, Yao. Put Nique, Rodman, Pau, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller in as locks. Add Paul George and Chris Bosh as honorable mentions.   I don't get how AD is a lock and Pau is not. Pau was a second option on back-to-back championship runs, AD was on only one."
"They’re not superior. They’re better fits. More teams might take White because they already have a star who’s better or has more potential than Demar. The Clippers for example would take Derrick White over Demar because they have Paul George. If they didn’t and wanted to stay competitive Demar would be higher on their list. The problem is that there aren’t many teams that either A. don’t have a star who’s better or B. Aren’t actively trying to suck. Neither type of team would want him at the moment but he was getting looks from the Lakers, Bulls, Toronto and I think a couple other teams."
"Except the Rockets have been contenders the last decade, Pacers have been 1st round exits at best, no real superstar after Paul George left"
"I never said that superstars are the top 12-15 players. I just think 2018-2019 Paul George was legit a top 7/8 player, maybe even top 5. He was firmly in superstar status and nothing short of top 10"
"OKC Paul George was easily a superstar, tf? Paul George had just come off a season averaging 28/4/8 on 58% TS%, which is the 2nd most ppg that year, all on insane defense. Paul George that year was easily one of the best defenders in the league. He got third in DPOY voting and was first team all defense. He was also all nba first team over forwards like KD, Kawhi, and Lebron. George was even third in MVP voting that year. Putting up monster offensive stats like that while being a DPOY finalist and being first team all nba and being third in mvp voting sounds like superstar status to me. I don’t understand how you can be third in mvp voting, all nba first team, all defense first team, 2nd in ppg, and not be a superstar."
"Paul George had 2 years left, he’s better than beal and it was a very specific situation with kawhi. And jrue holiday did not go for a massive package IMO."
"Jrue Holiday and Paul George aren't superstars either but had huge packages for them very recently. Beal was basically co-scoring-champ this year on very respectable 59 TS% (very good for this volume, and with Westbrook on the team.)   Assuming he says he'll re-sign with the team he's traded to, it will be a big deal for him."
"The Paul George redemption arc, Ty Lue’s adjustments, and the way they embraced team basketball was just awesome.  The fact that Reggie and Batum were buyout pickups is pretty impressive too. If that team is healthy with Kawhi and Ibaka, they definitely win last year (although if the Nets and/or Lakers are fully healthy, that changes things too)."
"Dawg if Paul George and Reggie Jackson could take us to 6, we definitely wouldn have lost with Kawhi."
Oh this tired trope again. The Lakers put themselves in a position to offer two max slots to LeBron and someone else (presumably Paul George) while still retaining enough young talent to flip for a 3rd star (which ended up being Anthony Davis).   The Pelicans drafted Zion and ever since have been throwing away assets and cluttering their team with negative value contracts like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. And this is following years of doing the same crap when Anthony Davis was there (like not hiring a medical/training staff for the team and acquiring and extending guys like Omer Asik). They're a poorly run team and always have been. You guys have been gifted three generational level talents in the draft in the last 20 years and you've wasted *all* of them. My guess is Gayle Benson is a shit owner just like her husband was and the team would probably be better off if she sold it to someone who knew what they were doing.
That Ben Simmons for Paul George trade proposal is laughable lmao
Who would you rather have on your team Paul George or Jayson Tatum
Brandon Ingram Jonathan Isaac Paul George Karl Anthony Towns
"LeBron isn't nearly as high as a lot of people would guess(although it doesn't surprise me too much, he's efficient but not AS efficient as Kawhi/KD/Curry in general)  It's also interesting how Paul George gets bumped up a lot which makes sense given that he didn't have a bad reputation in the playoffs until 2018  Westbrook's stats are even worse now though LOL"

"Damn some Saddiq love! Idk if he’s the next Paul George or the next Jae Crowder but I do know he’s gonna be a reliable starter for the next decade, pretty good for the 19th pick"
No he just realized the same thing Paul George and even Chris Paul thought playing under Doc is that he can be fake as hell. He spent all year telling Ben and media that nothing was wrong with his game and when it went wrong he didn’t want to back his guy
"I doubt a contending team trades Paul George; a top 12 or so 2 way demon and sharpshooter who their star specifically asked for, for Ben who half the time can’t even play in crunch time. Paul George is better at everything except passing, and even purely from a playmaking perspective he might be better since he’s a spacer and a scoring threat. The only rationale here is youth which sends the wrong message to Kawhi.  And if a dame or Beal trade happens it’ll be for a rebuilding package. Ben is already 25 and by the time those guys want trades he’ll be 26 or 27. He’s not gonna have much value to a team like that"
Paul George was damn good in 1v1s in team USA. He has the height but the talent disparity makes it an even matchup.
&amp;#x200B;  2016: Kevin Durant or Derozan/Lowry (surprised no one mentioned it)  2017: Kyrie Irving  2018: Jimmy Butler  2019: James Harden  2020: Paul George  2021: Ben Simmons
It takes a special person to make me like the way Paul George handled things. Ben Simmons is that special person
"The best deal I can imagine for the Sixers is:  LAC receives: Simmons, 2023 FRP, 2025 FRP  PHI receives: Paul George  Hear me out. Bill Simmons proposed basically this on his pod. This is a lost year for the Clippers. They need a point guard. They have the most 3 point shooting in the league and play small ball with no big routinely, especially in the playoffs. Paul George had a good playoffs but is 31. You get younger in this deal, you get an all-defense player, you get your point guard who was 4th in assisted 3s last year. And crucially, you get picks you swing another deal. If Dame or Beal does come available, you can send Simmons back out with picks to get in on it. For Philly, they get a perimeter player to pair with Embiid, finally.  I don’t see Daryl doing any of these other deals (CJ, Sexton, Etc) unless Adam Silver forces him to at gunpoint. (Which might happen). Daryl would rather send out additional picks with Ben than take 50 cents on the dollar."
Wtf did Paul George do
Paul George in 2020? You forgot what Harden did to force his way outta Houston????????
Clippers   PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Blake Griffin C: Bob McAdoo
It's L or K but after that C and G are pretty good  Chris Paul  Clyde Drexler  Carmelo Anthony  Charles Barkley  Chris Bosh   (Chris Webber's first name is not Chris)  lacks some interior defensive presence. Has some guys who can actually shoot a three.   G is also very nice  Gary Payton  George Gervin  Grant Hill  George McGinnis  Giannis   lacks anyone with a consistent 3 point shot though
Does young KD count since he was a sg then? He posted up a lot then too I feel he’d win if he gets ball 1st if not Id say indy Paul George/Zion someone had mentioned Mj wasnt as talented defensively in the post Zion quite literally just running at him like he does everyone else and bouncing off them for a hoop would probably work. Indy Paul was just a freak so yeah I’d pick him I’d say he relied more on athleticism than anything which is really the only way you could bridge the gap on Mjs skill.
"No idea why people are acting like it’s just ben wanting out. The sixers don’t even want him there, they’ve made it clear, his co star and coach threw him under the bus and ownership has been very actively and openly shopping him. Of course he doesn’t want to stay in that environment. This isn’t a Paul George situation in which he tanks a playoff team just because a better situation came up"
"Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Danny Granger, Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal         Bench: Monte Ellis, George McGinnis, Rik Smits"
"It’s hard to call it a play when Simmons unironically declared what he was going to do a month ago. The front office of the Sixers were EXTREMELY content in this whole situation until they realized they couldn’t get Lebron James in a trade. Honestly the only people that aren’t fucked in this scenario is the players. The coach shit talks a player to the media, the front office then doesn’t respect their word and goes on to play chicken for NO apparent gain.  As someone who watches OKC I thank fucking god I don’t have to watch your front offices decisions. When Paul George wanted out to play for the Clippers after performing sub par in 3 playoffs our office didn’t give a fuck he was gone. They’d rather go into a rebuild that attempt to fight a player about what they were going to do."
"Isn’t this what Anthony Davis, James Harden, and Paul George all did?   They forced themselves out of their contract early. This is nothing new."
"Man, I would have DESTROYED six year of Paul George at basketball. He wouldn’t have stood a chance!"
"I’m not interested in talking about his performances over half a decade ago.  For the past 4 years he’s had a sub 50% TS, and lost in the first round all years but one in which he’s had Beal Paul George and Harden as costars.  He’s an extremely inefficient high volume player, you can’t win a championship with that player on a supermax"
"Paul George wasn't a villain last year, he was just being relentlessly laughed at. More of a jester than a villain. He made up for it in this year's playoffs, kinda."
2016 Kevin Durant  2017 Kyrie Irving   2018 Jimmy Butler  2019 Anthony Davis / Kyrie (again)  2020 Paul George  2021 Ben Simmons
"I have really come around on the paul George situation. Like whatever negative feelings I had toward that whole situation just gradually dissipated with each bit of news we hear and what we see in the league. I’m back on the PG train especially after this, cause I know in my heart it was a Presti move. It only makes sense with what we know now"
I thought they meant the Paul George in Indy situation?
"&gt; supermax players only for them to leave anyway (which has not happened yet  Paul George was only on a regular max, but he still got moved 1 year into his 3 year max deal from OKC.  Closest example probably."
"uh, this has been going on for years lol lets not act like its all Simmons' and Pauls fault   Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Harden all happened in the last few years"
"Philly fans out here downvoting away but it’s the truth. Philly legit has no one to blame but themselves for this literally completely avoidable problem. Just treat your max guy with respect.   How many times did Toronto shit on Derozan or Lowry? Or Harden in Houston after that Spurs series?   No other team literally throws their player under the bus like that. And the funniest thing about all of this is it’s Doc Rivers unprofessional ass. Horrible coach, horrible GM. He tried throwing Paul George &amp; Ty Lue under the bus. Ty Lue and PG proved Doc is a fucking fraud tho.   I can understand Embiid being upset even tho it was a stupid place to air that grievance. It’s also on him. He alienated the dude.   Ben Simmons owes Philly nothing. Fanbase, FO &amp; roster have all shown he’s not wanted. Why the fuck would he bend over backwards for them? Why do them any favors at all after all the disrespect? Ben passed up on dunk but Embiid had like 8 turnovers. Doc never made any adjustments. Everyone should have taken responsibility for shitting the bed."
"Yeah, this is totally unique, and the the league and owners would be stupid to not take advantage of it. This isn’t Kobe mid 2000s, Paul George, AD, Butler, or even Kawhi. Or arguably even Vince Carter. This is a guy who genuinely just doesn’t care and won’t take responsibility.  This should be the event that sets a lower limit on players that can demand trades. Honestly, the league should place cap relief on the Sixers if this goes to hell for them but they stand their ground."
AD was on the final year of a contract.   So he doesn’t fit what I said. It did happen with Paul George and Harden.   So does 2 examples make that something that happens “all the time”?
"It happens consistently pretty much every single time a star player requests a trade. AD, Paul George, Harden all got traded exactly where they want to go.   I’m also not sure why you’re acting like this is such a horrendous thing for the team. I guarantee you all those teams would rather have the trade packages they got for their stars than getting nothing in return for losing them in free agency."
"It might work in particular situations, such as Paul George and OKC, where both groups were on the same page. The problem is that the more this happens the more a precedent is set, and the more paranoid the owners get about the players having them over a barrel."
"Says the raptors fan. I don’t know why Brown gets this capped out treatment, his biggest weakness is his playmaking, which will get better with age. With his athleticism, shooting ability, and defensive potential, he can certainly become Paul George or that level."
He just signed an extension. Paul George is the only notable player to ask out less than a year after that big of a contract extension. It’s not unprecedented but it is unlikely. Embiid also loves Philly and his family is there. You can’t apply thot-chasing Paul George logic to Embiid.
The Ben Simmons situation is what people think the Paul George situation was
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."

You guys were able to jump start it at least with that Paul George trade. We got screwed with Bynum and our only real asset was Jrue. Think we could have fielded a 6-8 seed team if we really wanted.

"Well they care, but the don't value winning in the playoffs to the point where they would tank to do it.  They are in Indiana, the basketball capital of the world.  There will always be basketball fans in Indiana, and Indiana basketball fans love underdogs (like the movie Hoosiers).  So being a middle of the pack team trying to overcome the odds plays right into the culture of Indiana basketball.  Plus many fans would rather see there team compete every year rather than go through a tank just for a shot at a championship.  How many teams in the last 20 years have actually won a championship by ""blowing it up"" without adding LeBron?  Maybe 2?  With those odds you basically have the same odds of getting an All-NBA caliber player in the middle of the draft like Curry or Booker.  Heck they did it back to back years with Paul George and Kawhi. They just didn't keep Kawhi."
"I mean the reason you tank is to get these all star level talent type guys. The pacers have had these players. They had Paul George for the ECF runs, he gets hurt, doesn’t wanna be here so they trade him. They get back Oladipo and Sabonis. Oladipo has a couple great all star level seasons in Indiana and they think hey, that’s our guy to build around. Unfortunately injuries fuck up oladipo, but then Sabonis emerges and they try and build around him. It’s not the same core of guys keeping them just decent.   They assumed it wasn’t the talent, it was the coaching that prevented success, which given the reports on Bjorkren maybe, but they made a change to get carlisle and if he can’t fix it, than that’s probably it for this core of guys"
"If russ couldn't be successful with kd , paul george , harden , beal and he's starting the season off like this i really wouldn't call it a hot take"
Thunder also had a headstart of a trillion picks + young star by trading Paul George. I don't believe Sixers even had that opportunity.
Lauri has been outstanding defensively the last three games. Look at his numbers when defending against MPJ and and Paul George
Wasn't he a throwaway trade piece on Paul George trade? He is so good.
"These arguments are ridiculous tho lol. Every player kinda has their own code, and even if Westbrook was pissed when PG did it, what’s he gonna do? Call out Paul George to the media after the playoff win?"
Don't think he said anything when [PG did it.](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/04/20/okc-thunder-nba-playoffs-paul-george-reverse-dunk-next-question/)
Don't think he felt the same [when PG did his dunk](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/04/20/okc-thunder-nba-playoffs-paul-george-reverse-dunk-next-question/) as the clock wound down
Paul George’s parents are Paul and Paulette George.   Paul George also just had a son which named… Paul George.
Man all I can think about is how Paul George did this (with even more showboating) to the Blazers on his and Russ’s last win with the Thunder.

"With Lauri Markkanen as their primary defense in the past 3 games, Paul George was 6 of 20 for 12 points, MPJ was 4 of 14 with 11 points and Deandre Hunter was 2-11 with 8 points."
"Lauri Markkanen: The Paul George stopper  Reggie Jackson blatantly changing his pivot foot 25 feet from the hoop in front of the entirety of Staples Center and not getting called for a travel perfectly summed up this game, F- refereeing tonight"
Umm his teamate Paul George did the same thing 2019 playoffs that one time they beat Portland...
"Hey guys, George Paul is back!"
"Can’t believe Westbrook got a technical for that. In the 1950s, this would have been an absolute non-issue. Can you imagine spewing such nonsense to George Mikan, or Paul Arizin?  The game has gone soft."
"&gt; Because media circuses, especially those caused by fringe All NBA guys are viewed as an unnecessary headache.  Not sure if you're implying that Ben will request a trade from wherever he's traded to, or that the media circus will inexplicably follow him wherever he goes after the trade.  &gt; How is a player being willing to sit out a season because he’s upset at the franchise/ doesn’t have the ability to deal with fan toxicity not a “change in what he brings to the table”?  He dealt with by far the most toxic fanbase for 4 years and there were really no problems. I think it's pretty hard to deny that with doc/embiid kinda throwing him under the bus, and the entire fanbase hating him, these are pretty unique circumstances that are not likely to happen on a new team. Stars request trades all the time. For teams like, say indiana, who lost oladipo and paul george, the probability of any star leaving is quite high. Is the pacers FO gonna look at ben and say, ""well, he asked for a trade under the worst circumstances possible, that means he's more of a flight risk than the average star""? I really don't think so.  And if we're gonna look at Ben's actions under a micropscope, why don't we consider both sides of things? Ben has been plagued by the yips in the playoffs, shouldn't the fact that he's seeking mental health treatment be great news, and boost his trade value? It just feels like cherry picking at this point.  At the end of the day, sure player personality matters sometimes, but I think it's mostly fodder for media narratives. Front offices don't hire psychologists to scrutinize the psychology behind every tiny thing a player does. ""He requested a trade, that means he's mentally weak"" does that sound like something a psychologist or a good GM would say, or does that sound like something skip bayless would say? I'm fairly confident that for most front offices, talent trumps minor personality issues."
Except it goes both ways - Ainge sitting on picks got us Tatum and Brown instead of a year each of Paul George and Demarcus Cousins
The same reason Kobe and Mike are underrated passers. The same reason Paul George is an underrated shooter. The same reason Curry is an underrated finisher
"There were rumors that ATL was looking to move Cam Reddish in the offseason and at that time I would say Reddish and White's value were comparable and I'd even give the edge to White. But since the season started, Reddish has been playing like Paul George so I doubt ATL would want to move him at all anymore."
"Right but Harden was also at the end of his contract and asked for a trade because the Rockets were headed for a rebuild. Multiple terrible trades got them there.   I do agree that things are different now but the situation with Embiid would be a bit different too. Outside of Paul George what other superstar trades have happened so early into contracts? And ones from a high seeded team. All I’m getting at is there are other factors here. Hopefully we never find out tho lol, at least not with Embiid."
"This is a big part of why the Lakers were so bad for a couple years there. People today like to just trash the Lakers for being so poorly run or whatever, but the truth is they really went all in that year with Dwight and Nash to try to make one or two more title runs with Kobe and it blew up spectacularly because of injuries and Dwight leaving.   Dwight was coming off back surgery that year and has never been the same player after that, Nash broke his leg in his second game with the Lakers (and suffered permanent nerve damage and he also was never the same player again), and Kobe tore his Achilles and he too was never the same player after that. That was all on top of the Chris Paul veto which alienated Odom (who demanded to be traded) and Pau.   No matter what, after going all in like that with all the players and picks sent out to put that team together, the Lakers were giving away their future to try to win in the present. The only problem was their present was killed by injuries, so it was just bad for them all around. It would be like if immediately after the Clippers getting Paul George and Kawhi, Kawhi suffered a career altering injury and PG left in free agency a year later. You can't fault the Lakers for trying to go all in to win, but people still today think they were just the victims of poor management. That was a factor later, for sure, but putting together a team of Kobe, Pau, Dwight and Nash at the time was seen as the title favorites, but that all blew up, of course."
Imagine if they took Paul George in 2010 instead of Evan Turner.
Sam Presti really traded Serge Ibaka for Paul George. Go even further Sam Presti turned serge Ibaka into SGA Gallo and 5 firsts
"Remember when Russ got traded to Houston and then the first game back against OKC, I think Russ and his new team lost. And afterwards everyone was like “omg Russ’s new teammates let him down in this big game!” because the Rockets lost.   That was so fucking weird. Russ was acting like it was some sort of revenge game when the Thunder caved to everything Russ wanted his whole career. Then Russ was the one who wanted out of OKC! Paul George backstabbed him and then Russ requested out too. And then Russ had to pretend he was out for revenge against OKC. Fucking bizarre."
"Beal is not top ten  Paul George had a great regular season, but not how top ten works  Higher than him that year - Lebron, Curry, Durant, Harden, Giannis, Embiid, Kawhi, Dame, AD, Jokic"
"Paul George/Jimmy Butler tier.  PG13 v Pippen is a legitimate debate IMO. George is the better scorer, Pippen the better passer, both great defensive players. George had better success as a #1 guy and the better peak season but Pippen played  big role on multiple championship teams. Pretty close."
Paul George was a top 10 player that season before the All-Star break. After that he wasn't great.
That officiating crew was straight up dogshit. Hassan getting ejected for Green throwing a ref and running at him?! That was dumb but a couple plays after Will Barton had such an obvious pushoff that he owes royalties to Paul George for using it. Everytime these teams play the physicality is so one-sided it hurts to watch but the better team won and still covered so no harm i guess.
"Kawhi ain’t a top 75 player and is nowhere near as great of a player as people claim he is. He was surrounded by elite defensive talent and amazing veteran savvy on the offensive end during his Raptors run, and he hasn’t shown he could be “that guy” ever since. Even with his time on the Spurs, he wasn’t doing anything Jimmy Butler or Paul George hadn’t done."
"I thought Luka would be a bust   i thought Tatum would be a bust   i thought Simmons, Ingram and Jaylen Brown would be busts  i thought KAT would be a bust   i thought Embiid would be a bust and specifically thought Jokic would be a bust at #41  i thought Bennett would be the GOAT and Giannis would be a bust   i thought AD, Beal and Dame would be busts and Miami should have traded LeBron to draft MKG #1  i thought Kyrie would be a bust and Kawhi was a massive reach at #15  i thought Wall and Cousins and Paul George would be busts   i thought Blake, Harden, Curry, DeRozan and Jrue would be the five worst players in the draft   i thought Rose and Love would be busts and that Westbrook would play for 20 years and never get a triple double   i thought Durant was too skinny and should have gone in the second round  i thought LMA was a bust and Rondo and Lowry were the two worst PGs in the draft   i thought Deron Williams and Chris Paul were busts  i thought Dwight was a bust   i thought LeBron was a bust"
It's almost like that team also had \*Paul fucking George\* as their second star
"Damien Lillard, outside of the year he sent us packing with that shot over Paul George, is the most overrated superstar in the game. He’s a big plus on offense but such a zero on defense that also doesn’t elevate his team enough. And believe me I know about an offensive dynamo who’s a defensive minus not elevating the team to the heights it wants to go to. Like Russ, Lillard is a floor raiser, but he’s not a ceiling raiser. He’s never going to be the alpha on a championship team, no matter what complimentary pieces Portland puts around him."
"Yeah, I think my favorite version of this is what happened with ""Playoff P""  [Paul George originally mentioned ""Playoff P"" as a joke during a press scrum and no one really cared about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBcKrWEercc)  [Then in a subsequent press conference a reporter throws ""Playoff P"" without context to Melo and Melo's reaction is what got noticed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1EZtVrKIps)"
Mine is that Paul George blows
Paul George is the most well-rounded player in the nba bro is literally good at everything
Paul George is the best 2nd option in the league
"No they still win with pretty much any top 20 player you can name barring redundancy such as another point guard like dame or Westbrook. Any big man, or wing in the top 20 puts them over the top. You don’t think AD for example doesn’t make them that much better? Or how about Paul George?  In fact I’d argue their offense might even run smoother with one of those two considering they don’t need iso touches. Durant may be better than them but any top talent that can shoot/defend/for the system puts them over the top"
"Kind of a weird stat. Steph ranked #15 in the league last year, below noted mover Zion (who played fewer MPG).  CJ, Zack LaVine, FVV, Paul George, Dame seem to consistently rank high every year along with Steph."
The bad shots are finally catching up  \-Paul George
"I was so grateful that we somehow dodged you guys (tho it turned out poorly regardless...)  The Clippers have had great PG defenders since the CP3 days and your entire team last year had crazy length. Paul George or Leonard can slow Lillard down enough to let the rest of your team make it tough for the rest of our guys. Then if McCollum is hot, you just slide over PG13 or Leonard and shut him down.  It's such a massive personnel mismatch it's crazy. That would've been the easiest 4-0 for the Clippers, maybe a 4-1 at best for the Blazers."
"If Westbrook can't even win a single ring after a career of playing with James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James and Anthony Davis there is no way he escapes the failure label."
I’m not just jumping on the Joel/ben can’t work bandwagon. I’ve been saying this for a while.   Ben def has some personality quirks and one can surmise his circle is filled with yes men.   But I don’t think the most extreme situation should be cause for shitting on the league.   I think there’s a lot of issues here…   A. The Sixers have a personal issue.  B. You have a GM who doesn’t believes that chemistry isn’t really relevant.  C. I really don’t know if doc is a good fit for this situation either.  D. I just think it’s obvious ben isn’t working there. The team tried to ship him off last year and the rockets used their offer as leverage against the nets.   So team doesn’t want you. You become the scape goat of the teams playoff exit of course he doesn’t wanna be there.   I just think ben needs the right situation. Morrey will not take any offer that isn’t a Paul George return so he’s kind of forced to wait it out?   Deciding to sit out is the only way he can really force the hand.   Every game he plays poorly it’s scrutiny and attention so why would you want to return?
I think Paul George will be
"&gt;""I'm no James Harden. That's not my knack...to just shoot the ball, score the ball. I can and I pride myself on being effective on both ends. **But there's going to be nights like this where I just can't make a shot**, and I can't allow that to affect my game.  &gt;""Shot-making...scoring the ball is not what I do. I try to do everything, I try to play the game the right way and just get lost in the game and try to pass the ball and make plays defensively, rebound. Just a little bit of everything. I am going through a tough time, but good thing about it, we are up 2-1 in this series and I haven't shot the ball well.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2905797-paul-george-on-shooting-slump-scoring-the-ball-is-not-what-i-do  🤡  And Doc Rivers.  &gt;""I'm not worried about it,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He's a great player. He's human. I can guarantee you this, he has not forgotten how to shoot. It will fall for him.""  And Kawhi.  &gt;""I mean, he's good,"" Leonard said. ""We all start from scratch again Game 4. You shoot 100% from 3 in two games, three games, doesn't mean you're going to shoot well going forward. It's all from scratch again. This is playoff basketball.  And even more Paul George himself.  &gt;""I'm obviously struggling shooting, struggling scoring the ball,"" George said. ""It didn't affect us winning tonight.""  &gt;""I still got to be aggressive and still try to make plays,"" he added. ""I will do everything I can to win a ballgame. Some nights are just going to be like that, I am not going to make shots, but I got to find a way to make an impact.""  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29715159/paul-george-downplays-critiques-amid-shooting-slump-no-james-harden"
"Basically. Paul George always looks smooth with it, but there were certainly no excuses about ""playing well, just not making shots"" in the bubble lol"
"I can give you 30 other guys from the 70s in the NBA alone (not including the ABA) that were clearly better and more impactful than Bing.  Kareem, Walton, Lanier, Unseld, Reed, Debusshere, Dandridge, Frazier, Monroe, Gus Johnson, Gus Williams, Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham, Dennis Johnson, Elvin Hayes, McAdoo, Maurice Lucas, Oscar Robertson's last years, Jerry West's last years, Wilt's last year, Dr. J's intro to the NBA, Randy Smith, Artis Gilmore, David Thompson, George Gervin, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, Jojo White, Jim Chones.  There. 30 guys who anyone around in the 70s would have said made more of an impact on their teams than Dave Bing did."
"I also wanted them to trade those picks but I get why they didn't. Wiggins, 7, 14, and (maybe) Wiseman is going to get you a player significantly better than Wiggins, but there really aren't too many of those players who were both available and a good fit for the team.   For example, I would've done Wiggins, Wiseman, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Paul George. That's fair value in a vacuum and we are immediately contenders if we do that. But the Clippers would never. Another would've been that package for KAT, but the Wolves would never. Etc.   Before the Bulls made their moves this offseason, I thought maybe they were going to blow it up again since Lauri and Coby both failed to become stars, and I thought Wiggins/7/14 for Lavine was a good exchange. But ofc that didnt happen"
"While this is true, we as fans have collectively always looked at accolades and awards instead of memorable moments. Unless Dame wins a chip, MVP or something, it will be very hard for him to be remembered. I think this also applies to Paul George, so far."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
How about he strives for Paul George first and then moves onto all time greats.
Trae young got the same contract as Luka.   So...suggests he is also a supermax rookie extension player.  And what about Donovan Mitchell's 5 195 rookie max?  What about Paul George? Kevin Durant?  Anthony Davis? Jimmy Butler?
"And the blame solely lies on Ben here.  Paul George was absolutely massacred by the media and fans in 2019, and so was Westbrook before that, and many more before.  If a max contract player does not show up in play-offs, everyone will be out for his head.  This is prevalent in every sport, comes with the territory. It's just Ben being Ben, he's a man-child that just can't handle criticism."
"nets or clips have best hairline though in kyrie or paul george, i'd say celtics have third place runner up with our jays"
Paul George for Indy
Dame 4-1 in the playoffs against Paul George
"Since Malice in the Palace people switched over to the Colts and never came back.  Interest was rising again with Paul George vs the Heat, but he got injured then forced his way out.  Oladipo looked exciting then got injured and wanted out.  Granger before both of them.  Just years of the same, injured stars who eventually ask to leave.  Comparing that to a team who recently had 2 of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, I guess its obvious why theyd prefer the Colts although I'm not a football fan personally."
Paul George should be in.
"with all due respect to Dame, he usually plays like shit against the Clippers.   0-6 now against Cornrow Clipper Paul George."
Paul George approves.
Defensive Paul George Of the Year
"yes but who else in the east is beating a trio of one of the top 5 and the other guys i listed 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ a young durant, wb, and harden made it out of the blood bath of the west. what makes you think durant couldnt do it with wade and bosh, kyrie and love in the east… against guys like paul george, old boston big 3… lowry and derozan. cmon man"
Paul George now leads the league in steals
Man honestly I’m thinking Paul George deserves it more tbh
"Paul ""thick hog"" George &gt; Dame ""micro penis"" Lillard"
"Beside the efficiency this game, Paul George has been playing like a top ten player this season so far"
"Paul ""Am I fucking going over"" George"
Paul George had 8 steals lol
"For some reason Dame sucks against Clippers but this was different. Dude just stopped caring.  Paul ""Hamburglar"" George with 8 steals."
Not anymore Paul George has 4 steals per game
"I am interested in how they would fix this issue.  The 3 I can think of is Paul George, harden and Simmons. Signed big contracts and wanted out. Whether it is settled amicably or not, it will have negative impact in the future. No team is safe anymore."
He got kept off because he’s on the Lakers but let’s be honest Thybulle didn’t deserve it either. Guaranteed if Paul George played 20 MPG and only focused on defense he’d be lockdown too
"If Pandemic P came from Paul George being amazing in the bubble rather than the opposite, it’d be a top tier name for sure."
OKC got that haul without Paul George destroying OKC's leverage. That's the point.
Paul George and Spida Mitchell.
Paul George. Shai. Gallinari. What 6 years of picks?
if he gets a shot he’s paul george.   shooting aint easy though.
"Ironically, the distance from my Granparents old house in Sacramento to the Warriors old Coliseum is the same as Palmdale (where Paul George grew up) and Moreno Valley (where Kawhi grew up) to Staples. And yet, unless you live here, everyone says they grew up in L.A.  Where Kobe lived in Irvine is only 20 miles closer (about 60 miles).  And yeah. All of that is considered as LA’s market.  Actually, according to blackout rules (can’t find NBA but here’s MLB)  https://images.app.goo.gl/kp2h8MjtRbfDyrfS9  And based on fans according to the New York Times here are where the fans of said teams are:  https://images.app.goo.gl/1RbHqwgSoQxmPJef6  The interactive map for baseball also goes to show how the idea of these “markets” is ludicrous. The Giants stretch all the way down to central California, go past the Oregon border and well into Nevada.   The Wolves are a small market by NBA standards but the Twins breach 7 states and have heavy heavy support in the big cities."
"I don’t see this happening for the same reasons Lowe explained. The biggest being there players have no good reason to accept such a deal. The other thing is trade requests is vague. Sure, some guys outright say it, but that’s not how it happens in most cases. At least not in ways in which a player wouldn’t have plausible deniability (especially if you turn it into a rule). Admits all the team executive freak out reports, I wonder if the Pacers would prefer Paul George just go to LA or if the Pelicans would prefer AD played out his deal. I think these teams would be either looking to trade these guys when they don’t sign an extension or losing them to free agency anyway.   Simmons is a unique example, but this is just the result of a team trying and failing to trade a guy resulting in him wanting off the team himself. There are already measures to punish a guy for not playing.   Even in terms of dollars, I don’t think this is the major solution people think it is. We’ve seen that when players want to go somewhere, they get there even taking less money.   I also find this player empowerment issue to be overstated. Is anyone up in arms over restricted free agency? As long as you can keep a guy for the first 7 or so years of his career 99% of the time if you want, I don’t think there needs to be any leverage pushed back towards ownership."
"Paul George openly talked about how dififuclt it was mentally to deal with the bubble and the public slander and said he was in a very dark place mentally, is that really the comparison you want to use lmao"
Didn’t Paul George start this with OKC?
"People overreact on playoff performances too much as always, the small sample size in the playoffs has skyrocketed or has fucked up many players reputation, playoff runs especially like one series is just way too little as a sample size  Example: Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Lillard for the positive side, Harden for the negative side, Harden is actually a better playoff performer than all of them but once you get a reputation good luck, Paul George as well"
"If this is true, doesn't that mean the average fan is looking at things all wrong? Serious question.   Imagine thinking higher of Paul fucking George considering how disappointing that iteration of the Thunder were relative to expectations, compared to your franchise's GOAT, with whom your team *far* exceeded any expectations you would have had when he was drafted."
"Melo was better in every way. His consistency and longevity was a huge key. Paul George is amazing DONT get me wrong. But Melo was heavily snubbed from a bunch of all nba back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. (2006,2009,2011, 2014) these four all nba selection should have been given to him. 2014 and 2009 one should had been automatic but for whatever reason boozer got it over him in 2009 and Kevin love in 2014.  Also don’t forget the forward selection from the 2000s was heavily dominated by Garnett dirk duncan lebron. There was no way PG would get first place over them. Melos 2013 all nba selection was also the hardest to get first place. Durant managed to edge Melo out with 50/40/90 and Lebron was just at his absolute best. Had the knicks management with Phil Jackson been competent the Knicks would had been a consistent playoff team. No reason to blow up a team that was second seed in 2013."
"I don't think the OKC Paul George is a particularly good example. The only reason OKC fans aren't livid about it is cause of the godlike return they got for him.   Even then, he was the laughingstock of the league for a period of time for saying he would stay with both Indy &amp; OKC, yet he bounced."
People really throw this at Ben Simmons and Harden but don't forget about fuckin Paul George forcing his way out after signing a massive extension.
"yeah, but you'd much rather them go about their business quietly (see: OKC Paul George) instead of making a spectacle (see: Dwightmare, AD, Simmons, etc). Things go smoother for everybody that way."
There’s a reason why the average Thunder fan’s opinion of Paul George is much higher than Kevin Durant despite the discrepancy of their careers in OKC.
The Thunder seem to be in a much better place with their draft chest than if Paul George and Russell Westbrook left in Free Agency
Paul George did it literally 2 days ago.
He played his typical game. Paul George did this to the warriors too except nobody else on the clippers could shoot. Ayton and defense is the suns key
Why make it seem like it’s not common? “Paul George attempts a three” would get 5k upvotes here easily
Hindsight 20/20 and pure hypothetical but wonder from time to time how different the NBA would be if the warriors drafted Paul George and Somehow still landed green and Klay
"We're arguing semantics at this point.   It's like saying Paul George, straight up, was traded for SGA, Danilo and 6 firsts. Which completely takes things out of context. As they were desperate for Kawhi."
He could make it  3 frontcourt starters  Jokic LeBron AD (fan vote)  3 front court reserves Paul George Rudy gobert  JV/ayton/towns/KP
"I mean I guess he was for that one year, but he isn’t anymore.  Like Paul George"
"By that logic LeBron would be a PG too. He certainly plays like it.  I think Luka's playstyle is more like the other modern day primary stars of their team (LeBron, KD, Paul George, etc) and they tend to be considered forwards.  If you wanna call Luka a guard than he turns the ball over too much to be  ahead of Booker here. Booker has less turnovers and significantly better defense. He would be the 2nd All Star guard behind curry imo  If you wanna call him a PG then he's not nearly as complete as you suggest averaging almost 5 TOs a game."
"I think Jokic deserves to be in tier 1. Giannis is just that half step below so I’d almost go tier 1a and 1b.  Luka has not played well enough this year, so I’m more inclined to go with your breakdown for the lower tiers. Of course this is only at the moment I expect Dame and Luka to be up in tier 2 by season end.   Also I need to see Paul George succeed in the playoffs.   Harden is another interesting omission, but not many of his moves work with the officiating this year and he’s clearly lost a step so idk where he will end up. I think the nets need him to be a 25+ ppg scorer in the playoffs to get through the East this year, assuming kyrie doesn’t play."
Imo it’s Paul George his game is beautiful
Yeap  Especially looking at fellow blockbuster free agents KD and Kawhi/Paul George. The chip already made it worthwhile.  They are playing with house money right now.
I think it's because only winning 1-3 more games the next couple years with Paul George was far less impressive to say the least  Like you aren't going to give the award to a 4th-6th seed who played with an All NBA level player the entire season

And the rest you’re coaching Kawhi Leonard and Paul George
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.   If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
"His lack of 3 point shot decreases his value + the lack of free throws from jumping into the defender. Paul George is barely considered as top 10 and he is an elite 3 point shooter.  As great as Wade was, I don't think he brings bigger impact than Curry, Durant, Giannis, Jokic and Kawhi."
"they just need to relocate at this point. they've been doing shit like this ever since lebron was drafted. they let boozer walk away for nothing while being a rfa. they signed larry hughes over ray allen or michael redd. didn't want to trade jj hickson for prime amare stoudemire or iguodala. didn't want to trade kevin love for paul george in 2018 or they could have traded kyrie for middleton and bledsoe instead of getting isaiah thomas and  a bunch of make a wish kids. not to mention drafting luke jackson infront of josh smith and kevin martin. drafted dajaun wagner over amare stoudemire and caron butler. also drafting dasagna diop over joe johnson, zach randolph, richard jefferson and gilbert arenas. traded jamal crawford for chis mihm. drafting anthony bennett. the whole franchise is a joke"
"Who's filling out the SF, PF, and C spots? If it's just role players, then they're a non-playoff team. If you put a good All-Star next to them (i.e Paul George, healthy Zion, Butler, etc.), I'd say 2nd round exit.   A good, fun, contending lineup for the Ball bros would be:  Lamelo, Lonzo, Paul George, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bam Adebayo  LiAngelo is your 11th/12th man"
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.  If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
Man Paul George looking real rough lately
Paul george for wiggins and moody
i like the lakers cause i grew up watching them but i also like the clippers cause paul george is from my hometown
"randle still leads the team in assists by a lot and is running an effective 2 man game with fournier, he leads the team in potential assists per game by an insane amount  as far as frontcourt players go only jokic, draymond, lebron and giannis are ahead of him in that category.  and jimmy butler and paul george but they are kind of hybrid SF/SGs.   either way all those guys are elite players and many time all stars/all NBA players.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?sort=POTENTIAL_AST&amp;dir=1  just long stretches where nobody is hitting their shots, randle is putting it in their hands  too many times this season it's a ping pong game where he passes it to kemba, kemba dribbles for a few seconds then gives it back to randle with minimal time left on the clock.   his game should look better with better PG play and it has several times this season when kemba was benched late in games"
You are being downvoted but tell me a superstar who is better at everything compared to PG. Paul George is arguably the most well rounded superstar ever.
Paul George.
Paul George is so good they really named a position after him
"If you're trying to make the best possible team with a starter from each team in the division, then Pacific should be -   PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Paul George  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  And this team is better than any of the other teams"
"If I had to pick between paying a talented, injury prone prospect an albatross contract and drafting a bust late lottery, I'd definitely pick the latter. Way less detrimental long term.   But either way it might not have mattered for the Clippers. There's a good chance MPJ would have been sent to OKC in the Paul George package."
"The main things you need to win a championship is a top 5 player and luck. Clippers got a top 5 player with Paul George as his side kick and started running their mouths.   As good as this Warriors team is, you have also seen them set the record for longest win streak to start a season and they lost that year in the finals.   So instead of crowning yourself, maybe just say you like their chances and think they can do it. If Curry tweaks his ankle, then the Warriors chances are back to nothing."
"I don’t think the Warriors go on this run without Steph playing the way he has been yeah?  Most valuable player for their team is possibly Paul George, KD is another example, as is CP3."

 Paul George not being in the top 10 is utter nonsense
Ask Paul George
Paul George
I see you’re an OKC fan.. are you just basing off this from the time Jerami Grant still on OKC with Paul George and Nerlens Noel shutting Giannis down that one regular season game years ago? Because I can assure you Jerami Grant by his lonesome is not stopping Giannis or any top 10 player at all
Wasn’t it Paul George? He’s not 6’10”.
i think paul george got better since his injury
"Paul George tried acting like a point guard this game, thus, the turnovers."
"Clippers came out solid, Morris was cooking, Bledsoe hit a few jumpers, Zubac beasted ---- but they were still looking very sluggish despite all of this. They had plenty of chances to bury the Warriors but Hartenstein was the only player besides George that didnt shut their brain off after the first quarter.  For the Warriors, early game and looking ahead to Phoenix --- it's understandable. However, they were very sloppy and were trying to hand the Clippers the game, each team kept matching each other's bonehead plays. The one thing that teams should not do against Golden State is have a one-man army approach. The Warriors dared anyone else but George to do something and they won that battle this day, even with the PG 2nd half spectacle.  Both defenses looked good. Clippers were not allowing any easy layups but they often had one guy slip up which led to the easy backdoor cuts and dive cuts. I feel like they did not pressure Curry enough to give it up, let him do his thing all night. The Warriors had all 5 guys connected all night, so many deflections and steals --- they dared George to play through the doubles and for Kennard and Jackson to do anything except stand on the 3 point line. Will be interesting to see how they approach Booker with Paul running point and a more aggressive Phoenix attack.  Also, why do these refs suck? Just pick and choose what's a foul and what isn't. The first technical is some clown school garbage. But that was the gasoline for the fire that Hartenstein decided to start. I wish refs would just call the game the same way the entire game, not flip back and forth based on the game flow or try to constantly overcorrect bad calls. Just own the bad call and keep calling the game."
"And let's not forget the play where Paul George just decked Curry in the most egregious moving screen I've seen all season, and no whistle - Kerr had to burn his challenge to get them to call it."
"Record and narrative. Another example is Paul ""Top 5 player"" George who is playing worse than he did last season but getting way more love for MVP and stuff"
Just realized Kawhi Leonard isn't playing. Dude is always so damn hurt. Extremely overrated player. At least Paul George plays. Kawhi nowhere to be found. Can't wait till he retires
Erg. Paul George never gets calls. Glad to see the refs letting both sides go. Not just one.
He beat a clippers team with Paul George and Terrence man. Harden had to face the fucking warriors with Chris either on the bench or playing horribly. Stop it
"wtf is paul george doing with 8 turnovers, jesus"
Paul George vacationing on Wiggins Island and he's not having a good time

"It's a really unique thing. To fit the profile you have to be   A) really good when in your prime  B) a bit of a diva to refuse changing when you fall off  C) have one or two skills/abilities that remain at an elite level to justify being a high value role player. Specifically something that isn't on-ball because that's where you're going to want your stars to be.  So someone who's currently operating a lot on-ball but could still be effective off-ball.   Maybe someone like Paul George ? He could fit the mold of what Carmelo is doing now + better defense when he gets older, but he'd have to accept he can't just freelance offense on the ball like he often does now."
"You’re telling me someone like kawhi, Paul George or jimmy butler couldn’t  lock him down if you could hand check"
"Westbrook isn't hard to play with if your a primary scorer. He didn't have issues sharing the ball with Durant, Paul George, Harden, or Beal. He's had no issues deferring to LeBron and AD this year. Westbrook might be hard to play with if you're Reggie Jackson, but he's superstar friendly."
"&gt;	On Monday's episode of The Lowe Post, ESPN.com's Brian Windhorst disclosed the Pacers unsuccessfully attempted to nab Irving in advance of the NBA draft as buzz started to build that George was being shopped.  &gt;	""I know that around the draft and in the Paul George talks, the Cavs were not willing to make Kyrie Irving available for Paul George,"" Windhorst said.  &gt;	""The Pacers offered Paul George for Kyrie Irving,"" ESPN.com's Zach Lowe added. ""That's a thing that happened, according to people that we've talked to.""   &gt;	According to a report by Windhorst, Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers, Pacers and Denver Nuggets discussed a trade that would have sent Love to Denver, George to Cleveland and assets including Gary Harris and the draft's 13th pick to Indiana..  &gt;	Cleveland, meanwhile, has been left to ponder a future without Irving. Windhorst broke the news that the four-time All-Star requested a trade July 7 as he seeks to break free from a partnership with James.  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2723814-paul-george-trade-for-kyrie-irving-reportedly-repeatedly-rejected-by-cavaliers.amp.html"
Yes he is.  Paul George is argued as higher by a lot of people on here and I respect it but CP3 is at worst right after.
fully on board the paul george train. dudes awesome.
People also forgot how good Paul George can be as the #1
"The buzz cuts a lot of guys got a few years ago (Westbrook, Giannis, Paul George) were whack. They all look much better now"
"Jermaine O'Neal finished 2nd for MVP voting one year. Is he better than Pippen?  Other players who finished 3rd for MVP include Paul George, Blake Griffin, Penny Hardway, Grant Hill.  It's not exactly some unprecedented peak by Scottie."
"You listed one team out of 14 seasons, and that team was still totally built around him. He has played with KD + Harden, KD, Paul George, Harden, Beal, and now LeBron and AD. What are we talking about?"
1. Curry 2. KD 3. Jokic 4. Giannis 5. Lebron(Playoffs) 6. Harden 7. Embiid 8. Luka 9. Butler 10. Paul George  The difference between any 2 spots is really slim. I think most people would be ok with the general gist of this list.  The top 4 positions this year are particularly interchangeable. I do think the Warriors record has earned Curry the spot for now though.
"The Jazz including Rudy aren’t a good enough perimeter defensive team to win in the playoffs. Rudy, Mitchell, and Conley are all below average/bad perimeter defenders. They got destroyed by Reggie Jackson, Terrence Mann and Paul George. What do you think will happen when they come up against Booker/CP3 and Steph/Klay?"
"I just saw this yesterday. Trae had a great game, and I was about to post how Mavs fans are really rooting for him, and like the third comment down was something like, ""Yeah, but the Luka stans think Trae sucks."" I didn't bother commenting at all. It's just exhausting.   Trae is awesome. Love him. Luka is awesome. He's my guy. Love him. Dame is awesome. Love him. Make Paul George cry, baby. Paul George is awesome. On and on and on.."
"Biggest problem with Russ is that he is a stat sheet stuffer- not a transcendent star who is out there to slay opponents and scrape, claw and scratch for wins. His play just does not translate to a great team environment.  His beat situation was with Paul George in OKc. They could’ve done great things. Their styles perfectly fit together. Lakers are a team of 12 with 4 guys individually each playing their own game. No team vibe. No chemistry."

"He dad dicked us in the playoffs 2 straight years then poochied off to his home planet, seemingly never to be seen or heard from again. Also there were rumors that paul george fucked his girl and he got the yips from it"
"Okay but that’s one player… do you have any stats for all of the other teams and players? One player doesn’t mean anything statistically…   Even if shooting was easier in the bubble, wouldn’t everyone have that advantage, thus negating the advantage in general. Also what happened to the clippers losing to the Nuggets? Kawhi and Paul George were bricking everything in the 4th quarter of game 7. They were shooting abysmally in the second half of games and during crunch time to lose that series. Why didn’t they get this “bubble advantage” to help them close out the series? What about Danny Green missing that game winner on that pass from Lebron? Wide open and in the bubble lol…   It’s just bad reasoning imo"
"jokic, paul george, trae, ja, giannis, curry, kd, booker, blevins are all playing better than him off the top of my head"
Paul George actually wins playoffs series consistently and was the number one option for a contending Pacers and has been named in MVP voting multiple times.   Dames only chance to make the finals he got sweped the KDless warriors. Paul George took Prime Lebron Heatles to 7 games and 6 games in 2 other years.  Its not hard to see the difference between someone who either gets bounced every year in the first round by a lower seeded team. Or gets beaten badly by actual contender in the subsequent rounds. Comapred to Paul George who brought one of the greatest teams ever with Prime LBJ to 7 games. Or last year where he still managed to take the clippers to the WCF and even win 2 games without Kawhi.
Paul George has literally never won anything in the playoffs either. He's not a champ and never will be.
Damian Lillard has a winning percentage of 56% in 700 career games. Paul George has a winning percentage of 43% in 723 career games. How exactly is that a more winning style of basketball?
"the players who won it deserve it, but they're also players like Paul George, Siakam, Butler, McCollum, and Giannis, for most of the last ten years. big names or guys who would go on to become if names. before that, it was Ryan Anderson, Aaron Brooks and the like. DeJounte is definitely doing pretty well, in that context. not when compared to Oladipos breakout season."
"That thunder team wasn't contenders they were the 6th seed. Blazers being the 3rd should have soundly won. Also what clippers team? We have only seen the clippers play 2 playoffs since Kawhi joined, and PG actually won 2 games in the WCF without Kawhi.  Paul George plays more winning basketball then Dame straight up."
Idk he’s a top 5 MVP candidate but doesn’t get talked about like he is.  People want to try and say Paul George is ahead of CP3 in the MVP conversation for example.
I've developed a pavlovian reaction to that song n now I can't hear it without thinkin about Paul George flossing
Hard to compare… it’s a team sport and trae (last year) has had a better team around him than Luka  I also don’t think the hawks get past Paul George and Kawhi
"I've noticed that whenever any player is down on his luck, the haters who are usually quiet come in full force because they have ammo. Remember Paul George, that 4 game curry stretch after Durant left. I don't think LeBron is less popular or anything but his team is having a rough time and he's been in some controversies recently. So his haters are puffin up their chest rn."
Paul George is the only name on the list that actually surprised me.
"Paul George is more of a scorer than the rest of the guys on that list, so Ima go with him."
Paul George
think he leads the league in minutes played. mans been run ragged lately. Also paul george goes through slumps. It's less pronounced this time because the team around him is so good
Paul George is struggling to make shots big-time recently.
Paul George and hibbert took them to 7 but okc has no shot.   Nephews need to stop talking when they didn’t watch ball back then lol 😂😂
&gt; There was real talk that the Pacer's had actually won the Paul George trade with how well Oladipo played in the 2018 season.  I remember that
"The question is not if dame or lillard is  top 75 , the question is why they preserved the first 50 ?No disrespect but I guarantee you some of these players have done less than 3 all NBA appearances and were not the guy on a championship team.   Paul George is another guy that I have  slightly above dame all time and I don't think there ever been 75 players who are better and had a greater career than him."
You could’ve done about 400 more Paul George   My favorite was G-League George lol
"Paul George, but I think everyone dislikes him hahaha"
You really think Jamal Murray is a better play than Paul George lol
"There’s a large number of NBA players who have accredited their improvements to playing alongside Russ.   They directly said seeing his work ethic in practice and his leadership inspired them to become better. This happened with Paul George, Victor Oladipo, and more.   He would also help get their young guys easier looks, teach them more how to win, and all kinds of stuff.   Do you seriously think having vets provide no upside to a locker room or a young players development?"
Team has been multiple time first round exits and they didn’t even win a single damn game in that WCF appearance. Lillard is still yet to win a single conference finals game something Paul George was even able to pull off.
"Maybe doesn't fit exactly, (he isn't a superstar) and there are for sure worse examples, but I don't believe Oladipo gets enough shit for how dirty he did the Pacers.  The Pacers fully embraced Oladipo after the Paul George fiasco and him forcing his way out. Oladipo being an IU alumni, the fans accepted him immediately as if he was an old friend. They were quick to embrace Oladipo's ""This is my city"" phrase after he hit a game winner early in his first season with the team (the best season of his career might I add). Victor gave a hope to Pacers fans in a time where there was little hope to be had after the team that had so much success in the mid 2010's was blown up. There was real talk that the Pacer's had actually won the Paul George trade with how well Oladipo played in the 2018 season.  After battling injuries in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, Oladipo returned to a team that had the other half of the PG trade ascend into an all star caliber player in Sabonis. Pacers fans believed these two players could be the building blocks of the future, only being 28 and 24 years old respectively. What does Oladipo do? He openly asks [""Can I come play with ya'll""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jsxseu/michael_victor_oladipo_asked_the_raptors_heat_and/) in front of his teammates and forces a trade out of Indiana.   In the end, I guess it didn't work out to badly for the Pacers, Oladipo continues to battle injuries and they got Caris LaVert from trading him. It just felt so shitty for Oladipo to turn around and do the exact same thing that led him to being traded to the Pacers.  tl;dr Oladipo was embraced by the Pacers fans and gave them hope in a bad trade situation only to turn around and do the exact same thing."
This season I would have Paul George over lebron.
"[Just wait until you see this George Gervin travel call in an all-star game a couple years prior.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yxQJYkmpL4&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  I think folks underrate or don't realize how much the game has changed from the rules interpretation side.   It was a lot easier to catch an offensive or over-the-back foul back then (as can be seen in the Paul Westphal poster, too). If a defender displaced an offensive player, it was a defensive foul. *However*, if an offensive player even gently displaced a defensive player, it was an offensive foul. Like, [imagine post players getting called for this in today's game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZLKjofu_s&amp;t=132s&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen). Shaq wouldn't have been able to exist as we know him."
"So you’re 12 then?  LeBron, KD, Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Giannis, Harden, Jokic, Embiid, that’s 10 with Kawhi out.  AD, Booker, Beal, CP3, Paul George, Butler, Tatum, Brown, Beal, Mitchell, KAT, Gobert, Zion is out, Irving is out, and that’s the top 25.    If Ball wasn’t a terrible defender with poor scoring efficiency he’d be top 25, but he’s certainly not there now.    Young players improve quickly.  Ant’s D puts him a lot higher than he would be if he was playing defense like last year.  LaMelo needs to figure Defense out and become more efficient."
"Yep. I'll cut Paul George an infinite amount of slack on this one just because:  1. He had the guts to even try that dunk in-game  2. His legs probably weren't fresh  3. It's the first time we ever saw that exact Vince Carter 360 even sort of imitated during live play  But those qualifiers aside, yeah, it's a textbook case of how two people can technically complete the same dunk but one can still be so much better."
"Paul George maybe? He's definitely not far off top 5, and playing consistently amazing."

"Jimmy butler, Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown are not as goid and never will be better than Paul George."
"&gt; Westbrook has not been a guy whose game gets better in the playoffs.  I'm sorry, have we not been calling Paul George variations of Playoff P for the last 4 years specifically for his game getting significantly worse in the playoffs?  Did this man not just blow a 3-1 lead last year?  The main issue I have is that the guy is talking about ""can't blame PG for leaving, just look at how Russ performed in their elimination game"" when the man literally dropped 5 points in an elimination game the year before lol.  It's stupid to act like Russ dragged PG down, meanwhile there's a reason we've been calling him Playoff P for the last 4 years.    They didn't frame it as ""PG left because he didn't see a contender in OKC"", they framed it as ""PG left because Russ choked while he was carrying"".  They both blew it, and so did Melo who didn't get named here at all because if you stub your toe in the morning there's a 90 percent chance that it was Russ' fault.  Acting like had to ditch Russ cause Russ dragged him (and apparently was carried all season by PG) is revisionist history at best and straight up stupid at worst."
"I think everyone's having KD, Curry, and Giannis in their Top 5 (in no particular order). I'd imagine almost everyone would keep LeBron up there, though I've heard some people argue he shouldn't be anymore. I personally think that's crap and have LeBron in my Top 5.  Then I think it starts to get messy. Jokic comes to mind and is probably who most people would put next, including me, but there might be some recency bias there.  Then you have the likes of (in no particular order) Lillard, Harden (he hasn't been having the best year, but it's been &lt; 20 games, let's not take him out of the convesation just yet), Embiid, Kawhi, AD, Paul George, and possibly the young guys (pun intended) like Luka and Trey. I think there's some reasonable argument for all of these guys to make it over Jokic, though it's stronger for some of them than others. Maybe you could add Westbrook to that list, but I'm not going to start on how I feel about him.  I'd probably say someone like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Beal is the best player in the league who **clearly** isn't a Top 5 player. I don't think anyone would put these guys in their Top 5 right now, but they're still playing at an elite level."
"Paul George in OKC. it was obviously beneficial for both parties  Also PG’s in Indiana wasn’t THAT bad compared to others, still wasn’t great. helped that he requested out in the offseason both times.   yeah russ’ wasn’t bad"
This season? probably Paul George
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Lol you know damn well why Paul George was the example, and it wasn’t his 3pt shooting ability."
Westbrook and Paul George win on efficient hate and LeBron wins via hate on volume.
"He was always an ok slasher. Now his handle is a bit tighter and he doesn’t turn it over while driving.  It’s not like JB improved his handle to the point that he’s a primary initiator, or even a Paul George type of guy.   Tatum’s “passing” is mostly just hitting open guys in the perimeter when he’s posting up, which is a pretty natural progression. It’s not like he’s making good passes to the paint or anything."
"i know but if he plays literally two weeks, maybe a month, there's no way we don't have, say, next year's raptors pick at least. he was a question mark BECAUSE he muddied the water in the media and refused to play to prove otherwise. him and his people knew what they were doing, and good for them, it worked. but that doesn't mean I have to like him. indiana got more for a year of paul george knowing he wanted to go to LA too. it just sucks and it's impossible not to be mad about. thank fucking GOD Keldon is the pick we got from the raptors or it'd be absolutely humiliating. lol"
OP really just threw in a confusing Paul George reference just to get attention from the dregs of r/nba
"Trust me, it’s not even worth reasoning with them on this. Paul George is currently the designated public enemy of r/NBA, just like how Russ and Harden were not too ago. I swear there’s some kinda hysteria or derangement syndrome here, people are literal foaming at the mouth when PG makes the mildest comment."
"OKC accepted to trade Paul George after Shai was included. OKC again traded or let everyone go, except Shai. Again this guy has shown serious flashes, even in Clippers uniform. Now it's his time. This was obvious for everyone who followed the guy since the beginning of his career."
"Lol dude I don’t care about the clipper pls stop looking at my flair and making assumptions lol. Just from being on this sub you can tell most people dislike bev from the whole 5 years is mine thing and being a dirty player, people here love Luka and dislike Morris for stepping on his ankle in the playoffs wether it was intentional or not. And people clown PG for the whole dame thing(dame who gets jerked off here) This sub is an echo chamber, he probably gets more hate here than most places because people are trying to meme and get Karma, it’s just a fact.   I’m commenting because it’s a Friday night and I’m drunk after hanging with my friends so I probably aren’t articulating things as well as possible, but like don’t pretend that Paul George isn’t constantly giving the media a lot of stuff to run with compared to the average player.   Again, this didn’t about this quote specifically"
"KD hate has dwindled due to his injury and move to brooklyn.   Kyrie hate fluctuates and the hate is mainly from his off court antics. When he has a big game the hate is stops for a while.   Harden hate is at an all time high now because of the terms he left houston on.  Otherwise players who seem to get the highest volume of hate are Paul george, westbrook, morris twins, Pat bev and lebron (as usual)"
"I can see it now:  Top comment: “This is what I don’t get, WHY DOES PG KEEP TALKING TO THE MEDIA? You’re just asking to be clowned! Here’s another few sentences basically saying that.   Also I think he should let his game do the talking. Why is he saying stuff like this unprompted?  You know what the greats don’t do? Talk to the media.  I’m thinking about writing a musical about Paul George not being good.”"
KD has seemed to become more likeable lately to the masses. I would swap him out for Paul George. People really hate Paul George
Paul George
i’m so sorry to break this to you but paul george not his pr team give a shit what you or the trolls on here think. he’s a superstar nba player and he’s in headlines weekly. he and his pr team are just doing fine.
"Rumor was Portland offered Indiana a better package for Paul George than OKC: however, Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard left in bad terms and refused to trade him to Portland. His own daughter tweeted something like, ""No way dad will trade him to Portland.""  Sometimes GMs and owners do stupid things out of spite."
Everybody is acting like peoples complaints about Paul George were during the regular season. No one ever said he was bad then. He shits out and sucks terribly both in the playoffs and most especially in clutch moments. He is an amazing regular season player that you better hope you have enough of a support system to cover for in the playoffs.
bro why tf would paul george ever have any self motivating thoughts or even dare to say them out loud smh this guy should just shut up forever or hire trump’s pr team itll be better than what hes doing right now smh cant wait to pull this out for any future loss game
"if you like basketball, you like paul george this season."
Just a reminder that the last time Paul George played in conference finals was in 2014. 2014...That's back when Iggy Azalea was relevant.
"Just smarter shot selection but also super small sample size. Honestly, the person probably shooting the best right now is Paul George. He is 51% on 99 attempts. He has the second most made threes on over 50%. Pretty nuts."
i promise nba fans do not like basketball bc Paul george is having a fire arc this year
What's the real idea or object Paul George was referring to with the metaphor of vengeance?
Incoming people shitting on Paul George for being motivated
He literally finished in 3rd in both MVP and DPOY voting 2 seasons ago and got back with his MVP trainer. Clippers also have improved as an offensive unit. The are #1 in 3 point percentage and Paul George has assisted in that with his ball movement. He's a Top 3 candidate right now.
Dude Paul George in on 🔥🔥🔥
"Well it wouldn’t have happened because the thunder wanted sga in the trade for Paul George. But in a hypothetical scenario, that trio would work really well."
Paul george is a flamethrower this season
Paul George.
Better than Paul George tbh.
"I really hate how much people go after players when they end up acting the way Harden did. He went to the team privately first and asked to be traded, just like Jimmy Butler in Minny and AD in NOLA before him. Once the team said no, we're willing to get uncomfortable if it means not trading you, then you can't be upset if the player then resorts to antics to increase the pressure on the team to move them.   Paul George went to the Thunder and asked to be traded to the Clippers, and rather than throwing a fit over it, the Thunder just traded him for a huge haul, so no antics were ever necessary. But that doesn't mean Paul George tried anything that Harden, Butler and AD didn't, he just had his request acquiesced to right away without the team deciding to go to war with him first.  The reality is that if your star player wants out, they're gonna get out. If they come ask for a trade and you just ignore him, then all you're doing is delaying the inevitable, probably worsening the return you'll get for him, and creating an unnecessary shit show in the meantime. Better to just accept the reality and deal with it than trying to pretend like this situation doesn't exist."
"Yeah basically? I mean I don’t get why we would shit on just harden then. You know how many guys haven’t honored their contracts now? Anthony Davis, kawhi, Paul George, etc. PG is the only one who gets shit for it."
"Middleton yeah, unless you're really high on some lower end contender.  I guess it' snot impossible that Middleton is a better player than Paul George at the end of the year, but then the Clippers wouldn't be a championship team so it's irrelevant"
Middleton is better than Paul George tbh
"&gt;The Rockets being a hamstring away is, because the possibility of it going a different way exists. The possibility of the Cavaliers winning that game in regulation ceases to exist when JR’s mistake is factored in.  “If Chris Paul had a healthy hamstring the rockets win the series” is the narrative OP is trying to dispel. The reason why saying JR’s blunder cost them the game when there was no clear shot available (LeBron was 40+ feet out at the time) doesn’t make sense is because it wasn’t the worst outcome available. Losing in regulation via turnover or bricked early shot is still very possible. Him running the clock out was dumb, but in terms of actual consequences, it was inconsequential. George Hill missing that free throw cost them the game more than JR did."
"Lol no, it was the exact opposite. No one on this sub shit on Kawhi until he signed with LA and the Clippers Paul George trade."
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
Who needs stats when I can just ask Paul George about shot quality.
"That's wild. Knew the owner was shitty but that's nasty 💩   I think people don't like Harden because of his do or die playoff games. He completely checks out. I'm a raps fan, a bunch of years with stars disappearing due to being smothered but I would hate to be a Rockets fan if my superstar *willingly* disappeared.  His trainer is gone? He's a superstar, he can hire them himself, not a valid excuse. Harden had Dwight, CP3, &amp; Westbrook. They all arrive *and* are all gone because of Harden. The team was constantly rebuilt around him, to his wishes. Him saying he gave his all doesn't pass the eye test. Playoffs is where it matters, just ask Paul George."
remember when he single handedly ended a franchise legacy in the playoffs with the most unnecessary buzzer beater over all NBA and MVP candidate Paul George
"&gt;The nba is more about off court antics than the game itself, because the product has become more trash every season for the past 5 years  If that's the part you decide to focus on, then yeah probably. Paul George demanded to be traded twice in his 10 years career. Not 'every' off season. And he spent 6 years with the team that drafted him.  It's easy to prove a point by using hyperbole to the extreme, I'll give you that."
"It wouldnt, people are naturally frontrunners.   Same if the clippers win, everyone would love Paul george , except Lakers and Pacers fans"
"Wonder what LBJ's reaction would be the day RDC posts a video that puts LeBron on the receiving end of someone, haha. I can't imagine it's nice for someone like his teammates, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, etc. to watch this."
I feel like we're like 2 or 3 games away from a big Paul George 3pt shooting post that'll get a lot of attention if he keeps it up.
Paul George with 51.6% on over 8 3's a game is absurd.
He basically already is Paul George level and is 22. This is an insane argument
"No thanks, at least Paul George shows up to work. PG would be a perfect third guy for that team though."
the pause after adressing Paul George was comedic perfection
"That was my introduction to his videos and I ended up watching so many times.   Paul George... Paul George listen to me when I say, you trash."
"Lots of MIP winenrs are good defenders  Giannis, Siakam, Vic, Jimmy Butler, Paul George"
"You're just making things up.  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers reportedly were in talks to trade Kyrie Irving to the Phoenix Suns in a three-team deal in June, according to Jackie MacMullan of ESPN:  &gt;""In mid-June, shortly before [former general manager David] Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson.""  &gt;**That trade came a month before Irving requested one out of Cleveland**  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2752210-report-kyrie-irving-trade-for-paul-george-eric-bledsoe-was-explored-by-cavs  The whole reason Kyrie requested a trade in the first place is because he was included in trade talks."
"And not only that, but the team Kawhi screwed over was good enough to give Golden State the business the season prior. We’re talking maybe one more piece away, and that piece wouldn’t have had to be mortgaging our future on Paul George. Kawhi was a straight snake in the grass."
"Vic did things for this town that Paul George never quite could.  I'm a little freaked to still be seeing ""V. Oladipo"" in the box score - DAMMIT I'M TRYING TO PROCESS THIS"
Hes on the Clippers. And I'm not  Paul George hater but he probably won't keep it up.
"I respect that rationale. Although there are some caveats to the accolades, namely the All-NBA appearances. At the forward position you could argue that Kawhi had to compete with a wider base of outstanding players at the forward position: LeBron, Durant, Davis, George, Griffin, Anthony, Aldridge, Love, Green, Butler, and Giannis. While Westbrook primarily competed with the same base of Lillard, Curry, Paul, and Harden with occasional sprinklings of players like DeRozan, Irving, and Thomas, and Walker."
"We were able to swing the Kawhi trade by trading two lottery picks on our team and having extra picks to move.  Trades like the Kawhi deal aren’t happening anymore either, look what was traded for Paul George and James Harden."
All the homies hate Paul George aka Pandemic P
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
How do u forget paul george? He was worse an all of them. Re-signed a new deal . Told WB hes staying and literally next year forces out with a trade
That's because KD and Paul George haven't built the reputation that Dame has. Dame is the most loyal and level-headed superstar in the league so he can get away with stuff like this. KD and PG have done too much dumb stuff to get away with something like this.
Didn’t Paul George make a 5 part mini series about staying in OKC?
I guess it depends how stringent you are with the term superstar. Personally I wouldn’t call Paul George a superstar which would take care of two of your examples.   But the Rockets definitely followed the format to try and create a superteam around Harden a few times. At worst I’d consider those to be failed superteams or alternatively you could say they were superteams that weren’t as good as the superteam that ended up winning the west that season.
"Totally disagree on both counts. I wasn’t for trading for harden but I get why outsiders think it’s a good move. Trading for one year of kawhi would’ve have been a terrible idea, just as trading for one year of Paul George or jimmy butler.   The thing that everyone seems to forget with kawhi is that the raptors were lucky that KD and Klay were hurt. No team in the nba was beating the warriors fully healthy. So yeah it worked out for Toronto but that doesn’t mean that it would’ve been a good move for the Celtics. If the warriors are healthy you lose, kawhi leaves the following season and then what?"
"That can be said for most player breakups. I can literally say the same exact thing about paul george, kawhi, Russ, lebron, etc. The situation is naturally messy"
No.  Good teams don't trade their best players just because they had a bad playoff run.  It would take an entire season of Paul George sucking ass for them to consider trading him.  (Or more likely Paul George forces his way out.)
25 for 42 is super impressive. But Paul George with 47 for 91 is almost more impressive
Soooo we not talking about George Paul anymore?.........
Everyone knows Paul George can be fire during the regular season. This shit ain’t groundbreaking.  It’s always the same with him. He needs to perform come playoff time to back it up.
"I agree they played better, but I don’t agree with your assessment. Like, if you remove PG and lebron from that series, the heat are still the more stacked team. It’d be a tough series but the heat still have the two best players in the series(though I guess it depends how high you were on hibbert) And you removed the first or second best player of all time in their athletic prime from one team and Paul George to the other.   Even disregarding that, it’s pretty dumb to discount a player because their team was winning by exploiting a mismatch. Like jamaal Murray was the most important factor of the nuggets beating the jazz in the bubble. Don’t think that should reflect poorly on jokic though."
Nobody gives a fuck what Paul George does until he does it in the playoffs. If you actually give a fuck you're probably a Clipper fan or casual fan
[Paul George has been playing great this season](https://i.imgur.com/RUdPyQPh.jpg)
No one is judging Paul George based on his regular season performances. He can put up 35/10/10 on 50/40/90 in the regular season for all I care and it wouldn't change my opinion of him until he does it in the playoffs.
&gt; Russ never made any teammate better   Paul George
"I like Damian Lillard obviously, but this is kinda petty. Imagine how people would perceive someone like KD or Paul George in a situation like this."
Paul George is streaky. Full stop.
Paul George. Paul George listen to me.. you are trash 😂😂
"Paul George and looking like an MVP candidate for 1/2 a season, name a more iconic duo"
"Were you following your team back in 2011? Remember the guy your team embarrassed? The guy who went from being the possible best player in the world to averaging 17 and even Jason freaking Terry stopping him from getting easy ones close to the basket because he had no post game?  Yeah, that guy had his 3rd MVP in the year just after.  Nobody cares about playoff performance for a regular season award. I have absolutely no idea where that myth started. The evidence on the matter is *exactly* opposite.  What matters is seeding and the competition. For example if LA keep beating everything and Lebron ends up clearly better than AD during the run (a real possibility), Lebron wins it hands down. If however a Paul George led Clippers surpass his team, then PG is the favorite. Maybe KD does historic carry job and despite the dysfunction within the team they end up first overall. Then KD gets it.  If however in any of the 3 (above) examples those players let their team reach the 1st seed (or even 1st overall) by comitee (say AD/Kawhi/Harden have a massive impact as well) then there is no MVP for either of them.  You need an extremely high seed (top 2 preferably) *and* leading your team in a clear manner (say all adv stats have you as the clearly better player ... all of them). There is literally no other consideration (apart from the one, Westbrook MVP that is, which was supremely weird).  So yeah, Giannis has no chance (for the time being) because his team is neither 1st seed (or -preferably- 1st overall) nor is he the clear best guy in his team. Khris Middleton is right there with him. So no chance for him, nothing to do w playoffs though. If he mounts a similar season to last and suddenly have the Bucks as the clear 1st overall team you bet you a$$ that he gets it for the 3rd time in a row.  I don't believe the above (to be) probable, but yeah it is *not* because of his playoff woes (perceived or otherwise)."
I see him as Paul George potential not top 5
"Bron, AD, Schroeder...... CP3, Booker, Ayton..... Giannis, Jrue. Kris. ..... Paul George,  Kawahi, Lou Will.....Gobert, Mitchell,  Conley.... &gt; Celtics"
"Yes he is. Yall refuse to let players who were good in the early 2010s go. Theres plenty younger guys better than Paul George now. Brown, Ingram and Tatum. Take off your nostalgia goggles."
He is not better than Paul George lmao.
"Paul George is a mvp candidate right now, and brown is better than him? So much better than Simmons? lol"
Jaylen Brown is so much better its not funny .          Ben Simmons is a defensive specialist.           Brown is a budding superstar two way player who is already better than Paul George
Paul George
"&gt;Except Kyrie himself stated that's why he wanted out when he wanted to trade him for Paul George  Show me a clip or an article of Kyrie saying that himself.   What Kyrie himself did say is that he was thinking about a trade long before the PG/Kyrie talks, which were had by Griffin (not LeBron), and in which the Cavs rejected the trade.  &gt;As for you don't get to choose your teams lol Lbron been choosing his teammates since 2010 so I don't know what you're on about there.  Yes, you can choose what team you play on when your contract is done. That's what free agency is. If you're already on a contract, you don't get to choose who you play with. This is true of 99% of the players in the league. There are some exceptions, but the vast vast majority of players are in this predicament. This isn't unique at all.  &gt;Yes, he was the franchise player at the time who managed to get guys like Hayward and ariza on board to play with him until they ruined it for him.  Yeah they ruined it for him by getting him someone much much better, a consensus top3 player to ever play basketball, and having him play on a literal NBA Championship team.   Should they have not ruined it for him, proceeding to win nothing instead of what they did? What even is this lol  Just answer me this - What should the Cavs or LeBron have done in this situation, in your opinion?"
The Paul George trade was 1-2 years before that when the Cavs were still one of the 2 or 3 best teams in the league. Well before Kyrie requested a trade
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
"Except Kyrie himself stated that's why he wanted out when he wanted to trade him for Paul George, and of course he wanted to keep him after the trade failed but it was already too late. As for you don't get to choose your teams lol Lbron been choosing his teammates since 2010 so I don't know what you're on about there. Yes, he was the franchise player at the time who managed to get guys like Hayward and ariza on board to play with him until they ruined it for him."

&gt;Paul George was the best player on a team that took the heatles to 7.  They didn't take us to 7 because of PG's play. They took us to 7 because Hibbert and West were massive mismatches for Bosh/Birdman/Battier/Haslem
"""Paul George... Paul George listen to me when I say this... you... are traaaaaash."""
52% from 3? Paul George setting us up once again lol
"In my ideal Basketball HOF, Lowry would just miss the cut.  He's a 6x Eastern All Star (probably would only have 2-4 if he played in the West against Steph, Lillard, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Kobe, Luka, Tony Parker, Paul George for the AS guard slot), 1x All NBA and 1 title as a #2/3 option. He had a short but semi successful college career and one gold medal, but it's team USA so how impressive is that really. He's a solid player and any team would be lucky to have him, but he isn't a transcendent talent like Duncan, Dirk, Nash, Kobe, Chris Paul etc...  At his peak he still wasn't a top 5 player in his position. Steph, Lillard, Westbrook and Chris Paul were all clearly better than Peak Lowry (2015-2018) and then guys like Kyrie Irving, John Wall, 2017 Isaiah Thomas, James Harden (if you count his 2015-18 stint as a PG) are all in the same tier.  I think to make the HOF you should be absolutely irreplaceable and left a distinct mark in NBA history, and obviously this is just my interpretation, which means nothing. But Lowry as great as he was/is was replaceable."
Eh Paul George was the best player on a team that took the heatles to 7. I think for kyrie not reaching the conference finals in Boston while they were able to do that every other year without him carries an equal amount of weight when looking at the whole career to pg’s playoff failures.   Tl:dr I’m firmly in the “I don’t fucking know” camp
"Lol at you   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why  In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson. No formal offer was made by any of the teams, but news of this potential transaction stung Irving, who, sources close to him say, became convinced that LeBron's camp, which also represents Bledsoe, orchestrated the trade talks.      Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade. But once Griffin was no longer employed by the team, the conversations stalled. Cleveland then engaged in talks with Indiana and Denver, according to league sources."
"""kawhi leonard ..... you trash. paul george ..... you trash"""
"Extra devil's advocate, even when he played with LeBron he had some pretty poor performances that just got swept under the rug because of LeBron.   [From someone else's old comment:](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mido6/the_hill_that_you_are_willing_to_die_on/dzo3ptk/)  &gt; I wouldn't ""die on"" the hill for the argument I'm about to make but I think the narrative of Kyrie as some ""clutch playoff assassin"" is overblown and highlights how he just got to benefit greatly from playing next to LeBron. Nobody noticed when he played poorly in the playoffs they just blamed LeBron &gt;  &gt; A) Kyrie shoots 38% from the field the first two games of each of the past two nba finals games they lost averaging about 21/4? Everybody just blamed LeBron. And teams who fall down 2-0 lose series about 93% of the time it does matter despite that 2016 miracle comeback &gt;  &gt; B) Kyrie shoots 39% from the field the first two rounds of the playoffs last year? Nobody notices because LeBron makes sure it doesn't matter &gt;  &gt; C) Kyrie shoots 35% from the field averaging 18 ppg the first 4 games of the 2015 series vs Chicago? LeBron hits a buzzer beater to prevent them from going down 3-1 and bails everybody out &gt;  &gt; D) Kyrie is only a 28% shooter in playoff crunchtime situations. Amongst stars this is a bottom level figure. But nobody remembers they only remember that one massive shot he hit and whenever the Cavs lost close games LeBron got all the scrutiny &gt;  &gt; E) in the 2nd half of game 6 of the 2016 finals kyrie was god awful. 1/7 for 3 points. The Warriors had cut a 24 lead to 8 and in that span this cavs had a whopping 14 points over 12 minutes. The Cavs were BEGGING to give that game away and have a clippers game 6 2015 type collapse &gt;  &gt; But of course LeBron bails everybody out goes King Kong mode that 2nd half and kyrie gets let off the hook again &gt;  &gt; Kyrie has been far from a bad playoff performer but this narrative of him as some playoff assassin is overdone  Kyrie hasn't just struggled as a #1 on his own. He also struggled at times playing next to LeBron. When other stars have performances like those they often lose and the player gets labelled a choker.   Paul George has never really had that safety net."
Nope. There were trade talks for Paul George but PG would only agree to stay if Lebron agreed to an extension and Lebron refused.
"When I first got into the nba, my parents wouldn’t let me stay up late enough to watch the western conference games so what made me fall in love with the association was the eastern conference circa 2009-2012  Celtics: Loved Watching Rondo facilitate to Kg, Paul, and Ray Bulls: D Rose was an exciting of a player as I’ve ever seen, plus I loved the way Joakim Noah played  Magic: Prime Dwight Howard killing shit with Hedo, Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ryan Anderson Heat: LeBron, Wade, Bosh were on another level Pacers: Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, Lance  Sixers: Young Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala  Knicks: Melo and Amari    Even liked watching the not so good teams like the Cavs with Young Kyrie or the Wizards with young John Wall"
There were rumors that the Cavs were going to get Paul George and Eric Bledsoe for Kyrie and Kevin Love. 2017 offseason
Only thing that makes this team even more hated is if Paul George somehow ends up on the Nets. There would be a never ending string of reddit posts about how the Nets are pure evil.
We talking LeBron James MVP awards or Paul George MVP awards?
Someone on here really tried to tell me that Gobert is better than Paul George smh my head
Yep. Paul George has been quiet lately and his 3pt % is regressing to norm. Kawhi is locked in. He’s banging on people
"They aren't lol. Kawhi leads PG in every stat besides defensive rebounds, is a better defender, and averages *less than half as many turnovers*. The only thing Paul George has over Kawhi is his flukeishly hot shooting start."
The paul george regression was inevitable. Good thing Kawhi is able to play like God mode during this time
Man the narrative that Paul George is the new top guy on the Clippers died quick lol
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"Idk man. Anymore it seems like superstars can decide when and where they want to play regardless of their contract. Not saying I think giannis is going to pull a Paul george, but he def ain't stuck in Milwaukee"
Paul George and apparently the dummy that you were replying to don’t seem to understand that concept. A bad shot for you isn’t a bad shot for Dame.
"People are acting like he is 36 years old already. There are a bunch of guys who are high level players until age 34, and a lot of teams are banking on guys continuing to do that. I can tell you this, I’d rather be paying Hayward $31 mill at age 33 than paying Paul George $45 mill (or for that matter Kemba $38 mill at age 32). I think it was a more “LOL Hornets and MJ are DUMB” than it was any actual critical thinking on the general reaction.   The money on the NBA right now is just ridiculous"
Paul George really?
"yeah idk why people shit on Luka. Dude’s too classy for that shit. For Trae, Paul George and other stars I’d understand but c’mon Luka really!?"
Paul George hedge fund going broke
"I’m just saying that this idea that having picks gaurentees success isn’t that true, the picks you guys have belong to really good teams so there’s no gaurentee you get a superstar like your making it out to be. Also let’s look at your player history, KD, Harden, Westbrook, Ibaka, Sabonis, Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, lu Dort (baby 🐐) I don’t think your team or many other teams are ever gonna top having that much talent in a decade, I just realistically don’t think you having a shit ton of Clippers, Rockets picks is as big as a deal as you think it is. You guys had The Who’s who’s of 2010 all stars I don’t think your getting any better than that"
"I should clarify. Oubre, with what ive seen so far, would be one of the 2 primary defenders on Lebron, Kawhi, Paul George, Giannis etc. I dont see any of the names you mentioned able to play well against those guys."
Paul George: That’s still a bad shot.
Paul George somewhere visibly shaking
That was a bad shot -Paul George 🤡
"""Thats a bad shot"" ~Paul George"
Paul George getting ptsd
"Paul George could cure cancer, end racism, and save a baby from a burning building and people will still ask if he can do it in the playoffs"
It was and I dont care what anyone says - Paul George probably
Paul George is a number one option for most teams lol. Tf are you on?
Paul George. Very good but not the number one option for a team
OKC got 5 first round picks and Gallinari for Paul George so...start the bidding there
Probably a borderline all star or discount Paul George with a worse mid range game
"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player *at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
A lot of the guys at the top haven't played much. The only high volume ones are Paul George and Joe Harris
"ah yes, joe ingles was the one giving paul george trouble that series. not, you know, a certain 7 foot frenchman. he had one awful shooting night and you assume ingles had anything to do with it lmao. he averaged 28 points on 45/41/88 splits the first 5 games, joe sure did a great job there!"
"1. Google the word ""rumor.""  2. By definition, concerns about team chemistry won't be resolved in 10 regular season games. That's like saying ""Paul George is playing great right now, therefore he won't choke in the playoffs."""
Paul George put up 25/6/3 on 41/37/86 against Joe Ingles in the playoffs
They remind me of the Clippers before they got Paul George and Leonard
Yeah I was all in on Dame Lillard +2400 preseason when he initially opened up I took it. Got Embiid like +2800 but didnt lay as much. Put a small amount on Paul George +9500 when that's initially what he was.   I agree the odds all kind of suck right now. If I were to do one I might do Kawhi+4000. If he's not gonna load manage I think that's a solid bet given the price. Other one is Harden +5000. Obviously there a million reasons why he wont win there's a reason he's that low but if it's a weak year and he ends up taking over and establishing himself as the top dog I could see it at +5000. Some will punish him for the superteam thing but if Irving/Durant also miss more and more time that's another factor.   I dont think Jokic right now is that far off. +700 is too high but if he has a bad week and drops to like +900 I might put a few on it.
"Yes, after joining GS his shooting %s jumped 12% in the playoffs, before joining the best team in NBA history he was basically another Paul George type player, probably not as good, despite having a loaded OKC squad which was a great team &amp; many players would've won at least 1 ring with."
Presti turning a mediocre team with Westbrook and Paul George into a treasure trove of assets was pretty incredible
"Its so bold to predict the downfall of the clippers. Its not like 70% of this sub makes “haha playoff p” jokes to make fun of how paul george disappears in the playoff, and how there’s always that one lakers fans who comments doesn’t matter wait until the playoff under any post that remotely praises the clippers. But please go off about how a very good Jazz team upsetting the clippers would be soo wild. /s   PS. in all seriousness I know what you mean since the clippers seem better on paper then the jazz"
"Go back and watch the games.  Seasons come down to 'very few possessions'.   Lebron did it consistantly for a few years.  4th quarter he would clamp up whoever was hot for the other team.  It started that year with d.rose.  It went on to paul george, joe johnson, tony parker, etc during the heatles run.   The trapping defense was effective early on in games but when it slowed down in the 4th lebron put the clamps on  people.   Lebron took it personal and he reminded everybody who the real mvp was."
"I think the talent pool of the center position was really poor. I remember watching the Inside the NBA guys make all decade teams for the 2010’s. At the guard you have Kobe and d wade on the back end of their career, but then you have 3 players who arguably are top 5 easily top 10 at their position ever in CP3, Harden, and Curry. You have Lebron, Durant, Kawhi, and Paul George at the forward which is another group with 2-3 players who will go down as some of the greatest to ever do it. There’s plenty of players I’m leaving out of those positions as-well, but the center position seems vacant when trying to fill it. I mean is Dwight the best option? The last end of dirks career ? It’s most realistically someone like Anthony Davis who doesn’t even like being considered a center, you have all these young talents at the big when for the last decade it’s been a weak position. Marc Gasol and Cousins are probably the best centers besides AD in my personal opinion for the 2010’s and that’s just so weak compared to the guards and forwards."

Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
Nba and clowning on/giving nicknames to Paul George
I didn’t say anything about Paul George. Tell me who’s guarding the 2x finals MVP who is one of the most unstoppable isolation players in the league
You must not have seen Jingles teach his son Paul George how to play the basketball
Joe Ingles vs. Paul George
"Paul George dragged the Pacers to the playoffs (and 45 wins) with rookie Myles Turner and George Hill as his next best players, while coming off of one of the most Gruesome injures by an NBA player and still only made third team All-NBA."
Love me some Paul George slams
"To be honest,  The Lakers are the only team the really worries me.  The Jazz have the clippers number and Joe Ingles is very good at taking Paul George out of the game."
Paul George after an interview
Paul George literally signed up for this
Demar &gt; Paul George
Anyone else think that Royce O'Neale looks like Paul George drawn with a crayon?
"honestly i agree. i used to dunk on fools at my local gym and pretend i was paul george... watching nba just isnt the same anymore man. the gym was the best place to talk about basketball, too!"
Paul George with the empathetic slam understands your pain.
Paul George honestly
So did his wife when Paul George got in her
I like it when Paul George dunks the basketball
Lol Paul George and Kawhi letting loose some pent up rage today
"Well there’s a lot of weight in DRose leading a team ravaged with injury to a 62 win season which was better than the big 3 Heat. Even then, D12 came in second so the argument should be it was Dwight’s to win.   I have no problem admitting he was in contention, but when people start going he should have won, that’s a little much. No one is saying Paul George has a claim to the 2019 MVP(well no one except him)"
Yeah Paul George would be a good return
"For what it's worth, [bbref's MVP tracker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html) (which tries to predict who voters will pick, not who deserves it) has Jokic as a heavy favorite for MVP so far.  |Rk|Player|Tm|W|L|W/L%|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS||Prob%| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Nikola Jokic|DEN|11|7|.611|18|18|35.5|9.7|17.1|.567|1.1|3.2|.328|8.6|13.8|.622|.598|4.8|5.7|.843|3.3|8.5|11.8|8.9|1.8|0.6|4.0|3.1|25.2||47.7%| |2|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|14|5|.737|15|15|34.5|9.5|18.9|.505|2.1|4.9|.419|7.5|13.9|.536|.560|4.8|5.3|.900|1.0|4.4|5.4|5.7|2.0|0.7|1.8|1.7|25.9||13.1%| |3|Joel Embiid|PHI|13|6|.684|15|15|32.0|8.7|16.0|.546|1.2|3.0|.400|7.5|13.0|.579|.583|9.1|10.9|.834|1.8|9.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.4|3.3|2.4|27.7||12.4%| |4|LeBron James|LAL|14|6|.700|20|20|33.1|9.3|18.8|.496|2.8|6.6|.417|6.6|12.2|.539|.569|4.1|5.8|.713|0.7|7.1|7.8|7.5|0.9|0.4|3.6|1.5|25.5||6.9%| |5|Kevin Durant|BRK|12|8|.600|15|15|36.7|10.3|20.0|.517|2.9|6.6|.444|7.4|13.4|.552|.590|6.9|8.1|.860|0.5|7.0|7.5|5.5|0.7|1.5|3.3|2.1|30.5||5.4%| |6|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|11|6|.647|16|16|32.6|9.8|17.9|.547|1.3|4.4|.296|8.5|13.5|.630|.584|5.9|10.1|.584|1.7|9.3|11.0|5.6|1.1|1.1|4.0|3.4|26.8||3.8%| |7|Anthony Davis|LAL|14|6|.700|17|17|32.8|8.5|16.2|.522|0.9|2.7|.326|7.6|13.5|.561|.549|4.1|5.7|.711|1.8|7.0|8.8|3.5|1.3|1.9|1.8|1.8|21.9||3.2%| |8|Rudy Gobert|UTA|14|4|.778|18|18|30.4|5.4|8.9|.602|0.0|0.0||5.4|8.9|.602|.602|2.6|5.1|.511|3.8|10.4|14.2|1.4|0.6|2.8|1.4|1.9|13.4||2.6%| |9|Paul George|LAC|14|5|.737|16|16|34.3|7.9|15.8|.504|3.8|7.8|.484|4.2|8.0|.523|.623|4.3|4.7|.907|0.5|5.7|6.2|5.4|1.2|0.5|4.0|2.1|23.9||2.5%| |10|Khris Middleton|MIL|11|6|.647|17|17|33.0|8.2|15.8|.519|2.6|6.0|.441|5.5|9.8|.566|.603|2.9|3.1|.925|1.0|5.5|6.5|5.8|1.0|0.2|2.2|2.7|21.9||2.4%|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#players) Generated 1/29/2021."
1st Team:   Stephen Curry Luka Doncic  Lebron James Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  2nd Team:   Damian Lillard Bradley Beal Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetekounmpo Nikola Jokic  3rd Team:   Kyrie Irving Jaylen Brown Paul George  Anthony Davis Andre Drummond
"I think you could throw  Jokic, LeBron, Embiid, Durant, Davis and even Paul George in a hat and not be wrong with who you chose for three guys.   Saying otherwise is because you are considering past performance or only one side of the ball."
Cannot believe u just said rudy gobert is better than Paul George.. and I dont even like Paul George
"&gt; With all due respect to the Jazz they don’t have a top 5 or even a top 10 player that can get you a bucket of efficiently or get a stop when needed in the clutch.  With all due respect, we came closer to beating the Nuggets than the Clippers did.  Also, a worse version of this team has already taken out Paul George in the postseason, and helped build the choker reputation he still has today."
I have Kawhi and Paul George while my opponent has KD. The fantasy gods are smiling down on me today.
"David Locke told this story. HE said after game 2 in that series that he talked to people in the Utah organization and this is what they said. ""The key to the series from here will be what OKC does with Melo. If they dont play him, we're gonna push them but they just have alot of talent we might come up a bit short in the end. But if they keep playing and starting him, we feel like we are in the drivers seat and should come out ahead"". You cant stress it enough [OKC with Paul George+ Russ and no Melo won the min vs Utah big time](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612760&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=201566,2546,202331) those two with Melo got destroyed.   Melo hurt them all year. And it ended up leading to their downfall vs Utah everything said in that ended up being an accurate omen. The one area he could've helped is leading 2nd units the rare times Donovan put Melo by himself without PG/RW on 2nd units the lineups worked. But he got away from it after the early part in the season."
&gt; But I do think Royce is a better overall defensive player than Paul George  Equally crazy
"I'm not saying he's a better overall player than either one. That would be silly. &amp; he's obviously not as good on D as Kawhi ""former DPOY"" Leonard.  But I do think Royce is a better overall defensive player than Paul George, and I think he's been as good--or better--of a ""3 &amp; D"" type wing defensive specialist than any player this season. (which PG is not) Lou Dort is the only guy I've seen that's been as good as Royce."
"I was never comparing Royce O'Neale, only taking your statement of Paul George playing exceptionally well as some indication of why the Clippers are better than Utah."
"I mean the Kuzma comment was obviously hyperbole.  But in all seriousness, you've got some gaps in your knowledge base if you think Paul George is better for a team than Rudy Gobert.   I don't mean that as disrespect in any way, I just think maybe you haven't sat down &amp; actually watched Gobert enough to see how impactful he is, or something.   Fact is, the Utah Jazz are a team literally built around Rudy Gobert, and they're one of the best teams in the NBA.   Paul George has never been the centerpiece of a team that had the success Utah has had w/Gobert. &amp; at the end of the day, there isn't a GM in basketball that wouldn't take Gobert over PG13 to build a team around."
"Paul George also always starts seasons white hot and then falls off over the course of the year, I'm not sold on him maintaining that level of play through the playoffs."
"I'm a Jazz fan and I've watched a majority of the minutes Royce has played in the NBA.  Even if he does, which he won't, he's still the 3rd most-accomplished perimeter defender in this conversation at best.   Paul George and Kawhi Leonard are very good at basketball."
If Paul George can be an MVP I think AD will eventually get his
"These are very bad takes.   Royce is not a particularly good defender, certainly not the best in the league or this conversation.  He just looks good because he's the only good wing defender on a not very good perimeter defense.  You may have also noticed Paul George is shooting like 50% from 3 this season on a very high volume.   He may not exactly strike fear in the hearts of his enemies, but he's still pretty goddamn good at playing basketball."
"For the last time. We are talking about the 7 game series. What the players did outside of that is entirely irrelevant to this series. Paul George could've dropped 100+ each game before this and it still wouldn't matter. These +/- are being calculated PER SERIES. Jesus man, atleast try here."
"The past few years have really shined a light on him and highlighted why he is as important to our city and state as he is.   Him sticking through the thick and thin is one of those things you take for granted growing up just because it wasn't until Paul George that a lot of us learned what the alternative is first-hand. (Discounting Granger leaving cause that was a much more mutual, slow falling out)"
"Most likely to be named all stars in the West:  LeBron James  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard   That leaves 2 spots. But there's heavy competition for those with guys like Morant, Booker, SGA, McCollum, Anthony Davis, Fox (just to name a few)"
"Coming from Barkley is odd since he called out Paul George(?) for saying he was feeling depressed in the bubble, saying he's rich and has all that stuff around him to keep him occupied."
"&gt; while Lavine is a bit more efficient   ""a bit"" lol...lavine's true shooting % is 7% higher. Only SG's who have more assists per game than Lavine is Harden, Paul George, VanVleet. He is the better defender and the Bulls have had the 10th hardest Stength of Schedule so far, while the Hawks have the 21st. Trae is a special talent and will be great for many years, but that doesn't mean he's having a better yr than Zach, Sexton, or Brogdon right now"
"We have advantages in the backcourt, bigs, and bench. There are too many pick and roll ball handlers on the Jazz for the Clippers to account for. Beverley's aggressive defense is a detriment against Conley and Mitchell because both of them have become patient playmakers. Paul George for whatever reason can't stop Joe Ingles.   The Clippers have fantastic perimeter defenders, but help defense is always more important than perimeter defense. The moment one of Jackson, Kennard, Williams, or Zubac are on the court, the Jazz will exploit that matchup. The drop off between their ""good"" and ""bad"" defenders is bigger than any contending team. There are also just too many playmakers on the Jazz to account for without elite help defense at all times on the floor."
I still don’t trust Paul George in the playoffs
"it’s Paul George. of course it’s Paul George. Dude is already a borderline MVP candidate and you’re replacing his neurotic, occasionally choke-prone personality with an overriding belief in his ability to beat anybody any time by himself? Dude would be putting up 40 a game."
*Paul George nods*
"If you polled those same 100 experts I would guess few would consider Ingles a wing stopper. Having a nice series against George a few years ago, I think George was injured too, doesn’t really do it. Murray is a guard, but Ingles looked much too slow against him last year whereas he was a primary guy on Chris Paul with the Clippers that last year Paul was there. The Jazz don’t even consider him their best perimeter guy, that’s Royce O’Neale."
"If you’re looking at Utah (smartass) then you should be looking at the Bucks and probably Clippers too because they’re about as likely to challenge the Lakers as we are.  Paul George is a perennial playoff choke artist and the bucks haven’t even made the finals.  Personally I think your definition of contenders for a too narrow if you’re leaving any of those teams out including Utah.  West contenders to me are Lakers, Clippers, Jazz, Nuggets. East are 76ers, bucks, Nets."
"Ingles isn’t considered a wing stopper?  Didn’t he have multiple great Playoff series as a wing defender? I remember him shutting down Paul George?  “According to NBA.com, he was matched up with George on 231 possessions, nearly three times the amount of any other play on the Jazz. Through those 231 possessions, George scored just 52 points on an abysmal 19-for-57 shooting from the field (33.3 percent) and 6-for-25 from 3-point range (24.0 percent).”  Sounds like a great wing defender to me?"
uh where were you the last 6 months that this sub wanted paul george to quit his job?
"Huh, it only took Wade, Bosh, LeBron, Ray Allen and various other role players to beat Paul George, Roy Hibbert and Lance Stephenson. I hope you feel accomplished, you’re not winning another title."
PETITION TO MAKE PAUL GEORGE NOT AN ALL STAR JUST BECAUSE LETS DO IT REDDIT
Beal for Paul george
"He had 49.3% TS in the Jazz series. I watched those playoff series and he was a walking brick. Paul George played like absolute shit in game 6, but that doesn't mean Westbrook played well overall."
"Plz vote for Vuc guys.  We need it to be a thing.  I had Vuc, Bam, KD, Beal, and Jaylen Brown for East  Kawhi, Paul George, Jokic, Steph and Luka for west.  But most important we need Vuc in.  Plz.  Plz. Plz.  Magic fan shave nothing don’t deprive us of this and sweet sweet mid range jumpers in the all star game."
"Only question that needs to be asked is if paul George did this, would Lebrons’s fanboys be singing the same tune"
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
Hottest take I’ll ever say. CJ &gt; Paul George ^on ^offense
"&gt;The 6-11 Miami Heat don't own their own draft pick. It belongs to...the OKC Thunder, unprotected of course.  &gt;In 2015 the Heat traded their 2021 first round pick to the Suns for Goran Dragic.  &gt;The Suns traded this pick to the Sixers in 2018 to move up and take Mikal Bridges.  &gt;The Sixers traded it to the Clippers in the Tobias Harris trade.  &gt;And then the Clippers traded it to the Thunder for Paul George.  &gt;With the team ravaged by Covid, the team has dug themselves into a hole that will be difficult to recover from, and Sam Presti is rubbing his hands together.    Commenting to come back to this when the playoffs start. Say hi everyone"
What about George Paul
Paul George?
"Who would have guessed that a team with 1 shooter, Paul George, would get demolished in the playoffs. I'm fine to admit that Westbrook's game isn't built for the playoffs where wins are earnt through exploiting your opponents weakness, not through your own strengths. I could make arguments about OKC playing bum ass Carmelo Anthony in the Utah series, or how the Jazz should've had about 10 more technical fouls in that series, or I could even point out the fact that both Russ and PG were playing through serious injuries vs Portland, but the biggest factor to OKC's and in turn Russ's playoff failures was a lack of shooting. As I said the playoffs are about exploiting weakness's in your opponent - having zero shooting is a pretty easy thing to exploit. As good of a GM Presto has shown himself to be, he clearly dosnt like giving up picks to go all in on a team, it was true in the KD era, was true in the Russ era, I hope it's not gonna be the case in the Cafe/SGA/Dort era."
"That dirty one on Livingston could've resulted in an open fracture like with Paul George during that exhibition game, wtf"
"&gt;I don’t believe in rewarding players who can’t lead their team to the top with the MVP for “narrative/stats""  But this just creates an inherently unequal playing field and incentivizes guys to join superteams in order to receive more personal credit/accolades. How are guys like Curry and Jokic, who have mediocre-bad supporting casts, supposed to lead their teams to better records than someone like Kawhi or LeBron, both of whom have elite talent around them?  It's especially stupid in the case of someone like Curry, who we've seen lead multiple #1-seeded teams and win multiple rings. He *clearly* is a guy capable of ""leading his team to the top"". And he's putting up the best production of his career, but being punished purely because he doesn't have the luxury of playing next to an Anthony Davis or Paul George-type player."
"And how does that work? Remember when AD said he wanted a trade and he had his preferred destinations and his team decided to limit his minutes to maintain value?   People (myself included until I looked into the situation more) were speaking of him as if he dogged NOLA. Paul George was dragged for wanting out, and so on.   I don’t think Dray was speaking in the sense of “players can’t request trades” but moreso “public perception” which is largely influenced by the sports media (let’s guess who they’re influenced by) absolutely dogs a player for requesting a trade."
Paul George: thats a dumb take
That’s a bad shot - Paul George
"Several pretty big differences. In 2015-16 Steph averaged 6.7 assists and a league leading 2.1 steals, while he’s now down to 5.9 and 1.2. The league TS% is also up by 3%, so the distance is not as great. Steph’s advanced stats across the board are also down slightly. PER, WS/48, BMP and Offensive and Defensive Rating are all a good chunk worse than the unanimous MVP year. So is his Real Plus Minus from ESPN and RAPTOR from 538. Though his stats in everything mentioned is still amazing this year.  Part of it is Steph’s defense is worse this year. In 2015-16 and the couple years around that Steph’s defensive numbers were actually really solid. This year they’re below average. And there’s just several other guys who are completely dominating as well. Embiid, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Giannis and Jokic are all playing pretty damn good. So are Harden, Kyrie, Paul George, Luca Doncic and a few other guys. League is just stacked right now, so Steph isn’t standing out as much."
"Curry should be higher, but so should a few other too. The votes are a complete and utter joke, Dame is 13 on the list behind Gobert and Mitchell. How is it Dame and Mitchell are less vauleable than Gobert, and Gobert is a great player. But I would take Lillard and Mitchell everyday of the week over Rudy. Then there is Luka who is ahead them, despite the fact that Portland and Utah are way better, and their star players more deserving this season to be in hunt for the MVP. Lillard has dealt with similar injury problems to Dallas, but Portland is actually competitive. Also I would argue that Tatum, Paul George, Kawhi, and Durant should all be behind Mitchell, Curry, and Dame. Boston is struggling big time, George and Kawhi take days off, because they can. And well Durant is nice, he is playing with two superstar players. The rankings are a farce and don't reflect the true value some of these players bring to their team."
"If they did stay the course with the plan of start of 2017-2018, they would've been a fun team. Lakers primary target was Paul George. I would've loved to keep Clarkson and Nance too but Ball-George-Ingram-Randle-Lopez with Hart, Kuzma and Zubac coming off the bench plus some veteran role players for the bench unit might've been interesting. This 5 was very plausible at the time.   This lineup would not be the title favorite that LeBron-Davis duo is but they could've been a fun 50+ team."
"The bad part is is, players can tank their value by coming out publicly for the trade. The player can tank his value by getting injured (obviously unintentionally). The player can get their contract sky high then leave (Paul George). And I have a feeling that's whatll happen next. Get the big deal, stay a year, then complain because you don't have a team around you, demand a trade and heaven forbid the team doesn't want to because they have a franchise player and now have to go find a franchise player. Don't sign the contract and if you do want the trade do it quietly and show up to work. The real part about the league is there's too many teams and not enough talent. If the league were half the size it would be easier to get true value for a superstar player. Not 3 late firsts, 3 pick swap rights, and a ""quality"" player."
It was actually against OKC and Paul George hit the game winner to send them 4th.
"It’s way different now. Besides injuries, Sam was very conservative until KD left. Sam pull one of the biggest riskiest small market trades in recent memory acquiring Paul George (2012 Presti doesn’t do that). Also OKC’s current coach is far superior than Brooks &amp; Donovan (I mean we beat a healthy bucks with 8 players lmao). Right now it’s Shai/Dort, but we’re hoping we get a top 5 &amp; top 10 pick in this draft. Plus we have so much draft capital we can combine them for another star via trade in 2-3 years (currently we have enough draft capital to trade for 2! Stars)."
&gt;The fact that players are shooting 50% from the 3point line is fucking insane to me.  Steve Kerr shot 50% from three thirty-one years ago -- the year Paul George was born.
"Ok but they're mad that the trade went public (which like I said, all do anyway), not that it was a rule. That's all I'm saying. He never did anything like Kyrie or Harden. Even Butler gets off pretty unscathed for what he did in Minny and that was way worse. He had a contractual obligation too, where is his hate? People gave him a pass just because he's ""such a hard worker"" or something. I don't care that some get criticized and some don't, but there's definitely no consistency in the reasoning for many people. Paul George got a lot of shit even though Presti is known for helping players if they want out and it was handled internally without any fuss.  It basically comes down to how likable the player is by fans. If he's liked, then people will make excuses. If he isn't, then fans will find the smallest things to exaggerate."
"Right now, I think the Clippers are better. But when the playoffs come around, I think the Lakers will be better. I still don’t trust Paul George in the playoffs"
Paul George
"Totally agree, you ride it out in this situation. They're sure as shit not getting the Jays so they're on their own unless they somehow trade for Paul george or some shit next season. Lol"
"He’s having a great year, but the 2020-21 season is not comparable to anything. Everybody is shooting the lights out.  Zach Lavine is averaging 28 on 53/43/86! Paul George is averaging 25 on 51/48/91! Kyrie is averaging 28 on 54/44/87!  Turns out NBA players are insane shooters with no fans."
Terrance Ross and Corey brewer also have a larger career high than Kawhi leonard and Paul George. I'm just saying
"Yeah, just saying context matters. Saric is 28th in DRMP and I wouldn't say he's better than Paul George who's 29th. But he does often play with some great defenders around him that allows him to be more disruptive on defense than playing with subpar defenders."
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
I'm guessing 2. Paul george I don't think will be back any time soon
"If the Clippers don't win this year despite having Kawhi and Paul George, who I greatly dislike but begrudgingly admit is a more talented basketball player than any of the other 2019 Raptors, then I think clearly the Raptors culture was a huge factor."
"Alright. Firstly, I wouldn’t say Durant and Kahwi are much clutch than Kyrie. Clearly much better players but not more clutch. What have they done to be considered more clutch than Kyrie? 2016 Is not the only clutch shot Kyrie has, he makes game winners every season. He has so many clutch moments and if you want me to point them out, I will.   Durant is clutch but his reputation as a clutch player is overrated because of 2017 and 2018. Both of those Game 3 shots were great shots but there was little to no pressure. Before that, in 2016 he choked away the 3-1 lead to GS by shooting 10/32 in game 6 at home. In 2013 against Memphis he was awful in those 4th quarters as they were eliminated.  He scored like 8 points in the last 3 total 4th quarters of that series. Total.  If you tell me why you think KD and Kahwi are more clutch than Kyrie, and make a good point, I may agree with you.   What player am I making Kyrie out to be? I have clearly said so many times that I understand why anyone would take PG over Kyrie or Jaylen Brown over Kyrie. PGs defense is way better than Kyries and he’s taller and a much better rebounder obviously. I just don’t think you can count on him to be the offensive player that he usually is when it matters most and he’s proven to be a choker. That’s a huge thing for me. Paul George as far as talent is definitely better than Kyrie. As far as talent he should be a top 5 player but there’s a reason that he’s not. That’s all I’m saying and that’s not unreasonable, neither does it show that I don’t know what I’m talking about. It’s just my opinion and it’s different than yours. I never stated where I think Kyrie ranks in the NBA so I’m not sure how I’m making him out to be a player he’s not, I just think he’s definitely, undoubtedly, better than Bradley Beal😂"
"&gt; And that’s the business  You act like it's super common to do this. It isn't -- or wasn't, at least  The league has changed a lot in terms of player movement. People want to dismiss the criticisms because Paul George did the opposite shortly after (forced a trade out of OKC after signing a big deal)"
"1. LeBron 2. Steph 3. KD 4. Harden 5. Luka 6. Giannis 7. Jokic 8. Dame 9. Beal 10. Embiid 11. Kawhi 12. Trae   Are all unquestionably better offensively than KG was. From there I think you could make fair debates with guys like AD, LaVine, Brown/Tatum, Booker, Zion, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Brandon Ingram. I'd take some of those guys over Garnett offensively but not all of them."
"Wym presently compared to other superstars? You can’t name 3 players right now right now who are more clutch than Kyrie. Every year kyrie has game winners, every week or two he has a game where he completely takes over the 4th quarter. It’s not just 2016 it’s his entire career and body of work in the playoffs and regular season. It’s just much better than Paul George, who is like 2-20 on game winners and both of his game winners came in the same OKC season"
kyrie has only ever won a ring with lebron. paul george spent multiple years playing with rodney stuckney. you tell me which one is underachieving
"They got the assets to obtain Kawhi and Paul George. It arguably wouldn’t have happened without shredding Blake’s contract, which was just signed that year."
They flipped Harris into the picks that became part of the Paul George trade and Shamet who they flipped for Kennard and four seconds
paul george might've won a ring with lebron too.
Paul George  Kyrie  Beal
Paul George? Is defense just not a consideration for you?
"Bro I have Drummond and am down caris (but I’m glad that went down how it did), spencer dinwiddie and Wendell carter jr and now Paul George. I was 1st for 6 straight weeks and am now like 10th lol fml"
If we will count Kyrie as a SG then we can count Paul George as a SG too and in that case my vote would have gone to PG
5 of the top 20 (qualified) 3 point clips belong to Clippers players:  Marcus Morris - 48.4  Paul George - 47.8  Nicolas Batum - 45.6  Luke Kennard - 44.4  Patrick Beverley - 43.6
"I've been a long-time LeBron stan, but it's pretty unlikely he'll be this good by the beginning of two seasons from now.  I just looked up a couple advanced metrics for Jordan; his mid-30s figures were roughly equal with LeBron, then when he returned to the game in his late-30s he was a good player but a dramatic drop-off from just a few years prior.  There's evidence that LeBron's aging better, but I think in 3 years the best case is Paul George or AD good (all-star, not in the MVP discussion)."
Who has more crushing playoff losses than Paul George the Broken?
Paul George has joined the chat
"Lots of teams have had solid runs, even the Jazz are somewhat known for going on a midseason tear most years albeit not to this extent.  The difference is the ways in which they're doing it, the ways they're able to keep it going and overcome things when it doesn't all go their way, and at this point I'd say 18 wins out of the last 19 games and currently being back up to a 7 game winning streak, is a bit more than a ""hot streak"".  They're shooting and scoring at unprecedented rate from the 3, and doing it with 5-ish guys. Gobert is looking like an early favorite for what would be his 3rd dpoy award. They have a variety of bench pieces making some solid depth. Unlike previous years they seem to have that killer instinct and I don't see them taking their foot off the pedal at the end of games to the extent they used to (Huge IMO).   Most importantly though in my personal opinion, they've shown they can overcome bad nights shooting and continued to win games decisively against some great competition. They can beat teams in a variety of ways, whether it's through solid defense and chipping away what points they can get, coming out and bombarding teams with 3's, or even feeding Gobert and going inside when teams try to sell out the paint a bit in an effort to stop the 3's.  I personally don't find the Clippers to be fear inspiring and I'm still not sold on the idea that Paul George and Kawhi Leonard's combined superstar power really works well and compliments one another that well. The Jazz have also had some pretty consistent success against ""Playoff P"" and more recent success against the Clippers.   You're 100% right about the 50/50 calls and probably even some of the 60/40 calls though, especially if it's the Lakers.   I think ultimately with the Clippers though, it will depend on them stepping up their team chemistry, and which version of Paul George shows up, and whether or not he can be consistent.  The Lakers are obviously a matchup nightmare for the Jazz and most everyone else because of AD's versatility and skill set. It's the same issue the Jazz have with the Nuggets when Jokic and Murray are both on, but the Lakers are not only even better, they're more consistent. On top of that the Laker's are deep and versatile enough that they can find other ways to beat teams if their initial approach doesn't work out. One minor silver lining is that Lebron had struggled to win in Utah for a while before eventually turning it around, but again that's in the past now and he's been fine against us since like 2018 at least. I'm just hoping he can revert to his older Utah struggles if we have to face them. Even then though he didn't necessarily struggle personally, just that he wasn't able to close and get the W in the end.  I fear the Lakers most, Nuggets and Sixers are probably a tie for second place depending on how consistent they've been playing when we match up, and then after that I'd put the Clippers.  I'm not saying it's a surefire thing that any of those matchups will matter or that the Jazz are favorites to win them or that it would be easy.  I'm just saying that there's a bit more to it this year and the Jazz should be seen as a legitimate threat, instead of the same team in the middle of their annual hot streak."
"I hear you and agree with you. For most players, Dame included, they read what people say and it affects them just like it would anyone else. And like Dame said, for those who want to join a superteam just to chase a ring, so be it. More power to them. But you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned Melo and “the whole narrative around his career would change.” Narrative. That is what Dame is talking about. The media’s narrative.. the narrative of armchair point guards.. pundits.. doesn’t matter to him. He knows who he is, what he wants, what he thinks is right. And I think he aims to prove that what he brings to the league and to Portland is just as valuable. And I agree with him, although as a lifelong Blazers fan I’m super biased. But I was there in the building when he put the Rockets away in the 2014 playoffs with a three that he got off in 0.9 seconds. I was watching when he destroyed Paul George and the Thunder in the 2019 playoffs with that “bad shot.” And were the greatest, most thrilling moments I have ever experienced as a sports fan. More than when the Seahawks won a Super Bowl. More than when the Mariners won the 1995 ALDS with a double off the bat of Edgar Martinez that scored the winning two runs in the 11th inning of the deciding Game 5. And I will love Dame forever for what he has done in Portland, for the joy he has brought me and the rest of us who are Blazers fans, whether or not he ever wins a championship. I would rather have Damian Lillard’s career here in Portland than to have had any of the stretches of championships that LeBron has brought to Cleveland, Miami, or LA, because Dame is OUR guy. We can be proud that he is ours and no one else’s. He has been loyal to Portland and we love him for it."
You dont think it’s bad that Westbrook was significantly worse than Paul George immediately after winning MVP?
"After 63 consecutive game-winning threes, Dame finally bricks one. Paul George sleeps soundly for the first time in ages."
"lmao westbrook has not been better than paul george or james harden, more news at 11"
Helped us win our only championship and rested Kawhi and Paul George to prevent us losing by 50.   I too am thanking Ty Lue tonight
"I mean Bridges isn't a reach. He was always a good wing defender with good potential on offense.   Cam is kinda a reach but was having a good year on UNC and even had some Paul George comparison.  Haliburton is definitely the one they should pick. Good back up for CP3, and CP3 isn't getting any younger"
"Unless they win every game before the voting ends, he doesn't have a shot at the all star game. Lillard, Curry, LeBron, Davis, Kawhi, Jokic, Paul George, Doncic, two players from the jazz (probably Mitchell and Gobert) are all locks. That leaves just 2 spots left for Booker, Conley, DeRozan, and Fox who all deserve a spot more than him"
"AD would never have re-signed and would have cost Brown. Paul George would likely have cost Brown. Kawhii would never have re-signed and would have cost Brown.  until recently, the *treasure chest* was Jaylen Brown. he was good enough to be attractive to other teams but not so good that they thought they were asking for too much.  It's almost like the only reason Boston is in as good a position for the next 5 years as they are is because they didn't make foolish, short-sighted trades."
He's not a better rebounder (pretty even) or 3pt shooter. Also he bodied us because you guys had AD and they had Paul George.
"Let’s run it back.  &gt; lmao, russ was not the reason the rockets lost the playoffs  This implies he had nothing to do with it when he literally had the **most** to do with it.  And lmao, “simply isn’t true”. Teams were hard doubling harden and forcing westbrook to beat them 4 on 3 and with capella teams got away with it because they know westbrook isnt and even worth guarding past 10 feet at most. They thought that making it 5 out would increase our chances and russ would be able to beat 4 on 3s that way (like any other REAL star guard would have done) but unfortunately, he couldn’t.  And actually, I agree with you. The teams shit construction *is* why we lost. And that construction is really russ. I don’t know why the fuck they thought he was going to be a new player at age 32. So yeah, the rockets are pretty dumb for that in hindsight.  &gt; westbrook has been on teams more successful  Like the 2012 thunder? Yeah, they had better players and westbrook was better back then. The NBA also wasnt as advanced as it is now so players like westbrook did better. Not sure why that’s relevant. Russ and steven adams got shitted on in the first round 4 seasons in a row even with Paul George on his side.   My point is there are about a 100 players who would have produced better then westbrook did for us in those playoffs and I’d a ton of them make the series a toss up too. You’re ignoring that even with westbrook the swries was really close to being 2-0, it legit was winnable a good chunk into the 4th.   But guess what? Russell Westbrook shot 4-15, had 10 points, dished out 4 assists along with 7 turnovers. That’s 15 shots to 10 points, 4 assists to 7 TO. There are 200 players who would have impacted the game enough for us to win. Lakers fans sighed relief when he checked back in after we made a run while he was sitting. I can’t believe you don’t remember this lmao  That is absolutely g league fucking level of basketball, I don’t care if he averaged 19/5 a bunch of low end players would do that if the other team refuses to guard them and they said fuck efficiency.  His TS was in the 40s.  Half our team was not worse then westbrook, you think just because he put up 19 PPG he was somehow good? Our players who stood still and shot open threes at a respectable clip and At least tried on defense had way more of an impact.  So what the fuck is so hard for you to understand? Westbrook wasn’t good, he held the team down, he was the main reason we lost and tons and tons of players would have done way better and I’m willing to say a large number of players would have won us that series since we’d be up 2-0 if not for that G League performance by Westbrook.  I don’t need to digest shit, **you** do. You’ve yet to produce a single valid point lmao and you’re acting like you have"
"Do you think Paul George sometimes just chuckles to himself ""he would have looked pretty stupid if he missed"""
Paul George had recently turned 24 when he played that series.
"I think saying he's way fucking ahead is wrong. Saying he's ahead is subjective he's better offensively at age 22 but rebounds and assists are very close and I'd take 22 year old PG defensively over 22 year old Tatum any day. It's kind of an unfair comparison though as Tatum started a year earlier than PG. If you take both of their year 4 averages (assuming Tatum keeps with where he's at now) I'd probably take Paul George over him unless I needed a slightly better shooter/scorer. Dude was all NBA Defense 2012, 2013, and again in 2015 when he came back from injury."
Paul George seems to be out indefinitely with the no updates and the injury info from doctors
Paul george? He would probably be the best fit for any contending team. A defensive star that can hit 3's on a crazy rate. He isnt ball dominant as well
He cheats. We have no idea if he would be more than a 6th man without egregiously abusing the rules.   https://mobile.twitter.com/Kazeem/status/1208051696817102848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1208051696817102848%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fnba%2F2019%2F12%2F20%2F21031719%2Fjames-harden-crossover-paul-george-rockets-vs-clippers-travel-carry-double-dribble
"On one hand Paul George was a legit MVP candidate just a year a half ago. On the other hand, Tatum is *way fucking ahead* of where PG was when PG was 22. IMO Tatum’s ceiling is definitely above PG."
tbf i dont think paul george can do what harris does off the catch either. for example a guy like harden shoots only a little better on wide open catch and shoot 3s than he does on stepback 3s. Harris shoots over 50% on caatch and shoot. Dont know what george shoots but theyre just different skillsets.
They haven't been incredible but Tatum and Brown are their only top picks I'd much rather hit on that than the #30. There are teams with a much worse drafting record than Boston. You can just use free agency to fill out the middle.   Also is it his fault that Kyrie was dogshit as the main guy? Seemed like a universally lauded move to trade for him. It's like when a team trades for Paul George and he biffs it in the playoffs. You can fault them for trying.
"First off, we're talkin about Championship teams *right now*, not 2 years ago. If you wanna talk about teams from 2 years ago, then we have to use 2019 Jaylen Brown for comparison  Even then, Jaylen Brown *now* is not quite as good as Lowry then, especially when you insert him into the Lowry role. Lowry's BBIQ, leadership, playmaking and range were instrumental in that win and he was better than Kawhi at a lotta times in the Finals, especially when he was raining bombs from 3 in Oracle. Jaylen Brown now is on a statistically unsustainable hot streak but will cool off by the end of the year.  You're the one who made the Braindead take bud. Without all the intangibles Lowry brings the Raps aren't making it out of the 2nd round.  Now put 2021 Jaylen Brown on the Lakers instead of AD. Or on the Clippers instead of 50/40/90 Paul George. Lmao at thinkin Brown is anywhere near those players"
"We still bagging on the Celtics for not trading for Paul George? It would have required giving up Jaylen Brown who’s arguably a starter for the ASG this season. AD would have required giving up Tatum and Brown and there’s no guarantee that he sticks around after last season, especially if Kyrie still bolts for the Nets. Also, if memory serves correctly the Celtics weren’t allowed to trade for AD until the offseason due to the Rose rule. The Lakers made the move before the Celtics were even allowed to get involved. There are a lot more questions around Myles Turner but the Celtics can’t trade for him unless Hayward consents to the deal, which he might not have done."
"I agree with that actually. No offense to Paul George, but I hope Tatum has a higher ceiling than that."
And Paul George and butler.
"For Paul George, right 😁"
"The Celtics have made some massive moves over the past 5 years to assist the Jays (Kyrie, Horford, Hayward) but these all seem to be forgotten.  As for the players you listed, AD refused to play for Boston and let them know he would leave immediately in the offseason, Paul George would not have been a good fit in Boston and there was very little motivation for the FO to make a move and trading for turner was not the Celtics decision, Hayward chose to walk for more money which didn’t allow for the S&amp;T"
"Tatum reminds of Paul George sometimes, can get super hot and drop like 40 with like 7 3's but also can drop like 5 points on 2/15 shooting"
This is why the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Look at say 2014 before everyone realized how efficient begging fouls was. Bigs were on top of the league. Fast forward it’s just really Joel and giannis Zion  up there for bigs. That’s what’s propping it up for star players. How is Paul George getting one less attempt per game now that back then when he’s firing   3 more threes a game and isn’t as aggressive attacking like back then ? it’s clear too many fouls are occurring from ref baiting on the perimeter
"They've been patient for years, and supposedly didn't wanna commit to trades for AD, Paul George, and now Myles Turner. Obviously we don't know all of these were 100% on Ainge not offering enough (like maybe AD wouldn't go to Boston) but there's been so many reports of him not wanting to trade the *treasure chest* I gotta feel there's some validity to it"
Paul George is a liability in the playoffs
Paul Geoorge is doing pretty good. Wonder how Paul George is doing though...
"We really need to wait and see if and when Paul George gets healthy again first. If he ends up being out for a couple months then I don't think the Clippers hang on to that 3rd seed, so who knows where they end up. I personally don't think the Jazz will stay in first place either though. Even as hot as they've been they haven't been able to get any separation from the Lakers. It's not like Utah will continue winning at this rate, as nobody does."
"Clippers a full of players the Jazz can hunt. That's the thing, there isn't a ""throwaway"" player on the Jazz that you can stick a weak defender on, either starting or on the bench. Last year they had more holes, but re-adding Favors and a healthy Bojan pushing Jingles to bench leader with Clarkson gives the Jazz much more offensive versatility for 48 minutes.  I mean the Jazz even hunt Paul George and have the playoff receipts to prove it."
"Bosh Spice and George Paul are undefeated. Thanks, Skip. Also, DeMar DeFrozen is up there, but I don’t know if he came up with that one."
What kinda nuts though? Paul George gives me a walnut vibe but Harris is totally a pistachio.
"Paul George should be more nuts. Harris has the gravity of KD, Kyrie and Harden"
"Beal is definitely fun to watch, and is a great player, but I think it's funny we give him a pass on not being able to carry a team. We don't hold him to the same standard as the top tier guys in the league. Imagine if Harden, Kawhi, Dame, or even Jokic or Paul George didn't even come close to making the playoffs 3 years in a row. I used to think he was entering top 15-20 player status, but I'm starting to think he's closer to Zach Lavine than Dame Lillard."
"“Paul George possesses prototypical physical attributes for an NBA small forward prospect, even if he currently sees more time at the power forward position” ——from Paul George’s pre-draft profile.....lol.  Not only did he not come into any league as an SG, he was actually expected to slot minutes at PF 😂"
Green looks better. Dude seems like a faster Paul George.
"they tried to trade him for paul george and eric bledsoe and when he found out, he requested a trade.  it's fair game to me"
Paul George and Beal too imo
"Lebron Steph Kd Harden Cp3 Wall Dame AD Paul George Kawhi Westbrook  Thats 11. You can also add Cousins, Kyrie and Aldridge ahead of Klay easily. This being 2016 after all.  Miles ahead? Not really but he was firmly outside the top 10."
"Totally agree. It's just like how Paul George isn't great during the regular season, but come playoff time he becomes Playoff P. Exact same thing will happen with the Lakers"
thats the team Paul George grew up watching
Kyrie left after they tried trading him Paul George to Cavs Kyrie to Phoenix Bledsoe to Indiana
For a 21 year old on terrible team with a Paul George type body yes I would like that
i’d have to leave the sub for a week if paul george or anyone on the clippers did it lol
Nice of Kyrie to pay tribute to Paul George mid game. They must be good friends.
"??????????????????????????????????????? you know that players coming off of injury often need a year to get into nba form. And if you're such a big part of a teams gameplan on both ends its gonna look rough. And sure simmons is the frontrunner for dpoy currently but unless your 1st option is trae young pg is better for your team than ben simmons. even then pg has a solid argument as he is one of the most well rounded players in the league and provides value off ball when he's further than 10 feet from the basket. If i were to build a team around 1 of them I'd choose the 6'11 point guard, even over ad but as a number 2 option pg is much more of a swiss army knife than ben simmons. you need someone to comfortably defend the opposing teams best guard/ wing pg is your guy. you need a shooter to clear out because your number 1 option is isolating, paul george can do it. you need someone to isolate because your #1 is being doubled? I hope you get my point. paul george is more than a meme and currently averaging 24/6/5 on 51/48/90.  PS: IIRC Ben simmons was out in last years playoffs and the 76ers were swept or did I miss something"
"Players in top 20 in scoring and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Paul George, Zach LaVine.  that’s it. Insane how disrespected he is"
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
Here's one of his pre-draft articles where it mentions that the Clippers were his favorite team growing up (at the end of the article):  http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Paul-George-Workout-and-Interview-3495/
"I love Paul George, how could anyone hate Joe Ingles’s son?!"
"Three reasons:  1. In hindsight the voters realized they made a mistake  2. His scoring efficiency dropped significantly in years 2 and 3  3. He had Paul George, a player on his own team, out play him"
Look what butler did in the finals it’s true butler didn’t statistically outplay tatum but I think at this point it’s safe to say he’s a better leader and does a lot of the little things that don’t show up on the stat sheet that leads to wins.  I think a lot of GMs would take a guy like butler over tatum and Paul George for this year just to try to win a championship. Butler has those intangibles
How quickly they forget.  I'm taking Jimmy Butler over Paul George or Jayson Tatum.
"A huge part is also that it’s Paul George. Even when he says objectively true shit people will find a way to get at him.   He’s just not well liked, at least by Reddit."
"Yeah just because some of those guys can be primary ball handlers doesn't mean you'd get diminishing returns. Steph is an elite off-ball player, KD is one of the best shooters in the league. Kawhi would benefit even more when paired with a ball-handler since while he's an improved playmaker, benefitted from a guy like Lowry. Jokic is still also an elite pick and roll partner, so would be a tremendous second option as well.   I don't think being a good second option is a great argument for a player being better than guys who can be Championship Contenders as the first option, unless you believe AD can be close to that as the first also, which there definitely is some reason to believe. But I think a better way to look at it is put PG, an elite 2-way player (who can be a second option of a chamionship team and first on a legitimate playoff team) with any of the guys we are talking about, and Paul George/Anthony Davis is probably the worst duo.  Again, as we are showing there are arguments both ways."
"i mean even as recently as the summer before he joined the thunders he [said the same thing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-kevin-durant-offered-advice-thunder/467406001/)  &gt; “I grew up a Lakers and a Clippers fan,” George said. “I idolized Kobe. There will always be a tie here, a connection here. People saying I want to come here, who doesn’t want to play for their hometown? That’s a dream come true, if you’re a kid growing up on the outskirts of L.A., to be the man in your city. But it’s definitely been overstated. For me, it’s all about winning. I want to be in a good system, a good team. I want a shot to win it. I’m not a stats guy. I’m playing this game to win and build a legacy of winning. I’ve yet to do that. I’m searching for it. If we get a killer season in Oklahoma, we make the conference finals or upset the Warriors or do something crazy, I’d be dumb to want to leave that.”  that whole article is actually a pretty decent read"
"Lol he’s not even close to Paul George camp what the fuck are you on. He’s been good in the playoffs since his 2017 meltdown, that was one game 4 years ago."
Paul George and Kawhi can do a lot more but they fit the bill
"He's in the Paul George camp. We know how good he is in the regular season, but i don't think any of us want him for a game 7"
"You can absolutely train them to have a good grasp of dodging picks. It’s an art, but it’s not something no one can grasp. It’s just that it’s more natural to train your jumper or handle.   What’s happening in your games is that you don’t have guys bursting off screens either getting home or pulling up for the three. You don’t have guys stopping short and getting a 3 shot foul against you. You don’t have some dynamic roll/pop man or great screen setter probably either. Most guys aren’t great screen setters for one reason or another. Guys are probably not running you through 2 screens at a time either. I generally like to do things your way as an on ball defender, and it’s a skill, but I think it’s more about what the offense can do than how good the defense is.   When the offense is really good, you might need to do more than just Paul George every single screen."
"This is the way. Not saying this as a Lakers fan, but just being realistic as a basketball fan that the teams with the best superstars tend to win playoff series. It's how the sport has always been, it's why no one in the East stood a chance against Lebron for years when the next closest stars weren't even top 5 players or close to it(Paul George is a top 15 player and Giannis/Embiid weren't that good yet)."
I would assume Cleveland trades for a guy like Paul George at some point
Hence the 2-for-1... Which they did go for (Paul george shot a 3 immediately)
People aren’t taking victory laps about him being bad it’s just highlighting how on the totality of his career the following are his shooting splits   57% from the rim  33% from 3-10 feet   31% from 10-16 feet   36% from 16-22 ft   31% from 3  His defense is fine but he clearly has yet to show he can score from any level of the court with any kind of consistency. For a guy repeatedly comp’d to Paul George and labeled this “untouchable asset”. It all just highlights what a massive curve fans grade young players on and how devoid from reality it often can be. In the backdrop of all this is people overhyping Reddish because of his connection to the Doncic trade There are many many ex beyond Cam Reddish where people do this every year
"An illusion fools you.   He’s “solid, average” when he can check other stiffs and tomato cans like Greg Monroe and oxygen-starved Myles Turner. He gets devoured by the game’s elite bigs.   I don’t care about his playoff performance in past seasons, balling up bums like Rudy and Paul George. Or his efficiency. The guy makes his layups - I’ll give him that - he just lacks the ability to get to the line at an  elite rate. If your team has to win the play-in game to make the first round, you have no seat at the MVP table."
"I’d max him no problem. If it was 14 points on average efficiency, no way, but his scoring efficiency is insanely high too.  He’s the next Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Paul George wing that takes a slow burn in development but will be one of the most impactful players in the league in his prime."

Holy fuck I can’t believe I forgot Paul George. My apologies the dude is a real nice guy and gets hated for off the cuff comments he makes in pressers.
I imagine Clippers fans remember him going after Paul George specifically. First it was CP/PG talking shit then Devin got heated and chirped at him.
Paul George slipped the screen which was why 37 didn't seem to notice PG. I think 7  didn't call the switch or maybe 37 just didn't hear or process it
[Right](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-says-the-clippers-are-not-in-panic-mode)
You’re straight up delusional if you don’t think this sub doesn’t specifically hate Paul George more than any other player in the league
God damn I swear these kids on Reddit just take out all the bullying they’ve endured on Paul George LOL
It's amazing that people think that players can just magically come back from injury and surgery when we literally saw how long it took Paul George to come back to form from a broken leg and the same for Gordon Hayward.
U can feel the memes coming. They went praising Paul George to slandering him within hours
Paul George just can’t get it done when it matters. What’s the opposite of clutch?
Paul George in last 5 mins of Milwaukee game: 0/5  Paul George in last 5 mins tonight: 2/10  He needs to find his rhythm in late game and go for the easy shot than forcing the 3 ball
Paul George launching brick after brick in the 4th
Paul George really is one of the least clutch stars I’ve ever seen
"Man, Paul George has been mediocre this quarter. I'd go with Reggie who is 5/6 from downtown."
PAUL GEORGE IS TRASH LMFAOOOOOOOOIOOO
Right before he took that 3 i was thinking paul george better not do some dumb shit
Lmao TNT doing George Paul dirty
Paul George going cold in crunch time? 🌚
paul george sucks
"True, that one still makes me mad just cuz Paul George got literally clotheslined on his way up on the other end and no one gave a shit but I watched a dude step on a shoe 50 times and put in slow motion"
"this year definately not, but there are alot of players that compete before they become established stars. have people forgotten that dame,john wall, paul george, giannis, lavine, etc have participated in the contest in recent history?"
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
Dang Paul George unironically is having a nice game
"Paul George can shoot over Kemba, Pritchard, or Teague any time he wants"
little known fact that both the US state and the country of georgia are named after paul george
Don't trust Paul George though
Paul george syndrome
"Stats alone will not do it this year for Giannis. If he can finish more games like he did against LA then yes, absolutely. Being clutch comes with experience and I think he’s starting to understand that.  EDIT: Just ask Paul George. I’m pretty he didn’t have a single game winning shot until a few seasons ago. It matters."
Paul George plays the most handsy defense I've seen. Hand checking is suppose to be illegal.
Paul george
"Mmm I mean the clippers have the potential to beat the Lakers. If Paul George has a really good series instead of choking like he usually does, they’ve got a serious chance.   Lakers the favorites for sure but it’s not a guarantee"
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Paul George   “According to ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman, the Celtics' draft-night offer included three first-round picks and two starting players, one of whom was Jae Crowder. However, the Celtics reportedly refused to include their 2018 first-round pick from the Brooklyn Nets or the Sacramento Kings/Los Angeles Lakers pick that will land in Boston through the Markelle Fultz trade.”"
Kinda a lot  Beal and Westbrook  Giannis and Middleton  Harden and Irving  Kawhi and Paul George  Jokic and Murray  Brown and Tatum
I'm looking forward to that game.  I really hope both teams are at full strength.  You got:    Ty Lue vs Doc Rivers:  Ty now coaches the team Doc was just fired from.  Doc pretty much said don't expect any different results from this Clippers team because Ty is just as responsible for the Clippers blown 3-1 lead since he was Doc's lead Assistant Coach at the time.  Plus Ty was supposedly the front runner for the 76ers job until Doc took it from him.    Paul George vs Doc Rivers:  There have been sneak dissing comments from both towards the other as to who is to blame for The Bubble.  Plus PG fucked his daughter then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Tobias Harris vs The Clippers:  Tobias plays his former team who he left because he felt like they low-balled him a contract offer.    Paul George vs Seth Curry:  PG13 fucked his wife then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Plus they had a lot of chirping goin back and forth during The Bubble when Seth was with Dallas.    Kawhi Leonard vs The 76ers:  Kawhi hits one of the most memorable post-season shots of all time to eliminate the 76ers in a Game 7 to then go on and win a Chip and Finals MVP.
"I mean, we did want them, we just wanted Paul George more."
Paul George is going to defeat Perry the Platypus and take over the tri state area
Paul George is a super villain on r/NBA
Paul george is praising his new coach who is doing a really good job. Why are people mad about this?
"Jimmy's stat-line tonight was gaudy - but he normally doesn't have 30+ point games which means people typically gloss over him. I get why it happens, hell, I prolly would have been one of the people who'd do it - but when you ask a ""Paul George or Jimmy Butler"" question 5 months ago, people said it was over, [Jimmy won.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ituqxj/its_over_jimmy_butler_is_better_than_paul_george/)  [Yet as recently as 6 days ago, most people over-whelmingly took PG13 and Tatum over Jimmy.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/loc9c6/start_bench_cut_jayson_tatum_jimmy_butler_paul/)  I really believe that we can beat any team in the East(minus Brooklyn) if we're healthy in a playoff series with him at the helm."
"&gt; when you can trade for Paul George, you do so  By that logic, the Warriors totally should have traded Klay Thompson, because when you can trade for 2014 Kevin Love, you do so."
"Okay I mean Harden literally averages near 16 ppg in the all star game. Paul George once scored 41 in an all star game, and Dame...i mean dame is dame"
Did I say he was? Both teams are much better when those guys are on the floor for their team. My point was that everyone keeps bringing up that Jimmy has missed a bunch of games but no one ever talks about all the games KD has missed which is roughly the same. KD's a better player than JB but he shouldn't get a pass for that. Last year Paul George missed a bunch of games and wasn't named an All star. The double standard and bias is quite staggering.
"I think if you choose Lavine, Julius Randle, Vucevic, over  Dame, Paul George, Harden then that's probably a bad choice"
I’d rather have prime Chris Paul George Hill tbh
"It was a bit of a heartbreak to let him go, but as SGA himself said, when you can trade for Paul George, you do so. We all hoped to see him blossom in Clippers' colors, but since we can't we'll root for him from afar."
West had 4 forward/centers in reserves.  East only had 3.    east had Tatum/Vuc/Randle with Simmons/Brown/Harding/Lavine.  west had Davis/gobert/George/Zion with Lilliard/Paul/Mitchell
Chris Paul George Muresan.  7’7  Super athletic  Great defender  Phenomenal passing  Super ballhandling
Chris Paul George would be the goat
He said feels like one. Paul George feels like a top 20 player

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"nobody can prepare themselves for living in isolation for months in a row. You think Paul George just made up his depression? Again, this isn't a video game, just because everyone was in the same situation doesn't mean everyone reacted the same way."
"Kawhi was imo the only likeable thing about their roster last year... guys like pat bev, harrell, and morris rubbed a lot of people the wrong way last season and Paul George was a meme in the playoffs - it's more or less carried over into this season"
"The OKC Thunder had a consistent track record of success when Paul George forced his way to LA in 2019  The Toronto Raptors are known for being well run and *were coming off a championship* when Kawhi Leonard left for LA  These teams can’t be described as poorly-run, but they’re small-markets who lost out to LA"
"The mythology of sports is what makes it fun though, as is being a fanatic to a degree. I don't think being a malicious fan and threatening people or players or what not is in good spirit, but illogically/irrationally defending your team/guys because they're your guys is completely part of the fun of being a fan. And I'm aware the team owners and those that profit off of us care about us beyond our money, but I can still care about the team itself and the brand itself and I think, again, that's what makes team sports fun.   As far as your second paragraph, I do agree. I don't want rules to restrict player movement or for any of that to happen. I want it to happen organically/naturally, as in how Beal and Lillard don't just go jumping teams. A player making a legacy on a team is special in my eyes. If Paul   George ends up not winning a championship his name will be forgotten not long after he retires, mostly because he was never special to any one fanbase and burned bridges. In comparison, Reggie Miller is still talked about regularly by Pacer fans in different generations. Lillard will be the same way. Washington fans are hurt their team traded away Wall when they'll be shit anyway because it did mean something.   Of course not everyone thinks like me and that's fine, but I, and I could be wrong, do think this type of thinking is the only way for small markets/bad teams to continue getting support otherwise issues do arise where bad teams are watched by no one as there are no team fans left."
"Especially considering that just a year later the Thunder flipped those two for Paul George, while the Magic flipped Ibaka for Terrence Ross and a late first round pick. What makes it even worse is that Ibaka actually turned out to be a key contributor to the Raptors championship."
Paul George banged Roy Hibbert’s girl and it ruined the Pacers
"The fuck are you talking about dude. Jokic in his two seasons of playoffs has been the best players in series that had Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Gobert and Donovan Mitchell."
George Paul the bricklayer checked in tonight
The “negative stigma” surrounding Paul George is that he performs even worse than roleplayers do in the playoffs. The way people talk about him it’s like they wouldn’t touch him with a 10 foot pole come playoff time.
"I mean this is Paul George we're talking about, right? Not some role player? Should we really be praising him for having only slightly less TS than league average?  Also average TS in the league was 56.3 last season, 53.6 is a lot lower than that."
His playoff struggles are very exaggerated because people don’t like him as a person.  From a team success standpoint he peaked when he and the Pacers took the Heatles to 7 and 6 games in back to back ECF.  Even the series where he is memed about heavy he played excellent on average. Everybody remembers Dame’s game winner but nobody remembers Paul George scoring 36 on 14/20 shooting that game. He averaged 28 ppg on 58.3 TS% that series. They lost because Westbrook took 22 shots to score 22 points a game. But people don’t care about that. It’s just pLaYoFf P.
Paul George with a truly inspirational performance.
"All you need to do is look at which superstars have been traded in the last few years and what they were traded for and ask yourself if Boston could have topped those offers. Look at what Indy traded Paul George for, what Minnesota or Chicago traded Jimmy Butler for, what San Antonio traded Kawhi for, what Houston or OKC traded Chris Paul for.   The Celtics should have *easily* been able to top those trade packages, especially since they had picks that were once highly valued that they could have thrown in (the Kings pick, the Clippers pick and the Grizzlies pick, most notably). They didn't have to trade Tatum and Brown to outbid those other teams for those guys. They also had Kyrie/IT, Horford and Hayward that they could have offered, since they apparently weren't going to be willing to give them another max level contract to keep them.   Instead Boston didn't do anything and just watched as most of those assets crapped out. The max players all just walked in free agency, and the draft picks ended up being much worse than projected and the Celtics had to use them on middling prospects rather than blue chip studs. I can't imagine there's many Boston fans from the last few years who looked at what the future could look like back then who are real happy with how it's currently going. The Celtics seem to be heading in the wrong direction these days, and the clock is ticking on the Jays. If things haven't turned around in the next couple years it's probably just a matter of time before those guys start making trade demands like Kawhi, PG, AD, Butler, etc did when they felt like they were stuck on a team going nowhere."
"Yes, hence he has to prove himself in the PLAYOFFS. Same holds true for all fringe super star players. Giannis, Paul George, Luka, Trae Young etc all will be judged by their playoff performances not regular season. If you wanna show you’re not worth a Harden trade you prove it in the playoffs not regular season."
paul george wants to be Winslow so bad
"Obviously there are players of value in clippers (kawhi, Paul George, zubac etc). They just aren't on the table in this hypothetical trade."
What if the Cavs traded Love for Paul George. Does Lebron stay in Cleveland longer? Does kyrie stay? Do they beat the warriors?
This will not be competitive. Tune in tomorrow night if Paul George doesn't play for a better chance at watching the Grizzlies compete.
"who could they have traded those assets for that honestly woulda been worth it at the time?  paul george took a massive leap during his time in okc. and from what it seems on the outside, pacers valued getting some hometown talent over the best possible package. davis wanted to play with bron. sure, they could very well convince him over 1 and a half years, but their team would really be down to tatum and davis without much supporting talent around them. theyd have to rely on free agency to build a team  they made the move for kyrie and it worked real well, till it completely blew up in their face cuz kyrie was kyrie. idk if theres really anyone else that makes sense for them to go after. hardens too. hes 31 and theyd have to gut a lotta their roster for him"
danny loves his athletic wings who can develop a good shot and learn how to handle/distribute the ball (think Paul george). He went after jaylen and reportedly loved justise winslow too
Not as good as Marquese Chris Paul George Hill
Chris Paul George Hill
You mean Chris Paul George?
Marquese Chris(s) Paul George Gervin
I was replying to this obviously absurd circlejerk claim  &gt; he would be getting 0 MVP consideration. If you said they should be MVP you'd get laughed at  That's blatantly false. 2019 in particular had plenty of people naming Paul George *all the time* as a serious candidate.
Not as good as Marquese Chris Paul George Karl Anthony Davis Bertans
Chris Paul George Muresan  7’7 + point god + star wing = win
How about Chris Paul George Foreman?
&gt; Anthony Davis who historically has been better than Paul George  This is the main flawed point. AD has been disappointing to say the least throughout the whole season. In the start of the season PG was getting MVP talks.
"i'm curious as to why you think that? no one on the jazz is significantly out-performing their career averages when it comes to shooting, which is without a doubt their greatest weapon, outside of maybe jordan clarkson and royce o'neale. compare that to someone like marcus morris for the clippers who is shooting a whopping 9% better from three than his previous best, or paul george who's shooting 7% better than at any other season"
"Lol no. People have pretty much always made fun of Danny Ainge for saying he's ""close on a deal"".  &gt;The largest trade in history (at the time) for Kevin Garnett  People were saying he was afraid to make a trade right before he made this one.   People were laughing at how ""close"" Danny was to landing Kevin Garnett for years before it actually happened.  &gt;The #1 pick trade to get Tatum and Romeo at #3  &gt;The first-ever trade of two 25ppg scorers (Kyrie/Isaiah)  Right before these two trades, Danny was getting made fun of for being ""close"" on Paul George."
"al wins are legit and jazz have been great but Embiid, Paul George, kawhi and AD were all missing in the match-ups with Sixers/clippers and lakers."
Nah Paul George will come up anytime a major injury happens as people will try to compare it to his leg snapping in half
"Yes it doesn’t guarantee you a title, but it could bring you from being a pretender to an actual contender.   It isn’t like when the Clippers got Kawhi and Paul George it guaranteed then a title, and they only had 2 guaranteed years of Paul George and Kawhi.   The fact is that if you have multiple teams interested in a player. The player is a very good player (all-star caliber) with a great all around game, then he is going to have a good return because of how much better he can make a team.   Look at the difference in Phoenix after acquiring Chris Paul. They went from the lottery to being one of the best teams in the West. Imagine how good Philly would be if they got an actual point guard that works great with both Simmons play style and Embiids play style. Or if the Clippers upgraded Beverly for Lowry.  When you have a team with Lebron and AD and another team with KD, Harden and Kyrie, you need to make moves to actually compete, and title windows are shorter than people expect."
"I mean, Booker was an all-star last year at 23, when his team was losing.  He's now an all-star again at 24.  In 2018 he was ""snubbed"" for Jimmy Butler and Paul George, two all-nba players.  So, I don't think that Booker fans should have that much of a persecution complex."
"A season ago, I probably would have said Dame. But considering how crazy of a season he’s having right now, I don’t think that’s true anymore. I could maybe see Paul George fading to history if he doesn’t win a championship with the Clippers. I do think he’ll be a HOFer when it’s all said and done though"
I think people forget how good paul George is the fact that you even asked this lmao
"One of four players in NBA history have had multiple seasons shooting 40% from three on at least 7 attempts a game: Ray Allen, Curry, Klay and PG. Paul George is a historic shooter"
"Indiana, Boston, and Miami aren't really the strongest of teams right now. Philly was missing embiid. The win against the Clippers was without Paul George and Kawhi. Charlotte is iffy. And the Lakers are missing AD obviously. I'm not calling Utah phonies or anything but this definitely isn't a tough stretch. Although an 8-1 record is impressive regardless."
Paul george shot 40% from 3 in college - there was a lot more reason to think he'd turn it around than someone like Edwards who was a poor shooter (29%) in college.   You're right that rookies are often inefficient. But guys that were inefficient all the way along rarely suddenly become so.  Even if he becomes a good shooter (like lavine is top notch)...you're still not that great. Like lavine is an absolute best case scenario if everything goes perfectly and hes a borderline all star kinda guy in the east. That's the ceiling for a pure scorer who doesn't pass or defend.
"Not sure Paul George can get you 60 on eleven dribbles in under 29 minutes. (Against The Pacers and George, nonetheless)  But yeah I guess I get your point"
"I wouldn’t take him over Paul George though, but if it was George Paul, probably"
I’d take him over George Paul
In the same tier as Kyrie/Butler/Paul George. Right below the Lillard/AD tier
"I thought that Luka had reached his potential at age 19 and he wouldn’t improve his game.  In 2016 I thought Kyrie was going to have a better career than Curry, and would be known as the better player.  Yeah Paul George and Westbrook should have at least 2 rings by now with a dynasty in OKC"
"Last year's Clippers team was really not likable. Outside of Kawhi who is the definition of ""minds his own business"", the Clippers fielded a line-up of Marcus Morris, Patrick Beverley and Paul George, three players who get some of the most hate in the league. They endlessly talked shit and acted like a team that had won multiple rings, then came up staggeringly short when it matter most."
*Paul George has entered the chat*
"Anyone decent can win as first option. Chauncey and Tony Parker won as first options. Jimmy almost did.  A better question would be ""What's the worst player who could consistently make a team a contender without a great team"" and I'd say maybe Paul George to that"
"- Paul George, probably lol"
* Past 2000 Ray Allen    * Present Paul George with a proper second banana and a good coach probably could have won one by now.
I think Paul George could do it if he had a stacked team.
He needs a 3&amp;D wing like Jimmy Butler or Paul George as his running mate. CJ is great but he’s not a true #2 imo.
"Except when they play against regular season Paul George who would just hit 3 after 3 with a hand in his face. Seriously that guy is basically KD during regular reason.    Also, I don't know if we can lock down 3 superstars with elite sharp shooters surrounding them ala Nets"
Akashi = Harden Midorima = Klay Kise = Paul George Aomine = Westbrook Murasakibara = Kawhi  Kagami = Derozan Kuroko = Jrue?
"People keep saying this, but stars don’t just become available for no reason. If AD was as loyal to the Pels as Beal is to the Wizards idk who the hell the Lakers would have gotten. Maybe Paul George?"
They could have won if they wanted to. Paul George had depression and Montrezl was purposefully throwing the game by forcing the coach to make him guard Jokic and not play Zubac Olajuwon 40 minutes a game.
"To note, Westbrook was the same way all the way until the Paul George betrayal. Some folks just wanna live their lives..."
Kawhi didn't play against Paul George until college.  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/28111598/clippers-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-destined-play-together](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28111598/clippers-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-destined-play-together)
Paul George too   And Dlo sometimes
Paul George in 2020 vs Dallas Mavericks
"All of these guys except Klay probably had a rough childhood. Harden, wb, derozan and Jrue are all from the hood of LA. Kawhis dad got shot in Compton. Idk about Paul George though tbh."
I also don't believe that but Paul George is much proven to lead a team the Kyrie Ben and Middleton
Kawhi is the only player in the clippers that has consistently dropped 25+. You should be bashing Paul George if anything... not Kawhi. This man been hating on Kawhi ever since he got injured with the Spurs. What’s his problem? lmao
"&gt; James and Russ were never a good fit. Phenomenal players individually but just a god awful fit.  lollllll. People explained away his last OKC years as not having enough spacing around him for him to be successful(despite playing with an MVP candidate Paul George).  Then he goes to the rockets, where they literally sell out their whole scheme to play in a way that would benefit him and put him next to a guy that allows Westbrook to play 4v3 constantly and when that goes wrong people STILL say it was a bad fit."
"2018 OKC vs Utah   Westbrook, Paul George, Caramelo Anthony and Steven Adams losing to a rookie Mitchell and Ricky Rubio"
"Think about this one though:  “The Lakers devastated the Clippers sometimes meticulous sometimes cutthroat and very much All-In strategy in building a contender with Kawhi and Paul George, sweeping them in 4 games and putting a big question mark on if the situation is salvageable or if Kawhi and PG leave the franchise to ruins.”"
"Probably homer bias here, but Norm is like the Walmart version of Paul George. Very good value player at his contract.  Before people get mad, I'm not saying he is as good as Paul George."
"Oh look, it's regular season Paul George!"
"Paul George every year : 2 months at a near MVP level, Andrew Wiggins the rest of the season"
"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13. Luka Doncic 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Not sure if I missed anyone, but are all better and most are a tier above Tatum. Tatum is solidly in 16-20."
"He absolutely cannot be the 2nd star on a title team. A 2nd star on a title team is a Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Steph Curry, ... not a Paul George."
Why do y’all dislike Paul George so much. What has he done?
"Sadly, it's not a coincidence that this happens every year after the All Star break.   My cousin works at Cafe Demetre on Bloor Street, in Toronto. They were insanely busy in February of 2016, because Toronto hosted the All Star game that year.  On Sunday night, she served a group of NBA players. Paul George ordered 7 chocolate crepes and an entire cheesecake. He demanded they blend the cheesecake and bring him a straw. She couldn't believe her eyes, as he drank it with incredible vigor and almost immediately entered a diabetic coma.  His wife was not at all fazed by this, as she explained that this is an annual tradition."
Low key poor mans Paul George with how insanely hot he can get and how ice cold he can be too
"If Jokic averaged 43% shooting over a full 23 game career playoff sample, like Embiid has, I’d agree with you. Obviously nitpicking single games is a different thing. He’s been way below his regular season averages every time he’s made the playoffs, has a worse playoff eFG% than Paul George who catches a ton of shit for his playoff performance even with good defense."
Did you watch the game? Paul George shot 5/18
"Yeah, and Embiid’s teams have consistently underperformed in the playoffs. Dude has a worse playoff eFG% than Paul George lol. Even over 7 games +/- is a really noisy stat, if that’s all you have to lean on when he couldn’t buy a bucket then it’s not a good sign."
Paul George is not good anymore. he just lucky
"not really, game was practically already over with how both teams were playing.   but yes, generally speaking, it is a true a luka highlight would get more upvotes than an equivalent paul george highlight"
Paul George sometimes looks like a G-league player and it's pretty inexplicable.
"Kevin Love seems like he has a bad attitude and isn’t a good leader. Lebron probably wishes he held onto Wiggins longer and waited to cash in his Wiggins trade chip for when Butler and Paul George became available.  Love got paid big money and will likely make the hall of fame thanks to Lebron carrying him to a championship, so can’t really feel bad for him."
"Paul George- Been a fan since he broke out in the ECF vs Bron  Kawhi- Man just does his job, whoops ass and literally shows no emotion. Doesn’t do social media bullshit and is a very private person. I weirdly love that   Klay- it’s just so fuckibg fan tuning into a random ass game and seeing klay just go off. Love the pure shooter he is"
"The clippers go as Paul George goes. When he’s on they look like world beaters, when he’s off well yeah"
"I don't think so but it would have gone 7 games, and the way Paul George was playing in that series particularly it would have been a close one but I'm 95% sure the Clippers close that deal"
I don't think there's a player in the NBA that has as many unforced live dribble turnovers as Paul George. It's absolutely infuriating.
"Paul George was the only issue I had, I’m fond of Pat and Montrez, Kawhi I’m neutral."
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"Oh man the Lebron era Heat in 2011 were HATED. People hated the proclamation theyd win so many rings.  2020 Clippers never really got that level of hate, they were just ridiculed because Patrick Beverly and Paul George were on the team, saying they were winners when they never won a thing."
"LMAO you overvalue Paul George.   With Luka, Jokic, Embiid, Zion, Ja, etc. and the other young guns rising, he's maybe, at best, the tenth best player in the league moving forward."
"Clippers would not have max contract space. They've locked up Beverly, Kennard, and Zubac for 34.5m. Along with Paul George (40m) that leaves ~35m, minus roster holds. That's less than the max even before considering rosters holds. The Clippers could maybe bring in a borderline max guy (Julius Randle, Zach Lavine) but the true max guys aren't going to take a pay cut to go play with PG13, Beverly, and Luke Kennard."
Since when does Paul George care about contract length?
Paul George and the hoop stanchion being too close in USA team scrimmage.   Easier one would be Buster Posey and the catcher blocking rules.
After Paul George busted the fuck out of his ankle they moved the stanchions of the hoops back a couple of feet
Because he thinks hes paul George and doesn't play to his strengths.
Paul George wont give a fuck how long he signed for. He gonna go where he want to go lol
"Lets say worst case scenario Kawhi leaves...  The Clippers still have Paul George signed for another 5 years and now they have max cap space to sign/trade for another superstar.  In either case, the value of the picks will not “explode”."
Are you friends with Paul George?
then trade paul george dummy u shouldnt left raptors
Their collapse last season was unprecedented and not likely to happen again. Against Dallas they had a 121 offensive rating with Paul George going full Pandemic P.
Why would they wish that when they have Paul George?
“Josh Hart is better than Paul George”
"yeah he was mocked to the Spurs at 11 for months and a few weeks before the draft I kept seeing people say the pistons or Hawks might take him and then the bulls ended up making it even higher. he's got too much potential and takes the game seriously enough, Pats gonna be a beast. I don't expect him to definitely be the best player on a championship team but there's no reason for you to think he can't be like a lesser shooting Paul George-level guy."

Lebron Steph Giannis Kd Kawhi Kyrie Harden Embiid Tatum Lowry Paul George AD Beal Jimmy buckets  Gobert  Trae young  Luka  Lavine Booker  KAT SGA Dame  Jokic  Zion  Fox Porzingis  Also I’d take Lamelo but that’s sure to be controversial since he’s only been in the league for half a year
Absolutely not kawhi and Paul George be bricking hard in the clutch for some reason
Lebron Steph Giannis Kd Kawhi Kyrie Harden Embiid Tatum Lowry Paul George AD Beal Jimmy buckets  Gobert  Trae young  Luka  Lavine Booker  KAT SGA Dame  Jokic  Zion  Fox Porzingis  I’d take all these guys over Ben Simmons in the playoffs
&gt;And he's the only playoff level guard they have outside of Paul George  You're forgetting about Reggie Jackson /s
"On both sides of the court is irrelevant, all that matters is net impact.  LeBron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, AD, Dame, Chris Paul, Booker, KAT, Butler, Paul George, Kyrie, Beal, Luka, Lavine, and Zion  I got to 20 before I thought of players that would be debateable."
"And he's the only playoff level guard they have outside of Paul George.    He also fouls at a ridiculously high rate, so even if he's healthy he can't be counted on to play a full game against elite guards in the playoffs."
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
"Where in this analysis do you account for the ""Paul George perpetual failure factor""?"
Paul George is the Eric Bledsoe of Star players
"That’s fair. But out of Bron, Giannis, Harden, Kd, Steph, Ad, Embid, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, who can Middleton go above? Plus there’s still arguments for Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Beal, Lavigne, and Mitchell over Middleton."
Paul George pushes like a mfer on offense
We have nobody that can guard Paul George
"Paul George, Tatum, Lavine, Siakam over Beal imo.   But I value defence more than most.  I think PG is definitely better though, the other 3 are debatable.   So yeah I guess top 15 but not 11."
"Yeah, it's less on the Clippers and more just on Kawhi for making that demand. If Kawhi had just been cool with simply joining the Clippers as they were already constructed they'd be a much better team right now, with so many ways to improve their roster. They're still very good, of course, but their assets are all spent and this is pretty much who they are with no real abilities to upgrade anywhere. Paul George is very good, but I think anyone would rather have [SGA plus five 1st round picks (and two swaps)](https://i.redd.it/gablumavxti51.jpg) right now. Especially when you factor in how large PG's contract is, along with his age and injury history."
"been thinking that he’s a smaller, less developed post injury Paul George offensively with a better, less telegraphed handle and a bigger focus on drives instead of 3s"
"Let me just preference this with the fact that I’m a Thunder fan who has every reason in the world to agree with you.  But PG is still clearly a better defender. Even if Paul George isn’t their best defender, he’s still pretty clearly elite. I’m not a fan of advanced defensive metrics, but most of those and on off both suggest he is the best defender on the Clippers.  The weakest part of SGA game this year has especially been defense. I’m not sure why either of them being the best in their team, or the ranking actually matters when comparing the individual.  SGA has not even been one of our three best defenders this season probably."
"Player A is SGA, player B is Paul George"
"They could've had a better back up plan. I know they were going for Giannis but even that was a long shot. They could have moved players like Powell or Lowry who'll they'll now have to rush to move or get nothing back when they'll walk. Or in Powell's case are going to have to give up a ton of cap space for a sixth man.  At least when the Celtics lost Kyrie, they picked up Kemba immediately. The Pelicans only moved Anthony Davis once they were guaranteed Zion. Even the Thunder got Paul George and Carmelo a season after Durant left. The Raptors have done nothing but lose their championship identity each season with no replacement even for their role players."
"Paul George, Harrell and Lou Williams last year"
George Paul
"He can't be traded because he signed a contract extension. So we can't trade him till the summer even if we wanted to. We also can't trade Paul George, Reggie Jackson, or Patrick Patterson even though I see them in a ton of trade rumors."
"No it would be a really poor argument.  Robinson, Hakeem, Barkely, Shaq and Ewing were all a tier above Pippen.   It's like saying Paul George was better than Curry and Durant in 2018 cause he came 3rd in MVP voting."
"Think Paul George on the Pacers. A top 10ish player, could be the #1 guy on a middling team, but an amazing #2 guy on a championship team.  He was a better passer and transition scorer than PG. With George being the better isolation scorer and shooter.  Both peaked as top 3 in MVP voting as well."
1. I think the overall 3pt% improvement is due to players perceive the rim better with a static background behind it instead of a wave of fans.   2. The players on this this list with the highest % of 3 pointers -unassisted- are:  1. Zach Lavine (48.8% UA)  2. Mike Conley (41.7 UA) 3. CJ McCollum (39.7% 3PUA) 4. Kevin Durant (38.8% 3PUA) 5. Paul George (35.7% 3PUA)  Lavine really stands out here with almost half of his 3s coming unassisted. CJ’s larger volume also means he’s hitting a higher total amount of unassisted 3s in total (hitting 1.9 per game vs Lavine’s 1.7)  To me these are the most impressive shooters on the list. The ability to spot up from 3 unassisted is the most lethal skill out there and you can feel it when those players have the ball.
"Paul George but better ball handler, better defensively, slightly less as good of a shooter.  Twice as intense and clutch.  Am I'm a Paul George fan saying this."
"If Utah ends up with best record by far, it seems many people will not want to only give them one player in the 3rd team. League leader in points per game has always been, as I remember, always at the lowest 2nd team All-NBA, but I think Beal's situation my be an exception. So I think Kyrie, Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Beal all are close. I guess I could bet on Beal because he probably has the least of ""shared vote"" with others.  Paul George has a great season, I think he'd be there. Also they can count Anthony Davis as forward I think, last season it was totally possible so why not now, he could get votes over any non-star players. With the missed time he might miss it anyway though, because Jimmy Butler is playing fantastic.   These are the doubts I'd say, the other guys in this list are basically sure bets to be All-NBA."
Paul George &gt; Dame but otherwise I agree with your list.
"Curry, Doncic, LeBron, Giannis, Jokic  Lillard, Harden, Kawhi, George, Embiid  Paul, Beal, Durant, Butler, Gobert"
"Yeah I couldn’t decide between George, Randle, and Tatum. I chose Randle because he’s the first option on his team but Paul George is very likely also."
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
Paul George over Randle
Sam Presti in the 2019 offseason. Flipping Westbrook for CP3 and multiple FRPs and flipping Paul George for SGA and a shit ton of FRPs.
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.    Ben is a great perimeter defender (with room to grow), but he's not at Kawhi level. He's likely not at peak Paul George level right now.  ||Peak|Games|DBPM|DPIPM|DLEBRON| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |Ben Simmons|2020-2021|88|+2.2|+1.6|+1.65| |Kawhi Leonard|2014-2016|202|+3.1|+3.5|+3.30| |Scottie Pippen|1994-1995|151|+3.1|-|-| |Tony Allen| 2011-2013|209|+2.7| +3.0|+2.55| |Paul George|2013-2014|159|+2.5|+2.5|+2.38| |Jimmy Butler|2014|67|+2.0|+2.1|+1.65| |Andre Iguodala|2011-2012|129|+2.0|+2.4|+2.0|. |Andrei Kirilenko|2005-2007|180|+3.2|+2.6|-| |Metta World Peace|2002-2004|197|+2.3|+2.2|-| |Draymond Green|2015-2017|236|+3.2|+4.1|+3.75| |Rudy Gobert|2017-2019|218|+2.4|+4.2|+4.15|  Embiid is the best defender on the Sixers.

Paul George has a history of great playoff performances. You're letting memes get in the way of facts.
But that doesn't mean anything. He's basically just Paul George then. Sustained regular season sucess but inevitable collapse in the playoffs without a second star.
"I'm going to try to see if I can name 25 players that you can argue are better than him in no particular order:  1. Lebron  2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Kawhi 5. Embiid 6. Harden 7. AD 8. Luka 9. Jokic 10. Cp3 11. Booker 12. Westbrook 13. Kyrie 15. Butler 15. Lillard 16. Steph 17. Klay (assuming he's healthy) 18. Paul George 19. Tatum   (I think the next 5 are real stretches)  20. Ingram 21. Zion 22. Murray 23. KAT 24. Demar 25. Sabonis 26. Beal 27. Mitchell 28. Gobert    Yeah, that's about it where you can maybe make an argument of being better than Simmons.  I think Simmons is definitely top 20, maybe top 15.  Also again that list wasn't in any order, I was just naming players off the top of my head.  Also side note: I totally forgot about Gobert and Mitchell until the end of that list. Sorry Jazz fans, I didn't mean to pull a Lebron, those guys are studs."
LOL @ the pause and look away after he said Paul George.
"Paul George, Patrick Beverley"
"The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn’t get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  He’s never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who’s the risk?   Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That’s sad. Guess we should just stop trying to win cause we won some titles a few years ago and be happy with it. No wonder you’re so against being aggressive with trades. You rest on your laurels.   Part of the Lakers “history” is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Oh and you know who cited Thomas’ situation as a reason he didn’t want to be in Boston? AD.   How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ? At this point dude, you’re in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye."

Paul George is smooth
Interesting to see defensive on/off between Trae and Beal. Seems like the majority of the sub would consider Trae to be even worse on D than Beal but this indicates he's a good deal better. Also surprised to see Paul George ahead of Giannis on defensive on/off. Sucks that the stat doesn't tell even close to the whole story as you said but it's at least interesting to compare. Thanks for the effort op.
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
"Steph is worth a Paul George type of haul. He's never getting traded, though.   If Klay comes back at 100%, he'd be worth multiple 1sts and a young player, but that's a big if. And he's a huge part of team culture, he's almost certainly not getting traded either.   Dray has the least value since not every team could use him. But I still think we could get a 1st + filler for him, at least. He's the least unlikely to be traded, but I still don't see it happening."
"The NBA has way higher AAV contacts though.  Bryce Harper is making less than Al Horford this year.  Trout, Lindor, and Cole make about the same as Paul George, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard and Tobias Harris.  I was really shocked when Bauer got $102 million over the next three years but that deal has two opt-outs and other crazy stuff."
"From getting clowned by Draymond about his retirement tour, to having LeBron, George Hill, and Jordan Clarkson blow out the Celtics during his jersey retirement day, to having the worst takes of all time, to this... it has not been a good few years for Paul Pierce lmao"
"He also took trash talk personal, shitting on Paul George's career two separate times.    His sister trashed Paul George's wife.    Not to mention, Paul George essentially apologized three separate times and Dame's response was basically ""I'm a man. I don't hold grudges.  I accepted his apology.""  Like no accountability from his own end."
Never forget that their names are Paul and Paulette George
Paul “Paul George” George is good at basketball
"You're right, I'm just saying there are plenty of examples of guys who went on to be great players after having disappointing rookie years. Dirk, Harden, Kobe, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Paul George, Giannis, Gobert, Gordon Hayward, ect. Are all examples of guys who had sub par rookie years and went on to be great players. If Wiseman still plays like this 3 years from now, then you can call him a bust. I'm just saying give the kid time."
Paul George has really skinny arms lol. Did he lose weight?
Weird. I have a pretty clear memory of Paul George waving his arm around after winning game 3 of our series vs y’all saying he was fully healthy ☠️ have fun in the lottery tho
The only thing crazy is  people mistakenly crediting Paul George for all of that when it was Roy Hibbert and David West taking advantage of the Heats lack of size that was more important
Dae Paul George bad
Paul George got the vax.
paul george what
Paul George is demolishing them
Paul George is on a personal mission to keep the blazers match up for them in the first round.
not in a league where 30yo Paul George was considered an MVP candidate
what about a classic 'paul george bad statline/shot' thread
Paul George is on Karl Anthony Towns Instagram saying the vaccine will make your feet shrink lol.
Tbh it doesn’t help that it was Paul George. This sub absolutely hates anything he does.
And fuck Paul George.
Paul George should be fined tho
"The first thing I thought was that this must be an inside joke, this is prime r/nbacirclejerk material though. Literally just “Paul George bad”"
"Paul George: ""That's a bad shot"""
"Get ahold of yourself mate I’m not mocking KAT  I’m mocking the person who really thought that Paul George would say something to insult KATs mother on his own Instagram   Thank you for the dumb ass stereotype of the city though, I see you’ve removed your flair so no one can make one about you lol  Enjoy ya day"
What happened to your Paul George should be fined post?
"Paul George plays, but injured :("
"How are Paul George or Kawhi ""low impact box score""?  Their 3rd in the West clearly from those two guys. Fact is the rest of the team is not great at all. Solid but who is their 3rd best scoring option? Its a toss up between 5 guys and all of them should be a championship teams 6th best option.  Lowry takes the cake for ugly games but impactful."
Should Paul George be fined?
"John and George Harrison as well, whose spousal abuse has been forgotten because people only talk about John  Paul and Ringo were the non-wife-beaters"
"i’m hesitant to speak on most famous people as people. like, i’ve never met paul george. between nba games and ads and interviews, 95% of what i’ve seen of paul george was edited by someone else to give a certain idea who he is. that’s a hard perspective to understand a person as a person from. but with that said i feel like if i ever met PG13 i would hate him lol dude just cannot stop saying the wrong thing at the wrong time"
"Paul George bad, upvotes to the left"
Wtf is paul george doing? Does he have no fucking tact????
"Paul George is a fucking clown if he's actually serious there. Even if he's joking, why the fuck would you do that to someone like KAT who's been affected so badly by COVID? Fucking idiot."
mods are blocking all posts of paul george making fun of KAT for getting vaccinated   [https://twitter.com/ClaireMPLS/status/1379500931675353088/photo/1](https://twitter.com/ClaireMPLS/status/1379500931675353088/photo/1)
Paul George is one of the most overrated players in today's game.
"If PG’s defense was as good as Giannis’s sure. And if Steph or Harden were as bad as Jokic in the most integral defensive positions, sure.  If by “larger” you mean 10x more then you’re just wrong. If you gave me Paul George with Rudy Gobert or Giannis type defensive impact, he’s one of the greatest players ever"
Paul George wasn’t a good passer when he came into the league either
"I've seen a lot of people use this line of thinking, but even if they could package Wiseman and picks for a borderline All-Star, you're still banking on Klay coming back at anywhere near full health to have a legit shot at making the Finals again. I mean, I guess it's probably worth it, but you're betting against the odds. The dude hasn't played in two years.   As crazy as it might seem, the smart move would probably be to try to trade Steph in the off-season for a Paul George-like package then go into full rebuild mode. At this point, the Warriors owe Steph the chance to compete for another championship while he can still play at a high level, even if it's with another team."
Starting on this Warriors team ain’t saying much bruv. And I consider those guys all slight positives. Kuzma a dead neutral. They looked a mess without their leaders. If they were more than slights that wouldn’t be the case.   Any trade can be scary. Scared money don’t make money my guy. Know what else gets you unemployed ? Putting the worst offense ever next to a generational player. Say the Clippers flame out and Kawhi walks. Paul George is another name I’d go after and the Clips would want to recoup some of that lost draft capital for sure. There’s going to be options for them if they want it. And they should.   And Kawhi wasn’t DPOY anymore by then let’s be honest. And he doesn’t match Steph’s impact individually who as of today leads the league in Wins added per RPM. Raptors made moves around Kawhi to give themselves a chance and that what got them there.   Basically what you’re telling me is you’d be hesitant to go for a win now trade to help Steph cause you don’t think anyone helps them. So you want them to hold onto a player that you don’t seem to think is very good. That’s just backwards thinking imo.
"Talent is too obscure of a concept. I think you’d need a clear definition, what you’re talking about seems more like skill. But either way watch Paul George on an off night and it looks anything but smooth. I’d give Kawhi the nod because consistency in using those talents/skills should matter."
"Yeah that’s accurate that it’s rare, especially if you win rookie of the year. It’s also only been around since 1986. The superstar winners would probably be Tracy McGrady, Kevin Love, Paul George, Jimmy Butler and Giannis."
"Just for the record and all, those CotY and EotY awards were complete nonsense.  Bird took over a Pacer team that had won 50+ games repeatedly, but struggled to 39 for one season due to injury.  They then won 58 with the same roster, and Bird was given CotY apparently for keeping his players healthy -- no one without his reputation and name wins that.  The EotY was apparently for taking the 37-45 2010-11 Pacers and turning them into the 42-24 2011-12 Pacers.  I guess hiring Frank Vogel was smart, but other guys have done that, too, and Vogel is not exactly Phil Jackson.  He did draft Paul George at #10, but he was unremarkable until years later.  He also drafted Kawhi Leonard at #15, but traded him and Davis Bertans for George Hill -- which didn't look too terrible at the time, but is, ahem, highly questionable today.  [This](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/2012_transactions.html), is Executive of the Year material?"
Lol clearly didn’t watch that season. He won 56 games and finished 2nd in the west with Dwight out 41 games. Did you watch the playoffs? Using raw stats it’s clearly James setting up Dwight constantly and getting east buckets. 16 a game is an extremely weak 2nd option. That’s what Oladipo put up on the “trash” 16-17 aways you okc fans always go on about it. So what is it? Dwight wasn’t trash but Oladipo was.  And once again you don’t know your basketball history and are confusing years. Harden beat Russ in ‘17. Russ has never even been good enough to get smacked in the 2nd round by an old man Manu because he couldn’t get out of the 1st even with All NBA Paul George.  Keep the mental gymnastics going buddy.
"Best case is Kawhi or KAT (Embiid/Giannis aren’t realistic options anymore lol), but KAT would require a 3rd team to take Wiggins (I doubt Minny wants him back, even reformed Wiggs). Kawhi however may not even cost the 4th pick as it would be a S&amp;T and the Clips would be a happy to get anything in return. Those are the main two that make the Dubs a true contender even with a recovering Klay.  Paul George could also be an option, if Kawhi leaves (not to the Warriors) or demands a roster shake up.  Agreed on Beal, I think he’s not a bad idea, but he doesn’t fit that well, and if Klay’s defense has fallen off we would have defensive issues at 1,2, and 3. However, like you said, if Klay is 90% and still a great defender, Beal can also be a piece that puts us over the top.  I think they end up keeping the pick if none of those guys become available. We gotta also factor in losing Wiggins in any trade the 4 pick pulls (unless we re-sign Oubre basically all our contracts are &lt;5M). The 4th pick can be Sugg/Green off the bench, which would definitely help their bench scoring issues."
"That sequence was so amazing, I think it demonstrated how underrated by the casual fan Luka's defense is. Luka while not a good defender is definitely a positive defender. But some people acting like he can't defend for his life. He's really good at defending guys like Paul George, Jimmy butler, he can actually bother guys like these, Guards most of the time can take advantage of him becouse of the speed, but he can usually shift his feet to force his body, and disrupt the guard, but i mean he can't guard bigs lol, maybe he can hold him down for a second or two so they can double him."
yeah and its dumb that ppl put no expectations on dame to start winning but paul george gets expectations to win with his first year on a new team
"Yeah and they should not do that because neither Dame nor PG is a choker historically just because they lost a playoff series to a team that played better  PG loses to the Thunder on a buzzer beater and the Nuggets in a bad series and the majority of fans magically forget about him being ridiculously clutch with the Pacers  Dame beats the Thunder on a buzzer beater and the majority of fans magically forget about him being pretty bad against the AD Pelicans, among other Trail Blazer playoff exits  My point is just that that's hypocritical from the majority of fans and I think it was silly for OP to use Paul George as an example of a choker bc its a pretty blatant misremembering of history"
"Getting annoyed by everyone using Paul George as an example of a playoff choker when he was terrific on the Pacers lol, people could label someone like Dame as a ""playoff choker"" using the same criteria people use to call PG one  Also Kyrie is good at basketball he smoked us tonight"
"Yall doubting, but he's not gonna stay if Paul George flops in the playoffs again"
"A shitty version of Paul George you have in your garage collecting dust cause you keep telling your wife you’ll clean it, but you never do."
"What about him screams top 5? The fact that, like you said, he is in the Paul George tier, top 15ish player, and is only 23.  I’m guessing you probably thought Kyz was better too  Lakers fans."
It will be Paul George as soon as his bum ass retires
Paul George in 10 years
"Literally no idea how anyone can see a top 5 level player in Tatum. Dude is so miserably overrated. And I’m a lakers fan, get it straight.   Second, on a per minute basis, guess what? They score the exact same amount except one does it more efficiently. Tatum is so ridiculously overrated it’s laughable. Tatum is that same tier imo of Paul George level player. What about hun screams top 5/mvp level player?"
"Brown is a much, much worse defender lol. Tatum is a pretty neutral defender in total this year based on the COVID time, but outside of that he has been elite.  Brown has been a huge negative on that end. Not only has he continued being bad off ball, but based on his newly found large offensive load, he has also been a bad on ball defender.  Tatum has defense, playmaking, rebounding is a wash, and if you ask any Celtic fan that actually **watches** the games, they will say Tatum is the better scorer. They are pretty even efficiency wise, with Brown having the slight edge, but Tatum having the edge on actual points scored. Statistically, for the season Brown has a solid edge efficiency wise but he has been like a 47/38/75 guy outside of that incredible insane start, which, tho he is still great, is not his normal self.  And yes, he is exactly what you call older in potential upside. He is not only literally older in age, but Tatum has MVP/Top 5 Player in the league potential. Browns ceiling is a Paul George level player.   Can’t really expect a New Orleans fan to know anything tho."
In all honesty a large majority of us were very salty/irritated about the outcome of the series and i think a lot of us kind of put that into Joe. He turned our star player into a role player by the end of that series and a lot of us kind of were embarrassed that it was done by this dude with a math tutor meme. As the hurt wore off and with Paul george leaving the thunder dry most of us joined the team Joe is awesome/continue to meme PG train.
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."
Paul George is somehow overrated and underrated.
"I'd consider him a plus defender, but he's not a lockdown guy at his age. A couple years ago he was VERY good, shutting down Paul George in the playoffs. His IQ is off the charts with positioning and just getting into the other player's head. He's big enough that it's hard to shoot over him as well."
"the paul george pacers only played the cavaliers once. after he came back from his leg injury they lost to us(the 2016 raptors) in seven games, and then in 2017 got swept by the cavaliers (by a 4ppg margin no less iirc)"
Paul George got the goat hairline
"Watch this clip again. How much more throwing his arms around is necessary? Last game Paul George full speed jump body slammed him to the ground.   This bullshit reasoning that Embiid sells it better when Jokic 1) gets criticized for flopping and 2) Jokic literally gets hacked to shit and thrown to the ground, is utterly absurd"
"Paul George 360 dunk when the commentator goes “OH BAYBE, PG”"
Paul George is an underrated one. Dwight and Blake like cmon how could you forget those two
"Yeah, having a front office that passed on Paul George, Kemba, Giannis, Klay, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell definitely didn't help."
"Well definitely the Heat, like you said, but also league direction had a lot to do with it.  Hibbert was an all-star and arguably their best player in 11-12 and 13-14, but immobile centers were already starting to be limited to only what they could do. Unfortunately for the Pacers, Hibbert wasn’t a great offensive player and his defense was starting to fall off as the floor was getting more and more spaced out.  Granger was always hurt and couldn’t contribute like he had in the past.   David West was still a great player, but was moving on from fringe all-star to quality starter/high end role player.  Hill and Stephenson were wildly inconsistent from what I remember.   Paul George was just starting to come into his own, but by the time he was even close to the player he is now his supporting cast was starting to slide off.  That was most of their team, and I don’t really remember the state of their bench too well. But like you said, the Heat certainly didn’t make anything easier for them."
"Not counting extensions, I think Paul george with OKC is the last one"
"And KD, Paul George, Bradley Beal.."
"Paul george, dame, and KD definitely did. Cant find anything from the others though. They've praised him a ton, but cant find anything from them where they said jrue was the best defender"
"&gt; Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre.  Is that enough for you, or do you know better than NBA players?"
"I think the casual take would be thinking Guard defense is just as valuable as offense. The James Hardens the world get paid and built around not the Tony Allen’s. There’s a certain level of offense that’s more valuable than 2-way dominance. Steph Curry is the most efficient volume scorer to ever exist and warps defenses as much as anybody. That’s more valuable than what 2-way demons like Paul George have to offer. You’re never going to take Giannis over let’s say 2nd-stint Cleveland Lebron, MVP Steph, OKC KD. Also calling Steph Curry only a top 30 player ever is just straight up disrespectful and clear hating idek why I responded to u."
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre"
I don’t think you can say that for sure about Paul George. He stayed with okc that first year but then left cause no one wants to play with Westbrook and lose in the first round over and over. In Boston he likely would’ve seen much more success with the roster they had. I mean they made 2 ecfs without him.
"Paul George also would've bolted for LA at the first opportunity.  Honestly, the only player I'm mad that we missed out on is Jimmy, because he doesn't seem to be obsessed with living in NY or LA, he just wanted a winning situation."
Dipo was the 2nd overall pick but was meh  Sabonis was already decent but who would have known Sabonis would have broken out like this? In fact he didn't even really break out into all star status until after Dipo went down. We may have very well lived without realizing Sabonis true potential.  Also its Paul George. OKC was itching for a KD replacement and wanted to win now
"He was 2nd/3rd option in Orl. He's 4th option in Den. When all you're doing is catching dimes in the paint from Joker vs trying to be Paul George on the Magic, it's easy to see the major increase in FG%."
"We still waiting on that dude  If Beal demands a trade in the next year maybe he’s it, but the fit is really awkward there.  If KAT does he’d definitely make them a contender, but the Wolves taking back their own pick, a player they passed in drafting and Wiggins, plus whatever else for KAT is hilarious to me.  Other than that, I’m not sure who else is in a position to demand a trade anytime soon. Obviously some of these come out of nowhere and Tatum could demand out next offseason, but KAT/Beal are the only guys in and situations that could (and both have expressed intentions to stay).  The only other possibility is a Kawhi S&amp;T or Paul George if Kawhi leaves. But that’s only if the Clippers flame out again, and even then it’s unlikely."
George Paul
Back when the league was fun. Sad to see all the people in there hyping up the KD/Russ/Dipo core   Could have traded for Paul George in that timeline as well
Half of those guys haven't lead a team to even as close as paul george has or even play half as good his defense
You clearly don't watch the Nuggets   1. You didn't see Paul George superman into Jokic in the LAC / DEN game  2. You didn't see the Terrence Ross hacks  3. You think the Nuggets are losing because they're down 18 in the first half
Paul George is better than Simmons tho  Even before the slump
Paul George is 31 year old in 2 months and has like 6 major surgeries
"Okay, so if youre waiting for the Warriors to be handed an all star, thats probably not gonna happen.   Trading for stars isn't meant to be some slam dunk thing, they're risky moves by nature.  The Wolves stuck their neck out trading for Jimmy Butler, the Thunder when they traded for Paul George, the Celtics trading for Kyrie , Philly trading for Butler, etc etc"
"Paul George was *literally* traded, so no."
"Lebron, simmons, westbrook, harden, paul george"
"His handle isn’t good. That’s legit what he’s missing. Look at DeRozan, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Kawhi etc when they developed their handle, it makes all the difference in the world."
"I’d easily take butler over Paul George, and I think the clippers would too"
Facts even Paul George has said how Jrue is his toughest matchup and you’re right it’s never forced.
"Paul Arizin was the truth, he would drop 30 in any era, and George Mikan is the original big man."
"I upvoted, but I think people are much too quick to assume that picks traded by good teams will turn into late first round picks.   Everyone was confidently claiming that OKC's pics from Houston would be late first rounders, and then Houston blew it up to rebuild. And now the Clippers only have Kawai and Paul George for the next couple of years, meanwhile their picks go out to 2026.  Things change, and it's always a game of probabilities, which front offices know, which is why they put pick protections on picks even if they have no idea whether they'll be needed."
"Paul George went to his barber and said ""give me the KCP"""
"Why don't you just get an AD, Harden, or Paul George to ask to be traded to your team like other franchises? /s"
"Take a look at this and tell me you can argue it? Alright?   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Chris Paul &amp; NBA All-Stars on Jrue Holiday | Best Defender In The NBA](https://youtu.be/-CzZZ-ohpFQ)  Let me know when all these players have said how good Bogi is and that he’s there toughest matchup.  Add Paul George &amp; Kelly Oubre to that list too, who weren’t featured in that specific video but had said so anyways."
"No, I copy pasted his post below:  Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v. Giannis 2012: AD v Draymond 2011: Kyrie v Kawhi 2010: John Wall v Paul George  I’d take the 10th pick in 2018, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010.   2015 is a wash"

Youre right they went up 3-1 against the warriors and lost bc of Westbrook. Y'all goofy. Now Paul George is a playoff beast? Come on son.
"Probably an american/western biased measurement of popularity, but here are the most followed nba players on instagram: (in millions) ([https://www.dunkest.com/en/nba/news/33213/most-followed-nba-players-instagram](https://www.dunkest.com/en/nba/news/33213/most-followed-nba-players-instagram))  1.

"I'm glad we did not see much more than a bit of blood, I had a hard time stomaching the Paul George or Gordon Hayward injury.   Horrible injury, I hope he recovers from that."
The bubble helped Paul George get fully healthy from his shoulder injuries.
"Watching Westbrook get bounced out of the first round with Paul George TWICE, and now possibly not even making the playoffs in the Eastern Conference (weakest division) alongside Bradley Beal doesn’t answer this question for you?"
I’m going to still sound ignorant but I won’t believe in the Clippers until they get it done in the playoffs. Paul George has slumped in the playoffs for 3 straight years so it starts with him. If he performs how he does in the regular season they should make the WCF at least.   They have nothing to show for in the post season that would help me out. It’s like people forget that the playoffs are a whole different ball game then the regular season.
"Bullshit. They didn't have a primary playmaker, and Kawhi and Paul George aren't leaders. I don't care how badly they want to try against LeBron James, they weren't mentally tough enough to beat LeBron 4 times in 7 games last year. They couldn't even close out the Nuggets."
Nice try Paul George.
"I mean if KD stays healthy that’s what the Warriors do anyway.  I don’t get this argument, because it’s obvious. You aren’t wrong, but it just isn’t saying much. You could replace them with Paul George or Jimmy Butler, both vastly worse than Harden/KD and those Dubs still likely 3-peat"
They took the best version of the Cavs to 7 and lost in the last minute. Harrison Barnes to Paul George absolutely is enough lol
I don’t think he’s anywhere near as good as KD or Harden  I’m just saying if the 73-9 Warriors added Paul George they still likely win 2 of the next 3 chips like they did lol
"Paul George played in OKC, with Westbrook, same as KD. How'd that work out?"
"Well, give Paul George or Jimmy Butler those Warriors and they win too.  I don’t see that as much of an argument lol"
"Curry is number 15 in 3P% with the most 3PA, and only one player with 350+ attempts is ahead of him in 3P% (Paul George)"
Paul George tho
"That was SO dirty, everytime I see it I fear that Livingston injures himself like Paul George (open fracture)."
"My prediction  &amp;#x200B;  1st - Harden, Lillard/Curry, Leonard, Giannis, Jokic  2nd - Luka, Lillard/Curry, James, Randle, Embiid  3rd - Mitchell, Booker/Paul/Kyrie, Tatum, Butler, Gobert.     Missed the cut, George (If he continues to play as he played on his last games, I'll consider him on 3rd team for Butler), Zion (He's a freak of nature but they are losing), Durant (He played few games this season), Westbrook or Beal (There are so many guards to consider, their record is also a factor)"
"You do know that 3.4% is a pretty big gap right? 58.2% TS is Paul George in the RS level good while 54.8% TS is solidly below average.  Not to mention that's 1 less assist with 0.4 more TOs. 0.4 isn't significant in itself but combined with the assist decrease you can see that teams trap Dame hard in the playoffs and he still gets slowed down a lot by it, causing mistakes."
Ok Paul George
I am a suns fan and I approve this message. Healthy lakers still favored causes I trust lebron much more than Paul George. But we don’t have that much more time left and the lakers are not completely healthy yet. The clippers are very good and can’t be counted off
"So it's a bad shot, but he made it.  Paul George is this you?"
My counter to that is given that roster do you think any other coach would have gotten y’all out of the first round? Let’s also not forget he took a lebron cavs team to game 7 the year after Paul George left (when everybody and they mama thought you’d be fighting for first overall pick)
"No reverse jinx here. Last year's team was so dominant that I had no doubt they'd win it all. If by miracle, this year's team wins it all, they'd be the worst Laker championship team ever. You guys look so much better this year, now I will admit I'm still a bit hesitant on Paul George, but you guys reshaped your roster to cover for him if he doesn't perform. Plus you got Rondo who will just tear up the playoffs."
Imagine thinking Dame is more impactful than Paul George.
"Westbrook was a year past being the MVP and Paul George just finished top 3 in MVP. But yeah, sure, I bet FVV and Siakams trade value were way higher than that!"
Monta Ellis Paul George
"It literally says this in the article:   “Before sending Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers in a shocking deal, the Oklahoma City Thunder reportedly held talks with the Toronto Raptors focused on George and Russell Westbrook.”  “According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Thunder general manager Sam Presti offered George and Westbrook to Toronto for a package centered around forward Pascal Siakam, but the Raptors declined the offer.”"
Did Paul George really underperform that much? Yeah he was bad but nobody expected him to be good. I’d say Kawhi underperformed more compared to his 2019 run.
"Did you even read the article?   &gt; Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  &gt;for Paul George.  Just delete this post bro."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html  It was both based on a report from Adrian Wojnarowski
"The Love trade made sense at the time, his Minnesota stats were insane, but this is definitely true. He was beyond useless in the playoffs for them. If they had traded Wiggins for another star, then they would have been in a much stronger position.   There really wasn’t any other trades to be made though. You could go for Carmelo, but that would have been worse than Love. Probably could get Paul George, but he was coming off a horrific broken leg. Bulls wouldn’t trade Rose because they would have expected him to come back at a superstar level. Everyone else that would have been available, you would just choose to keep Wiggins over at the time. Very unfortunate for them that Love was all that was out on the market that year."
That was the OKC asking price for *just Paul George*: https://twitter.com/bruce_arthur/status/1147597746980970496  and somehow they still did better
"Sorry I made a post about this already. Yes Paul George is an all star. But he is not even close to consistency to KD, LeBron, Steph and even Kawhi. He goes broke from shooting over 30% of the time in playoff series.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtwk7i/of\_games\_in\_playoffs\_with\_40\_or\_under\_efg\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtwk7i/of_games_in_playoffs_with_40_or_under_efg_in/)"
I agree with that. Paul George also is very inconsistent as I noted in another post.
I mean Paul George is significantly better than both lol
"&gt; Just ask Paul George,   Top 3 MVP candidate OKC Paul George?"
"I mean the Clippers were affected because CP3 saw that they had no shot against the Curry KD Warriors and chose to move to Houston to team up with Harden at least partially because that was one of the only ways to create a team that might be at the Warriors level. And this is really the big trickle down effect of no KD in Golden State.  If CP3 stays with the Clippers and they run it back with Blake why couldn't they beat the Spurs and the Rockets? They already beat the Spurs in 2015 and were an epic choke job in Game 6 away from beating the Rockets too so it's not like that was some insurmountable task either. No CP3 on the Rockets mean they never reach the heights of 2018 either and probably plateau at their 2015 and 2017 levels.  With the Spurs you have to account for the fact that Kawhi's injury happened against the Warriors in the WCF. This is kinda butterfly theory, but without KD there, that series goes differently and maybe Kawhi doesn't get injured. So if you believe his side of the story (that he left because he thought the Spurs doctors didn't value his health), then his reason for leaving dissappears too.  For the Jazz, maybe without the depressing thought of having to face the Warriors every year, Hayward stays in 2017 (and also since he's not in Boston, he dodges that freak ankle injury that hobbled him for a couple of years). They had already drafted Mitchell before Hayward left anyway so that team suddenly becomes really spicy too.  The Blazers made the WCF in 2019 so they were already pretty close at least one year to making it. Plus with no KD in Golden State maybe they swing for the fences more and trade a package of CJ + other assets for Paul George, Jimmy Butler, or Kawhi to try and make a run (similar to how the Raptors did).  And for what it's worth, the Wolves were 3rd in the West in 2018 before Jimmy was injured for like a month (behind only Golden State and Houston). With no KD in Golden State and potentially no CP3 in Houston, they're suddenly really close to being at the top of the West. And sure Jimmy probably still gets frustrated by KAT and Wiggins' immaturity, but at the same time they probably respond better to what Jimmy wants from them if they're that close to contending"
"I love how Thunder fans are the battered wives of the NBA.   A decade ago, their franchise had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  Their brilliant front office loses Harden then Durant.   The Thunder fans are left with the very least of the three.  Yet here they still are, defending Russell like hes going to come back to them and once again lead them to a sixth seed and first round exit.  Russell Westbrook is incapable of playing with another great player and making them better.  Just ask Paul George, or Kevin Durant or James Harden.     I guess you weren't a fan of the Thunder way back in 2019.  You should look up Oklahoma City and their lone playoff series from that year.  You can tell me some more about Westbrook being better than Lillard."
"Gobert probably is the MVP of the Jazz this year but there have definitely been a number of national media guys asking why Mitchell was not getting MVP consideration as the best player on the team with the best record. If that same stuff was happening for Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons then that would really hurt the cases for Jokic and Embiid.   You don't hear Kawhi and CP3 getting MVP buzz for this same reason, because Paul George and Devin Booker can make the case that they've been more important to their team's success this year. It might be a minority of people who think that, but it's enough to knock them out of the MVP race. Like I said above, the same thing happened when Steph and KD were teammates.   There's just a big difference between how clear it is that Jokic and Embiid are the MVPs of their teams versus guys like Gobert, Kawhi and CP3 with their teams."
"Honestly surprised I haven't heard Paul George comparisons. Very smooth, very crafty, very confident."
I gotta give it to Paul George. I got really into the NBA because of the Pacers and Paul George was the star of the team at the time.
I don’t understand why Paul George takes so much heat nowadays. He should be considered like a drose for coming back from his broken leg like he has
Randle and Zion and Paul George and Tatum seem to be the obvious choises right now.
"the guys who could beat him (cause of lebron missed time) are zion (bad record), tatum (underwhelming record), butler (missed many games too) and paul george (awesome season)  maybe george could get it"
Paul George has easily been better than Tatum this year
"Love paul george. He definitely doesn't get the respect he deserves. Elite defender and scorer. Took lebron, wade, and bosh to game 7. With roy hibbert as his 2nd best teammate"
Paul George or Josh Smith
"Player A, because Player B is Paul Pierce.  I don’t even care that Player A is Paul George. Paul George may shit himself on the court in the playoffs, but at least it’s not literally."
"you’re right, he wasn’t the only problem. the pacers fo are content on being competitive enough to make the playoffs, but with no gameplan on how to advance past the first round. iirc, they haven’t since paul george left. the year oladipo went ballistic, and pushed lebron &amp; co. to the edge, they weren’t expected whatsoever to win that series.   yea, injuries played apart in falling short; but so did not having top end talent to truly compete. not having the best player in a respective series will have you falling short more often than none. mcmillan isn’t no tactical savant by any means, but even if he was; there wasn’t much he could’ve done even if the roster was healthy in indy. nate has proven that he can get the most out of a team via effort, leadership etc. which is barely half the battle in the chess match that is playoff basketball.   the nba coaching world is cutthroat, it’s a lot of blame with very little praise at times. a lot of fans lose sight of the fact that’s, there’s only so few positions to be held in coaching. an organization’s outlook can change in a blink of an eye, which in most cases would put a hc out of a job. it’s the nature of the business, you might be right for the job in year 1-3 of our development; but in year 4-6 of our transitional phase from developing to competing; someone with a higher acumen is required to get the job done. pierce was just out of his depth as they transitioned."

"Ad sitting out, lebron out, harden out, klay out, Trae out, lamello out, Jamal Murry out, embid played less games than lebron despite lebron being out for 4 weeks, Ben Simmons out, Lonzo out, wym other players are banged up and we not noticing?  Kawhi and Paul George loading managing.  Pat bev is out.  The spurs just got fined for sitting players and Toronto sat practically every single one of their starters last week.  When asked about it the coach pretty much said ""yeah idk why Kyle Lowry isn't playing.  I think he's tired.""    You're dumb af lol"
"Yup, r/NBA where everyone loves Paul George"
"But if the Clippers lost in the first or second round, it's possible Kawhi again may make some crazy demands of the Clippers before re-signing. Like if he suddenly thinks he'd be better off with some other player instead of Paul George for a teammate, maybe he makes the Clippers trade PG before re-signing. We've already seen that Kawhi forcing the Clippers front office to do what he wants has been pretty disastrous ([never forget exactly how much he made them give up to get PG](https://i.redd.it/gablumavxti51.jpg)), so him interfering again could really destroy their chances going forward the way Harden making Houston trade for Westbrook killed the Rockets."
"I think he's somebody that you can't rely on in the playoffs, and yes I know he led his Pacers two back-to-back Conference Finals back in the day, and I didn't believe in him as a superstar then, but ever since he called himself ""Playoff p"" smh, and I said this at the time but Kawhi Leonard would have been better off staying in Toronto or going down to Miami to team with Jimmy Butler, maybe Paul George will prove me wrong in the playoffs this year but I'm not putting any money on it         ( and I know that Kawhi Leonard played like garbage in game seven against the Nuggets but his overall track record still works for me)"
"It depends on how they lose, this came up on another thread earlier today but if Paul George stinks it up in the playoffs again don't be surprised if they try to field some offers to trade him outside of that , nothing much else they can do"
"I don’t think anyone is arguing the injury man. People are just tired of Dame not getting the same criticism that other stars get. He hasn’t gotten shit on by the media in his career like Harden, Russ, Paul George, etc have gotten"
They really dont. Think most Pacer fans have realized that in the Post Paul George era they were at best one extremely competitive/amazing series from reaching the second round as their final ceiling.
Anyone else remember a few weeks ago when this guy had a Portland flair and was trash talking Dame and talking about how he was worse than Paul George and whatever
ugh can we not? just leave paul george alone
"you don’t think paul george made this video, do you?"
"Elvin Hayes, Marques Johnson, Rick Barry, Chris Bosh, George Gervin, Paul Arizin, Lenny Wilkins, Hal Greer, Dave DeBusschere"
"Westbrook, Wall, Rose, Curry, Paul George are really fun players to watch"
"LeBron, Curry, Harden, Durant, Embiid, Luka, Davis, Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic in no particular order you’d easily prefer on your team than Beal. I like Beal but he’s not a top 10 player. I’m not confident he’s even in the top 15. Dame, Chris Paul, Butler, Kyrie. For another guy I’m kinda running into people I’d want about the same amount as him Westbrook, Beal, Mitchell, Paul George. So he’s somewhere in the 11-17 range."
Paul George
Where the Paul George haters at??? All they have is “Do it in the playoffs”
If Paul George plays like he played in the first round last year I wouldn't be surprised to see either one of those two scenarios play out lol
Over/Under 50 Paul George backboard jokes what are you taking
Joe Ingles and Paul George
I know you aren't the one I replied to but then what's the point of bringing up Paul George negatively?
"dang, add George Hill as a backup PG, and you can have a lineup of Chris Paul George Hill"
"Thanks Paul George. Really inspiring how you played sick against the Sixers the last time anyone heard from Ben. No reason, but do you know when you started to feel better?  Also random thought, having nothing to do with anything I just wrote, but NBA maybe COVID isn't the only illness players should be forced to sit if they have?"
I hope you didn't just compare Paul George to Kevin Durant...
Paul George was doing the same earlier this season.   There's alot more to basketball than Scoring.
"Im pretty sure they'd consider Paul George a forward, all 5 of his all-nba selections have come as a forward"
"I'd have to look at their competition to compare cases, but you just pointed two examples in a 23-year span, which tells me it isn't a common thing. We know Steph, Dame, and Luka are locks for the top three spots; decide what you wanna do with Harden and the other candidates from there. (Important: does Paul George count as a guard?)"
"Nostalgia aside, it’s EASILY Paul George"
"i take prime paul george over prime carmelo to build a team around   carmelo doesnt play defence and is a much more selfish player, as seen by how he pushed jeremy lin out of the 2012 knicks lol"
Paul George is a similar scorer to Melo and has more off ball game tho
Considering a young PG before his prime beat peak Melo in the 2013 Pacers-Knicks series I’d take peak Paul George. Though from what I remember Hibbert was the MVP of that series
The answer is obvious. Paul George plays D while Carmelo doesn't.
"Mikal, Williams, and Barrett are the next Gen Kawhi, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler."
Top 10 playoff shot of all time. Right over Paul George too
"Paul George, how are you?"
"He probably would have been near that level when he played. But today, that would probably get difficult. You've got Steph, Harden, Kyrie, Westbrook, LaVine, Beal, Paul George, Lillard, Trae, as other candidates already"
"Simmons can, Bam can.   There are also all those swing defenders like Kawhi, Paul George, Butler, Draymond, etc who can switch and defend 1-4.  I would agree Jrue is definitely in the conversation for top 3 guards and probably a favorite, but he's not a lock and Simmons is the only guard that is anywhere near the impact of those DPOY type players."
"Possible candidates are khris Middleton or paul George if they underperform in the playoffs, brandon Ingram, Fred vanvleet, Michael porter jr."
Paul George in shambles
"Not from what I've seen. It' 2 players, maybe Durant. But are we going to now just assume everyone knows who Paul George and Damian Lillard are?"
Gobert is better than Paul George?
"Well for one how bout the fact he's played 22 games in a 72 game season. There was a lot of talk about Davis carrying the Lakers to allow Lebron to rest and it turned out the exact opposite.  He came into the year with him and Vogel saying he was going to bring his 3pt attempts up to around 6, he's at 2.5 per game at a pretty much career low .293 excluding years he really didn't shoot any. By all metrics he's had a pretty shitty year with numerous games where he's been outplayed by mid level guys even in wins. If he hadn't won a chip and his name was Paul George or James Harden he'd be getting absolutely killed in the media.  He's just ruined my fantasy team and made me further consider why I even play it every year."
Paul George?
"""that's a bad shot""  -Paul ""ChaseYoungHTTR"" George"
"Ya Barkley seems like a genuinely good guy, I’ve met Rodman a couple times he’s an a hole and we all know about Paul George and doc’s daughter and PG’s slander after doc was fired those two are much more deserving imo."
Why Barkley? I would also add Paul George or Dennis Rodman
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
paul george off the side of the backboard?
Paul George is up there in terms of motion finesse.
Paul George has always been an inconsistent playoff performer just look at his career playoff game log
OKC flipped him and rookie Sabonis (yeah he looked good as a rookie but he didn't look that great) into Paul George. I wouldn't call that a give up
Right but Westbrook lost in the first round with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony against a rookie in Donovan Mitchell who was sitting classes 10 months in school 10 months earlier
"KD, Paul George, and Harden all had the choice of moving forward with Russ, or moving on... and all three chose to move on. Can you think of any other top player that has had three MVP level teammates that good who decided it was best to play elsewhere?"
Paul George is making the HoF
"Paul George, Kyrie, jalen Brunson"
"im a hater, and while he stinks up the court sometimes, paul george without a doubt has one of the smoothest, most beautiful games out of everyone. This dude flows like water when hes on. He torched us in the reg season in 2018, and made it look effortless. its the same energy as watching calligraphy or ice skating. precision, control, touch."
Underrated picks:  CJ McCollum Paul George Jayson Tatum
Paul George ending bruh
"Paul George. When he is on fire, he makes it look so easy. That game-winning floater against Utah in 2OT when he was in OKC was so smooth"
"&gt;HOF teammates  He started to do this after KD left OKC and he had no another star players around him. Guys like Bradley Beal, Paul George, Melo in that last season with OKC aren't HOF players and he was doing it with them too."
"Hawks fans will forever deny the fact that Nate McMillan had Gary Payton, Ray Allen, LaMarcus Aldridge, Zach Randolph, Brandon Roy, Rashard Lewis, and Paul George on his teams and was 17-36 in the playoffs with all of them in their primes."
Can't wait to waive goodbye to Paul George in 1st round.
Paul George is better than jimmy though
no it’s because paul george
"That was a specific person. Anti-Jaylen-ism has outed a loooot of people who don't watch the games (when he's been a quality player since 2018, and was a beloved prospect in 2017), he's such a great wing on both ends, his shooting has improved, he embarrassed Siakam defensively in the 20 ECSF and he's a fun dunker. His breakout in the mainstream exposed people like Bill Simmons, who still thought of him as a blank Paul George asset and not a future All Star. I'm not saying if you're anti-Jaylen, you're a doomer Celtics fan, but a loooooot of the doomer celtics fans hate Jaylen and think we should've dealt him for _insert 20ppg scorer_"
"Says you. OKC until this season was consistently a playoff team and overachieved expectations from the beginning. And has a relationship with their city that not many teams have. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Derek Fisher, Victor Oladipo are just some of the names that have complimented the atmosphere with the team and how professional Presti is with them."
"No. Kawhi hasn’t been clutch for 2 years (his entire tenure with the Clippers, obviously was in Toronto). And Paul George is yk"
not dissing Siakam at all but there is zero chance he ever reaches westbrook/paul george levels. those guys are hall of fame locks.   WB 1x MVP 2x Scoring leader 3x Assist leader 9x all NBA 9x All Star   PG 5x All NBA 7x All Star 1x Steal leader   Siakam 1x Allstar 1x All NBA 1x Champion.   The Raptors championship window is closed. Clippers are in contention for a ship. the wizards aren’t winning a ship but WBs accolades will always be ahead of siakam. Pascal can maybe return to 2nd team all NBA levels but i believe we’ve seen his ceiling as a player as this time. this is just my opinion and i could be wrong obv.
Paul George just signed a 5 year extension...
"no they didnt. actually their inability to develop anyone alongside durant/westbrook and wesetbrook/paul george was their demise. They hit on three of their stars players early in the draft and then basically never developed any legit talent. their best player was steven adams, a mediocre center. Roberson was never a great player and consistently cost them in the playoffs. They couldnt unlock oladipo when he was on the thunder.   Yall wanna blame big markets the reality is presti put together an actually terrible team for the modern game year of year and it cost his teams despite the elite star talent he had."
Because he played his prime years with Kobe lol he’s not gonna be the best SG in the league compared to now where Bradley Beal and Paul George are Harden’s main competition at the SG slot  Also it’s stupid to write rings off as a team accomplishment. Wade did a hell of a lot for those rings he wasn’t just some benchwarmer that tagged along. In 2006 I would go as far as to say he carried the heat in that finals comeback
The Paul George episode alone would be must watch TV.
"""George Paul"""
"Tatum is the most overrated player based on potential it’s not even funny. People are crowning him so much before he’s even a true superstar/MVP caliber player that it’s fuckin ridiculous   He’s a great prospect as a big wing who can sort of do it all (Paul George type build), but he still hasn’t accomplished shit as a superstar so comparing him to Larry Fucking Bird is ridiculous"
Marquese chriss Paul George Karl malone
"Prior to Lebron deciding to sign with the Lakers, it was Paul George. Everyone was talking about how Paul George was gonna make his way to Lakers one way or another and that would jumpstart the next era of contention for the team. So while yes they were ridiculed for not landing good FA during their rebuilding seasons (warranted after burning all that money on Deng/Mosgov) they were still in rumors about landing the next big name. And they end up getting the biggest name of the last 15 years without really having to do any work."
"And it’s not like OKC screws over all their vets in the process of rebuilding. We don’t just send them to where there is most value for the organization, they communicate with the players about the future.   Sam Presti has been known to treat his star players pretty well and sends them to good situations if they ever want to be traded. He managed to get Paul George to sign a long term deal (even if he eventually wanted to leave). I don’t think there are many players, outside of KD and Reggie Jackson, who has talked down on the organization. It’s just that it’s Oklahoma City unfortunately."
"The Thunders would be really good.   Ep 1: Okla-Home-A: the Thunder is born and the team comes to OKC for the first time with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in tow. Shows some background on what happened with Seattle  Ep. 2: The Thunder Rolls: Drafting Harden, and covers the challenge to LA in 2010, taking Dallas to the WCF, and going to the Finals in 2012.   Ep 3: When it Rains, it Pours: Covers the Harden trade post 2012 Finals, the Westbrook injury in 2013, and the tough 2015 season.   Ep 4: You the Real MVP: Covers Durant’s 2014 MVP season and his impact on the city.   Ep 5: New Beginnings: Covers the hire of Billy Donovan and the departure of Kevin Durant in 2016  Ep 6: The Brodie: Episode goes in-depth on Russell Westbrook’s relationship with the city and organization.

Ep: 9: Restructuring: Covers the return of Chris Paul to OKC and his impact. Also covers to arrival of Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Lu Dort, Darius Bazley, and the teams new direction.   Ep 10: A New Storm: Mark Daigneault is hired as the new coach, the team begins its process of tanking to draft in the lottery, and begin their race back to where they once were, trying to bring the organization back full circle where they were a decade ago. Could possibly feature: Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley, or Jonathan Kuminga"
You guys resigned Paul George lmao. That’s a bigger signing than most teams in the league. Presti just did a shit job building around Russ
Paul George 😬
Paul George and Gordon Hayward end up having significantly less Google searches of their names.
It’s definitely not even close to Lebrons. Literally dude had Paul George putting them in a deep hole forcing him to force shots. Put any superstar in that position and they do the same. Also he had only two bad games which Lebron was terrible the whole series in a final.
People legit disrespect jimmy so much. There was a top X list posted recently where someone ranked Paul George above jimmy despite jimmy having been better since his days in Chicago plus literally having had an all time playoffs last year.
Paul George goes off averaging 35 ppg with great efficiency and defense throughout the playoffs to lead the Clippers to their first nba title over the Nets in 6 games
Agreed. Ngl that paul george trade. Absolute dub. Would love for sga to win at least 1 mvp and fmvp. That step back 3 he has developed is deadly
Paul george vs nuggets was probably worse tbh
wait you have Tim Duncan Robinson ahead of Paul George Gervin? can I have some of what you're smoking
Marquese Chris Paul George Gervin
Not really. Reebok has 2 decent bball shoes. The og shaqs that didnt age very well and Iverson's which are on par with grant hill's fila sneaker. Both decent sneakers but nothing that could fuck with nikes catalogue..especially at this point.. kyrie Durant and paul george have better sneakers design wise than the ones you guys are bringing up.  Jordans..Pennys and lebrons are the main 3 tho yet n still as there's groups of people that collect only those sneakers even tho 2 of those guys been retired before mos people buying em was born lol.
This is why paul george is considered a hateable player
Chris Paul George Karl
Paul George is a good one actually.  Hellllll no on Jokic.  I think the Blazers say no on Jimmy because of age.  But PG is actually a good one I could see both sides agree to
"a year of steph or 4 years of paul george, which would you take"
Paul George doesn't have to do anything for me to demand public execution
mavs fans lol let somebody like paul george do this to luka and they will beg for public execution
Chris Paul George coached by Mike Dan Tony
Paul George Hill sounds pretty terrifying honestly
That’s a good point— I probably overrated Chris Paul then. In hindsight Paul George Gervin would probably beat Chris Paul George wouldn’t you say?
"Not impressive, he got the Paul George clutch boost"
Chris Paul George is just a bunch of first names
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
It was a bad team. KD left and they got Paul George a top 15 player and they can’t even get out of the 1st round.
"Pro tip:  if you're playing the clippers, don't let your best player take the shot, give it to whomever has Paul George on them"
Westbrook and Paul George has to be 2018 losing to a jazz team that was led by gobert and rookie Mitchell
Still don’t know what you’re trying to get at. The CP3 team only did so well because we had insane luck with avoiding injuries with CP3 and Gallo.  A healthy PG and Westbrook duo had Paul George in the MVP convo with Russ playing hot right next to him and the Thunder in the 3rd seed at one point IIRC.  Russ and PG had some tough times in the playoffs after KD left I won’t argue that but look at what Russ did in 2016-2017 with a bum roster vs what Curry is doing right now with a slightly better bum squad and tell me with a straight face Russ wasn’t on the same level come on now.
[Exhibit A](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/paul-george-2020-playoffs-stats)  [Exhibit B](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/siakam-2019-playoffs-stats)
Paul George looks like an amish farmer with that beard of his.
Paul George lost his chance at a chip when he left his baby mama and married that stripper
Paul George in playoff form early
"You're missing a lot of context here though.  The warchest was big early in seasons due to Memphis pick and sac pick looking very valuable only to fall due to late runs by both teams.  Alot of the trades involving picks for stars involved trading jaylen or jayson and that still doesn't look wise long term.  We did trade part of our chest for kyrie which people seem to forget. That was a huge trade.  Grant and Romeo haven't had the best seasons but I'm pretty forgiving of that tbh given all the circumstances.  Kembas nagging knee injury meant we were without a point guard for ages.  This is a shit season but we're still a good team.  Have had more days lost to covid than 10 teams combined, ongoing injuries for key players, no off season and no camp for our very young team but we didnt trade for anthony davis or kawhi or paul george who were all LA bound so oh boy let's fire danny ainge or brad Stevens."
"What are you talking about? LeBron was going to go to the Finals whether Kyrie was there or not. He literally won two games without Kyrie or Love the previous year. He nearly won a game after they added KD in 2018.   He didn’t need Kyrie specifically, he needed another scorer. Damian Lillard could’ve done the same thing, or Paul George, or Chris Paul ... you get the idea. Kyrie played well but he didn’t do anything that was irreplaceable."
D. Rose best player on a court with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.
"A healthy SGA and Gallanari &gt;&gt;&gt; Injured Paul George. Dude had surgery on his shoulder right after the season was over for Christ’s sake, and other than that there were no huge moves we made besides trading Grant away because we couldn’t afford him at the time.  You keep coming back to how much better the Russ and PG Thunder were compared to the CP3 Thunder and that’s because of the impact of Russ and PG lol."
Paul George is pretty damn close the hottest player in the league. I’d personally put Giannis over him.
Better question who has the best hairline in basketball?  I think Paul George easily.
"101 offensive rating without Beal on the court this year   After you write off that, I'll show you what it was with Harden, Paul George, and Durant  As long as this sub understands that having a significantly worse impact on team offense than Paul George (it was like 112 vs 104 with the same players in Paul's favor lol) is not the mark of an elite point, we're good. Although it would be better if they understood why. Ultra ball dominant point guards who can't score efficiently or space the floor are not often found on good team offenses, they actually could not be more opposite of team building the correct way."
"Lebron and Davis have been absent for like half the season.  Harden isnt out west anymore, and neither is KD, or Westbrook.   The Blazers have been missing Nurkic and CJ for SIGNIFICANT parts of the season.  The Mavs have been missing Porzingis.  Paul George and Kawhi have been taking turns resting.  The Jazz dont have Mitchell.  Jamal Murray is out for the season.  Unsurprisingly, the top 2 teams in the West are the only ones with non-significant injuries.  Not to mention the fact that this is a shorter season (each game missed means more), and they've introduced play-ins to benefit teams like GSW, New Orleans, and Washington.  &gt; maybe I will change my mind.  Soemthing tells me you wont change your opinion regardless of the information you receive."
"This sub is a complete disgrace to the sport talking about Westbrook anywhere near top 10 all time. Let's just look at how overrated his impact has been this season, as it is every season without fail.  Wizards offense is terrible when Westbrook is on the court without Beal: 101 Offensive Rating. Just like Westbrook caused the Rockets to have their worst O Rating by far in years, having Westbrook was worse than having 60 games of Chris Paul, even though Houston had made other offensive upgrades. Just like Thunder with Paul George on and Westbrook off had elite offense, Westbrook on and George off had a bottom tier offense...  We literally just saw how much worse Rockets got with Westbrook instead of Paul and vice versa. Time and time again this sub proves it can't learn anything about basketball and just reacts to narrative and box score stats. People have been so dumbed down it's incredible. I'm not sure Westbrook has ever even led an average offensive team rating without Durant, Harden, Paul George, or Westbrook on the court with him, and that's not a difficult task. I'm just gonna look up Kyrie, first player that comes to mind as someone better than Westbrook but this sub is too dumb to understand.  Nets this year with Kyrie on, without Harden or Durant: 117 Team Offensive Rating  Wizards this year with Westbrook on, without Beal: 101 Team Offensive Rating  It's like that every year of Westbrook's career, I don't even need to look it up anymore because it's like this year after year, he's one of the most ball dominant and overrated point guards in history"
"Yeah but Karl Malone and Barkley ran in to Jordan’s Bulls,AI ran in to Shaq and Kobe’s Lakers.Those players didn’t fall short for the same reason as Westbrook. Russ has had Kevin Durant,Paul George,James Harden,and Bradley Beal."
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
Please explain how. Stat wise they're fairly similar. Paul George brings good defense as well.  If you wanna make the claim that SGA is around as good as George I'd still disagree but wouldn't think it was an insane claim.  However saying SGA is not only better but way better is just wrong lol.
"Own level based on what?     It's Steph, then the rest of the league. Klay isn't close.     Paul George is shooting 42% on 7.5 attempts, 41% on 7.9 attempts last season, both with 30% less assisted 3s than Klay.     Harris is shooting 48% on 6.4 attempts.     Duncan Robinson shot 45%  on 8.3 attempts, 41% on 8.5 attempts now.      Klay's career high is 44% on 7.1 attempts, and 41% on 8.3 attempts.      Korver shot 49% on 6 attempts.     Nash shot 47% on 4.7 attempts with 50% less assisted 3s (a lot more pull up 3s per game) and dwarfs his efficiency in mid-range and FT shots, as the first option on his team.     What makes Klay so special?"
SGA is way better than Paul George right now
I had almost forgotten Paul George was on the Thunder!
Paul George and Damian Lillard have got kind of a spicy history. Could be fun.
"russ threw the game away in g5 2019 when paul george dropped 36 points. once again, you’re deflecting by saying “when his teammates suck.”   despite dropping 36 on 20 shots (insane efficiency) russ was the one chucking away down the stretch, finishing with an uber inefficient 29 points on 31 FGA.   grant shot 7-8 from the field, adams 5-8, schroder 7-10. no excuse for russ. dont deflect to his teammates"
"Let's be honest, if russ left KD to go to the warriors he'd have two rings too. Maybe not two finals mvps but two rings. KD would be the one with either zero or one or two after also leaving okc. His stats aren't empty he's just never had the team (or particularly the coach, Scott Brooks is a fucking joke) around him to make it work. He needs be your number 2. So does Paul george so that didn't work. Him and harden are both way to ball dominant so that ain't work. And him and KD, I think, would have worked if it stayed together longer. Ironically I think KD would have been happier that way"
"So have, or a similar amount, LeBron, Butler, Kawhi, Harden, Kyrie or Paul George and I'd argue all of them deserve all nba nods"
"Yeah I didnt see the ""series he played in"" qualification my bad.   ["" One George-to-Cleveland deal fell apart when the Cavs declined to make a future first-round pick unprotected, a concession they felt they couldn’t make without assurances from James. It is unlikely that the Cavaliers would’ve traded Kyrie Irving with James and George together on the Cleveland roster.""](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/29/report-cavaliers-wouldve-traded-kevin-love-for-paul-george-if-lebron-james-committed-long-term-last-summer/)."
"Stars leave to join with other stars. If they were leaving one bad team for another, it wouldn't be worth moving in the first place. Somehow Carmelo Anthony and Paul George didn't go to the finals after joining up with Westbrook, CP3 didn't go to the finals after joining up with Harden, PG13 didn't go to the finals after joining up with Kawhi and every single one of the Timberwolves defectors did."
"I think Love had individual good series but I dont think they ever needed him. Ran through the east in 2015 without him I just think the gap between the Cavs with Love and without Love was far too small for what the Cavs needed.   &gt;I don't think there's a finals series that he played in where the Cavs were like a tier 2/3 star away from winning.  Interesting way of putting it. I do think the 2015 Finals was very winnable. Idk if they win that series with Kevin Love(lean no) but I think there are a number of players who were gettable at 2014 for Wiggins that couldve put them over the top. I think 2016 needing all that it took for the Cavs to eek out a win was a reflection on Love.   Also here's an interesting hypothetical. Paul George almost got traded to Cleveland in a 3 team trade for Love in 2017. I know Woj has said if that happened its unlikely Kyrie is dealt. 2018 Cavs with Kyrie/LeBron/PG, that I think definitely wouldve had a shot vs 2018 GSW. And I think Woj saying that Kyrie likely stays also highlights the fact the Cavs players knew Love wasnt enough, that they needed a meaningful jolt, and had they gotten one things might have been different."
"natural paul george regression, then"
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
(Paul George)
"&gt; Imagine if the Cavs had traded Wiggins for a wing.. let´s say Paul George or Jimmy Butler &gt;  &gt; 3 peat easy, at least 2 of 3  Damn, Bron needs all the help he can get. How about form a team the right way?"
"I completely agree with you. That OKC team was terrible without Russ, and him making it to the playoffs was definitely impressive. The reason I would put him lower is because he hasn’t been able to get out of the first round by himself. When he was with Paul George, the Blazers dominated that series. The only times he has been able to make it out of the first round was with Durant or with Harden. And with Harden, he was the second option and also played a weak OKC team in the first round. When I say lead, I value winning in the playoffs more than leading a team to the playoffs."
“this season PG vs Dame Lillard in Blazers-Clippers games:  Damian lillard 15.5ppg 5apg 17FG% 7 3FG% 0-2 W/L  Paul George 29.5ppg 6apg 57FG% 55 3FG% 2-0 W/L”
Paul George is a better basketball player than Damian Lillard
Paul George at 42% with that many attempts is impressive
Too many people care way too much about what happened 5+ years ago.  I do not care what Paul George did on the Indiana Pacers.  I do not care that Russell Westbrook was in the finals in 2012.  That is not relevant to who they are today.
Paul George or Pat Bev.
And somehow he has a higher 2K rating than Paul George??
"lol another post that was made by people caught up in the moment. Of course they would say that lmao PG had the worst playoff run of all time while Butler had the best.  However, the Bubble was a very weird setting and considering PG was struggling with depression at the time it makes sense given his drop off. It is a very close conversation between the 2 and I have them as 13 and 14 but Jimmy has not done enough to put himself above Paul George just yet"
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"&gt; No its not lol PG has always been better than Butler aside from 2015  Impact stats disagree but go off   &gt; and is having a comparable if not better season this year.  On what planet is PG having a comparable, let alone better season than Butler this year lmao.  Butler is averaging more in every single basic counting stat except points, turnovers, and fouls.  And Jimbo blows him out of the water when it comes to advanced stats except TS%, of which they are nearly identical.  &gt; One playoff run should not change that especially if the Heat get bounced in the first round this year  PG routinely disappears from the playoffs, Butler rises to the occasion.  When has PG led his underdog team to the finals?  &gt; If Paul George chokes yet again while Butler has another insane run then I will say that Butler is far better  I really don't think you will bud.  &gt;  considering PG has been good if not excellent in the playoffs aside from last year  Did you miss him in OKC?"
Yep. I'd put Paul George above him too.
Middleton. A lot of new/casual fans don’t appreciate him and just cannot understand why we gave him the max.  “bUt HoW cAn YoU jUsTiFy PaYiNg HiM tHe SaMe As PaUl GeOrGe?”
"Then you give guys like Paul George guard eligibility and AD forward eligibility and it throws that theory out the window. It really doesn’t matter if they play those positions some arbitrary % of the time, they still can’t reasonably be compared to guys like Kyrie Irving and Kawhi respectively."
Paul George
"You can disagree with me, but you're wrong and the numbers indicate otherwise. It is impossible to strictly be as good on defense as offense. Being elite on both ends of the floor is obviously inherent better than being elite one way, the two best players ever LeBron and Jordan are the best because they are elite on offense and defense, but that doesn't mean that being a two-way player makes you better than an elite one way player. Paul George isn't better than Harden or Curry.   Over the past few years, Embiid's offensive impact has not been close to Jokic despite similar scoring numbers. Why is that? There are a variety of reasons, playmaking, spacing, passing, etc. The box score is a very underserved tool at describing player impact. It is just simply factually incorrect to believe that just because you are good at offense and defense that means you are better than someone who is only good at offense or only good at defense. You have to look at the degrees of separation l."
Lmaooo imagine comparing KP to Paul George. KP is no where close to Paul George right now.
He honestly would have had a stacked team the following year anyway with Horford signing and they still even had the assets to trade for freaking Paul George. That’s still probably a guaranteed ring and he wouldnt be blamed for it because he stayed.
"Ah yes my bad because you’re the only one who has the mental capacity to truly understand something so complex. Stop bro lmao.  Harden, Kd, Jokic, Tatum, kawhi, young, luka, Embiid, ja, dame have all indefinitely outperformed lebron in these playoffs SO FAR. You can also make the argument for kyrie and Paul George but I won’t even include them."
Paul George is not a role player.  Both him and KP are considered second stars not role players although KP has underperformed a bit in the series
"it’s hard to defend a team playing 5 40%+ 3pt shooters basically always on the floor and then also kawhi leonard and paul george, I think we would look much better defensively against literally any other team in the west"
*Paul George voice* That’s a bad shot
Ignoring Paul George???
Yes basketball is a team sport. The fuck does that mean? If Kawhi wins does it not count cause he has Paul George on his team? Gtfo of here.
"Yeah that too. Lol i can’t look at percentages this series though, otherwise kawhi should be falling real soon. I swear he is shooting 100%, he is making an impact like he did in Toronto to turn that bucks series around. And Paul George going to the basket is always a positive. Except one bad first half he has been playing amazing"
"It is sustainable  when you look at how they are getting their looks.   Going all the way back to game 2, the gameplan was for them to be extra aggressive in attacking the rim because the Mavericks were poor at defending at the rim. Kawhi and Paul George continue to force their way and there is nothing the Mavericks can do to stop it if they don't double. Kawhi and Paul George have been isoing like crazy because the Mavericks defenders can not hope to defend them.   Not to mention Paul George is still playing like his trash version from last year. He's shooting 23% from 3 and hesitating on jump shots he would shoot with no conscience in the regular season. Paul George is torching the Mavericks despite choking. That just goes to show how poor the Mavericks defensive personnel are. This goes to show how matchups work. The game is just not only about percentages and luck.   As for the Mavericks, the role players were just straight up bombing with hands in their faces. Yea the Clippers defense wasn't great but THJ was hitting ridiculous shots. That isn't sustainable."
You complete forget flip flopping Paul George or New King in town Kawhi?
Paul George has never had a playoff like Luka had in each of the first 3 games though.
"Lol it's not rocket science man.  6 years and the best the East puts out is teams led by Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, Paul George and Roy Hibbert, or uh Paul Milsap and Al Horford.  That's really all that needs to be said."
"Nah, fuck the Clippers.  Kawhi left 2 good teams and I don't think he's fun at parties  Paul George overpaid and makes easy to meme comments on twitter  Morris is dirty, straight up fuck that dude  'Playoff Rondo' has largely been inflated by his better teammates, and he sucks at Connect 4  Pat Bev talks more shit than he can back up  Ty Lue has never coached without an all-star  And our 3pt% was fuckin terrible, but I guess balancing out the first games.  ^^^^That ^^^^said,  ^^^^we  ^^^^got  ^^^^a  ^^^^few ^^^^fuckin ^^^^problems   Tag me back with this shit even if we lose the series, no regrets."
"Lebron didnt face strong opposition in the east. In his heat days the best team he had to go against was the pacers of a young Paul George.   Later in his cavs days? i dont even know. Lebronto Raptors of demar derozan? There wasnt a single team in the east, any year that could be considered a conteder if they were in the west."
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they’re looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they’re playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It’s just impressive that they’ve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he’s balling tf out  I’ve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he’s what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
Kawhi was better than Luka last year too. He averaged 33/10/5 2.3 steals on 4% better TS last year despite Paul George being dogshit. Don’t even get me started on the defensive impact. Luka has been great but Dallas has been living off their flukey shooting.
From Pandemic P to Pfizer P the story of Paul George
if Paul George had a game like Luka did tonight.. the energy would be diiiifferent
"when we got Kawhi and PG last season the media anointed us title favorites, and the team carried themselves as such. people got really annoyed by that. plus we have several players who are individually hated for various reasons (pat bev, marcus morris, paul george)"
y’all I’m just here for the Paul George highlights 🥰
There was such a blatant missed call on Paul George earlier
"**Most recent championship runs**  Kevin Durant averaged 29.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists on 49/34/90 in 21 games in the 2018 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  Kawhi Leonard averaged 30.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 49/38/88 in 24 games in the 2019 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  -------  **Most recent playoff runs**   Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists on 49/33/86 in 13 games in the 2020 playoffs.  Kevin Durant averaged 32.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists on 51/44/90 in 12 games in the 2019 playoffs.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  --------   Keep in mind here that Kawhi's stats are similar, arguably better (depending on what you value), without being on a superteam or even having a fellow superstar on his team (in my opinion, Paul George is borderline, not a superstar but a star. If you think he's a superstar, that's fine, but he's undeniably worse than Curry/AD. KD and LeBron have had better teams around them than Kawhi has). Kawhi's Raptors/Clippers supporting cast pale in comparison to LeBron's Cavs/Heat/Lakers and KD's Thunder/Warriors/Nets.   Again, everything except the stats are OPINIONS, and I have my own, and you can have your own. Please stop following me around and being weird about this. It's just basketball man"
Paul George moving KP with ease is wild
He just got boxed out of bounds by Paul George lmao
Porzingis really got boxed out by Paul George....tragic
As a OG Paul George fan he’s actually playing good in the playoffs 🥲
It would but if Kawhi keeps playing like this and Paul George is a beast then mavs in 7
"Ayton,Trae, Kawhi.  Paul George too is playing sneakily well."
"Bro Paul George plays 2k, so do plenty of nba players. Referencing 2k don’t mean u don’t play outside too"
"mavs seriously cant afford to lose both games at home though, they won 2 on unsustainably high 3 point percentage.   clippers look locked in and super dangerous right now, kawhi is on a rampage paul george is on a rampage  you have to win this game if you're the mavericks"
[Kawhi and Paul George after going down 0-2](https://imgur.com/gallery/HUq3HHy)
Paul George said today I eat in the paint only
Paul George is the best player in the world but y’all ain’t heard it from me 🤷🏽‍♂️
This is not the first round Paul George I know
Paul George has played so well these past two games that we are going to have to switch our collective mockery to jimmy butler. He will have to become the new punchline
#PAUL GEORGE SAYS FUCK R/NBA
But how will r/nba use pandemic p jokes if paul george js doing well?
George Paul heard the hate
Imagine if Clippers had Paul George last year
"Yeah it isn't a horrible take. His assumption that Wiggins would be ""at  worst"" Paul George is ridiculous and he was just buying into the hype. But in 2014 PG was definitely better than Kawhi. What the dude said back then wasn't really that ridiculous. If you use today's context it looks dumb as hell"
Paul George my goodness
When Paul George drives to the basket and doesn’t just Chuck up shots all game he’s at his best
Paul George is playing with something to prove
Paul George has canceled his haters
Thats Paul George the 13th to all of you (and me).
I miss 1st half G1 Paul George.   I blame everyone who ran the memes into the ground. The basketball gods saw that.
Regular season Paul George is here
Give Paul George his due
Paul George heating up
Paul George is cookin
Paul George better calm down
Paul George was right when he said the Clips have nothing to worry about.
"Paul George was right, they keep penetrating"
Paul George goes super ice cold every series. It wouldn't work out.

Dumb challenge KP clearly hit Paul George in the head
"Paul George has had a strong playoffs so far, had a great playoff legacy with the Pacers, and Tatum had mediocre Games 1 and 2 this year"
"I think NBA fans would benefit from doing a tier list for star players rather than top x. So S+ tier for MVP level like Jokic and Curry this season and Kawhi in 2019, S tier for all those “~8 top 5 players” not in S+, and A tier for Kyrie and Paul George and such"
"There was a standing trade offer for Roddy B for Paul George at the time, and Cuban didn’t want to pull the trigger. Roddy was untouchable for a short time period."
"I think it’s less about that then about how stark the difference is. You want a much closer split, something like Kawhi/PG. Imagine if Luka had his Paul George. KP was supposed to be something like that guy, but he just hilariously isn’t."
"takes like these are funny because paul george was considered a great playoff performer with the pacers, he actually outperformed kawhi in the 2020 WCSF, and he’s playing well right now too."
"It's the opposite. It sincerely speaks to the strength of NBA narratives that I have evidence for every single thing I said and yet people have *decided* on a particular version of history regardless of the facts.  1.Find evidence of the OKC coaching staff asking Melo to come off the bench that season.  2 Points Per Isolation Attempt:  Carmelo Anthony: 0.89 on 3 attempts (58th percentile)  Paul George: 0.87 on 2.5 attempts (55th percentile)  Russell Westbrook: 0.82 on 5 attempts (43rd percentile)  3 [Here are OKC's 8 most used line ups that year](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/traditional/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612760&amp;CF=MIN*GE*100&amp;sort=PLUS_MINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;PerMode=Totals)  Melo is only in line ups with majority starters.

"Paul George was probably the most ideal possible fit.  A guy who's fine playing both on-ball and off-ball offensively and is an elite defender on the other end.  It wasn't a perfect fit with Durant, but you can't argue the results.  They were a perennial WCF team when they were healthy."
More of a Paul George that actually shows up in the playoffs and is better on ball
tatum reminds me of paul george when paul george is really feeling it
I’ll choose to hate Paul George and Justin Jackson over Kevin Durant any day of the week
"Both KD and Paul George are at the top of that list but to add new ones I’d say Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Zion Williamson"
"Paul George, as we have already seen. Kawhi too - so the Clippers."
"As others pointed out, your numbers are wrong - you’re looking at playoff RPG this season, which is obviously a tiny sample size. So let’s compare Luka and Westbrook in the regular season.   In the regular season, 23.9% of Luka’s rebounds are contested compared to 24.5% of Westbrook’s.  Among players with 6 or more rebounds per game, Dejounte Murray (22.6%), Middleton (20.7%), Harden (20.4%), Paul George (20.3%), LeBron (18.8%) and Tatum (18.4%) all have lower contest % than Luka or Westbrook but it’s really mostly those two that are accused of stat padding rebounds"
"Skip has the best nicknames. The frozen one, number 2, George Paul, Big Penguin etc etc."
"Paul george was already a star by then, but even if that wasn't the case the statement was still ridiculous. The absolute floor for any lottery draft pick is a bust, plain and simple. Most of them would kill to be in P's shoes even then. I know the guy who commented that was just being bold with his prediction so I'm not mad at him or anything, but he was dead wrong lol."
"Was Paul George viewed in the same light as today 6 years ago? I feel like that statement isn’t insane considering George’s status in 2014. We knew he was great, but I feel he was still moreso a rising star (ie 2021 Booker) than a superstar (2021 PG)"
"The playoffs are different than the regular season. More pressure, more to prove, and all eyes are in you. Just ask Paul George or Kristaps"
"True but some of the responses are pretty silly even then. Like the ""Wiggins' absolute floor is Paul George"" comment is pretty hyperbolic to say the least."
No because Paul George is actually good in the playoffs outside of last year in the bubble.
New York should go after Paul George once he’s kicked to the curb after losing to Luka.
Paul George was better than Kawhi st that point. I wanted to highlight the person saying that *Wiggins’ floor* was PG13
Paul George was absolutely seen as better than Kawhi back then though. He was going toe to toe with Lebron and leading Indy to the hard fought ECFs. Kawhi was seen as a number 4 behind Duncan and Parker and Ginobili. It's just that Kawhi improved greatly after Duncan retired and was made the #1.
No. They didn’t have any asset left after the Paul George trade + Russ doesn’t fix their problems.
Paul George is better than Russ.  They are fine.
Paul George with Lebron back in the 2013 ECF
"AI basically accomplished what Russ has just without kd, Paul George, and Harden"
"I think it would be an extreme longshot, let me get that out of the way first. Winning erases everything, the San Antonio experience was forgotten the instant Kawhi hit that shot for Toronto. The only thing worse for his career than bouncing on LA, imo, would be Paul George shaking that Playoff P nickname and it becoming him who holds them back."
"Kawhi Leonard averaged 12.5 drives per game during the regular season. Paul George averaged 11.8. They're averaging 17.3 and 15.3, respectively, through three games in the postseason. George is shooting 81% on drives against Dallas."
"Yeah the whole ""buBbLe FrAUd hEaT cUlTuRe"" circlejerk for the last day has been tiring. Its the only thing that really bothers me about this sub; feels like theres a sizable portion of people here who dont actually care about basketball, they are just here to jump on whatever hate bandwagon is currently active. They get their memes and copypasted comments ready and just sit on r/new until whatever team/player that is currently the hate target loses. Clippers, Paul George, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Trae Young etc. It goes way beyond legitimate criticism and just ends up being a circlejerk where the frontpage will be covered with just ""x team/player sucks"" for a couple days and the comment sections are worse than twitter replies. Like when this sub turned into the official Paul George haters club for a week before suddenly remembering caring about mental health. I come here for basketball and memes, not to see the sub used as megaphone for venting your personal frustrations.       Like look at the posts yesterday when Miami lost, literally within seconds I saw people posting long ass hate comments they had clearly typed out in advance and were just waiting to copypaste spam the PGT with. Like how fucking sad is that? We had like 10 different frontpage posts that were all shitting on Miami or Butler in some form. Comment sections just full of insanely bitter 76ers/Bucks/Celtics fans that have apparently been seething since the last playoffs and waiting for their chance to do some hating.  Like yeah it was kinda embarrasing for the Heat to get swept, but did they really do anything that bad to get this level of hate? Saying that you are locked in is too arrogant? Losing against the reigning MVP and DPOY who just added Jrue+Tucker to an already solid roster? I can understand getting some shadeunfreude after getting your ass beat last year, but cmon man it gets embarrasing when you got Raptors flairs out here spamming comments about how embarrasing and trash the Heat are whilst finishing 12th. Even the official Bucks twitter account out here being petty posting cocky fan tweets that hade like 3 likes on em, like thats not something you can dig up from every fanbase on twitter.    If the Clippers end up losing I will prob just unsub cause the amount of concentrated hate in this subreddit will be enough to literally resurrect Hitler."
From Paul George to George Paul
"Here’s [Rookie Playoff P schooling Paul George ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6kBmWWkWqhY)  Edit: for anyone not aware, this was 2016 playoffs and a huge moment tipping the series"
"Hmm I think I'd rather trash talk a guy who's being a jerk or a poor sport, even if he's the best player in the league, than to badger a nice guy trying his best but failing. I don't really know Randle well enough to say he's a nice guy though, and I don't know Paul George well enough to say he's a bad guy.  It has been a little tough to watch Randle brick so many shots though"
"not really, Kawhi is the SF and Paul George is the SG in our rotation"
I remember this post lmao but to be fair jimmy buckets is better than paul George
"Right, you guys are ""second team"" in this scenario.  Still tho, y'all are kinda gettin' there.  Getting Kawhi like that, and having Paul George force his way to play along with him.  For shame."
PG would be a better second option than Paul George? Wut.
"He asked for Paul George and hslf tge season off last season and us leading his team to a struggle. He needs to get the same treatment as any other superstar tgen that team is struggling with him on it. If Lebron struggled (even if he had less mind you) people would be a shit ton worse to his name despite the championships and individual accolades. If anything he gets less scrutiny.  Fact of thd matter is, he is on a tesm that has talent enough to go to the finals. If you are the leader on a team you get the blame. If you want to label someone a superstar then you have to be criticized accordingly across the board. He's getting same if not less scrutiny as other superstars get."
"are you replying to the wrong comment?  &gt;	I don’t think anyone in the NBA has ever done a true 360 dunk.  off the top of my head Paul George - if you want to get this technical about it, his take and landing are essentially a complete 360  https://i.imgur.com/ooZXF41.jpg"
I think Paul George. Right? I think PG needs to play next to someone like Buckets where he doesn't have to be the leader and take the pressure off. I trip back to the East seems wise for him.
Lol Kawhi initially asked Jimmy if he wanted to play with him back in 2019 before asking Paul George as plan C(after KD also)
"TBH tho Paul George has been really solid so far against the Mavericks. Average 26.7 points on 53% shooting, 8.3 rebounds, 5 assists and 1 steal.  No clue about defense however"
Paul George is the new owner of the state of Utah if he wins this series without Kawhi

PAUL GEORGE
Indy Paul George is back on the menu boys.
Funny how I got hate for saying the Clippers offense looks smoother when it’s run through Paul George he’s a killer too. Kawhi will get his buckets regardless
 dude paul george can like barely even dribble. anybody else notice that shit? ffs
Paul George has played like he has the jitters the last 5 minutes. His handle is a mess and he’s been lucky to avoid a few turnovers.
Reggie Jackson and Paul George are the underrated bromance in the league
Paul George haters quiet as shit
Paul George brought his yes men to the game
Paul George has mastered the art of getting to the line when there’s nowhere to go.
Paul George is handling the ball so much and so confidently but so loosely; he's like a drunk Jason Kidd out there
"Paul George doesn't have a great handle, but it becomes atrocious in any tight game."
"Come on Paul, don’t be Ringo George. Boom these mothatruckers"
"Paul George or Reggie Jackson declaring “No OT tonight”, who you got?"
Paul George must have personally given Reggie Jackson a handjob before this game

Shouldn't have brought Paul George back in until they needed him.  The bench was holding their own
"Just strongly dislike. My hate is more reserved for Marcus Morris, Pat Beverly, Reggie Jackson, and Paul George"
I can't trust Paul George.
Paul George has got to learn how to stop turning the ball over.  It's one of his greatest flaws
Marcus Morris Nic Batum Reggie Jackson Paul George Luke Kennard is really enough to beat the jazz. Wow
PAUL GEORGE REDEMPTION ARC IS FUCKING LIT. GO GET A CHIP AND BECOME A GOD MY BOY

"Yeah, save for Paul George, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris and Pat Beverly"
"Paul George third straight 30 point game, Clippers third straight win?"
"Rooting for the clippers, but not like this.  Why can’t Paul George just choke once this year smh we want to see a Reggie Jackson FMVP"
Paul George has really improved as a playmaker
NO MORE PAUL GEORGE SLANDER
Paul George can shake off Pandemic P but I still have faith in Patrick Beverly being a bozo
Lmao the Clippers were just trolling the Mavs and Clippers all along by going down 0-2. They’re the better and more talented team compared to both. Having Paul George as the second option is wonders compared to the second options that the Jazz/Mavs have
"Come on Paul George, finish this. I want to see this shitty sub eat their fucking words"
Paul George legacy game
Paul George
"Paul George is going to win the game for the clippers here in the fourth. I feel it in my soul. I’m a georgesexual mom, always have been"
Point guard paul george basically every possession hes on the court from here on
Paul George better start the 4th quarter
Paul George is amazing
Paul George straight stiff armed him
"Honestly no matter the outcome, heads off to Paul George for stepping up."
"That's when I realized we needed to get rid of Jim Buss.  I'm pretty sure the stay poster was Jeanie's idea but we didn't get Phil largely because of Jim's ego.  When you can't put your personal issues in line behind business you're unfit for the job.  By contrast, Doc Rivers worked with Paul George, who cheated on Doc's daughter while she was pregnant with PG's kid...with a pornstar.  😂"
Paul George when Danny granger went down
Paul George Clippers smash Kawhi/Luka Clippers in first round 2022 you heard it here first.
"I believed the Suns would close, but I thought we were destined for a Game 7. I'm glad we aren't because there was a VERY REAL chance that Paul George could have ended up FMVP and while I have no ill will specifically towards him anymore, that would have hurt a bit to see as a Pacers fan. Or OKC fan, I imagine.  Plus just the idea of him as FMVP from any perspective would be a pretty wild thought. He's a fuckin baller though, no disrespect intended."
"That's true. There's some argument that it would've been better to hold onto Russ, rehabilitate his value, then trade him for maybe expirings and a 1st, or at least better contracts and a 1st. That approach has been great for OKC. But you right, it wasn't as bad as I made it sound.  The real double stinker was the Magic's ibaka trades. They gave up Oladipo and Sabonis to get Ibaka, only to trade him for Terrence Ross and a later 1st. Meanwhile the guys they started with turned into Paul George!"
Cam “Paul George” Reddish
Paul George.
"I think George and Kawhi having to give 100% on Offense and Defense really took its toll (Kawhi injury, George looked gassed last night). They need a play maker who can set them up with open shots.  Last night, the Suns forced players other than George to score. At the half, the highest scoring pair were Paul-Booker and Beverly-Cousins. Clippers came back when Jackson came in just like in Game 7 versus the Jazz. Only reason they lost was CP3 went God mode."
"Not gonna lie, I was a little salty watching Paul George (and guys like Durant, Trae, etc) rise to the occasion and carry their team against odds after watching our guys give up as soon as AD went down. But I'm still optimistic. Give it a few months and I'm sure Lakers fans will return to being obnoxiously hyped for our superstar duo."
"You’re clearly not a clips fan from your comment history, yet you comment ‘ George Paul’ and ‘Clippers Clowns’ on the Clippers sub in search of attention.  Rather be sensitive than pathetic"
"He was having a historic run this year, and the guys that were hurt were guards so they wouldn't even defend him. Some people just hate players for dumb reasons, like most people here hating on Paul George or Russell Westbrook. Giannis is an all time great player but since he cant do any fancy dribbles or hit threes from half court he gets hate."
"There is literally no reporting, it is all wild speculation. Would Kawhi leave? Would he demand a Paul George trade? Lol, what the fuck is he talking about?!"
Paul George
"Doc's record should be good, he coached T-mac, KG, Pierce, Rondo, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Shaq, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.   This doesn't mean he's good, a little bit of smoke and mirrors in those numbers IMO."
Paul George played better than him
"It's funny how you say ""not really a big fan of either team"" then you vomit a bunch of crap that completely ignores all the dirty shit the Clippers were doing this series.  First things first, the Clippers didn't commit a foul for 24 minutes. That literally broke a record. For a team that's allowed free reign to be physical, that's not just unlikely. That's damning.  I'm fine with the fouls that we were called for. I'm not fine for not getting the same treatment down the line. Booker gets sent to the deck every time he drives and the whistles are swallowed so far down the refs' mouths that they're melting in stomach acid. Ayton gets hit in the head and the eye 4-5 times last game and gets one trip to the line from taking an elbow to the head.   Also, Cousins shoved Payne and Booker after their game 2 L and has been shoving players on dead ball situations the entire series with no consequences. If Chris Paul has to flop for him to get caught, then maybe he shouldn't be actively raising elbows to people like a dumbass.  &gt; Jae Crowder literally tripped a guy in this very game  That was stupid and reckless.  Paul George also elbowed a guy who broke his nose in three places after looking him directly in the face.   &gt; Bev can be dirty and annoying, but Paul is in his class.  Which one of these guys dead ball shoved another guy after getting shot after shot drained in his face? Which one of these guys broke another superstar's nose? Which one of these guys took out another guy's legs and then mocked him as he fell on the ground?  You're so fucking biased it's pathetic. You have zero clue what you're talking about. And on top of all of that, the Clippers had a massive free throw advantage and couldn't make this a game within 20 points. That's sad."
"The Suns were not getting hosed by the refs. They were fouling. The Bridges hit on the elbow of Paul as he went up was an easy one. The baseline foul on Craig when he put two hands on the body of George was an easy one. Maybe one or two calls went one way or the other, but the Suns got those calls, too such as on the out of bounds call that should’ve gone the other way but resulted in them hitting a 3 instead or the nonsense Boogie elbow.   Watching this as not really a big fan of either team, it’s kind of funny seeing a Suns fan complain about George’s pushoffs or the danger of playing against Cousins. Both of these teams have those guys. The Suns have their own PG who is one of the biggest rule benders in the league. Jae Crowder literally tripped a guy in this very game. Cousins wasn’t hurting anyone with that shove, it was a fake dust up Paul was using to get an advantage. Bev can be dirty and annoying, but Paul is in his class and one example from this series of Bev being dirty was just Paul foul baiting and flopping. Paul has either injured or gone after injured guys before, too.   It just shows that for most fans when a guy is on your team, what he does is pretty much okay. No self aware Suns fan should be saying this stuff about another team, they aren’t victims."
Not really especially not to that extent.  Westbrook didn't make the Rockets better when he replaced CP3 despite being more likable. Kyrie didn't take the Celtics to another level when he got traded there. Paul George didn't make OKC better when he got traded there.
"This is a trade that I think is fine:  GSW: Paul George  LAC: Damian Lillard  POR: Wiseman, Mann, GSW Picks  Feel like each team can have championship aspirations or a solid rebuilding trajectory with this. Your welcome NBA FOs"
Or the second year player was asked something along the lines of “do you think Paul George and kawhi Leonard grew as leaders this year?”
"As much as we like to meme about him, probably Paul George."
"I was gonna say Paul George too, AD is too good to be the Pippen"
"Agreed. I really don’t have any reason or desire to hate the Clippers like I do, but Pat Bev brings it out of me. He prevents be from being impressed at how well other guys on your team stepped up and made a run this postseason. The heroics of dudes like Reggie Jackson, Paul George, and even Marcus Morris (who had a reputation himself but who stayed clean this postseason I think) who came up so big for y’all are partly lessened by Pat Bev’s antics."
"Personally, I think it's someone like Paul George or Klay Thompson. Both are elite shooters that provide great defense and the ability to create their own shots. I think that would be the ideal partner for LeBron James in this era."
"This is lazy analysis masquerading as real analysis.  Would the Lakers have guaranteed beating the Suns? No.  Would the Nuggets beat the Suns? No chance.  But the Clippers with Kawhi, Zubac, and Ibaka? Suns would definitely have no chance. The injured Clippers, before game 6, were outscoring the Suns, outplayed them as a whole. They lost games 2 and 4 more than the Suns won them. Having that extra offensive production from Kawhi makes all the difference in extremely close games. Now, did other guys step-up and put up offensive production in lieu of Kawhi? Of course. But you can't replace defense and defensive personnel.   Kawhi being healthy alone prevents Paul George from facing the lions share of the Suns defense. Kawhi healthy is able to abuse the Suns wings, who outside if Crowder, are way too weak to contain Kawhi on the block. Kawhi's defense can not be replicated, but further more he is a missing body that makes the Clippers small ball defense much much better. Zubac was out for games 5 and 6 and his rim protection was so valuable. As slow footed as he is, he did a much better job guarding the PnR than Cousins or Jokic. And do we forget about Ibaka, who would have been even better defensively than  Zubac, but can space the floor. Without these 3 key players, the Clippers lineups could have been solved defensively, as we saw in the breakout game in game 6 by CP3. Ty Lue ran out of bodies on the defensive end to contain the Suns. That's the biggest factor. PG can't be asked to play defense on Booker and CP3 when leading the teams offense, leading the league in minutes, and seeing so much from the Suns on the other end."
"Lets play into this because it's kinda fun - his team needed him to go god mode against Dallas to advance, then immediately find themselves down 0-2 to a wounded Jazz team. They comeback and close out without him, had a scrappy but ill fated series where Paul George showed up for 1 game offensively and was a meh defender at best all series, then they needed bailed out by Reggie Jackson going HOT.  On the surface, yeah totally, why would he leave the *city* he wanted to go to, and a team 2 wins away from the finals? When you dig into it, why would he stay apart from the city?"
Paul George walloping Booker in the face with his elbows on an up and over is objectively a flagrant foul and has been called that way for decades now.
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
counter: They have Kawhi and Paul George.
He’s the best on the team. If he‘s better than Kawhi he should be able to get out of the first round.  Pg and Luka is close. Paul George has done things that Luka hasn’t. He lost to the big 3 heat in the conference finals in his 3rd season and has only gotten better. Paul George is a way better defender and shooter. Luka hasn’t done anything yet but he has a lot of potential.
"We need to remember that Kawhi really wanted to be in LA two years ago, before he'd ever actually played professionally in his hometown. It's totally possible he hasn't enjoyed it as much as he thought he would and might want something else now. He's really given no clues either way about what he wants.   But we do know he also made the Clippers get Paul George first before he would sign with them, presumably because he wanted to win championships, rather than ""just be in LA"". The Clippers are poised to probably lose Reggie Jackson in free agency and they might lose Batum as well. It's also possible Ibaka is out all next year recovering from his back surgery (after all, that kept MPJ out a full year), so it's possible Kawhi might not have as much faith in a Clippers core of PG, Mann, Morris (32 years old), Zubac and Beverley (33 years old). If you assume everyone else around the league gets healthy next year, I'm not sure that's a real contender. But Kawhi and Luka probably is."
"As a Clippers fan, at least he apologized but it's worthless if he keeps pulling this shit. I hate what he did. It detracts from all of the other likable players and the season the Clippers had when Kawhi, Ibaka, and then Zubac went down. Paul George playing his heart out. Reggie Jackson being damn near automatic and just an easy guy to root for. Mann developing."
Lol wut? Did the Clippers lose Paul George between game 5 and 6? There's a slight difference.
"Love this team. The haters will never stop but they mean nothing now. Great season, incredible postseason by Paul George, did so much despite injuries and an insanely stupid schedule, no limit if Kawhi isn't injured."
"To start Paul George is a very good player and did well during these playoffs. But there seems to be a lot of “well Kawhi was hurt and PG13 did his best” sentiment going around and I think that’s kind of the point. This was his best and i think that means we need to change the narrative that Paul George can consistently control a playoff series. Without Kawhi the expectation was a loss in this series so this wasn’t a collapse by any stretch but it also wasn’t exactly his version of Lebron vs the Warriors + KD. PG had a chance here.   With Chris Paul in Covid protocol the Clippers still dropped games 1 and 2. That was as even a playing field as they were going to get and they couldn’t capitalize. Then Game 4 - Clips down 3 with 6s left. PG has 2 FTs to get within 1? Misses both, they lose. Game 5 was a masterpiece. He absolutely dominated that game. Incredible to watch. Which makes game 6 all the more disappointing. PG wasn’t bad individually but his performance was nowhere near enough to keep it competitive. Yes he was gassed playing the most minutes. Yes the rest of the post season also matters when talking about this and he did a good job there especially going “solo” vs the Jazz. Again, he is a very good player. 14th in PPG throughout the playoffs is something most guys will never be good enough to do. He’s better than the #1 option on most of the teams in the league but let’s be real - those teams are all on vacation right now. It’s not that he choked away the series it’s that ~10yrs of data have shown us that a Paul George led team has a ceiling."
"George Gervin, Paul George, Chris Paul, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh."
My team! Carmelo Anthony. Anthony Davis. Paul Davis. Chris Paul. Paul George.!
"Celtics were younger than Lebron when he won a title last year. And those Cavs teams were led by Brad Daughtery and Mark Price, so I see no problem including Paul George and Roy Hibbert."
"Embiid, KAT, Jokic, AD are all inarguable.  I'd take Bam, Vuc, and Gobert above him as well, but even being generous and saying he's like the 6th or 7th best center instead of the 8th - 18th overall is nuts lol.   If this was based on a complete league re-draft (snake format) and you're picking Ayton at 18, you'd have like Ayton and D Lo or Tobias Harris    Instead of Paul George / Booker /Tatum (at least one drops) and Nurkic"
"Not really sure how 3p% matters much if they end up having the same fg%. It just means Tatum was worse at 2p than Paul George. The only real thing that Tatum may be better at than George is ft% but even then, 77% isn’t so bad to the point where he’s “shooting them out of the game”. The difference is hardly there. My point is that ppl were praising Tatum for taking on the stacked nets team without jaylen brown despite his “bad” efficiency, which in all honesty isn’t that bad. So it makes sense for ppl to praise PG for taking on the stacked suns team without kawhi. If you’re fine with the Tatum praise but are against the PG praise then you might just be a PG hater."
"Zero shame for the Clipps, got an iconic franchise moment in game 6 and run, Paul George proved a lot of people wrong, and Mann looks like youth reinforcements for a team with likely one more shot"
"You cant seriously be using 2 games as a claim that he played well, especially when he only played well in 1 of them lmfao. Thats like saying ""PG played well in Game 1 and Game 5 against the Suns, that means he played well the whole series"".   2 games is way too small a sample size. Here, I'll include those 2 games with the 6 against Pheonix    Player | FG% | 3PT% | FT% ---|---|----|---- Paul George (Last 2 UTAH, All 6 PHX) | 44 | 30 | 80  Still way below what you would expect from a star level player."
"i mean it basically killed Indiana's playoff window at that time, the season after the Pacers missed the playoffs in 2015 and by 2016, everyone except George Hill was gone from that team; and ofc Paul George ended up leaving after the 2016-17 season. And the Pacers have yet to get out of the 1st round ever since that injury. Not saying that the Pacers would have won the East that year against LeBron an the Cavs but that injury has put a serious hamper on the Pacers playoff chances ever since"
"Lmao. No he didn’t. The pacers were a team led by a younger and worse version of Paul George. That was their best player. And their second best player was basically out of the league by 28 because he was so exploitable.  And again going to 8 straight finals when your competition is so weak doesn’t mean as much, especially not when you lose those finals.   If you seriously think that it’s an accomplishment for a player of Lebrons supposed caliber to beat a team with Paul George and Roy Hibbert as their two best players, when he himself played with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh then we need to knock him down a tier in the greats discussion."
"  Player | FG% | 3PT% | FT% ---|---|----|---- Damian Lilliard | 46 | 45| 94 Jayson Tatum | 42 | 39 | 92 Trae Young | 43 | 33 | 87 Paul George (FULL) | 44 | 34 | 84 Paul George (v Suns) | 42 | 29 | 77  Cmon man just be objective for a second. It's obvious that PG played terrible, especially in the Suns series. That Sun's series is actually the most accurate comparison between all of these players because Tatum and Dame are both the first option on their team, and PG was the first option for the Clipps in their series against the Suns. There's not way you can spin PG's playoff run in a positive light.  Also, LMFAO @ comparing PG to Trae. Trae is in his 3rd year in the league, this was his first playoff run, and he is a known chucker and low-efficiency player. And even with all those caveats, Trae still played better this post season than George did vs the Suns (again, Trae is the 1st option so you have to compare to when PG was 1st option too)."
"Sure it’s an accomplishment, it just isn’t as impressive when the best team you had to beat featured Roy Hibbert as their second star and a young Paul George as their first.  Try putting Paul George on a team today that had no other marquee player and tell them that team is good."
"Using field goal percentage to say that they were bringing their team down is so stupid. PG shot 42.8% which isn’t even that bad. Trae young in the victory over the 76ers shot 39.6% from the field. Dame in his loss against Denver shot 42.5% from the field. Tatum in his loss against nets shot 39.6% from the field. These are all worse than Paul George’s fg%. Does that mean these guys are the reason their team lost? Or in trae’s case, the reason why it got pushed to 7 games when it should’ve been less? No. Value isn’t measured through field goal percentage. Anyone who isn’t a hater can see how valuable Paul George was. The clippers didn’t lose bc of Paul George. The blazers didn’t lose bc of dame. The Celtics didn’t lose bc of Tatum. Despite what fg% may say"
"No you can’t. Celts were really old when Lebron finally beat them, and the Pacers were lead by Paul George and had Roy Hibbert as their second star."
"I was actually there for those series games that were in LA. Blake abusing Baynes multiple times at the rim still plays in my head haha. Yeah I’ve got to say if we’re going by individual performances CP’s against the Spurs is definitely number 1, but if we’re talking overall performance in the playoffs I’d have to say Paul George just for the simple fact that I’ve never seen a single Clipper, including CP and Kawhi, play with so much heart and grit, while still galvanizing the rest of the team. He finished in the top 5 in points, rebounds, assists, AND minutes of all playoff performers. CP in this situation doesn’t play all of those minutes nor does Kawhi. For that reason as well as PG really emerging as an emotional leader through these playoffs I have to rank him number 1"
"I’ll give Kawhi respect where respect is due but Rondo and his play making was a bigger reason why we were able to stay competitive with the Mavs. Yeah Kawhi definitely got us over the hump but for Paul George and the rest of the squad to bounce the #1 seed is something extremely special. PG finished in the top five of points(1st), rebounds(3rd), and assists(5th) among playoff performers. For all of those reasons as well as his 41 point explosion to keep us alive, the grit and heart he’s played with, he’s clearly the best Clipper ever to this point who isn’t named Bob McAdoo. This is just my opinion though, if others have CP or Kawhi as the greatest it’s hard to argue other than neither showed me what PG showed me through these series. He was the best player on the court by far, no Kawhi, no DJ, Blake, or JJ, to help but he was still able to get shots off, get guys to their spots and carried the team on his back. But like I said this is just my opinion on the matter"
"42/29/77 is faaar from ""wasn't perfect"". Honestly, if he had played at least decent, the Clips would be going to the finals.  To be clear, he was decent as a 2nd option behind Kawhis. He still had his typical Paul George games where his shot is off and his efficiency is trash, but he was definitely better than when he had to be the no.1 option"
"I didn't step into the post game thread, but by god was this a cathartic ass beating.  After going up 9 and then double digits in the 3rd, the refs were gifting the Clippers free throw after free throw -- and that was while the Suns were far behind on the FT and foul disparity. We went up 17 and then Monty failed to call a timeout until the 10-0 run and thank god we have Chris Paul.  I have only respect for Reggie jackson -- and some respect for Paul George (He abused the fact that nobody calls his off arm extension to the extreme this series) -- but I am so happy that we will never again see Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, Demarcus Cousins this season, almost so much that my relief of not playing against them and risking injury is greater than the happiness that the Suns are in the finals for the first time in my life.  Noticing the tides turning after game 5 on this sub and hten immediately flipping as Bev gets ejected was amazing."
Yeah I feel like if he were trying to do it on purpose he wouldn’t use his forehead lol   The Paul George elbow swing in game 6 looked a lot more intentional to me   But point still stands that a lot of people seem to get hurt around Bev. It’s a pattern
"There are plenty of people who never hated on Paul George, me included. This sub is filled with haters of all sorts though, and they tend to stay quiet when the player they're hating is doing well. The hating itself is childish and ridiculous regardless of the circumstances around ones career. It's wrong every time."
"Kawhi left the Raptors partly because he didn't think we were good enough to repeat. Paul George looked really good as a first option, but early in the playoffs when he had to play behind Kawhi, Kawhi had to go God mode to put away the Dallas Lukas. They'll also be losing their third option in Reggie Jackson. There can definitely be merit to him concluding that they wouldn't be good enough.   I don't think he leaves because of the home factor though."
If kawhi played and Paul George was hurt I think clips beat them. Fully healthy nuggs squad probably as well.
And Paul George looked dead last night. Imagine doing it for 15 years.
"This happens on everything on this sub. People just like sounding smart to strangers on the internet. Look at Paul George recently. He was this subs punching bag for the last few years. This year all I hear from everyone now is “Why do people hate Paul George so much, it’s unfair and stupid to criticize him”. Like bruh we were all doing that last year even this year during the first two games of the Dallas series. Just admit we were wrong instead of trying to sound smart."
Three fouls on their first two possessions. I’m still not sure how that Mikal Bridges block on Paul George wasn’t overturned.
"Ot you could watch the Clippers all year long and see they are a shitty team. Paul George is a great player , Leonard is a great player but they are a shitty team. The Suns add two players and go from not making the playoffs in 10 years to the NBA finals. The Heat added one player ( ?) last year  and went to the finals. The Clippers added 2 of the top 10-15 players ( depends on your opinion) and don’t do shit. Was it a 3-1 lead last year? 0-2 in every series this year ?"
But now he is robin to Paul George
I guess compared to Paul George he doesn’t take what looks like bad shots to me lol.
"The whole Clippers team was throwing jabs at CP3 all game. Cousins pushed CP3 out of the way early in the game, then Beverly, and Paul George was too but in other games. Hats off to Chris Paul, able to keep his cool and still show out"
"If I were commissioner, there's so many rules I'd want to boot right off the top. I'd get rid of the intentional swing-through foul, I'd re-introduce the plane of verticality, I'd evaluate the degree with which offensive players are allowed to push-off on stepbacks (and the degree with which they benefit from touch fouls immediately thereafter while defenders try to recover from being pushed away). The list goes on.  But for the time being, for the game the NBA has created today (for better or worse), Paul George seems to know how to tilt it in his favor. I don't think he's on some other players' level when it comes to abuse, but he does seem intimately familiar with all of the NBA's rule foibles and he knows how to exploit them in his favor just right. I think that's why he benefits from whistles on certain head-down drives to nowhere more than some of his peers; he's just found the rhythm that best catches the attention of today's officials.   I hate it and I want to see some degree of reform this offseason, but it is what it is right now."
"The Paul George thing was so weird. It's a bunch of trolls mocking him for.. missing some shots?? Why him wtf. Then somehow it bled over into sports media. There were barely any real critiques, just kids I assume name calling over and over. Like he never did anything dirty like Morris or someone"
Egregious? The one on George? Far from egregious.  Paul George did almost the exact same thing to Ayton last night.
Paul George was getting the softest calls ever when he got anywhere near the rim.  Nobody else on the floor was getting touch or bump fouls at all.  Seems funny to me that nobody was getting calls in the first half then suddenly PG was getting everything in his favor the second half while the Clippers were down 8-12 consistently.
"Okay but then explain:  * Dwight Howard * Lamarcus Aldridge  * DeMar DeRozan * Ibaka * Westbrook  * Paul George  * Harden * Hayward  * Whiteside   Basically Kawhi, LeBron, and Carmelo picked big cities in the last decade and that’s it.   Most of the time big cities are leverage. Most players re-signed with their team or went where they had a shot at the title"
"i honestly hope the league and clippers force him to get some psychiatric help because he literally snapped with that shove.  he knows 100% why he shouldnt and the ramifications if he does that, but theres a part of his mind that has completley let go of reason there.  i wonder if his coaches in the nba are to blame at all, its years and years of being praised for his tenacity and 'dog' that makes him play with this instigator ego.  the confidence with which he plays the instigator is similar to the confidence paul george plays with as the number 1 option."
"If a reporter wants to ask a stupid question, then yes I want the same generic answer.  Obviously the series would look different with Kawhi. At the end of the day, nobody knows if they would have won or what the outcome would have been. They’re just trying to get something out of Paul George that can make headlines since he’s shown a history of saying dumb shit"
Not sure how that's relevant to a discussion about Paul George just because he's a blazers fan. It's fair to acknowledge he choked those FT's but he's also the reason they were even at that point.
"Beat LeBron, mvp jokic, Paul George/on fire Reggie Jackson  12-4 in the nba playoffs   Didn't tank to avoid Lakers"
"Paul George is on of those players that people get surprised when he plays well and not as surprised when he doesn’t bother showing up. Minutes don’t mean shit when they’re just empty losses. Yeah he’s saved some face after last season, but last seasons bubble pandemic p combined with his off the court stuff really soured his appeal, and he’s shown he can be a viable number two, but wants to be treated like a number 1. It’s just Pippen with no Jordan, and you see how Scottie is doing now"
The disparity between discussion of game 5 Paul George and game 6 Paul George
Paul George played well there is no question about it. He stepped up to the challenge and while he wasn’t truly special or anything like that it was still great to see. He will always be Playoff Pee Pee and there is no escaping it.
Paul George appeared to not even break a sweat again.
Do you root for Paul George? Or Harden? Or Dwayne Wade (used to)? All of them flop and it's because that's the game now and I hate it. Remember the bad boys? They'd punch someone in the face and it'd be a common foul
Thats a good bet. Or stay with Paul george and the klaw and try to recruit. Either one is stacked.
"Suns beat Lebron, MVP Jokic, and Paul George who was having one of the best statistical playoff performance in recent history.  You play who’s in front of you."
"In game 5 there were like 2 or 3 minutes where Torey Craig played great defense on PG and had some good hustle plays. I thought to myself ""why isn't he getting more minutes?""  Idk if the decision was organic or forced by Cam Johnson missing the game, but Craig was the X-factor in defending Paul George last night, and the key to their defense."
"Lol lakers had Lebron, Denver had the mvp, and clips had kawhi for a bit and Paul George througout."

"Nearly everyone on the Clippers earned a good amount of respect with this year's playoff run. Lue big-time, Paul George too, Reggie Jackson for sure. But fuck Pat Bev, he's the only thing the Clippers have to be ashamed of after this playoff run."
Jesus Kawhist and Saint Paul George
"Can you blame me when you lobbed that one up for me? 😂  Alright, here's a real answer for you: in that Game 7 Kobe was still the game's leading scorer, scoring more than a quarter of the Lakers' points in the game. He had 23 of the Lakers' 83 points, which was huge for them. That was an insanely intense defensive game for both teams where almost everyone had poor shooting performances:  Paul Pierce: 5-15, 18 pts  Ray Allen: 3-14, 13 pts  Rajon Rondo: 6-13, 14 pts  Pau Gasol: 6-16, 19 pts  Andrew Bynum: 1-5, 2 pts  Lamar Odom: 3-8, 7 pts  About the only guys who didn't shoot poorly were Kevin Garnett (8-13, 17 pts) and Ron Artest (7-18, 20 pts). It should also be pointed out that Kobe also had 15 rebounds in the game (only Pau had more, with 18, nobody else from either team had more than 10). Kobe stepped up and did was his team needed him to do, and that's a big reason why they won the game, the series and the championship.   Can you make a similar case for Paul George tonight? He wasn't god awful, but he really wasn't very impactful overall. Honestly for me it's less about the 6 makes than it is the only 15 shots. He needed to be far more aggressive than he was. Kobe wasn't hitting his shots in that Game 7 in 2010, but he damned sure wasn't going to let his team lose. He was going down swinging if he was going down. Paul George didn't have that same kind of fight tonight, and I'm guessing if you're being honest you'd agree with me.   As for the minutes played and all of that, by the time Kobe finished that Game 7 he had played 923 playoff minutes over 23 games. On top of that it was his third straight year making it to the Finals, having played 863 minutes across 21 playoff games in 2008 and 940 minutes across 23 playoff games in 2009. That was also after missing only 9 total games in those three years, along with having participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. So if Paul George is tired then he's got 89 days to rest up before training camps open and then he has to go back to it."
"Paul George being better than Kawhi is reasonable?  There's no way that's true at all, they're pretty far apart. Unless you're counting injuries against Kawhi."
"He's been inconsistent at times. He's failed in the clutch.   But anyone that says that Paul George isn't one of the best and prettiest damn players in the game is a fucking idiot. PG is an elite talent. That's why he gets the shit he does, people want more from him. He's a top 15 offensive talent in the NBA, any year he's been in it"
"It was an unfortunate year but honestly the team looks promising. Ty Lue is doing a good job as coach and has shown flexibility and resilience, not a whiney, stuck up disappointment like Doc Rivers. Paul George had great games and is playing better than last year. No one can predict the future but this Clippers team has looked solid based on the overall playoffs performance this year."
They didn't try at all though. Kawhi basically called Paul George and said he's coming home to LA.
"You don't have a core.  You have space alien Kawhi who is mentally gone and can't be counted on, and an aging Paul George who apparently isn't good enough to do the damn thing.  Reggie is gone this off-season.  Then everyone else on your team is either a bum or a bad-character undesirable type.  I wouldn't want to be a clippers fan going forward."
"&gt; hard for me to dislike players like Paul George  threw his teammate CJ Miles under the bus. Had the worst elimination game performance of all time in 2018 game 6 against utah. another huge playoff flameout in 2020 against the Nuggets, while up 3-1.   I have no idea how people on this sub are painting PG as some ultra-likable player. He's absolutely not. It's cool he had some great games this year in the playoffs, but can't just erase and write over nba history like that."
"&gt; what did u say when Kobe shot 6-24 or whatever in game 7 of the Finals vs Boston?   I was celebrating a Lakers championship over the Celtics after that game, what do you think I was saying? See if you can spot the difference between these two players. Try to pay special attention to their demeanors:  * [Paul George after tonight's game](https://streamable.com/p62o0r)  * [Kobe Bryant after that game](https://youtu.be/AQQobw_JrJU?t=5m51s)  It's subtle, but if you look closely you might be able to pick up on it."
A commercial with Paul George saying “no OT tonight” tho wasn’t it?
"Absolutely!! Paul George stepped all the way up, some viewers hold every little thing against him but PG just showed the world he really can take charge again.   I definitely think Paul George has shed this narrative, there will probably always be some bringing it up but I think a lot will move away from it."
"Paul George stepped up in the biggest moments, It doesn’t mean much but I don’t think I can make a Playoff P joke again. Like Kawhi went down &amp; Paul George &amp; Ty Lue brought this team together.  I like the Clippers more than I’ve ever liked them"
"Agreed, PG played hard, and did everything he could possibly do. Respect to Paul George. Fuck pat Bev"
"My guy, the guy you are praising as cp3 was the clipper culture until Paul George and kawhi are changing it to be better 🤦🏽‍♂️. Damn you dumb lol no one in clippers fan base is defending Beverly except those in different fan bases who keeps saying we are defending him lol he’s legit saying he did good defense against elite players such as Mitchell and booker. You can only do so much and you only hope to slow them down. And he did."
"Anyway this finals go I will be so fucking happy for who wins and de aster by whoever loses.   Giannis is an amazing guy who plays as a beast and deserve the win just from his accomplishments until now.  CP3, even though he flops a lot, is a beast on the court and deserves a ring because I don't see him getting another shot at it and with everything he did in his career to fall short would be awful, also Ayton and Book are great. Also Suns needs the first ring.   Trae Young deserves it for his hustle, taking the hawks this far and how disrespected he was until now, but he is the one who will probably have the most chances.  Paul George deserved though, but fuck Pat Beverly, so I am sorry Playoff P."
"What are you talking about? I like Kawhi, rest of that team is awful though. I’m just saying that every year, Paul George always has some excuse that he whines about in the post game press conference (valid or not).  All stars own up to their shortcoming instead of blaming injuries, coaching, bad shots etc. Losers mentality"
"As much as I hate Kawhi, I'm rooting for paul George next season, he balled out last game."
"Huh?? Forwards were absolutely stacked in the 00s. All NBA are two forward slots, not just PF.  Dirk, Duncan, LeBron, Garnett, Pau, Stoudemire, Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Webber, Karl Malone, Barkley, Peja Stojakovic, Wallace, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, Tracy McGrady (Houston he was a SF and was All NBA as a Forward), Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Zach Randolph etc.. all competing for All NBA honors.   Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."
"Paul George signed with OKC.   &gt;Yes theres always stars who get drafted by small markets and sometimes are able to retain them,  Isn't retaining stars you drafted what we're talking about?   Small markets that show they can be competent and compete for championships have been able to do that.   All this complaining is bullshit because a lot of these small market teams don't respect the stars that do stay...theyre quick to ship them out as soon as they get hurt or start to age. Guys like John Wall, and Westbrook stayed dedicated to their teams and when the started to decline the orgs shipped them out."
Resentment against someone who wants to whine himself out of a ridiculously lucrative agreement they signed*.  I'm a Raptors fan. I have no resentment for Leonard taking a super max in LA (nor would I if he did t win us a championship). Paul George on the other hand is an insincere self centered untrustworthy scumbag who I hope never wins and has no legacy. See the difference?
Remember Paul George? Lmao.
"Eh, a lot of red flags if you view him as anything more than a role player. He’s improved defensively and is a good rebounder. And is a solid shooter. His biggest issue is his consistency, he’ll be a 20/8 guy one night and 5/4 guy the next.   Can’t afford to allocate so much of our limited resources to the Paul George of role players.  But I will say, he has never had a defined role on the Lakers. Either way, Kuzma has got to go."
Paul George is probably gonna end up the greatest clipper
"Oh yeah I’m not excusing the Clippers necessarily. I’m more saying that I think there are other front offices that would happily be equally shitty to their players, if they thought it would be advantageous. And I think Paul George and a lot of other star players are aware of that."
You’d think that would just make the Clippers an undesirable destination. Instead it’s the opposite with Paul George forcing his way there.
"Correct, Paul George is the best Clipper ever.   13 getting retired in LAC and Indiana"
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2844919-report-russell-westbrook-wanted-to-be-traded-before-paul-george-clippers-move
Lebron had his career high in Miami.   Paul George just had probably his best individual post season.   Kevin Durant.   Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season. Five 40+ games  Harden had a 40 point triple double and a near 40 point triple double with BKN this year. + a bunch of 30+ point games.   Curry and Kd were still putting up 40 and 50 point games in gsw.   We still see those performances
Dame needs to grow the fuck up. He's trying to preserve his image with his teammates while also complaining that his supporting cast is inadequate.  They could have been making a trade for an All-star for awhile now but he's too enamored with the idea of winning with CJ as his running mate. A few years ago they could have been serious players in both the Paul George (Indy) and Jimmy Butler (Minny) sweepstakes. But they missed both opportunities and ended up blowing their assets on stop gap wings. They still don't have a competent SF on the roster. Now they're stuck with no real way of contention.
"Some pretty good takes  &gt; Raptors don't do a complete rebuild from year three, but they do a retool and successfully pull off a trade for a super star.  &gt; Jerry West successfully gets the Clippers to the Western Conference finals.   &gt; Paul George left OKC.  &gt; The Timberwolves and Suns are the two favorites in the West.   Well that was half right.  &gt; The Nets are a major contender in year four and five of this timeline.  &gt; Clippers make the WCF without CP3  &gt; Rudy Gobert wins 3 DPOYs  But also some really bad takes....  &gt; Embiid isn't a starter, always injured.  &gt; Seattle has an NBA basketball team again.   &gt; The best rookie will be Josh Jackson.  &gt; Wolves win a title  &gt; lonzo considered top 10 player in league."
"&gt; Anthony Davis leaves for the Spurs.   &gt; Cousins ends up in Portland.   &gt; The Nets are a major contender in year four and five of this timeline.   &gt; The 76ers are heavy favorites.   &gt; The Timberwolves and Suns are the two favorites in the West.   &gt; Jerry West successfully gets the Clippers to the Western Conference finals.   &gt; Paul George left OKC.   &gt; Westbrook is traded in either year four or five. Either for a lot or as a salary dumb because his athleticism has left him because he was injured playing like he does.    &gt; Raptors don't do a complete rebuild from year three, but they do a retool and successfully pull off a trade for a super star.    hey this is pretty spot on"
Didn’t say it wasn’t impressive. I just don’t think it’s that big of a deal. Jamal Murray went off in the bubble last year too. It still didn’t mean he was a superstar. He’s a good scorer but he’s on the same level as Booker. Star players that need to take any extra step before being considered superstars. Mitchell isn’t capable of putting a team on their back like Paul George did and that Clippers-Jazz series was indicative of that
"You think it's more likely that Henry Abbott completely fabricated what was attributed to Paul George? For the web page hits? That's all it takes for you to believe a respected journalist is fraudulent, an athlete backpedalling?"
It depends who gets dunked on. It’s completely selective with this sub in particular.  *Paul George gets dunked on?*  This sub: LMFAOOOO Dunked on Pee LOL playoff form already   *White player gets dunked on*  This sub: Why are we laughing at him for playing defense? We should applaud him for having the balls to do something most guys in the league wouldn’t!
You're literally saying you believe Henry Abbott instead of Paul George directly lmao. How absolutely fucking stupid is that.
"Alright, fair enough. I’m sure Thunder fans aren’t too torn up about Paul George leaving."
Paul George trade begs to differ
The clippers were literally throwing Paul George *and* Kawhi Leonard at him at once. Two all-nba defenders (one of which is a DPOY) and it barely slowed the guy down.
Paul George. Dude wasn’t gonna sign and let the Pacers know so they could get something for him. It was sad but it wasn’t like he put out a documentary series about wanting to stay in Indy before he left.
"In 2019, Paul George was traded to the Clippers &amp; the furthest possible pick OKC get is 2026 1st round pick. 20,21,22,23,24,25,26... 7 yrs."
"They still got Paul George man, they ain’t gon be that bad. Plus Kawhi will definitely sign a 4 year max now, they’ll be contenders for timeeee"
If a All Time talent joined my favorite team and handed them two of the best finals performances ever while giving them two guranteed rings i would never shit on him lmao. Then again im the same one who roots for Paul George for just extending with okc so it might just be me
"Paul George was insanely athletic in his early years though. I think he'll play more like paul George in his later years without the insane athleticism, and a best-case scenario would be a mix of Luka and Tatum."
"I remember when PG was traded to OKC, there were reports that the Blazers offered a way better package but the Pacers GM turned it down because he was still salty about the Blazers firing him  EDIT: Found a link. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.blazersedge.com/platform/amp/2017/6/30/15907484/nba-free-agency-paul-george-blazers-trade-offer-rumors"
&gt; Is Luka not as good of a scorer as someone like Paul George because Luka's only done it for two years while Paul George has done it for 8-9? That's such a stupid argument.   Are we really using a superstar pick with a euro league MVP as the counter argument here?… My point is it’s still a small sample size and we haven’t seen adjustments to it yet.   This whole argument you’re positing makes me want to facepalm.
"Lmfao ok Danny.   Is Luka not as good of a scorer as someone like Paul George because Luka's only done it for two years while Paul George has done it for 8-9? That's such a stupid argument.   &gt;Lonzo's form is also, still, pretty poor  And that's how I know you don't know what you're talking about. Literally nothing wrong with his shot at this point. Pretending that there is is absolutely ridiculous, and entirely pointless because he's shooting lights out. So even if the form *was* still broken, that would only show room for further improvement and not a question of consistency.   Don't act like an authority when you literally don't know what you're talking about lmao."
"Paul George, and Jimmy Butler each had similar levels of speculation 1 year before they eventually got traded the first time.  Both were thought to be for sure traded at the trade deadline before they actually got traded in the offseason instead."
"A player like Dame is free to sign shorter contracts if he wants to move around the league at will, like other stars are doing lately.  He literally **JUST** signed a contract extension to 2025.  The team wasn't a contender when he signed it and isn't one now he knew it and everyone else.  I don't give a F about the owners.  Honestly, nobody does.  Nobody is going ""ohh woww think of the owners!""  Damian can't control what the team says and does but he can control what he says and does [like saying he wants to retire in Portland only to demand leaving a few months later](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934703-damian-lillard-on-retiring-with-blazers-i-just-dont-want-to-go-elsewhere) or like [publicly scrutinizing Paul George for ""running"" to the Clippers away from leading his own team](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/damian-lillard-accuses-paul-george-of-running-from-the-grind-in-war-of-words-after-blazers-loss-to-clippers/) or like [saying he would never assemble a superteam to win a championship](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/heres-reason-damian-lillard-says-he-would-never-join-super-team)  He publicly supported Kidd or Chauncey being hired. He then claims he had no part in the hiring.  Yea, sureeeeeeeeee.    Anyways I ain't even a Blazers fan but...  From the fan perspective: A) having a team build around their star and him leaving sucks because they've spent all of their assets building around him when he's signed to a long term contract only to have him suddenly leave and B) Lame for your superstar to say he's never leaving only to suddenly leave.  Nobody cares how it impacts owners."
&gt;Flair: Lakers  &gt;It’s not about market size  Lmao I swear to fuckin god it’s always a Lakers fan that says dumb shit like this. The biggest free agent signing in the history of the Pacers is David West lmao and it’s daylight second. Paul George went and snaked his way out of town then Victor Oladipo did the same.  Other teams have the same history it’s not just a Pacers thing.
Paul George
Hahahahaha! What was he saying to Paul George about the grind again?
His popularity on here took off when he had the beef with Paul George  Going up against him makes you instantly a favorite on r/nba
"Flair checks out. Stay classy my guy .   Kevin Love is washed. It’s okay to call every other marquee level player out—-BLACK PLAYERS—-so get the fuck outta here with this coddling of Kevin Love. He’s garbage and he’s been getting a pass, either bc he’s white or bc he evokes mental health——actually, Paul George evoked mental health too and no one cares—- so yea, it’s bc he’s white"
"Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo who is literally on the team.  Just stop bro, I’m getting secondhand embarrassment."
Paul George said he wanted to win multiple championships with the Pacers at a charity softball game and then requested a trade the next day lol
"Paul George didn't go to a superteam after 7 years in Indy, but he got hate for it - including from Dame himself. AD played 7 years in NO and never had a good enough team to even reach the WCF, and he got hate for leaving.   So what, those 2 years are the difference between super-loyal and taking the easy road?   Dame is just one of the golden boys of r/nba, he can do no wrong here."
"You could be right. But then again it's hard to say. Both franchises are motivated to make changes right now and in situations like that deals that might not otherwise happen go through. Like, look at *both* of your trades with Paul George."
Couldn't he request they trade for another superstar Instead of leaving? I don't know who but I didn't expect Kawhi and Paul George to be teammates either.
"The only thing that seems even close, and it's an insane long shot, is Paul George. It would take a total clippers melt down though. Kawhi opts out and signs elsewhere (Again, probably impossible), PG asks for a trade, and the Clippers take CJ and every possible FRP they can send plus any half attractive young player. Clippers re-stock draft picks and hope that the team implodes eventually.   Basically a moonshot. And even then it's doesn't make them favorites or anything."
"#HENRY ABBOT HATE TIME FUCK THIS GUY  Everyone slobbing on Abbott's knob...he's the same dude that said PG13 didn't go to the Lakers because of Kobe lmao.  &gt;Paul George, Angelino through and through, had once been the team’s safest choice. But sources say one reason the two-way star had re-signed with the Pacers in the fall of 2013 instead was that he was turned off by the thought that Bryant would police his efforts.  And then Paul George hopped on Twitter to directly deny it:  ""Now how crazy does that Kobe story sound to you? #MediaReachingAgain""  Fucking Phil Jackson shat on him on twitter about the same story too lol  https://twitter.com/PhilJackson11/status/524678101989851136  He's also been bad with twitter click-bait to get a reaction while picking and choosing bits of info from articles. Like his Jokic is more disadvantage than any player in the L2M reports...while not mentioning he's also literally the most advantaged too.  Henry Abbott said Bynum would have been a superstar if it wasn't for Kobe.  Henry Abott is an absolute shit stain. Look at this article. It's about Kobe's best dunks. He spent the entire article breaking down how Kobe should have passed the ball on each dunk.   &gt;But those whispers about Bryant being selfish, that have simmered throughout his career ... they don't come from nowhere.  THAT'S how he finishes an article about Kobe dunking on Steve Nash and Tim Duncan.  https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6966/kobe-bryant-s-best-all-time-dunks  Henry Abbott made his career at ESPN because he wrote shit ass article for Laker haters about Kobe."
It’s not nothing how do people keep saying this after seeing the clippers and nets supposedly have no assets and then end up with James harden and Paul George lol  Every team has the option to go all in for one year it’s just whether they choose to or not
"You think he saw Paul George alone make it to the wcf with his co star injured, and it set him off?"
Paul George
"I’m not moving the goalposts. The discussion is about whether you can get a Paul George caliber for CJ. Meanwhile you’re tossing out these trades that are completely irrelevant.  We are talking about Paul George here, not Kemba. Not Jrich. Not Gary Trent Jr   If you could get Paul George for CJ, guess what Blazers would’ve done it."
Tracy McGrady  Paul George  Paul Pierce  Vince Carter  Carmelo Anthony
Exactly. [That's why Oklahoma City is still celebrating Paul George Day ](https://twitter.com/davidfholt/status/1015381983642443777?s=20)
"&gt; surely you understand how that's different from, say, paul george joining up with kawhi in LA  Yeah Paul bailed 2 years into his deal and Lillard bailed after 1 lol.   Bailing 1 year into a 5 year supermax is not ""giving everything you had."" He deserves to get clowned after all his ""loyalty"" talk while trashing other players."
"he stayed with them for 9 years and gave everything he had for a chance at a title. surely you understand how that's different from, say, paul george joining up with kawhi in LA"
It really depends on what we hear about the Portland organization in the aftermath. If it ends up being even worse news than we know many won’t blame him. Some will but this wouldn’t be on the level of Paul George saying “trade me to LA and nowhere else” two years in a row.
CJ could become as good as anybody! He could even become as good as Paul a George or Jimmy Buckets!
"Bro remember how much you guys fucking killed him for posting that Paul George/Kobe piece? Which was likely the truth, only PG was embarrassed about his quotes so he denied it even though Abbott obviously didn't make it up?"
"...Paul George? He went for like a boatload of picks and SGA, Idt the Blazers were gonna compete with that.  Butler is a different story, Butler to Miami was clearly about him wanting to go somewhere where they wouldn't dangle him in rumors. HE chose Miami, then they made it work."
"I dont know why people keep saying this stuff..   Simmons aint it. and if Dame goes, the whole team goes. You trade him for a Paul George package not a star player."
Clippers to team up with Paul George
"Pacers were not trading Paul George away to Portland.    Pritchard still held a grudge against the team that fired him and he thought he had a better deal with Oladipo+Sabonis (two guys who did become All-Stars in Indiana).  Butler, maybe Portland could have gotten him.  Though, imo, the Wolves offer was better - better prospect in Lavine and higher draft pick in 2017 (#7 vs #10).  Portland is bare bones.  They never had the assets and I think fans are deluding themselves into thinking, ""the right move could have been made"" when there was nothing there, at all.  It's no different than some guy saying, ""Oh, man, I could have had my shot at the girl back in high school who eventually became a supermodel.  If only I made the right move back then.""  Yeah, probably not happening."
Non lottery draft picks won’t get you a Paul George type player.
"With all due respect to the Blazers, their backcourt was never capable of handling other back courts in the conference.      Steph / Klay   Paul / Booker   Parker / Ginobli   P George / K Leonard / P Bev   Conley / Mitchell       McCollum does not have the size and defensive capability required to handle most on this list, which really washes out his scoring abilities (as good as they are).       If I had to nail it down though, it really came down to Steph and Klay over all those years with Livingston off the bench that really prevented Portland from doing anything great in the playoffs for the time Dame and CJ have been together."
"I'm quite confident that Giannis, Luka, and Jokic will be int he top 5. Because they're all mvp candidates right now, and have not hit their prime.  There is no one else I'm really confident about. Tatum was my first thought, but I can't say for certain, as making the leap from a top 10 player to a top 5 player is huge. Like I don't think Paul George was ever really considered a top 5 player. Bu he is defintely on eo f the guys I'm thinking of.  Zion definitely considering him.  Trae and Morant definitely them.  I don't think Cade would make it to the top 5 that quick.  Embiid could still be there if his health holds up.  I think despite their age, Curry, Harden, and KD could all still be in the top 5.  I don't think Anthony Davis will be a top 5 player.  I'm curious to see how Lamelo and Anthony Edwards do, but I don't think they'll quite make it there.  So if I had to pick the last 2 spots for the top 5, I would go with Zion and Trae, with Tatum being the runner up."
"It's not the moves they make it's the ones they don't. We've needed a second star for years and had ample assets to get in done. In 2018, for example, CJ was 26 and we had three first round picks. How tf did we not parlay that into Paul George or Jimmy Butler or something?"
"I think Luka was the better prospect. Obviously hindsight 2020, I might just be biased by seeing Luka play for 3 years. But I also don’t know if Luka is currently top 5.  I think Cade is gonna be a better playmaking Paul George. Is that really good? yes. Is that a top 5 player at some point? maybe! Is that a top 5 player by 23? Seems like a long shot."
"If Dame actually demands a trade, and gives a list of teams he wants to play for, it’s not like the Blazers are going to have a ton of options. If Philly is on that list, the deal would be as much about the picks and additional players as it would be about Simmons. Even if it took the Blazers five years to rebuild, Simmons will be 30, not 50, and they’d probably still be able to squeeze a few good years out of him as a vet on a mostly younger team. Salaries have to at least come close to matching in a trade, and Dame is getting paid a pretty decent amount of money; Embiid is clearly off the table for the 6ers, and I don’t think they’d move Tobias over Ben (not to mention that if age is a factor, Tobias is four years older than Ben). Nobody else on Philly is on the books for more than ~$10M next year, and even if you include money that’s not fully guaranteed, like George Hill’s $10M and Paul Reed’s $1.5M, the 6ers roster outside of their top 3 is scheduled to make $20.4M as of right now. Dame is schedule to make $39.3M. A deal doesn’t get done without Embiid, Harris, or Simmons included, and the latter is the most likely to be available for Portland."
"At 10 they could have picked Donovan Mitchell or Bam, at 15 they could have taken John Collins, at 20 they could have taken Jarrett Allen or OG.  Fuck they could have gotten Kuzma at 26, at least he's still in the league.  Also could have just traded 15, 20, 26, and CJ for Paul George, that's absolutely a better looking package than Oladipo and Sabonis at that time.  Instead they got one player who has almost never played in Zach Collins and another that's already out of the league in Caleb Swanigan."
He made fun of Paul George less than a year ago
"Kawhi, Paul George, and a few 1st round draft picks. With Pat Bev's extremely intelligent playmaking/passing skillset, he and Dame would become a huge lob threat, and the Clippers would have the best defensive rating in the league. Instant Contenders.  Also gives Portland a chance to start rebuilding."
"dame won’t request a trade publicly, a trade will happen, and then while it’s breaking, woj or haynes or shams will report about how “both the blazers and lillard agreed that a move would be best for him”. same as paul george in 2019"
He was the guy that broke the Paul George trade a few days after it was reported. He's pretty legit.
Dame spent 9 years in Portland and nothing. At least okc got Russ Paul George. Thanks to that okc was probably on the verge of a play in until presti went full tank. What did Portland get Dame?
Paul George is for sure a better offensive player. He can actually stretch the floor unlike book. Add Tatum and others to that list who are obviously much better
"He doesn’t belong between 10-15 either. He’s more 15-20 There’s scorers like him or better who bring more to the table in that range. After the top 11:  Paul George - similar offensive player + good defense and better playmaker  Kyrie Irving - as a scorer, is a better ball handler, 3 point shooter, midrange shooter, and finisher + is a better playmaker  Trae Young - similar scoring numbers but is miles ahead as a playmaker, so he doesn’t have games where he doesn’t make an impact   Jimmy Butler - He had 22/7/7 on All-NBA defense and the best advanced stats of his career this season. I get he struggled in the 4 game sample size this playoffs, but he has shown he delivers in the past.  I’d also take CP3 over him, but I get how Butler and CP3 could be arguable. Booker is in line with Mitchell, Towns, and Beal. Puts him at 15-20"
"Please don't be a delusional Dubs fan spouting superlatives like this...  I'd take KD, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, OG Anunuby, Khris Middleton and Jaylen Brown immediately, as well as a healthy Kawhi and Lebron, but it's unlikely any of them are available. I'd also highly consider Nic Batum, Tobias Harris, Micheal Porter, and Harry Barnes  Wiggs is good enough and important to fill a specific role on the GSW, and he's vital to holding on to that max salary slot for trade purposes.  But he'll always be an overpaid #1 pick with significant limitations. The lack of ball handling and passing vision/BBIQ, poor FT shooting, poor rebounding, and generally bad shot selection all contribute to being an average player who has always been net-negative by BPM, RPM, RAPTOR, etc."
I mean last year he was better than Paul George tho
Lol why not? Since when does playing with ONE superstar stop a player from putting up numbers? Kyrie averaged 25 when he was with Lebron. He averaged 27 with KD and James Harden. Paul George averages 27 with Kawhi. What are you talking about?
Paul George lite
The take I read today about the Nuggets trading for Paul George.
The people who said Jimmy Butler &gt; Paul George last year. LOL  Love Butler though. Just hate who he plays for
Imagine if I DMed Paul George and he decided to fly me out to LA and give me 10m dollars.
"You'd take him over Paul George, who's fulfilled that same exact role you described?"
Why not Paul George? He's decent on defense.
Isn’t this the guy who also intentionally  he poked Paul George in the eye that very series?
Paul George?
[PG is literally his biggest fan lol](https://www.ocregister.com/2016/11/01/pacers-paul-george-credits-lakers-assistant-brian-shaw-for-his-development/)
"What this video doesn't capture enough are Crowders reactions to those obvious fouls. After the two Paul George face slaps, he was hooting and hollering like he didn't know how it was a foul. That's the worst part of Crowder, it's like he could dropkick someone and still think he didn't foul them."
"Middleton lead his team to one win against Miami.  Amazing.  No, Paul George and Middleton have very different playstyles. Paul George definitely attacks the rim a lot more and a lot better than Middleton does, hence why he has shown to be able to lead offenses in the past, and still can, and you can see by their huge differences in free throw rates and volume in scoring, and volume in attempts in the paint."
"Oh you wish Middleton was as good as Paul George.  With Kawhi gone, Paul George led the Clippers to win against the Jazz and took 2 games from the Suns in a series that could go either way.   Even when Paul George wasn't hitting shots, he was getting to the free throw line at a much higher rate, putting up many points, and was an excellent rebounder and great at getting teammates involved while breaking down defenses.   Paul George can actually be depended on to lead an offense, Middleton can not."
"He played with LeBron and Kobe in 2008, LeBron and Durant in 2012, and Durant, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, and Paul George in 2016.   But sure, let's give Carmelo all the credit! He's the greatest Olympic Basketballer!"
"It's the finals, there's only 2 teams left.  All the pent up anger people have over their miserable lives that they usually project on LeBron, Paul George etc they can't so they have to push it onto 2 rather likeable teams.  So what you're basically seeing is massive amounts of undeserved hate for the losers each night. When the Suns lose, they get hate, when the Bucks lose, they get hate.   Today the Suns hate bandwagonners are having their day, if the Suns win game 5, the Bucks hate bandwaggoners will too.  Meanwhile actual fans of each team may get a little annoyed with each other from the heat of the series, but won't feel strongly about the other team a few months removed from the series.  All this extremism/bitterness is just coming from people who are either jealous their team isn't in the finals or have some other anger in their personal lives that they are deflecting into sports."
"That's what you get for advancing to the finals. If you hadn't, we would still be talking about (read: dealing with idiots asking) whether or not Reggie Jackson is better than Paul George."
Very paul george like tbh
Middleton isn’t slightly better than Paul George. Paul George finished the one seed with Reggie Jackson as his sidekick and challenged this suns team as the obvious focal point of their defense.
"This thread is a big yikes.  Middleton’s inconsistencies are highlighted WAY more than any number two, which makes no sense. His game is predicated on tough jumpers, so his shooting is prone to variance. It has always been that way for players like him. He is on the same level as Paul George, if not slightly better.  He always comes big whenever the team needs him to. For reference look at every crucial game in the playoffs this year, not even mentioning his past playoff performances against the Celtics.  Let’s look at Kyrie’s “bad” games against the Warriors in 2016: - G1: 7-22 FG - G2: 5-14 FG - G5: 7-18 FG  Yet Kyrie has proven to show up big throughout that series. Why isn’t this the same narrative for Khris? People are spending too much time talking about his inconsistencies instead of seeing his impact in big games."
"Oh god so much worse. No Kawhi and Reggie Jackson &amp; Batum are free agents. Unless we get OKC Paul George (which is still totally possible) or we figure out a trade for someone like Kyle Lowry, we will be fighting just to not be in the play-in next year"
Being a Khris Middleton fan must be frustrating as shit. Coming from a Paul George fan lmao
"Paul George, Beal, and Westbrook deserves to be on here"
I wonder if all the people in this thread hating on Chris Paul are the same people waiting for Paul George to have a bad game.
I think Mitchell edges out Booker slightly cause ive seen Mitchell carry his team and go super saiyan to get it done. Like when he eliminated westbrook and paul george from the playoffs          Booker is fine player but the dude was the best player on awful teams up until the bubble      And needed cp3 to lead this team to relevance
"Just got into basketball so I don't know the history of everything Pat Bev has done, but he's so hated, his shove on Paul got so much more traction than Jae Crowder's purposeful eye poke on Paul George that made his eyelid bleed. Imagine if he didn't blink on time..."
"best case scenario he is like post leg break pacers paul george but worse d and better o. worst case he is like later years knicks melo, inefficient chucker but with better playmaking ability"
"The thunder teams after kd left were never that good. They still had no spacing and just replaced Durant with Paul George. The rockets team was falling apart, and the wizards were lottery bound without Westbrook   It’s just weird to me people can watch a dude carry middling or lottery teams to the playoffs and write him off as a loser since he can’t win as the best guy. As of now there’s 4 dudes in the league who have proven they can win it as the number one guy (Kawhi/bron/curry/Giannis). There’s a lot of great players who have yet to win it as the main franchise guy and that doesn’t mean they suck. It’s just really hard to do.    Westbrook has flaws, particularly with shooting and the need to try and take over late in games, but he wins game. He’s got like a 70% win percentage when he gets a triple double. That’s not empty stats or stat padding, that’s playing winning basketball"
"Kawhi being injured didn't leave a black hole in the roster. Paul George and especially Reggie Jackson stepped up. Sure it was a downgrade, but not a significant one. Suns could have lost with Kawhi healthy, but they could have won just the same."
KD + Harden + Paul George + Beal and now Lebron and AD &gt; Dirk + Stoudemire.  It's not that hard to figure out.
Amare was DEFINITELY better than Paul George.
"1. So we’re just gonna disregard the Portland series with Paul George as well? Ok.   2. Lol Harden was literally 6th man of the year. What are you talking about? He was definitely a 6th man for you guys and that was due to the fact that he was forced to come off the bench with OKC. That’s evidenced by the fact that when he went to Houston he averaged 25 in his *first year with them*. Having to play with two other perimeter players is what held him back because there’s only one ball and he couldn’t be the ball dominant player he ultimately became in Houston. There’s no scenario where you guys could have formed a legitimate big 3 with Harden, Westbrook, and Durant"
"I mean, Russ has played with some pretty unbelievable teammates, I could easily argue it is those teammates that helped drive winning/advancing over Russ. The one year he didn't the Thunder got trounced in the first round of the playoffs.  Every other year of his career he has had at least one of Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Paul George. This year with Beal, who you could argue is a tier below those guys, the Wiz also got thrashed."
"Russ certainly has been paired with a lot of top tier players over his career, so his lack of success can't be on supporting cast alone:     * young KD and young Harden * prime Paul George and aged Melo * prime Harden * prime Beal"
"&gt; In the final 23 games of the 2021 season, Westbrook carried the Wizards to a 17-6 record, while putting up 23/13.5/14 and averaging 1.6 steals per game  I can find a stretch of regular season games last year where Paul George played great, too. But all anyone said was ""prove it in the playoffs"" - including PG himself.   The difference is PG proved it in the playoffs last year, while Westbrook continued a multi-year trend of playoff decline."
paul george is trash and butler is better
"And none of the players are as good as KD, Paul George, Harden or CP3"
"\&gt; he very clearly declined  On paper, he was 3rd in PER, the same spot he was in the previous year.   Using the eyetest, he perfectly transitioned to a more off-ball position (as well as a non-shooter could) and would still cook mofos off the dribble whenever LeBron went off the court.  \&gt;He was no the same player physically, he didn't move as fast.  A lot less chances to show off your speed off the dribble when your playing as an offball slasher and have LeBron as an outlet pass on fastbreaks. If there was a decline it was minimal because he was still lethal at the rim and on fast breaks.  \&gt;He could shut down anyone before  Key individuals he guarded for a significant portion of games in 2012 Playoffs:   J.R. Smith who shot 12ppg on 31%.  Paul George (before he was a star) who shot 10ppg on 37%.    Danny Granger (secondary defender on him) who shot 13ppg on 38%.  Ray Allen who shot 12ppg on 38%   James Harden 13ppg on 38%  Russel Westbrook (secondary defender) 27ppg on 43%   Outside of Westbrook who he wasn't even a primary defender on, the others all shot significantly worse from their regular season standard.  \&gt; he used to get a ton of blocks for a guard.  He tied his career high in blocks per game in less minutes per game."
"Nash has never had teammates as good as Russ’s. Russel Westbrook has Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Paul George. I love Amare but Prime Nash never had anywhere near those level of teammates. Put Kevin Durant on those sun teams and remove Amare they win a minimum of one championship if not more."
"Yeah, the Celtics will have to figure out a way to dump Horford for sure. I'll be honest though, I don't see the Celtics doing all of that (especially not extending Smart or Williams, or exploring trades for Smart) unless they somehow know 100% that Beal will sign with them, and they can't know that. As someone who heard Paul George and Kawhi say in consecutive summers that they planned to sign with my team in free agency one year later, trust me, you can't count on that.   I think if Boston lets Smart and Williams walk in pursuit of Beal and it doesn't work out, then Boston will be in real danger of pissing off Tatum and Brown. You don't want those two coming up for contract extensions in a couple years having watched virtually every good teammate they've ever had just walk away from the team."
"Because people view Russ shooting as awful and refuse to see it in any other way. This also applies to Paul George and some of his poor performances in OKC. When they were doing bad no role players was going to step up for them so they just had to try to shoot their way out of it, leading to super awful games that people can then just clown. Kobe used to do the same thing, when he was having a bad game he would double down(which again you can fault, but sometimes the star trying to shoot out of it is better than putting the ball in Fisher and Artest and young Ariza's hands and acting like that will be better.   Should a balance exist? Yes but the team construction has to exist for that balance to exist. It's like everyone blaming Gobert for the Clippers collapse when he was trying to guard the paint and perimeter at the same time because no one on the Jazz could stay in front of their man. If Westbrook stopped shooting in these games, didn't even bother and just tried to create, it would look a lot like game 7 suns/Lakers in 2006 where people said Kobe quit because he finally stopped trying to take over. The rest of the team will just struggle and unlike Westbrook, they can't even initiate the play. They can't get open on their own. The answer is literally never as simple as ""the star should give it to the lesser player because he's playing badly"". Russ does feed the hot hand, but if he no one is hot what's the alternative."
"Exactly, and especially in a small market team - you have to have some sort of reason for professionals to go there.   I remember a few years back how cut throat Larry Bird was. Danny Granger gave the Pacers his prime, only for Larry to trade him when the team was finally decent. He then threw Frank Vogel and Paul George under the bus - and then Pacers fans were surprised when George left. I was like ""Dude was 95% out the door when you traded Granger, then you fired Frank and it was done..""   Indiana doesn't have anything going for it besides the possibility of a family atmosphere. Small market teams have to pay attention to that. And OKC has made itself a team that great players won't mind playing for."
Pure unadulterated cap. Raptors didn't trade siakam for Paul George and sources say we would move og and siakam for Moses Brown?? 🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
"And ""did right by"" with Paul George, Westbrook, Muscala (they offer him to go back on his signing after they traded George)"
Am I crazy for thinking it's not consensus that the Clippers will make the playoffs? Their best player is out the whole season. Paul George is guaranteed to miss games for load management and also has a big injury history. Terance Mann looked great but he's expected to take a pretty big leap in production based on a small sample size.
"Trust me they would. That's why superstars get to demand trades in the first place. Not treating a superstar right really hurts your chances with other stars. It would also piss off Paul George who wants to be paired with Kawaii in the first place.  Also most of the star players who will be in free agency will be Brooklyn's core. Assuming they don't want to break up their super team you're not getting any of them... So you're left with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle, John Wall.... I think Leonard is better when healthy than those players.  Also signing a new super star means you have to make the cap room. You can't just use your bird rights. Makes you lose a lot of talent, sometimes assets to move contracts."
tbf to Paul George Presti gave him that option when he signed the contract
"Ngl Stephs name musta been in my head cause I didn’t even mean to type Steph lol, im on my work break and meant Khris Middleton. Paul George is another"
"One big one is that Kawhi was actually worse than Paul George in the second round last year despite no one thinking of it that way  Paul George's ""Pandemic P"" clowning actually came mostly in the first round and didn't really come back until game 7 of the second round"
"Navigating through CBA is highly debatable.  During the Kupchak era, Lakers had some very qualified CBA experts at their disposal such as Larry Coon and one more person whose name I can’t remember.  Jim Buss/Mitch Kupchak themselves were very good at it too.  And contacting free agents before free agency starts?  That is a topic more suited to morality than who’s the better GM.   Mitch doing the right thing should be commended for.  Regardless, Lakers during the Kupchak era had consistently been able to get meetings with top free agents even after Kupchak contacted them after free agency starts  Fact of the matter is, Pelinka has been caught tampering when NBA discovered txt messages between Pelinka and Paul George causing Lakers to not be able to even attempt to get him.  You can easily judge Pelinka by the moves he has made so far.  And so far each year has made mistakes in different ways that Kupchak would not have made."
"The Bulls are paper champions, but they can’t defend and they made a huge mistake overpaying DeRozan, who won’t have the ball enough to be effective. It reminds me of the Thunder getting Carmelo after trading for Paul George, which Billy Donovan also bungled.  They also gave up a ton of first round picks and can’t trade one until 2027? That’s ridiculous if you’re a team that won’t contend for championships.  The winners are definitely the Lakers, they unfortunately got a lot better and improved in all the right areas."
"except he isnt  just off the top of my head steph, dame, seth, joe harris, ingles, paul george, klay"
The Paul George route.
"If people are discounting the Lakers because AD is always hurt, we gotta start doing the same with Kawhi and the Clippers. His health sucks and a team is gonna feel better going up against Paul George and Reggie Jackson instead of Kawhi."
paul george and co going nuclear for a couple weeks to stay alive without Kwahii isn't the same as lasting a whole season.
"Late night thought, Kawhi hasnt made a decision yet and I would be shocked if the Clippers didnt offer him a 5 year max deal like they did with Paul George. Warriors actually have the assets to pull of a sign and trade and they still are in Cali  Just saying....."
"It ain’t this, they already gutted their team to add Paul George."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"2013 AD would get the LeGM special and that’s being flipped for another player like Paul George or fat KLove. Maybe even like Horford, LMA, Noah,"
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
KG is a million times better than Bam will ever be. Same can be said about Paul Pierce and Paul George
"This is a fun exercise and I appreciate you making content.  I will say, 2008 KG had an 8.2 BPM and a 6 Vorp.  No offense to Bam but he’s not in that league right now.  33 year old Ray was a much different player than Murray. A taller more effective defender but he didn’t handle the ball like Murray.   Paul Pierce went to the hole a lot more than Paul George but they are still fairly comparable.   He and Ray had lower usage at that point than Murray and George.  Rondo was a semi-platoon player in 2008. Simmons is much better than that Rondo.  James Posey played more than Perk actually.  Tony Allen and Eddie House played significant minutes on that team.  Old Sam Cassell did in the playoffs."
Paul George just has to shit his pants during a game
I would put Middleton above Paul George.
"They traded for Paul George, only to then re sign him (which the Thunder also did fyi) not really making much of an argument"
"&gt; Yet the Clippers don't get nearly the amount of FAs as the Lakers  yeah they def didnt sign reigning finals mvp kawhi leonard recently, oh yeah and superstar paul george"
"Kawhi will be gone the whole year &amp; Paul George is still Paul George.    GSW is gonna make a big trade.  But even then, they’ll be decently deep with the only winning championship system left in the league.    What has Dallas done to put themselves over a healthy Warriors team?    Maybe the Nuggs could go above them."
So OKC blew it up by trading for Paul George...?
Paul George to the clippers
"Paul George did when he signed with OKC. I remember watching it thinking ""this is just like the decision""."
"&gt; The Decision   Not talking about him signing with the Lakers. During The Decision, LeBron told the ew York Knicks, Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Clippers, and the Cavaliers that he was considering them for FA. These teams made offseason moves postured around acquiring LeBron. Dude then went on national TV and had an hour long special about how he was taking the Heat. Hate Kawhi all you want but at least the dude didn't have a TV special announcing how he was screwing your team  Also, Kawhi didn't ""string them along"" intentionally like that, he was close to signing with these other teams. https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-open-offseason-process"
[He literally said himself he was close to signing with The Lakers or Raptors. LMFAO](https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-open-offseason-process)
"I mean, Kawhi was literally waiting for The Clippers to make a trade for Paul George before committing.    What do you want him to do? Lose his leverage to make The Lakers happy? You realize how silly that sounds? Lebron literally did the same thing with The Heat and The Bulls."
"And then Lebron and AD showed up a year after.  You might not understand this as a Lakers fan, but most franchises dont get all star free agents at all.  Small market teams never get free agents.  Even bigger markets like Chicago and Philly don’t have the pull of NY/LA.  The Sixers biggest FA signing in the past 30+ years was Al Horford, who they had to vastly overpay to get.     NY/LA/MIA teams have gotten Lebron, Ad, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Butler and Lowry all either signing there or demanding to be traded there in the past 3 years.  You can’t ignore there is a massive advantage being located in those cities"
I think it’s the same year Kawhi called Jimmy and then Paul George after Jimmy signed with the Heat
So you're a European NBA fan with a Paul George flair who resents Americans following Euro players/teams?
See: Paul George
"Those are just 2 teams though. I expect the Knicks to take a step back and the Warriors healthy should be a top 4 west team. Also this is a conversation about next year, I don't expect the Lakers to be a 7th seed again.    Saying the rest of the East would be fighting for playoff spots is just silly. The Heat (with Lowry), Hawks, Celtics are absolutely on the same tier as the Blazers, Paul George led Clippers, and Mavs. You flip those West teams to the East and they are not guaranteed the 4-6 seeds.   The East has stronger contenders. Both conferences have a very similar middle class, though I will give the edge to the West. The East has better fringe playoff teams. And the West has more clear lottery teams (Minny, OKC, Houston, San Antonio, Sac vs. Detroit, Cleveland, Orlando)."
"You gotta remember, Bron, Steph, B Beal, Paul George, AD, Kawhi, etc still aren’t here. If everyone came these games wouldn’t be close"
Can you imagine trading him and five first-round picks for Paul George
"I’m not sure why the Clippers trade Kennard, he was good for them off the bench. You already have Paul George who is a good all around scorer and defender. Why take away shooters?  The Clippers made the WCF because of shooting, and Reggie Jackson he was playing at such an elite level"
Nearly beat Kawhi and Paul George by himself
This is a Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler situation where one is useless when the other has the ball. You would prefer for LeBron to have the ball because he is the better desicion maker but that means Westbrook is useless and his defenser can sag off into the paint making it harder for ad and lebron. Or you can have lebron playing off ball which isn't playing to his strengths at all. I get they need a playmaker to play do anything when LeBron isn't on the court but 50 million sounds mighty expensive for a glorified sixth man. If the issue was playing with LeBron of the court then all i can say it's a coaching issue. The clippers don't have any phenomenal playmaker and still manage to be cohesive with only one of Paul George or kawhi out there all because of the coaching change. It just doesn't feel like the best move without considering how Russel Westbrook has been injured parts of the last four seasons
"Harden, KD, LeBron, AD, Dame, Jokic, Embiid, Tatum, Luka, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis, Beal, Butler, CP3, Paul George?  This is in no order. And didn't put much thought into it."
Great news! That Paul George trade couldn’t have worked out any better for OKC.
Bro what the hell do you want from them. They took Kawhi and Paul fucking George to game 7…
so you would trade westbrook for Paul George straight up?
Guy went to the Paul George school of shooting clutch free throws
"The vast, vast majority do Bro. Everyone has a house in LA/Southern California . Lebron, Drake, Dave Chappell, Obama, Jay-Z, Kobe had one in the OC, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Tom Cruise, The Rock, Kevin Hart. When you have east coasters like Kevin Hart, Jay-Z and ASAP Rocky moving to the west coast you know it’s the number one spot. How many west coast people you know moving to New York? New York is not what it used to be dude. It’s more popular for people out of the country, for sure, but celebrities who grew up in America prefer LA for sure, or at least my generation does. Look at the LA TEAMS, Paul George, Westbrook, and Kawhi all from LA. Kawhi literally left a championship winning squad to come home to LA, no one would do that to be in New York. I’m not tryna stir hate, I’m just putting you in the mind of a celebrity\Nba player"
For some reason I read it as Paul George and my mind was blown for a short while.
"Noah , Dragic, AL Jefferson , Paul george.... math isn't that hard   Then why are you bitching about Gasol ?"
"Paul George it. Secure the bag, then demand a trade."
Paul George is making the same amount of money and he hasn't done shit in the NBA.
"Paul George is a better shooter than Russ, and a better teammate."
"? They made it to the WCF this year and put up a good fight despite Kawhi being down. They made it farther than the Lakers or the Nets. Paul George averaged 27 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in the playoffs, with similar stats during the regular season."
"tbf the only reason Harden didn’t net that is because he kinda forced his way to the Nets and we got essentially everything they could offer. AD also cost the Lakers everything except Kuzma (and LeBron of course).  Paul George got SGA, Gallinari, and every pick possible from the Clippers."
LMAO you know you're a rat when even KD tells your ass to fuck off.  Kawhi really got his PR team out here trying to paint him on some machiavelli shit when the best super team he could assemble was Paul Fucking George? It's sure been working wonders so far fellas!
"The NBA doesn't *really* care about tampering unless it's blatant AND public. Players talk to other players and teams (via their agents) all the time but they are only fined when they do it on TV or something like that (like Magic winking ant Paul George to go to the Lakers).  The rules are that you can't talk to people from other teams in general and for free agency teams can't talk to players/agents/other teams before a certain time (a couple of hours from now). Nobody actually follows that rule which is evidenced by teams signing players a minute after that time. The NBA has never actually done anything about this which makes the tampering rule pretty pointless.  Anyway, what happened last year was that Woj reported the Bogdanovic trade as a done deal before the time when teams are allowed to start talking which put the obvious tampering in the public eye and that's when the NBA actually cares, when it looks bad for them and people talk about it.   That's why the Bucks got fined. If Woj had worded his twits different it wouldn't have happened. It's something everybody does but the NBA looks the other way unless it's blatant, that's why Bucks fans blame Woj."
"She had sources with Jeanie. After the Magic Johnson/Rob Pelinka shit where she said Pelinka didn't know how the salary cap works and all that, she was blocked out. She has sources with CAA. Paul George is a CAA client so it makes a lot of sense there.  She used to be a good insider for the Lakers but stopped being one over the last 2 years."
I dunno. I remember him stripping Paul George for a steal in crunch time of the wave bye-bye game. Hit some big shots too.
"I agree. Everything else about what went down in the before and after of the Paul George trade got leaked, even the voice mail from Jerry West earlier this year, but this tidbit was a best kept secret until today? I don't buy that shit lol"
Ballmer's gonna overpay to keep him he's boys with Paul George also if your giving him enough where he would actually leave LAC it's just not gonna end up great
"Thunder originally weren't going to move on from Westbrook and Paul George, no matter how much Dame called it."
"Players work together towards a common goal. You can say Westbrook didn't owe the Thunder anything, but he absolutely did owe Paul George something after recruiting him to come play there. PG relied on Westbrook nit snaking him when he signed that contract."
"Paul George grew like 2 inches when he was already in the NBA. The body is weird, it happens.  [Source](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/210814-pacers-paul-george-grows-two-inches-since-last-season)"
Paul George grew 2 inches when he was a pro. It used to be joked about so frequently but it was when he was like 21 I think
Lebron didn't persuade Paul George to re-sign in OKC and then leave.
Kawahi called Paul George and said I want to play with you dog. I already talked to Russ. Don’t tell russ
Lmao where’s all the people who said he wasn’t gonna sign a contract extension and ask out because he lost in the first round to fucking kawhi leonard and paul george in 7 games
"You are clueless . Paul George is a fuckin snake     Signs a 4 year contract , Tells the city of OKC he's here to stay tells Westbrook there gonna be playing together   Bails immediately the next year after getting waxed by Lillard in the playoffs."
"You say that now obviously ( twisting the narrative )   But we were debating star players and contracts , and Paul George is the biggest snake"
"Kawhi Leonard reportedly spurned Russell Westbrook in favor of Westbrook's then-Oklahoma City Thunder teammate Paul George before signing with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2019, according to [Ramona Shelburne](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook) of ESPN.  Per Shelburne, Westbrook initiated a conversation with Leonard about teaming up in Los Angeles, but Leonard responded by reaching out to George instead.  The Clippers eventually traded for George and signed Leonard as a free agent to create a top contender in the Western Conference. Westbrook was traded to the Houston Rockets later that offseason and has since moved to the Washington Wizards and [now](https://www.nba.com/news/wizards-russell-westbrook-traded-to-lakers) the Los Angeles Lakers.   "
"LMAO.    Exhibit A. Paul George.   Signs a 4 year contract , Tells the city of OKC he's here to stay tells Westbrook there gonna be playing together   Bails immediately the next year after getting waxed by Lillard in the playoffs. There's no loyalty in the NBA ."
Because Kawhi couldn't handle playing with an alpha male like Westbrook wanting the ball barking in his ear for sitting games etc. He definitely meshes with a passive Paul George never saying shit just being a constant distraction....
Kinda double standards considering Kawhi joined the Clippers WITH a Paul George coming off a 3rd-place MVP season .......
Think of the second star we could’ve gotten with all those picks! It could have even been Paul George!
"The story is very widely known, OP's point was about trading all of what they did for PG, instead of having Kawhi sign outright next to SGA and then trade for other pieces.  But it wasn't a trade for Paul George, and Kawhi wasn't going to sign outright. They gave up all of those assets for both players, which would turn a huge overpay into the steal of the century. Not to mention SGA is significantly worse than Paul George in the years that Kawhi is trying to win a championship."
People gonna act like Kawhi is some genius like he didn’t just blow a 3-1 lead with Paul George to Jokic and the Nuggets
"The actual article says ""Paul George."" OP shortened it to ""Paul"" for some reason."
"Sga right now won't even lace Paul George's shoes, what's this exactly? Kawhi and Paul George is much much much better then what you suggesting but I respect your opinion"
"&gt; The trade was for Kawhi AND Paul George  Only because that is what Kawhi demanded, which was OP's point."
"&gt; I mean, he basically coerced the Clips into trading SGA + Gallo + 5 unprotected picks and 2 swaps for PG.  The trade was for Kawhi AND Paul George. Functionally it was only for George but they got two All NBA wings for that package, not just one. And they've turned out to be a pretty good team so I'm not sure the ""what if"" is any more appealing. Paul George is the other high level player lol"
Chris Paul or Paul George
She broke the Paul George to OKC trade in 2017 by the way.
The title is confusing toe because I associate Chris Paul more with OKC now than I do Paul George. Alsoaube because it's just so informal to say Paul there.
"I do in this case since she is a CAA shill and Paul George is a CAA client. She writes puff pieces for all the CAA guys including Embiid who just recently fired CAA. She has very good sourcing on Embiid, Paul George and most CAA guys."
Mitchell beat Okc with Russ and George his rookie year. Book didn’t even sniff the playoffs until he got Chris Paul
Paul George

Paul George
Main: Luka  Dark: Paul George
"1. There’s no reason to keep an injury prone small forward when you already have 2 better ones lol, granger is gone by the time Kawhi is a starter   2. Like I said, in Kawhi’s first 3 seasons, is that team beating Miami? I’m not sure. Even if they do, can they beat OKC or San Antonio?  3. Again, he left a team that made the playoffs 20 straight times and held out of games to get traded. Paul George asked for a trade, what’s telling Kawhi doesn’t either?"
"1. Then he becomes a 3rd option.   2. Paul George was an all star before he hurt his ankle, and Kawhi had already won DPOY.   3. He and Paul George are friends he probably doesn’t leave him.   What does your last point about the draft trade have to do with anything. That’s irrelevant to the question."
"1. Granger already had injury issues by the time Kawhi was drafted, Kawhi being drafted doesn’t change that  2. By the time Kawhi became an all star, Paul George destroyed his ankle, that probably doesn’t change just because of Kawhi   3. Kawhi left the most competent organization in NBA history to play at home, he’s probably gonna do the same to Indiana   They probably lose to Miami in 2011-2014 again, then they’d lose to Cleveland in 2015-2017/18 and Kawhi asks out after that   Plus, the Pacers didn’t really draft Kawhi lol, the trade was already made and the Spurs told the Pacers who to draft"
"Surprised nobody has said clippers yet... Kawhi, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, Nic Batum even."
Paul George goes by PP for initials though
Paul Silas  Paul Pierce  Paul Pressey  Paul George  Paul Millsap
"That’s true but this sub flip flops on so much shit, just look at the Paul George shit. Last year it was nothing but memes about him but now everyone says those memes were fucked up, the upvotes/downvotes don’t make sense, there’s definitely a shit ton of people that act like they weren’t part of things they talk so smugly about"
"I know, right?  Those aren’t even his initials, and Paul George is still playing!"
"Paul George, pat bev, Lou will, montrez Harrel, zubac    Oh wait, that’s just the clippers"
"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
Clippers won 4 playoff games without Kawhi. Paul George dominated and led to the team a win streak without Kawhi in February. If anyone picks the Clippers they have clearly not been watching the team.
"Lmao this sub will compare Simmons to Harden and Paul George when they want to shit on the sixers not trading him, then say it’s nothing like those situations when they want to shit on the Sixers’ asking price.   George and Harden (George especially) were traded because the teams were blowing it up and got huge returns. There have been reports that the Sixers are willing to trade him for a haul comparable to those.   What the Sixers aren’t going to do is sell low and make the team worse with no other avenue to improve, just to satisfy the trade demands of a player whose only leverage is to make the team believe he’ll throw games for 4 years? Sixers are going to call that bluff until they can get a star in return, end of story."
What about Harden? Or Paul George?

"The west was really hard to do for me, they have ***a lot*** of talent out there and it's spread pretty well. My reasoning behind it is Jokic is still the reigning MVP and Murray isn't expected to miss the whole season if I'm not mistaken. The clips I'm giving Paul George a lot of credit here for how well he handled the job while Kawhi was out in the playoffs. I'm also banking on the Lakers not gelling like one would think with Westbrook  The big thing for the west imo is it seems like no one got better really except the Lakers"
"Superstar? Lol no. Pau was never a superstar, he was a very smart player who knew exactly what he could and couldn’t do and had amazing synergy with Kobe that made him look better. But he was never a superstar. AD is a superstar #2, Pau isn’t. Paul George is closer to a superstar than Pau ever was."
"KD mentally checked out of that Western Conference Finals, that's why we lost. Say what you will about Westbrook but he carried the Thunder that series and made it competitive. By the time OKC faced GSW Perkins was not on the roster, Waiters was on a full blown redemption tour, Roberson was being snubbed as the DPOY.   Oh and it's Paul ""Playoof P"" George and Billy Donovan who let us down those Westbrook led years. But hey, let's hear it from the fan of the team who thinks Randle is any good and Thibs won't ride this team down to the ground."
Absolute ceiling is Paul George without the playmaking ability
"They don't all play 70 games though and the stats reflect that which is why many of those players aren't as valuable as Gobert in a rating system that cares about cumulative impact.   Let's say the goal is to build the team that wins the most regular season games over the course of the next four years. All players are locked in for 4 years with no trades, no free agency, and new players never enter the league.   1. Giannis   2. Jokic  3. Doncic   4. Embiid   5. Gobert   6. Durant   7. Curry   8. Harden   9. Lillard   10. Paul George"
4 easiest ways to get karma on r/nba  Pat Bev bad  Pelicans dumb  “I thought Paul George was bad” on a positive Paul George post   Steve Blake copypasta
Laughs in Paul George
I think Aaron Gordon helps because with Grant gone they lost their wing defender but they got rid of Gary Harris who was their best guard defender. I felt better about them when they had both last year which was enough to slow down Paul George and Kawhi
"It's not about being dominant.  It's about whether they would win the chip or not.  &amp;#x200B;  We can agree that in 2018 there were very few players better than KD. Even with KD, the rockets almost knocked them out.  &amp;#x200B;  So yes with Paul George, Warriors will be dominant and most likely still be in the top 2 seed and make conference finals. Would they beat 2018 Rockets? I don't think so.  &amp;#x200B;  Now do the same with the opponents being 2017 Cavs."
Smart’s been selected for 1st team all defense twice (each of the two seasons before this one).   Other guards currently in the league who have 2 first team selections include  * Paul George * Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Ben Simmons   The list of guards who’ve made more than 2 is  * Chris Paul  That’s it. So no I don’t think there are that many guards out there who have Smart’s skillset.
It’s crazy how guys are just casually practicing half court shots. I like this kid. Gotta work on footwork though man. That was such a bigger part of the game back in the day. One of the guys with the best footwork is Paul George. Think about if this kid could get that level of footwork.
"Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, are you saying you don't think replacing Harrison Barnes on the 73-9 Warriors with Paul George is enough to beat the Cavs?"
"Yeah, but that Cavs team was unstoppable in the east. And in that series, KD being unguardable was the difference.  Paul George is not that.  I see that series going different if it’s PG other than KD. Or back to the original argument, any good SF other than KD.  No, it’s the once in a generation probably best scorer of this generation added to a 73 win team that made them head and shoulders above the rest of the league"
"You seem to be veering into a KD vs PG or KD vs Steph debate, which this is not about. This is about a 73-9 team that won a championship and then lost a championship in game 7 replacing Harrison Barnes with Paul George. They don't go 16-1 but they obviously win back-to-back championships if healthy. PG doesn't have to outplay Steph for that to happen, all he has to do is outperform Barnes which is a given."
"Again, much easier to not have those streaks when the pressure is off you and you can just sit back and watch a 73 win team do the work for you.   It just makes everything easier. Paul George doesn’t have to perform at an A+ level for the team to succeed."
&gt; You put someone like Paul George in that position and I’d say Lebron is a 5x Champion right now  &gt;People forget that 2016-2017 Cavs were actually performing far better than the year previously and Bron was on a war path in those years.   Is this the same Lebron who barely beat the PG/Jeff Teague/Lance Stephenson/Thaddeus Young/Myles Turner pacers in 2017?
"I was a KD fan long before he came to the Nets. I’ve also been watching basketball for awhile, so I know. You couldn’t just put “anyone” on those Warriors and still immediately win, which is what you applied.   Does Paul George make them better than with HB? Of course. Does PG dominant to the level KD did that series? Nobody knows but considering the *BIG* difference between KD and Paul, I’m going to say no. That man not outplaying Lebron at that point cause that was the huge factor in 2017 finals lol. Also  Let us look at KD vs Steph in those finals  Player	|PPG	|RPG	|APG	|SPG	|BPG	|TPG	|TS	|+/-	 Durant	|28.9	|10.75	|7.5	|0.75	|2.0	|2.25	|65%	|+86	 Curry	|27.5	|6.0	|6.75	|1.5	|0.75	|2.75	|56%	|+47	   KD  28.9 PPG  10.75 RPG  7.5 APG  .75 SPG  2.0 BPG  2.25 TPG  65% TS  +/- (per game) +20.25  +/- (raw)  +86  Curry  27.5 PPG  6.0 RPG  6.75 APG  1.5 SPG  .75 BPG  2.75 TPG  56% TS  +/- (per game) +11.75  +/- (raw) +47  Edit:  Durant outperformed him in almost every statistical category.  That one horrible game from Curry really hurt in the sample of 4.  KD went supernova efficiency wise in 2 and mediocre in 2.  Definitely seems like KD's award.  KD on the floor +86 and -26 when he's off, he's net +112.  Steph on the floor +44 and +16 with him off the floor, net +26.  KD's ""bad"" game he had 29/9/7  on 8-22 shooting while steph went 3-16 in game 3 which KD carried them hard for that game. Overall series, KD has more points on significantly better efficiency, more rebounds, more assists, more blocks, less turnovers.  Steph didn't play bad but I think KD deserves it.  Also has the highest +/- for the Dubs in all 4 games  Game 1 Durant +17 when on floor, -7 when off Curry +10 on floor, 0 off  Game 2 Durant +24 on floor, -5 off Curry +19 on floor, 0 off  Game 3 Durant +15 on floor, -7 off Curry 0 on floor, +8 off  Game 4 Durant +30 on floor, -7 off Curry +15 on floor, +8 off  Durant has led both teams in all 4 games in his +/- when on the floor and has also had the lowest +/- margin when off the floor  Durant +86 on floor, warriors are -26 with him off. Durant’s a net +112  Curry +44 on floor, warriors are +16 when he’s off. Curry’s a net +28.  Durant led the team in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, Fg%, 3P%, TS% and also had the highest  +/- every game  Game 1 Durant +17 when on floor, -7 when off Curry +10 on floor, 0 off  Game 2 Durant +24 on floor, -5 off Curry +19 on floor, 0 off  Game 3 Durant +15 on floor, -7 off Curry 0 on floor, +8 off  Game 4 Durant +30 on floor, -7 off Curry +15 on floor, +8 off  Durant has led both teams in all 4 games in his +/- when on the floor and has also had the lowest +/- margin when off the floor  Durant +86 on floor, warriors are -26 with him off. Durant’s a net +112  Curry +44 on floor, warriors are +16 when he’s off. Curry’s a net +28.  KD averaged  28.8ppg 10.8 rpg 7.5apg and 2.3 bpg with the 3rd highest TS percentage in NBA finals history only behind is last year dominance and when he was 23 years old against prime LBJ.  Edit: He shot 53% from the field 41% from 3 ppint line and 96% from free throw line   **long story short** applying that PG Warriors would be just as dominant, applies PG outperforms Steph and is somewhat close to Lebron in production. I’m sorry but there’s nothing you could say to convince me PG is on that level  PG could have been playing with the dream team and **still** not elevate the way KD does"
Agree. Paul George has 40% probability in playoffs to shoot under 40% EFG and go 2/18. This loses you games.
"You’re a Nets fan so obviously you’re biased, but a 73 win team that replaces their fourth best player with Paul George would be absolutely dominant   They may lose a few more games and have to try a bit harder. But they would steamroll the entire competition. **It’s a 73 win team that’s replacing their fourth best player with Paul George**"
Bruh with Paul George they’d be nearly just as dominant lol. That’s a 73 win team that replaces their 4th best player with Paul George…
"I disagree. You put someone like Paul George in that position and I’d say Lebron is a 5x Champion right now   People forget that 2016-2017 Cavs were actually performing far better than the year previously and Bron was on a war path in those years. I agree that it was a terrible decision for KD, but saying just **anyone** could have took his place and immediately won is ridiculous   As we saw the following year in 2018, Bron was on a straight war path and knocking out teams solo. He likely could have won in 2017. The problem for the Cavs was a top 3 player on a 73 win team. Not just *anyone* was going on that Warriors team and stopping Lebron"
Jimmy Butler:   Paul George:
"Yeah he definitely gets a ton of touches but I would also say the comment you replied to is correct that he doesn't have the ball in his hands as much as guards.   If you sort the NBA advanced stats by touches and look at Time of Possession, Trae, Luka, Harden, and Westbrook are top 4 as you'd expect. Jokic is tied for 46th, around Paul George and Jrue levels."
"except Westbrook took shots like he was the 1st option, especially in crunch time. most notably 2012 Finals  and Westbrook even had a higher USG% than Harden too in the playoffs in games played together. same with Paul George"

"Bcuz the narratives on Lebron always change. He didn’t have “1 bad game in the series” that was an all time underperformance. He has only won rings with insane supporting casts as well. Heatles superteam, lakers w AD, and Kyrie was unstoppable in 2016 lol. And making it to the finals in the East 9 times in the 2010s isn’t as great as it sounds. His hardest comp after 2012 was the derozan? Paul George? The hawks? And my point about kd was comparing how he gets shit on for still performing in w the warriors after joining if he played like Lebron did in 2011 he would get absolutely shit on for it…"
Yeah cus KD and Jeff Green could defend LeBron and Paul George or Kawhi. Mitchell and Haliburton are traffic cones for star SFs
“As a Lakers fan I’m hoping every first rounder 2nake forced Ballz to trade to get PG13% (after they gave him the Key to the City and declared a Paul George Day) ends up being a first overall pick for OKC”   Wut
I'm not sure why Tony gets the most shit for this. No one ever brings up Wade cheating on Gabrielle Union. Or Paul George cheating on Austin Rivers sister and offering to give his mistress a million dollars to get an abortion. Or Klay Thompson whose girlfriend walked in on him naked in the bed with someone else. Nope. Everyone just remembers Tony lol.
And the East was terrible when he was dominating it! Paul George and the Pacers were arguably his toughest opponent
"What was the best team lebron beat to get to the finals when he was In The East all those years? The Roy Hibbett Paul George Pacers? Jordan beat Ewing and starks, Miller, price and Daugherty, Thomas and dumars, hardaway and O’Neal, Barkley (when he was still  in philly), Wilkins, Bird, mchale and parish (old, but still playing).    Lebron beat Kyle Lowry and senator derozan over and over and over.  Oh, and John wall and Bradley Beal.   Who did Jordan beat in the finals? Malone, stockton, Barkley, magic, Payton, and Drexler.    I give lebron credit for beating the Spurs with Duncan, Ginobli, and Parker (popovich is the best coach either Jordan or lebron faced.  So I give him major kudos for beating him), and the warriors with klay, steph and draymond.  But his lost to mavs is inexcusable and cannot be ignored when comparing him with someone who went 6-0 in finals series.  How do you ignore that and his 3-6 record in finals series? Aside from his first run with the cavs against the Spurs where he had no shot to win (I don’t hold this against him) he played with 2 other hall of famers in all of his other finals series and his record is under 500.  What measure do you want to use to figure this out? Jordan has him beat with everything! Jordan’s peaks was higher than lebron, it just is.  Lebron has played damn near 50% more games than jordan and thus has amassed an incredible resume. But it’s just not as good as Jordans"
Marquese Chris Paul George Karl Malone
"Dame is tiny by NBA standards but he's still a solid 6'1 or 6'2. And he's no ordinary 6'1 or 6'2 human being either based on pre draft measurements he has a 6'7 wingspan. That's why he can get shots off like that playoff game winner over a long wing like Paul George or how he can routinely finish at the rim with 7 footers around(of course speed and hesis and threat of the jump shot also plays a role in this)  Like I'm also 6'1 but even if I had Dame's shooting ability, handles, and that signature pound dribble step back in my bag I would get my shot smothered by Paul George and other NBA wings 9 times out of 10 cause my wingspan is only 6'0 and I have small hands for my height.  I do agree though that Dame prolly doesn't have what it takes to even be a somewhat good defender at the NBA level and that's a combination of many reasons. Some short guys can guard though like Lowry, FVV, and now the man of the hour Davion Mitchell."
"I think Paul George did once.  Got the fast break, ran like fuck to the basket and when he realized no one was behind him he stopped for a second then did one from a standing jump  Either that or he did some other trick dunk"
what kind of Clippers fan are you if you don't have Paul George in team good looks but have LaMelo ball in there instead. Lamelo ugly as a beat up steak
"You have to prepare yourself for this, Westbrook has taken more shots in series than Kevin Durant, James Harden, Paul George despite them being superior efficient scorers and having  better scoring series   It's gonna be hilarious when he outshoots AD and LeBron going 3/17 while they go 6/10, i will laugh my ass off"
"I think you are missing what I'm saying. You don't have to go back 20 years to show your point, you can look at like Paul George at 35+ mpg for the majority of his career. Or like Harden or so on and so forth."
"Paul George wasn’t a Lebron/KD-type superstar, and you’re short selling the makeup of that Pacers team, particular in the 2012-2013 season. Looking back at what PG was putting in year 3 and 4 vs what KD and Lebron were doing in year 3 and year 4, there’s no comparison, despite the two both coming into the league younger than PG was when he got drafted. KD and Lebron were always a tier above Paul George."
"Pre-injury Paul George was a LeBron/KD-type superstar. He made the All-NBA third team and All-Defensive 1st and 2nd teams as a 23 and 24 year old, and pushed the Big 3 Miami Heat to 7 and 6 games as the #1 option on teams that weren't even particularly talented."
Getting to play in the Christmas games is something players and teams want to do. I believe Paul George talked about it
I'd lower it a bit. I always saw him as closer to a pre-injury Paul George type  That was a very attainable target that he still got nowhere close to.
"I feel like Spurs fan would hate him less if they got a better haul for him.  Like how OKC Thunder fans don't really hate Paul George.  Lot of people hate him on behalf of the Thunder though, which is weird."
"&gt;The only impactful franchise player trade that also didn't combo with free agency  Why would this be a qualifier? Paul George, AD, and Harden all forced trades to specific teams to be on title contenders. Doesn't really matter if those teams also happened to sign free agents that summer."
"i do like how it is always conveniently left out the hawks also won a playoff series against a 1 seed, the team that had like the 3rd best record in the league. with the guy who woulda won mvp had he not gotten hurt. 3 road wins in the series. all without the hawks best wing  but naw man its fine its not like paul george/the clippers was a meme for a year now the mighty clippers poor classy lukey keeps running into a super team!"
Kevin Durant don't seem like the typa dude to pull a Paul George.
"I wont qualify whether they were sucessfull or not, cuz that was not your inital statement. but look at the names the lakers pull in free agency.   Lebron, shaq, malone, payton, ron artest, steve nash(snt), dwight howard. melo. mid tier role players as well, danny green, trevor ariza, fisher, rondo, schoeder(was sought after prior to last year). Numerous other recentish players who wanted to or rumored to go to want to sign  or force their way to the lakers, Kawhi, Paul george, DeRozan, AD(obv), Igoudala etc etc.   not gonna accept the ""but nash was garbage and payton and malone were old"" arguements cuz they arnt relevant here. No other team is consistently over the last few decades getting free agent veteran players that want to play for their team at a discount.   gtfo"
"I think Nuggets and Jazz should be better but like you just said Paul George might go bananas all year. Bledsoe might do good their too, who knows"
But that’s largely due to Kawhi. With him being out until almost the playoffs I doubt Paul George will be able to carry the clippers to higher than 6th seed. But I could be wrong and Paul George could turn into Indiana pacers paul George and kill everyone so who knows
"Donovan is incredible. But to be called a *Superstar* you gotta be in a class of your own.  I'd say, LeBron, KD, Steph, Kawhi and Giannis are the superstars in the league.  I'd put Donovan with guys like Paul George and Devin Booker"
"Tatum might be in the future, but I don’t think it’s absurd to say that right now he isn’t.   There’s less than 10 guys who can be the #1 on title teams.  Paul George, Harden, Butler, etc. none of those guys have been able to do it, and it’s not like Tatum is clearly better than any of them"
"Any player who turned down a super max. Paul George and Indiana come to mind, but I'm sure there are plenty of others."
Indiana Paul George was my favorite player in the league. Now I just hate his overall attitude/vibe.
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our “GM”). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I’d say he’s done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
lol you are quoting an article that compares 34 games of ant edwards rookie season to middleton and paul george.  your ignorance is actually hilarious.
Paul George. Loved him during his Pacers stint.  Blake Griffin too.
She broke the Paul George thunder trade too.
IIRC she was also the first person to break the Paul George trade to OKC.
"I hate the eras argument. Honestly. It's low hanging fruit and at most half right.  The league had seen efficient perimeter offense exist in these slow, grimy, slugfest eras the league went through. The problem was people just didn't believe in it nowhere near as much as they should have. Larry Bird, Mitch Richmond, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Steve Nash even all were efficient perimeter shooters that had grown up and been coached away from the most efficient shot in their arsenal instead of being told to lean into it. There was an aura of purity to the game for the longest time, a rigid approach ""play the game the right way,"" so on and so forth. But these guys were prototypical modern superstars coached into decreased efficiency. I think it's fair to hold it against the prior generations that they just didn't do math. Because that's what it boils down to. They didn't like the math telling them to play the game a different way than what felt *correct*. We didnt fundamentally change how we measured efficiency in basketball. We figured out how to quantify it more thoroughly, but basketball has more or less the same baseline metrics for efficiency that it always has.  Do we have a higher volume of efficient perimeter superstars than weve ever had in our league? Sure. But I'd argue we're at a better understanding of the game for that to help inform who (and what) we should be looking for to set the baseline of efficiency. There are still guys with older games in the league today that fit that older ideation of the game, guys like DeMar DeRozan, DeAaron Fox, Russ is a great one for this category, Embiid without a doubt (though he's retrofit his game to live up to a modern standard of efficiency himself) all would be killing it if we were as rigid on our view of basketball in this age as we were in the 2000s.  I mean hell, look at guys like Kyle Korver, or Peja Stojakovic, or Chauncey Billups (even though he won a ring and is one of the most obvious Hall of Fame cases among retired players. I just learned that hes the only player in NBA history with a winning record against MJ, Kobe *and* LeBron). In their time they fulfilled very desired archetypes that exist today that I can directly correlate to a player currently playing that is seen as signficantly better than they were seen as when they were at their peaks. (Chauncey &lt;-&gt; Dame ; Peak Peja (I'm talkin '03-'04 Peja who put up 25 ppg on 48/40/92 splits)&lt;-&gt; Paul George, but mean of his prime Peja was probably more Tobias Harris; Korver &lt;-&gt; Duncan Robinson).  The variety of talent has always been there. And the fact that preferences have changed from the 2000s to today isn't some kind of counterweight that should devalue today's production and efficiency to spot older generations some slack. If they believed the game could be played the way it is today they'd have leaned just as hard into it in the mid 90s as they lean into it in this day and age. Hell, David Stern spent most of the 2000s praying for the league to produce a level of offense we see as routine today"
“Do you think the Clippers would have won the championship if they traded Paul George instead of Pat Bev?”
Paul George and oladipo would have been a huge coup
"You sure? Basketball reference hall of fame probability has him at 77% behind Paul George at 84%. It compares careers of similar players and their accolades. Remember that HOF is based on a career not a few years. Without that ring, if he retired today, he would be a borderline entrant."
"Only thing cool about Fresno is a surprising amount of pro ballers are from here or went to college here. Lopez twins, Paul George, Deshaun Stevenson. Derrick Carr, Davante Adams, and Aaron Judge too"
"You might want to swap out Dell for Paul George, you know, for someone who is an active player. And the drama."
"Paul George, KD, James Harden, etc"
"Ok can people stop saying Siakam is good enough for a 2nd option. He's not on that level of AD, Paul George, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Klay, Middleton or even Jaylen Brown, which are all ideal 2nd options. Kawhi carried that Raptors team."
Paul George
Paul George or Kevin Durant for a wing player
LeBron VS Pierce 2008 ECF Game 7  AD and Jokic dueling it out in the 4th quarter in Game 2 of the 2020 WCF Game 2  LeBron VS Paul George Game 1 2013 ECF OT Game  Mitchell VS Murray 2020 WCR1
Joe Ingles strikes me like that kind of a guy to be honest  Also I'm sure Paul George wouldn't say no to that after the injury he had
Modern day Paul George
Paul George.
"Trae is undoubtedly better than Mitchell and Booker. He’s better than CP3 too. And there’s definitely an argument for him to be better than Kyrie.   Do you understand that Trae averaged 29 and 9 in his second season and 25 and 9 this season….  Those are amazing point guard numbers and he’s only 22 years old and he led his team to the ECF while beating the #1 seed and dropped 48 and 11 in game 1 against the bucks…   How tf are Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker better than him, Trae in his second season had numbers that they’ll probably never have. Trae already eclipsed anything kyrie did in Boston as the #1 option and this is coming from a guy who loves kyrie.   Tired of the Trae disrespect, he’s definitely a top 15 player in the league rn, right behind Paul George and Tatum"
Honestly still would have been a highlight bc Bev was wiping out Paul George no matter what Harden did.
Paul George become underrated until the playoffs.  Everytime he had a high scoring game it was always ‘Do it in the playoffs’ and everyone was ranking all types of players over him
[A quick Google search and the Oladipo story I came across first](https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/05/07/woj-bomb-shocker-okc-thunder-almost-traded-demar-derozan-instead-paul-george/)  *Edit [And here is a story on DDR for George](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/raptors-approached-thunder-about-demar-derozan-paul-george-trade-last-season/b522kc5c3xjf1bmt1mw2lv6zr)
"The golden height is certainly 6'9""(with shoes). Paul George, Kawhi, Lebron, Durant. They might not be able to play the 2, but they make a far bigger difference in general."
"thats not really true, Ujiri tried to trade Demar for Paul George and Oladipo before the Kawhi deal"
Or just grt Paul George
"it has to be 2 top 10 superstars whose game doesnt mesh well with each other along with another perennial all star.  Giannis, Embiid and Paul George"
Only the raptors apparently.  I don't know if Paul George was really loved in OKC.  Good return but it doesn't look like there was any feeling other then neutral.    What say you Okc fans?
"This is the way to understand them:  * Gobert is the floor-raiser. With Gobert, the Jazz have a top defense and can make the playoffs if he's healthy.  * Mitchell is the ceiling-raiser. With Mitchell, the Jazz have a guy who can elevate his game on the biggest stage. Mitchell's like 3^rd or 4^th in playoff PPG all-time.  I don't know if Mitchell alone can carry a team to the playoffs, but I do know that he can be the best guy in a series against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard (until he got hurt)."
MVP: Paul George MIP: Tyrese Haliburton 6MOY: Jordan Clarkson ROY: Cade Cunningham  DPOY: Jrue Holiday
"&gt;you're probably getting a lower quality shot on average.  Cue Paul George saying ""that's a bad shot"".  Steph's made enough for any reasonable basketball observer to conclude that his efficiency is no fluke."
Paul george. He was exposed during the bubble playoffs. Obviously he redeemed himself this year.
"I think Julius randle got too much love. Everybody was on the train.   I think Paul George gets too much hate. Man is a baller, who yes, says some questionable things, but has undeniable on court talent."
paul george
"I would counter that teams obsess over this player archetype for good reason. Jimmy Butler, Paul George... any hyper-athletic 6'7""+ guy that can do everything BUT one thing is super valuable. If it's shooting, and the shot is maybe fixable? Worth gambling on all day."
A lot of people still dying on the hill of Cam Reddish turning into Paul George at some point.
Paul George. After these playoffs he really showed he might not be overrated.
Both KD and Paul George. Hard not to respect KD’s game and I give PG a ton of credit for coming back from a nasty injury. Enjoy them both now
Who you putting above them? You can put Jokic above and kick one of them out of the top 10 but if you’re saying they BOTH aren’t top 10 that means you’d have to put like Paul George or Tatum or Zion or kyrie maybe? Lol that’s a tough argument.
Paul George&gt;Tatum imo
Tbf Paul George is a SF just like Kawhi. The Clippers just play them both as interchangeable wings just like the Jays on the Celtics.  Powell as a SG is good. Powell as a SF? He should be a bit lower on this list.
"Well Paul George will likely be a small forward this year due to kawhis absence, and has been a small forward for most of his career. Luka shouldn’t be here though I agree.  Defence matters and Mikal is one of the best defenders in the league. Wiggins &gt; Mikal is somewhat fair but mikal &gt; powell for sure. Ingles is better than bogdanovic by far.   Also Tatum is a tad too high, why are Tatum and brown both here n Demar is too low"
"Has to be Paul George. The way the man battled us in the WCF killed the ""Playoff P"" meme and made me respect the hell out of him."
"The 2012 Heat  Outside of OKC, none of the teams they beat were that impressive   R1: Dysfunctional Knicks team that barely finished over .500 and had a mediocre offense.   ECSF: Good, but not great Pacers team without any true stars. Paul George wasn’t a star yet, and Danny Granger’s best days were behind him.  ECF: Over the hill Celtics team that was 27th in offense. They had absolutely no business taking Miami to 7 games."
Paul George has won me over lately
Paul George in too much love?? WHAT
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn’t playing well."
Paul George. I thought he was so whack after trashing Dame’s series winning shot when he was in OKC. And then his choke job in the bubble.   But after this last playoff run where he rose to the occasion and took the lead of that team. Idk how you could dislike the man. He put his heart on the line and the team on his back and pushed through the Jazz and gave the Suns a run for their money.
I mean it is questionable whether KD has a good squad in OKC or whether OKC had a good squad because of KD  Even when replacing him with a top 15 player in Paul George they didn't remotely look like title contenders  Plus when he was there he got hurt one year and they got 9th place and missed the playoffs
I'm surprised Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon haven't tried. Or Paul George either.
"&gt;super team heat  Melo got bounced by the pacers and Celtics in 2/3 of his first round exits. He lost to the heat once. Are those also massive superteams?   He also just didn’t make the playoffs multiple times. Were teams like Charlotte in 2014 also superteams that melo just couldn’t contend with?  &gt;Pierce missed the playoffs in his prime  And he had a much worse roster than what melo had  &gt;melo is on the same tier as embiid  Melo was on the same tier as Paul George (clippers PG, not Indy PG), but he thought that he was on the same tier as guys like dame or embiid, which is why he shot so much."
"1. Who can you trade Tobias for. It's going to cost assets to get rid of him, he's making $35 mil a year.  2. Siakam will perform better as a second option, but embiid isn't a good first option to pair him with. Embiid is gonna get doubled in the paint, exactly where siakam wants the ball. Fit is important. Look at Westbrook, he was the second option on OKC with Paul George, and he had a poor season. He goes to Houston, where he was still the second option, but there was much better spacing and he had one of his best seasons efficiency wise.    3. You can't just say ""I disagree, siakam will just make em better."" Like how? All you've said was that siakam is better as a 2nd option. You have given no reason to why he'd help Philly, with given how much trading Simmons takes away from them.   4. They are likely waiting for a star guard to be available, as that's their only way to win. If they trade for siakam there's no way they're able to do that, as siakam would not be good for any rebuilding team."
I think Paul George is better at everything except scoring
Paul George is directly better than Jayson Tatum at everyhting.
Paul George also did this in Palmdale
"&gt; CP3 was completely washed  No, he wasn't  &gt; Westbrook was the star of a regular season contender  No, he wasn't, Paul George finished 3rd place in MVP voting"
Paul George  John Wall
"Giannis was 48.4% against Ayton this year playoffs. Jokic was  40.7% , AD was 37.9% . LeBron was 32% and Paul George was 23%. Although for PG and LeBron the matchup data are considerably smaller ( only 25 attempts )"
This sequence that ended with a Paul George 4 point play to win the game against Sixers.  https://youtu.be/I0yTK142t1o
"&gt;there was no drama there  Lmao he signed a big extension and basically forced the gm to trade him. We have a literal quote from presti in response to Paul George saying “the trade was mutual”. Presti said “no it wasn’t”.   There absolutely was drama, but the okc have a competent front office who took everything that wasn’t nailed down from the clippers rather than let things get worse"
No new coach is going to fix Paul George or Ben Simmons? Because PG-13 played excellent without glenn last year.
"YEaah but can you blame doc when the second best player can't do shit in the playoffs. No coach can fix that, it is pretty obvious Doc is not the problem. It is Paul George, no new coach is gonna fix him lol"
"Kevin Love was his only mistake. The lakers didn’t have the option to get anyone better than Russ, it’s not like Russ was his first choice for a star.   Wade and Bosh were fucked by injuries it wasn’t a bad decision  But yeah I think the Cavs coulda gotten someone like Paul George instead of Love for Wiggins"
Except it wasn’t. It’s like the nets trading levert and a mid first round pick for Paul George. Everybody would have a meltdown. Just because the puck turned out to be a good player and then oladipo had a resurgence doesn’t change the fact that the haul at the time was weak.   It’s like if someone traded a second round pick and it turned out to be a jokic. Doesn’t all of a sudden change the value of the second round pick.
"I mean Kawhi himself kinda did you guys dirty by leeching Paul George on his way to LA. KD played out his contract, but Paul George had 3 years to go. Yeah the trade haul was great, but it also led directly to Westbrook eventually wanting out."
He’s not a star caliber player. Also Paul George
Are we starting to white wash what happened on here with Paul George last year?
Paul George had 10+ posts a day all off season?
"That's what fans tell themselves to console themselves.  You can leave as a FA OR you can demand a trade. Great players get hated for leaving all the time because 90% of the time your franchise is left worse off losing a superstar player. Indiana with Paul George. Denver with Melo. Cleveland with Bron. New Orleans with AD. Hell, Utah with Gordon Hayward."
Paul George last year
It isn't a single agency that 'spearheaded this type of action multiple times' though.  Kyrie was not a Klutch client when he threatened to get surgery to force a trade out of Cleveland. Kawhi wasn't a Klutch client when he forced his way out of SA. Paul George wasn't a Klutch client when he forced his way to LA.  Harden wasn't a Klutch client when he forced his way out of Houston.
Rich Paul to this sub is what George Soros is to cons
"Kawhi didn’t have to turn up until the 4th most games, he had Paul George to share playmaking/scoring duties with. Paul George was the main playmaker that series. Luka does need better conditioning, but he needs a good secondary playmaker just as bad."
"Not disgruntled but imagine Paul George in this Hawks team, sheesh (it starts with Collins + Reddish + Bogdan/Huerter/picks)  Trae - Bogdan - PG - Hunter - Capela"
"james harden, paul george, first westbrook trade"
"lol ""give up assets"" is an understatement. NO got a fuckin haul regardless of what the circumstances were.  Here's the thing, regardless of how much Rich Paul wants to ""bully"", NO doesn't have to do shit unless there's a trade package in return that clearly mitigates their losses. Lakers offered a package that was very enticing to NO so they pulled the trigger. Simple as that.  Same deal with Paul George and Clippers.  Stop it with all this player empowerment is bullying front offices bullshit."
"I would not consider them as hated as the Zaza example you gave out, but Kevin Durant, James Harden and Paul George"
"Lol, this is exactly what we're talking about here. Lavine has a fucking negative basketball IQ when it comes to defense and defensive instincts. Dude might be able to function as a net-neutral with proper coaching and good pieces around him, but he is not good. Good is Jimmy Butler or Paul George, good is not ""oops, i forgot about a rotation 5 plays in a row but made a nice steal or lateral shift a couple times so my fans forgot about my bad plays that led to a dude getting dunked on"""
"The main superstars who are good on D are Giannis, Davis, Tatum, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler."
"Only Giannis and AD honestly, Kawhi isn't the same player and doesn't try as hard on defense, Paul George too. Embiid is a good defender, that's why he gets gassed in every 4th quarter and went 0/12 in the second half. I'm sure some players could be better on defenders, but then they would be worse on offense and how good is that for the team?"
"This year Booker has definitely improved though, he wasn't even close to the liability he used to be. Paul George was the only one who really consistently hunted him in the playoffs.   But he's still far from a good defender (especially off-ball). Same with Mitchell."
yeah he’s no draft bust but definitely should’ve been drafted lower. is al-farouq aminu a draft bust because he was picked ahead of hayward and paul george?
Shoutout to Paul George smashing his chick :(
When you missed out on Paul George (PG) you were Urple and Old
You forgot Paul George.
"""Just GSW"" says a lot considering that was arguably the greatest team of all time. Nobody is getting past them without a strong team, and Harden came closest to beating them than anyone did when they had KD.   Nets and Bucks are both better than any team during that era with the exception of the Big 3 Celtics around 08, though the Celtics that faced Miami were already on the decline in 2011 and after. The Pacers weren't THAT good (Strong defense, terrible offense, Paul George isn't a true #1) and the Rose Bulls were real contenders once (In 2011) as Rose was injured pretty much everytime after that in the playoffs. The Pistons were a quality team, nothing special though after losing Ben Wallace/Larry Brown after 06  Philadelphia could beat some of those Heat/Cavs teams, Boston would give them a lot of trouble but they'd probably fare about the same as the 11 Celtics or some of those Hawks teams. There's just no way those Heat/Cavs teams would be getting past Milwaukee consistently if at all, and definitely not Brooklyn"
"A pretty normal one?? You literally just said it was ""ungrateful"" lol.  How many times does it need to be said to you before it stops going in one of your ears and out the other; Kawhi *doesn't get a ring* without us either.   If Kawhi is so easily capable of winning rings himself, why hasn't he done it for the Clippers the past two years with *Paul George* as his second star, yA DoPe.  Man... kinda... sorta.... fuck you too... I think. Yeah..."
paul george is an awesome player and super fun to watch
"First off the 538 model is is right to project him like this. Secondly it's just a projection, it's not destiny, this is just the most likely outcome when comparing bigmen with similar first years. Wiseman can still improve rapidly. Will he? I have no ideas, I can't possibly project that based on the information I have.  Just think of it this way. For every Giannis or Dirk that had lackluster beginnings to their career and ended up being MVPs there are way more players that started off lackluster and ended up lackluster still. This prediction model is correctly predicting that Wiseman will not be an anomaly. That's fine. Prove it wrong.  Honestly I have been skeptical of the Warriors draft strategy since the Wiseman pick. Clearly Halliburton was a better pick for fit for the Warriors and Moody/Kuminga are also not great fits in the sense that they are players that need development before they will make a positive impact. They are all young. Krispert, Mitchell, Wagner would have made more sense.  Going into next season with Krispert, Halliburton and Mitchell is a lot better than Wiseman, Moody and Kuminga. The thing is that it is undeniable that the three they did pick have bigger upside. Wiseman's size alone makes him intriguing. Kuminga has all the tools to potentially become a Paul George type player, Moody can be a two-way scorer and defender. The issue is none of our guys are pre-packaged this way, they will have to improve to meet their potential.  To me the Warriors are trying to have it both ways. Build for the future and win now. I don't think there is any avoiding the fact that the team will struggle when Curry leaves. This is fine. It's expected. The team could potentially lose their championship or even playoff window and waste the end of Curry's prime if they keep on busting on high draft picks. They are playing a risky game. I hope it pays off."
"Wiggins was really effective against some of the best scorers in the league, not least Bradley Beal, Paul George (in their first faceoff last season). He's assigned the best wing player and is reasonably switchable. Wiggins is a bit better defensively than you think. Plus he fits them like a glove right now, because he fills a need offensively quite well. Why would you trade him unless to obtain an offensive superstar?"
[As I said in a different comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pger5h/when_if_lebron_retires_what_team_will_he_be_most/hbc9iy7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) so was Paul George but he still ended up taking an extra year to get there.
"Paul George is guy that can play in almost any team and any system. It's absolutely obvious by now that simmons needs a giannis esque system around him for him to succeed.PGs value was deemed to fallen specifically due to a choke job while Simmons value is falling due to poor fit and his non existent shooting, an inherent flaw in his game.So Simmons stock has taken a bigger hit for me...tp support the case Westbrook has had similar trajectory to Simmons while AD has taken a hit for his last season...yet I am pretty sure the lakers will get a gargantuan package if they are to move AD"
"Paul George played badly but Simmons genuinely looked like a role player out there. I think you can criticise Doc for how he used PG13 but Simmons hasn't performed consistently in the playoffs at a high level ever so I doubt it's his fault. His lack of a post game, shot creation &amp; of course shooting really gets exposed when a team can scheme against him meanwhile PG just had a bad playoffs."
"Yeah and everyone also ‘knew’ Paul George was set on going to LA and would only be 1 year rental with okc but then [he ended up resigning](https://gamechangersportsnetwork.com/the-rental-returns-paul-george-resigns-with-okc/) and staying 1 more year, citing “unfinished business.”  But who the hell knows. I’m not saying Kawhi would have stayed, just that anything is possible."
"Paul George had already proven himself multiple times before he was Simmons's age. He has always been an elite asset, despite injuries. Simmons has yet to prove himself and his stock plummeted to its lowest yet after last year"
There was never really a discussion about trading Paul George so this isn't really a fair comparison
"Ben Simmons.   Don't overreact to Doc Rivers destroying his value, just like Doc did to Paul George.   Simmons would be incredible next to a knockdown scorer like LaVine. He's never played with an offensive weapon like that, the closest was Jimmy Butler and even that worked out pretty well."
LOOOOOOOL  Last season got Piston fans thinking Bey is Paul George or something
"My man, there were five seasons between the Lakers making the playoffs and Lebron joining. They had a stretch of 3(!) seasons without an all time great, going from Kobe to Lebron and eventually AD and now Westbrook.  Some of the notable guys who have played for the Lakers include:  Shaq  Kobe   Magic  Kareem  Wilt  Lebron  AD  Westbrook   Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  George Mikan  James Worthy  Michael Cooper  Byron Scott  Vets like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash,   Plus guys who reportedly wanted to play there like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Chris Paul, etc.  I really don't think it's a stretch to say that they've been a blessed franchise. They have 17 championships, tied for the most. They had a handful of bad years because Kobe was at the end of his career and they were doing right by him. Then they botched their rebuild to an extent, until Lebron fell in their lap and they were able to get Anthony Davis for a bunch of guys who mostly don't even play for the Pelicans anymore."
"what in the fuck yes he did  his biggest competition the past few years in the east was a teenage jayson tatum, demar derozan, kyle lowry, victor oladipo, and a young paul george  you gotta be smoking nuts to think he wasn't in the absolute weakest conference all those years  plus on top of that the dude would get to the finals and LOSE to the western team more times than not"
Paul George Push Off.   my guy
"No it's not... Stars have done that all throughout history.  Like I said, Wilt did that. He asked to be traded to the Lakers.  Rodman did exactly that though. I'm not getting your points, I think you're trying to view NBA history as something it wasn't. Asking to be traded to a place that can actually compete in the playoffs is very normal in the NBA.  But I was specifically referencing this  &gt;Paul George asked for a trade with 3-4 years left on his contract and they did it. If you tried to do that shit in the 2000s, you would've been clowned and for good reason  My guy, this is normal in NBA history. Even our main guy, Kobe asked to be traded out of his shitty situation. He asked to get traded to the Pistons (and bulls) specifically, a team he lost to, a team that had just made 4 straight ECFs.  Star wants to play where star can win playoff games. Nothing crazy."
"Yes, people forget that players should be at the mercy of their management, not the other way around. For some reason, the NBA has evolved to where ""players force their own decisions."" Lebron leaving in FA has turned into Kawhi/AD/Harden ghosting or tanking their teams in order to get trades. Paul George asked for a trade with 3-4 years left on his contract and they did it. If you tried to do that shit in the 2000s, you would've been clowned and for good reason"
People acting like russ loves to control and be the teams head. The only time that happened was with the wizards and it worked wonders. He literally deferred to paul george the two years he was there that Paul george had to tell russ to play like he always does. Him and harden were more like best buds instead of leader.
Harden is a PG Kyrie is a SG now  So I believe Harden is the 2nd best PG behind Steph  Kyrie is the 2nd best SG behind Paul George
AD has that Paul George energy when PG said Doc Rivers didnt run enough PNRs in a year PG was in the most PNRs of his career.  https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1334252770451283968?t=-IYpz7wiWgaxWnmfpFpPQQ&amp;s=19  Big guys need to grow up and stop whining to the media when they fail
that's not true  paul george has way more talent than ben simmons
Paul George
Harden and Paul George.
"it's sad but that's what the media and the fans do.  they glom on to one bad phrase, often taken out of context, and they run with it.  for instance, Paul George was [lightheartedly joking with the press when he said ""Playoff P""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBcKrWEercc) but the media and the fans turned that against him as soon as they got the opportunity."
"it sucks but it's always the one wrong phrase that the media and fans run with.  for instance Paul George said more words giving respect to Dame after the OKC-Portland series than he did about the ""bad shot"" but it's that comment, often taken out of context, that people care about."
Paul George…oh he doesn’t apply
Gobert is definitely not overrated lol. People have been clowning him for the entire summer and saying that he's a fraud. If anything he's underrated- he did a damn good job in isolation against Paul George and pretty much everyone besides Reggie Jackson. It's also not his fault the Jazz perimeter defenders have piss poor rotations and can't stay in front of anyone.
"I mean they won 55 games after losing MJ. I don’t see why you didn’t bring that up. From 57 wins in 93 to 55 in 94 losing the best player in the league is an unbelievable achievement (I don’t think the bucks, Lakers, Warriors maybe the Nets could do that today losing their top dog). Scottie was the unquestioned best player on that team and he also won ASG MVP that year (back when players tried to win it) (shoot they still kinda do today).   They were a bad foul call away v the Knicks from being back in the ECF. Yes they lost game 7, but that alone is an amazing achievement and a successful season after losing your best player. Their additions weren’t great enough to offset the loss of MJ.   Scottie &amp; Phil deserve more credit for this 93/94 season. Funny how it was barely covered in the last dance.  Paul George has a chance to prove how valuable he truly is this season. Been a while since he’s been the unquestioned leader. He balled out in postseason let’s see if he can lead the Clips to 3rd in WC and to a 2nd round exit. That’s what Scottie did."
"Holy shit, I just realized that r/nba hasn't shit on Paul George all offseason. What is the world coming to??"
Paul George?
"I agree 3 1sts is way too much, but he is still a great 3&amp;d player, and has showed he can do well off ball which is great when you're playing with a star like Embiid. He was OKC's best 3pt shooter behind Paul George, so he won't clog the paint."
"paul george, chris paul, carmelo, oladipo, dennis schroder. there’s probably something better but I can’t think of it"
"&gt; Like if the best we could get is Bagley, Hield and picks  it's not; his return is probably higher than what reddit thinks, but lower than what morey wants. i'm a portland fan so obviously take this with a grain of salt, but you could literally get cj mccollum, another player or two plus however many picks  we can trade (which can also be flipped) to improve. cj as an actual lead guard (point guard) can give you most likely a consistent 23/3/5. i think even minnesota can attach multiple picks alone with guys like bev (once he reaches his tradeable date) and beasley?  &gt;  I would be fine letting it drag out and not paying him.   so you want to show to embiid (who just locked down long-term guaranteed money aka he's comfortable) an unwillingness to compete to spite ben simmons for a year or two? again, look at ben simmons/anthony davis/paul george/ any other max star that wanted to be traded, etc. we've seen how insignificant signing these deals are to them to reaching that goal if they want out? i get he's been playing tennis with morey, but i've also watched dame spit ""loyalty"" for nine years just to have this off-season come about.  &gt; We’re a first or second round exit either way   your ceiling sans simmons is a first round exit max, not sure why second round is added lol you lack a significant primary ball hander if he decides to not actually suit up unless tyrese maxey turns into an league leading assist leader.  the same 6ers fans that are saying ""let ben sit and fine him"" are the ones who are saying portland would be idiotic to do the exact same thign with dame.  &gt; I’m fine giving Nerlens lawyers more evidence to use against Rich Paul.  also wouldn't do shit. one person is saying ""he didn't have my best interest in mind"" while other top nba talents (lavine) continue to sign to him lol"
"I acknowledged that there were 1 year injuries but I also mentioned their play styles. Paul George is a slasher and him being able to play like he is rn is honestly at the same level of absurdity if not more absurd than a pure spot up shooter who isn’t an aggressive dunker recovering from 2 year injuries. But the point is getting away from you. The point is you’re blaming fans for still having hope in their team who btw when they last played together were literally in the Finals based off an assumption. Also, the warriors are not next year finals or bust. Steph looks like he has like 3 more years of this level of production in him which gives Klay time to get into shape while also developing a scary young core of wiseman, Poole, Kuminga, and Moody. If warriors can somehow manage to overlap Curry, green, and Thompson’s window with Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman’s window then look out. Also, although I’m personally not a fan of it, warriors can still package their young players for a superstar. Steph paired with any superstar period, is a scary team."
It will be lower but if you’re expecting Westbrook to stop doing Westbrook things like bricking shots for no reason then you’re in for it.   He took more shots than kd basically their entire time together and still did a shit Ton of shooting with Paul george and harden. He is who he is at this point.   Allen iverson had the same issue later in his career. Shooters shoot.
"And Doc has plenty of that. I remember when the Donald Sterling tape was released, Doc kinda took over and acted like everyone had been blindsided by the contents of it. But Doc played for Sterling as a Clipper in the 90s, back when Sterling would bring people into the locker room to show off his Black players, like they were proud possessions or something, so Doc had known for decades what kind of a man Sterling was. And knowing that he still forced his way out of Boston to go work for him, even though he was under contract with the Celtics at the time. He's also the guy who is credited with suggesting to Kawhi that they trade for Paul George, despite the fact that George had cheated on his daughter. ""Shameless"" describes Doc Rivers to a tee."
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
"It’s a question mark. Ppl said the same thing about Paul George who maybe wasn’t 2 years but plays a way more explode type of game. Same goes for KD. Medical advancements have been insane as of late and things that we thought were impossible have come true. Until we see Klay Thompson play, they are not livers of past glory. You’re the one assuming and jumping the gun. We have no idea how Klay will come back but even if he’s 80% of what he used to be, warriors are scary. They’re no lottery team like the lakers were if that happens"
Paul George -   40 point performances in OKC with Russ: 10   40 point performances in LA with Kawhi: 1
"Not random! If the player's hometown was in the 50 United States or Canada, I got the latitude-longitude of the hometown and used the haversine formula. Using Harden as an example, his [hometown is Compton](https://theundefeated.com/features/rockets-james-harden-and-mom-sports-shaped-mvp-candidate/). In SoCal, the margins are very small. Harden's 12 km from the proposed Inglewood site and 16 km from Staples.  Kawhi's from [Moreno Valley](https://www.theringer.com/nba-preview/2019/10/3/20895966/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-los-angeles-clippers-stories-growing-up), which is 96 km from Staples, 102 km from Inglewood and 61 km from Anaheim.  I added teams because there were some good players languishing as like 7th or 8th string because their areas are just too packed. If we were only counting the original 30 NBA arenas + Seattle:  * Staples is the closest arena for 38 players * United Center in Chicago is closest for 63 * Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indiana is closest for 77!"
"Yea that was the thing I was thinking of. Wtf could the other team do to match his salary unless hes willing to take a pay cut (Which I am just taking a educated guess in saying he is not)?  The lakers do not have the assets to trade for him, Clippers cant trade for him (unless they want to give up paul george but I REALLLYYYY do not feel that happening), or warriors that are also in cap hell.  So how the hell could that trade even work?"
Reggie Jackson   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Marcus Morris   Serge (perfect man)ibaka   Pg and ibaka carry them
That guy knew exactly what he was doing by using Paul George.
For real. I used to see Danny granger downtown all the time. He lives literally 30 yards from Bankers right above the bars on Georgia street. I was at a hot dog stand when Paul George pulled up and 7 women got in his blacked out Camaro (still on his rookie deal then). And I met lance stephenson at a Walgreens in the hood at like 2 in the morning. He was drunk as hell eating popsicles out of the freezers and just throwing the wrappers on the ground. Him and his crew then proceeded to hit what looked like 60mph before leaving the parking lot and hopped the curb onto meridian heading towards downtown. Lance had 2 dudes and 6 girls and still drove. Dudes a maniac
Paul George &gt;  He does what klay does while also alleviating some ball handling / creation duties and guarding more positions
"Then we would've run with Eric Bledsoe, Paul George, LeBron James, Kevin Love and TT."
"According to LEBRON, Andre Drummond is ranked above Giannis, Simmons, and Paul George for defensive impact."
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"Russell Westbrook, and sadly Paul George. I’m a huge PG fan and he definitely has the skill but he just doesn’t have that killer mentality that Kobe, Lebron, Butler, etc. has"
"&gt; Arguably even better than what happened irl  I don't think ""arguably"" is the right word, to say the least. That Cavs team with Paul George instead of IT and Jae Crowder is unquestionably better. Maybe still not good enough to beat the KD Warriors but it would have been more of a contest. Current Cavs would be worse without Collin Sexton, though, since LeBron probably would have left in 2018 anyway."
Paul George
"For guards: Watch Kyle Lowry. Fundamentally sound and know how to get advantages despite his lack of height. Do Not Watch Steph or Kyrie.  For Forwards: Watch Paul George. Very nice shooting form and a tight handle, and has some of the best instincts on defense. Don’t watch KD or LeBron.  For Bigs: Tim Duncan was always a great example of how to be a traditional bigman. Don’t Watch Cousins or Jokic."
Maybe he actually gets traded for Paul George in this timeline.
"What’s this “10 most comparable players” metric they’re using?   Paul George is apparently most like Larry bird, who knew"
"Paul George is an anti-vaxxer too??   NBA should suspend all of the players who refuse to be vaccinated indefinitely. I don't give a fuck even if they take daily tests, get vaccinated or get the fuck out."
Clarkson was putting up 20 points while Gobert can’t even be bothered to post up 6’9 Marcus Morris and Paul George. How are you going to blame the role player for the star not stepping up on offense which allowed the Clippers to run a lineup that intentionally set up 3’s to rain on Gobert on the defensive end?
Paul George does well in the playoffs and somehow still ends up as pandemic p smh
"That's a silly hypothetical though, because that team couldnt realistically exist.   You can make any top 15 player the #1 guy on an unrealistic team. Like can either Kyrie or PG be the #1 guy? Not in my opinion  But here  Kyrie/Middleton/Paul George/Draymond/Ayton + best bench in the league."
What did Paul George do?
"I don't know why that Paul George example's in the article, there's no indication whether or not he's vaxxed."
"Paul George and Wiggins, based on the OP."
Wiggins is a stupid clown and so is Paul George
C: Joel Embiid   PF: Kevin Durant  SF: Jason Tatum  PG: Jrue Holiday   SG: Paul George
Kyrie Irving for Paul George was among the few rumoured trades I remember
"&gt;MJ had Pippen and Rodman  Pippen was considered an unreliable choker going into the 1990-91 season, after his ""migraine game"" in G7 vs DET in 1990, when he scored 2 points on 1/10 shooting. He basically had the same rep as Paul George did after the Nuggets series.  And Rodman was still a Piston at that time, Horace Grant was their PF. Horace was an above average starter, but he wasn't Rodman.  The Bulls also didn't have Kukoc or Harper during that first run."
"KD, Giannis, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, DeAaron fox"
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"

"The way to game this question is to pick the highest rated All-Star that isn't a superstar and starters that are almost All-Stars.  If Paul George is allowed: Steph, PG13 (All-Star), KD, Morris and KAT (All-Star). Roleplayers would be probably be something like Lonzo, Duncan Robinson, RoCo and John Collins.  If PG13 is considered a superstar i would go for: Jrue, Robinson, KD, Giannis and KAT."
Curry Luka Klay Thompson/Paul George og anunoby and gobert starting 5. Back ups I’ll take Dwight Josh Richardson Jordan Clarkon Marcus Morris annnnd Dort
"For the Knicks, it will be that an opposing team will figure out a defensive scheme to stop both Julius Randle and Kemba Walker, and they won't be able to offensively overcome it. Also, RJ Barrett will be solid player this coming season, but still not an all-star level player the caliber of Paul George or Jimmy Butler, which is what the Knicks need him to be to REALLY get over the hump.     I legit hope I'm wrong in all of this, and that the Knicks do in fact have what it takes to win a championship."
"he shot OVER the C at the end, that's part of the play. Maybe if it was Gobert, but shooting over Richuan Holmes ain't really the same.   You can find plays that look just like Jason Williams dribble crossover on Gary Payton or AI crossing MJ... but it wasn't on Payton or MJ. Kind of like how even if the motion of the player is the same, dunking on Paul George ain't the same as dunking on Gobert"
"giannis and curry as superstars, davis may be a better fit (arguably?) but is less rekiable health wise   giannis can be a super draymond in offense as a pick and roll partner who can playmake when curry goes off ball, and curry spacing would be lethal   best inside and outside scorers in the league right now  for all stars i need shooting and wing defense  mostly   so give me paul george (if he doesnt count as superstar) who also gives me an extra ball handler which you never can have too much of   i would put klay Thompson but because of injuries i would go with middleto n. strong shooter and defender plus chemistry with giannis   and finally myles Turner, for defense mostly plus some  so-so spacing at the 5 like brook lopez does    myles Turner  giannis  middleton  George  curry   that team is fairly formidable with 4 great scorers, 3 great shooters(GOAT shooter included) plus a decent fourth shooter, and the best interior scorer   and the defense would be dominant"
"Once Kobe was out I switched from lakers to clippers, crazy enough I was a big fan of Paul George and kawhi and following em through the years, once they went to the clippers i shit myself"
Paul George has literally been an MVP candidate before. Who’s the bar for superstar
"Starters: Curry/Paul George/Tatum/Giannis/Capela   Bench: Malcolm Brogdon/Wiggins/RoCo/MPJ/Myles Turner  Monte Morris/Marcus Smart  I tried not to go too crazy with the players. Most of them are decent defenders, and the versatility both on offense and defense is insane. The starting lineup is centered around the gravity of Steph and Giannis, who can create open looks for PG and Tatum. Capela is there mostly for defense, to provide a strong paint protector who’s still decently switchable. The bench lineup is much of the same, and can function both on its own or mixed in with the starters. I also included two solid backup guards in case Curry hurts his ankle ☹️."
"Starters:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Jonas Valanciunas    for my 2nd unit, I decided to only use 2 non bench players to make this a tad bit more challenging  6th: Lonzo Ball  7th: Jordan Clarkson  8th: Myles Turner  9th: Joe Ingles  10th: Montrezl Harrell   Reserves:  Mathisse Thybulle  Doug McDermott"

I misread the directions. Thought it was one all star and 2 superstars.   In that case I’m taking Taytum. (However could make an argument for Paul George)
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
"Chris Paul, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Clint Capela.  Plus defenders in every role, 4 3-level scorers.  Everybody can pass and shoot outside the best role player C in Capela."
Are you seriously using defensive ratings for players? Its mostly used for teams as a whole and it’s skewed towards players on good defensive teams  With that logic Kuzma is a better defender than Simmons and Seth Curry is a better defender than Paul George
"Jrue Holiday, Paul George, Kevin Durant, OG Anunoby, Jokic"

Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."

"It's nowhere near the top, but 2013 and 2014 the Pacers were building a pretty heavy rivalry with the Heat. I sometimes wonder if Paul George didn't break his leg if we could have been a top team on the decade. Hibbert forgetting how to play basketball certainly didn't help, though."
the pacers and paul george during the heat stint
"The kings reigned so long his rivalries are split into eras. But I’d argue his longest most salient rivalry should be playoff P Paul George. Had some consecutive intense playoff duels in the Miami Indiana series, and for the next couple years you’ve got battle of LA. Other than that I’d put kd curry, Boston big 3, and that awesome spurs team as his most memorable adversaries"
"We are only two seasons removed from 2018 (considering he missed 19) where Cam threw for 3400 yards, 24 touchdowns, 13 INTs on 68% completion, and rushed for an additional 500 with 4 TDs. That's basically Baker Mayfield from last year, with 300 yards more rushing and a better completion percentage.  That was Cam's highest completion % for his career, tied for 2nd most TDs in his career, lower than average INTs, and his second highest QBR (icky). and probably his best overall year of his career except for his MVP year which just looks like an insane outlier in comparison.   I think maybe the issue is that people are looking at that 2015 year and assuming that was kind of how he was playing for a few years there, but he wasn't. That year Cam had 11 TDs more than his next best year, tied for the lowest INTs, the most yards he threw for since his first 2 years in the league, and the second most rushing TDs he ever had.   If you take out that year from the equation then his ""prime"" lasted until he got to NE which was a terrible fit for him. Every year was wildly similar to each other. The only thing that was different in Carolina year by year was the team around him, not really Cam at all when healthy.   I think we are both overrating how good Cam was outside of that 2015 year, and underrating the consistency he had up until he got knocked out in 2019.   I think the best comp for Cam might be DeMar DeRozan in that sense. Had that stellar 2018 year and then everything else around it is just, like, the same. Other guys in that same mold are Arenas (though his career was entirely derailed due to injury, not the teams around him or anything else), Jermaine O'Neal (3rd in MVP in 04-05), Bob McAdoo, and Willis Reed.  If that Panthers team stays together, Olsen is healthy, Peanut is healthy, O-line stays healthy, running backs stay healthy, Benjamin doesn't eat himself out of the NFL, I think we would probably have a much different view on Cam. He would probably still be in Carolina too. Though, the injuries may have caught up to him by now because a guy in his 30s who took some of the most insane hits during the year probably isn't recovering like he used to. Still, I wonder how he would have done if he went anywhere other than NE considering the last healthy Cam we saw, again, had his 2nd best season of his career individually with a pretty shitty team.  * Also there exists the rumor that the Denver Broncos in 2015 broke Cam Newton mentally and he didn't recover from that. Not sure if there's any validity to that but if that's the case maybe Cam is Paul George or a supercharged Nick Anderson."
Paul George and the Pacers
"Westbrook's points have dropped off from 31 to 22 since his MVP year. His rebounds and assists have remained consistent. His points were only high that year because he didn't have a number two option, since then he's played with Paul George, harden, and Beal. Of course your points are going to drop off when you get a running mate that can score. Also in what way is he out of the league?"
"If by ""threatened"" they mean by OKC winning the lottery with all the picks Paul George got Presti and the Thunder then sure.  The Windows is closing up, Steve."
"had Clippers not choked against Denver, I think more people would be talking about it. Also I think Paul George would also be a great rival"
Mpj is an easy answer.  I think towns and dlo could thrive next year as a a duo as a sleeper pick.  Some all nba consideration for towns at least.  Will need to be fortunate with health ofc.  I’ll also be a homer and say Paul George is in the top 10 player convo next year even though it seems really hard with all the great players in the league

Love how Kawhi &amp; Paul George aren’t wearing masks now that covid is over.    /s
How could you miss out Paul George not wanting to be there either OP
Not a fan of picking on Kawhi. He's literally just sitting there like Paul George and yet yall act like Kawhi is acting weird or something
"How has no one commented on Paul George, who's face is reacting in sheer horror while his head just ever so slightly sways to the beat because he knows he's supposed to be 'enjoying' it?"
"Lebron, Steph, Durant, Paul, Kawhi, Davis, George, Harden, Cousins, Westbrook.  He wasn't better than any of those dudes and there's several others you could make arguments for (Butler, KAT, Aldridge, Dame, Wall, Melo, Klay, Lowry, etc). These things always sound good until you actually look at who they are up against. Absolutely nobody thought Draymond was top 10 in 2016 because he wasn't."
"Honestly, that Jerome Robinson pick was so bad I completely forgot it happened.   I still think MPJ gets dealt in the Paul George trade anyways. He didn’t play that season so Clippers wouldn’t have much reason to keep him when he’s a decently valued prospect."
"&gt;I very strongly doubt that Kawhi Leonard is going to push a trade for a star  Why not? That's how they ended up with Paul George, after all."
"I think you’re misunderstanding my point. LeBron is undoubtedly a superstar, and he is then a two-way superstar when he tries on defence. My issue more with the Paul George statement was that I don’t see him as a superstar, so if the precursor to him being included is also “when he’s on it”, then he doesn’t have the same weight behind him there as LeBron.   Does that make sense?"
Paul George looks genuinely confused by the music.
"Unless you want your core to be a 35 year old Paul George and 34 year old Kawhi, PG is probably getting traded somewhere"
Paul George special request?
"Trivia fact, Ray Allen is one of 3 players to participate in both the Dunk Contest and the 3pt Shoot-out. The other 2 are Paul George and I believe Lavine has done both as well."
I can't imagine he was seen with Paul George *and* Eric Bledsoe in the same week and they're not nudging him in the direction of accepting a buyout and giving a majority of his salary back. Would he though? Not sure.
Paul George is lucky this wasn’t announced last offseason. Oh the memes that could have been…
Paul George
"Yeah we both know this isn't just a Reddit thing. Ice Cube's son, Snoop Dogg, and aforementioned fans at Staples when y'all won it all. Oh and let's not forget Dudz and his pamphlet where he talked about how the whole squad was butthurt over Paul George.   This weird Clipper hate runs through everything Lakers my guy."
Paul George may very well go down as the Clippers GOAT. And that’d be cool to see. It was fun to watch PG as a first option again
"No, we never could have gotten AD. He wanted to play in LA and LA only, thats the advantage they have over everyone else. I’m sure they tried for paul george in the 2017 off season who was younger and would have been the ideal fit for harden but they couldn’t match OKCs larger offer. Chris Paul was the best we could do, and they were a GOAT level team the first season. They tried a huge offer for jimmy and they said no in 2018. We lost a bunch of role players, Chris Paul fell off and his value was at an all time low. The swap for russ was risky but was a last ditch effort on a plan that looked like it failed with CP3s worst year. Nobody knew hed come back like that"
"Is Dame really the Portland GOAT? Walton led them to a ring, Drexler to two finals.   Has anyone been better than Paul George this year in the history of the Clippers? Who’s their best player anyway?"
"Meh. Overall, fans did not like those Warriors teams once KD joined. They screamed that the league was ruined. Of course, they also dreamed of Paul George and Kawhi joining Lebron in LA, and loved when Harden landed in Brooklyn."
"I’m saying I don’t know if they’d be contenders. That’s pretty clear - I’ve said it from the beginning. Why is it a waste of time to talk about the fit being questionable? I KNOW the Nets are, I know the Bucks are, but I don’t know the same about this hypothetical team because of fit, not overall talent. Paul George is a less talented player than Dame, but he’d make them definite contenders because the fit is there.   Yes, they’d likely be awful on defense. Klay is coming back from over two years of devastating injuries. I don’t know where this assumption is coming from that he’ll be just fine now that he’s guarding SFs, as though it’s perfectly fine to not have him guarding the other team’s best guard and to trust his knees after two years of injuries.  Of course Dray and Looney are great, but someone has to guard the perimeter, and Iggy is on fumes at this point."
"&gt;  Even peak Drummond could never replicate what Hibbert did in the 2013 playoffs. 17/10 with 2 bpg and elite defense across 19 games.  Elite is a stretch.  He's immobile and he got massacred as soon as LeBron ran one switch.  He did play well, for a long time, until LeBron used him like a jizz sock.  It's actually astounding it took that long to realize he can't chase Bosh out to mid range and he can't survive guarding LeBron or Dwade on switches.  It's astounding that nobody did the same to him in the first round.  The only reason he looked passable defensively is because Lance Stephenson (surprisingly), Paul George and George Hill played great on ball defense and funneled to Hibbert while David West was a goddamn brick wall if anyone tried to get around Hibbert.  It stopped working because LeBron could bully George Hill on the mismatch or hit the open man if they tried to collapse on his drive.  That Pacers team would have gotten wrecked in the west by any of 5 teams.  &gt;  Replace Hibbert with Drummond and they don’t even make it out of the first round, let alone take the Big 3 Heat to 7 games in the ECF.  This may be true.  Their defensive funneling system with the physicality of David West worked well against LeBron's Heat.  Not well enough, and he figured out how to beat their collapse, but Drummond would not have done as well in that role.  That does not mean that Hibbert is a better overall player.  Hibbert is a 7'2 center who couldn't shoot over 50%.  He couldn't average 10 boards in any season of his career.  He couldn't cover ground, he was as slow as he could possibly be, and he might as well have subbed out on switches.  He was not a good player.  Drummond definitely isn't a max player, at this point he's not even all star level, but he is a super athletic guy and probably the strongest guy in the NBA.  He has actual skill sets.  He's a much better passer, scorer, more of a lob threat, sets better screens, can move faster and cover more ground than Hibbert, and is second or third best rebounder ever.  Granted that skill is not the commodity it used to be, but Hibbert is really only better at blocking shots when his teammates have done the tough defensive work to funnel a drive into him with no angle for a good shot."
Paul George 1/13 FG
i haven't forgotten how Paul George played in the 2021 playoffs yet
"If Simmons comes in and plays about as well as he usually does in the regular season, the Paul George effect will kick in, and most people will kinda forget about his playoffs by the AllStar break. Suddenly, Morey will have plenty of highway to commit a robbery"
"I know it's mainly because we use either last names or their full names, but for some of these guys I find it odd just thinking of calling them by their first names. Like when I see Paul George, I find it weird that in day to day people just call him Paul. He looks like a Paul George, but not a Paul to me. Think the same with Derrick for DRose. Idk maybe I'm alone on that though."
"Surprised by this - Paul George is a fucking monster in 2K. Absolute lock down defender; players just drop their dribble if he plays tight D on them. Easy release, money from the line, deep range, and an oddly electric clutch gene. Plus he'll run in transition and get you easy buckets. One of the best current players for sure"
Paul Chris Hill George
Chris Paul George Hill
"I feel like the last 5 years the top 10 players in the league have been fairly static: LeBron, Durant, Curry, Kawhi, Harden, Giannis, AD, Jokic, Embiid and Luka (displacing Dame).  In 2021 (this year) Chris Paul came 5th. That doesn't mean he's a top 5 player.  In 2019 Paul George came 3rd. That doesn't mean he's a top 5 player.  In 2018 Lillard and Westbrook came 4th and 5th. They are still outside the top 10.  And 2017 was a farce. You have Westbrook winning it over Harden because of the triple double narrative, AND IT coming 5th."
"peyton manning wasn't better, though he did have a good year before completely falling off a cliff.   adrian peterson was a huge story precisely because it's so rare and unexpected.  paul george is about the same player he was before his leg, but it actually wasn't as damaging of an injury as you're framing it."
Paul George seems like a massive whiner but he’s come in handy when I play with the all-time OKC lineup on 2k.
"&gt; Next Summer they'll be able to offer some 1sts and swaps in the 2026-2029 range   This is false. [They owe their 2026 1st round pick to OKC from the Paul George trade,](https://i.redd.it/gablumavxti51.jpg) and because of the Stepien Rule that means they can't offer their 2027 1st round pick either. They will be able to offer a swap in 2027 along with *one* of their picks in 2028 or 2029 and could do a swap on the other one, however."
"the problem is OP and people like him, that think that in modern era, people get broken from injuries never to return to their fullest - well, we have examples in sports that show us people being BETTER after serious injury  Peyton Manning, Adrian Peterson, people forget that Paul George broke his leg what would be the most gruesome graphic display of an injuryt, with multiple bone fractures (fibula + tibia), his lower leg was hanging on his teared muscles and skin, flapping around. Brady tore everything there is to tear in his knee, and that was 2008. MJ broke his foot in 85  Injury DOES NOT EQUAL broken athlete with lowered percentages of quality he once had. May be the case, may be completely opposite, and him returning even better."
I think Paul George will be an MVP Candidate
"I think part of it is that Paul George has that internally inconsistent character, where he says one thing and then can say or do something completely different a year later. It sort of gives me the vibes of a poorly written NPC. Very little emotion when he speaks too. Everything he says feels scripted and lifeless."
Paul Pierce or Paul George.  Fuck Paul.
No they don’t you’re just an imbecile who can’t interpret stats.   2016 I’d go  Curry  Lebron  Durant  Hrden Westbrook  Cp3  Paul George Lowry  Kawhi
I didn't realize Wall was only 3 years older than Beal. I thought he was much older than Beal because it feels like he hasn't been prime John Wall for so long now. It felt like a Danny Granger - Paul George type of situation who had an 7 year age difference
"Who is like Paul George, but slightly lankier and can jump a little higher?"
"CP3 I'd actually classify as the rare ceiling and non floor raiser.  Outside of the OKC year in 2020, you'd have to go back to 2011 to find a team in which he alone was capable of being the lead driving force of a team.  Hell even in OKC, they had Shai and Dennis to help CP3.  Gallo was awesome.  It wasn't Chris Paul carrying scrubs.  He's clearly more valuable as a player playing with other great players.  More so than someone like Russ who is best at leading mediocre teams to the playoffs like in 2017 because even when they got Paul George in 2018 the Thunder really weren't a better team."
Nah most greats can do both at an elite level and they don’t have to be all time level to do so  Paul George is an example
Paul Clifton Anthony George
"They really said:   “there are 61 players better than dwade including paul arizin “ (a guy who played back when black people weren’t allowed to play in the same games and also most people could only dribble with one hand.)  They really said:  “Scottie pipen over Shaq, Kobe, KD, Robinson etc… but not Steph.”   They really said:  “Dirk was just aight”  They really said:   There are FIVE people better than lebron fuckin James. One is George Mikan, and the other is Magic Johnson, who himself said that lebron is better than him….   They really said that shit."
"Booker, Lavine, and Donovan Mitchell.  Duncan, Kg, and Dirk  Tatum and Brown   Jimmy Butler and Paul George"
&gt; He had KP and Trae went further in the playoffs   Luka very close to alone nearly beat the duo of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in a game series. Trae is a great talent but there's very few players you could replace luka with and get as close to beating the clippers as mavs did
"Siakam went won the championship as the 2nd option to kawhi, while Paul George can't. Therefore siakam is better than kawhi. Is this one better?"
"I just think it’s always incredibly anecdotal when talking about how ‘basketball fans’ rate x player  Like you throw around terms like ‘people think’ or ‘basketball fans’ like that means anything at all but it doesn’t. The entirety of ‘basketball fans’ don’t have consensus opinions about anything. You show me 100 people who sleep on Vanfleet and I’ll show you 100 people who would say he’s Steph 2.0.   Look up FVV current 2k rating. 1 point lower than Lowry’s current rating. Look at FVV contract, 12th highest paid pg in the league. That would seem to show that GM’s at least would rate him as an above average starting pg.  So like where’s the underrated part? I swear all these posts about ‘x player is under/overrated’ are just circlejerks where people can trash on whatever player is on the hot seat (Ben Simmons right now, Paul George last year, Russell Westbrook anytime) or where people can circlejerk about players that only they are smart enough to realize are actually good (FVV, Alex Caruso, Robert Williams, ect) and where they have to put down the filthy ‘casual fans’"
I feel like butler making the finals as the leader of the heat and Paul George being playoff pee for years has kinda made it hard to put George over him.
1) Kobe 2) Steph 3) Darius Miles 4) Paul George 5) Lonzo Ball
Without Trae... Suns went 2-0 in the wcf without cp3 against the Paul George Clippers who beat the Jazz
Paul george vs jimmy butler was a genuine discussion
"Reggie Miller. Muggsy Bogues, Gary Payton, Allen Iverson, Paul George."
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
Stats? You mean the over inflated offensive numbers that have happened the last few years? You're proving my point. Dame is nothing but a scorer. He can't defend and he isn't as a complete of a player as Paul George is. Use your head.
Just use your head. Paul George is a better basketball player then Dame.  Paul George is the better overall basketball player. Dame is nothing but a scorer. And that's it. Paul George is a more complete player. He is. PG is better than Dame.
"In a 1v 1 situation first to 100 wins PG wins that 100 times out of 100. He is taller, he is the better defender, he is the better shooter, he's better at everything. Dame couldn't guard PG for shit. PG is better. He just is. You are wrong. Flat out wrong. Compared directly to each other Paul George is the better OVERALL player. He is."
Paul George is a better overall player than Dame Lillard. If you don't know that you're either a Blazers fan or don't know basketball.
If you think he’s better than Beal or Booker offensively you’re absolutely delusional and in 2021 Butler is a WAY better defender than Paul George. Dude is the most overrated defender in the league by far still living off reputation at this point
1.Kevin Durant  2.James Harden  3.Kahwi Leonard   4.LeOverrated  5.Jayson Tatum  6.Paul George  7.Jimmy Butler  8.Bradley Beal  9.Donovan Mitchell  10.Devin Booker
Paul George
"&gt;I do believe the Blazers had plenty of opportunities to trade away some pieces, mainly CJ and/or Nurk, to have a better chance to win. This kind of speaks to my point of the not really trying. They’ve been sending out this same core for the past 6 years and they have not changed much as a team. They’ve had the same problem for a while and everyone knew their weaknesses which was wing depth and terrible guard defense.   Like what? They tried trading for Paul George and it didn’t go through, and they couldn’t compete for harden last year. Also they tried trading for jimmy butler on 2018 but that didn’t work out either. What other Star players have been traded in the last few years? Chris Paul or Jute holiday, we’ll that’s just puts us in the same position as before. There really haven’t been that many moves the we could have made to get us to contention without drafting well."
Jimmy Butler and Paul George
"I guess Morey still thinks it’s 2017, when Paul George was a Pacer and teams actually wanted Ben Simmons."
"Pacers x Heat if Indy can overcome injuries and stay competitive. Not sure if Vic will really return this year, but the possibility of us meeting again in the playoffs again gives me chills.   And before Heat fans jump down my throat saying they’re too good for us, I’m just speaking from our perspective after the ‘13 Paul George ECF, the ‘19 Vic debacle and weird Jimmy Butler vs TJ Warren semi-rivalry."
No they were trying to trade Kevin love for Paul George
"“Although I think an argument could be made that Westbrook only having made it to 1 finals despite playing with KD, Paul George, or James harden in like what, 8 of the last 10 seasons? kind of says a lot about his ability to be the primary ball handler on a championship team”  Is what you said first. Then you tried to move goalposts and it still didn’t make sense  Underachieving for 2 years, one of which you were hurt, out of a 14 year successful career doesn’t mean much. You just don’t like him and that’s fine, don’t try to to disguise it in nonsensical takes like this    Take the L"
"“ but he has struggled to even make it out of the first round since the OKC trio parted ways. Then, even with Paul George playing at an MVP level, gets bounced in the 1st round - twice.”  i referenced his inability to make it out of the first round despite having strong supporting casts as evidence to back up my belief that he will never get a ring. i didn’t move any goalposts. try to keep up."

""waah russ is a stat padder he always takes adams' rebounds"" yeah, because okc utilised his speed in the fast break to pressure the other team, so him rebounding makes more sense than waiting for a pass from a giant clumsy guy and the giant clumsy guy boxing out for russ to get rebounds makes sense too  ""waaah paul george fucked a stripper and abandoned his girl then he abandoned the stripper then he's back with the stripper what a dick"" i feel like this one's more about hating on sex workers tbh because it's always about the stripper"
"I thought lebron wanted to trade Kyrie but for Paul George. And then afterwards, Kyrie demanded a trade."
"After what happened to Paul George, I don't want to see a wall anywhere near the court."
Joakim Noah for me. Went to watch Paul George led Pacers back in 2014 and Noah was towering over everything and Derrick Rose was over on the bench in his suit eating lifesavers out of a bowl
Paul George  &gt;  Jimmy Butler
"17-18 is when they had Paul George and Melo. They also had Jerami Grant, Roberson, and Steven Adams."
Paul George &gt; T-Mac
"Just because some teams hit the powerball later in the draft doesn’t mean they didn’t tank at some point. Tanking Assets: this century       Utah - Deron Williams 3rd, Kanter 3rd, Hayward 9th,  Exum 5th       Denver - Tskitishvili  5th, Carmelo 3rd, Mudiay 7th,  Murray 7th        Bucks - TJ Ford - 8th, Bogut - 1st, Yi - 6th, Joe Alexander - 8th , Brandon Jennings - 10th,  Jabari Parker - 2nd,  Thon Maker - 10th.

Indiana is the only team that I can think of that legitimately “never tanks”."
"He’s definitely a great player but he’s also overrated. If he pulled half this shit on another team without the greatest player ever on his side, he would be hated like guys like Paul George are here."

Paul George &gt; Damian Lillard. PG over a lot of guys tbh
You’re telling me that Reggie Jackson and Paul George were avoiding Gobert when they took turns droving in his face and finishing off the glass like 4 times in a row? Lmao. He’s a fucking bum.
Paul George lol
"Prichard: ""So, is that package of Brogdon, LaVert and a first rounder sounding any better now?""  Morey: ""Nope. I'm going to need at least five first round picks and Paul George."""
For example here were the top 10 players in RPM this past season:  1. Curry 2. LeBron 3. Gobert(??) 4. Paul George(?) 5. Giannis 6. Jokic 7. Embiid 8. Harden 9. Lillard 10. Lonzo(?????????)
"Dog, if Paul George liked fishing and wanted out, there's no way Ben the socialite wants to stick around in indy"
"I don’t think presti or most thunder fans think that having a shit ton of picks is a guaranteed way to become a title contender. But for the thunder franchise, with Paul George and westbrook wanting out, it’s the best path towards contending. Having those picks gives you a lot of flexibility. Maybe you can package some to move up a few spots. Maybe they help you trade for a good player. Maybe you can use them to build depth on your team, having multiple picks to try to hit on good players. It’s pretty clearly the best path for the thunder to have taken once their star players wanted out."
You're acting as if they have any chance regardless. Imagine if they were in the West. They missed their championship window when they could have traded Simmons for Leonard or someone like Paul George or another actual superstar.
"No one is calling Davis a victim, they’re pointing out how shitty the whole thing was handled and turned into a clown show by a gm and front office.   Look at the last several stars traded and ask how many were turned into a spectacle. Paul George, harden, kyrie, Westbrook 2X’s. All of those were handled with minimum drama from front office or player even when the player was acting like a snake or throwing a fit (looking at you Paul George and James harden). If the front office handles it well they come out looking better and the players get criticism. Like with kawhi and Spurs. No one blames the Spurs for that, they all know kawhi was being a snake   On the other hand look at how incompetent or bad front offices handle trades. You have butler and the wolves being a total meltdown and media fest, you had Davis and pelicans feuding with the pelicans leaking every single thing said and trying their hardest to make Davis look like a terrible person. There’s a proper way to handle trade request even when you’re not happy with it or mad at the player. Presti is a good example. He honored the trade request and publicly denied that it was a mutual trade but that was it. He didn’t ignore George or spread rumors/leak things. He set the record straight then moved on"
"They lost in 6 in 2020  And in 2020 Paul George played a huge role in the series going that long lol, he was ice cold"
"I think Darius Garland is gonna go from a promising young PG to all-star level  Jaden McDaniels will be really good too, he'll end up being like a early days Paul George-lite type of player"
"I mean anything is possible, but by a lot of accounts Mitchell likes Utah. He shows up to college games and is involved in the community.  He also has very well run organization.   If you were a player and had to chose between the big market Knicks and the Jazz, I think you would pick the Jazz.   If you start looking at the league, I do not know if big markets outside of LA are worth it.   Salt Lake has an extremely fast growing economy and is currently 30th in the nation ahead of San Antonio, Milwaukee, New Orleans, [etc.](https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/) Of the teams with bigger markets, there are only a few options.  * Toronto - Nope - If you have a residence in the states and play in Canada. Lots of taxes.   * New York - The Knicks have been one of the worst run franchises this decade. They may be turning the corner, which may be intriguing.   * Brooklyn - It is an opportunity to win a chip, however it would be a tough situation with volume shooters like Harden, Durrant, and Irving.   * Lakers - I think this would be a good fit, but you would still be third fiddle behind Lebron and Davis.   * Clippers - It is also a good fit and given that George and Kawhi can be passive this is an option. Not a great history of the clippers though. One of the historically worse ran franchises in the NBA.   * Chicago - Nope. - Since Rose, it has been a bad run franchise.   * Dallas - Decent option and Cuban would sell the farm. However, Luka would dominate the ball a majority of the time.  * Warriors - Was an even worse ran franchise in the 90's and early 00's than the clippers. It has since turned around and would be a good place to play.   * Washington DC - What was the last big time free agent the Wizards got? 36 year old Paul Pierce? It is not an attractive destination to free agents.  * Houston - Why would you go from a contender to the current state of affairs that is the Houston Rockets? (Obligatory FTR)  * Boston - Not a bad spot to go, but you have questions with the coaching and management now. Nothing to show they are a contender from their boat load of picks.  * Atlanta - Another team that was a dumpster fire in the past and is looking to turn the corner. Domestically, though Atlanta and Georgia has a ton of issues.  * Phoenix - Made a title run last year after being continuously bad throughout most of recent history.  * Detroit - Struggles to put people in the stands and the organization is dysfunctional.   Salt Lake City is a closer media market to No.3 Chicago than No.3 Chicago is to No.1 New York. Unless you are going to New York or LA, then market size doesn't mean as much as being in a better situation.   Now, as far as the free agency attraction factor. Every team struggles with that. The Knicks, Lakers, Clippers, &amp; Nets did not get Lebron when he left Cleveland the first time or left Miami or Durrant when he left okc. They went to better situations rather than markets.   Let's review the top $ FA's over the past five years, shall we.   **2021**   * Lowry (TOR - MIA) - Smaller Market  * DeRozan (SAS - CHI) - Bigger Market  * Ball (NO- CHI) - Bigger Market  * Markkanen (CHI-CLE) - Smaller Market  * Dinwiddle (BKN - WAS) - Smaller Market  **2020**  * Hayward (BOS - CHA) - Smaller Market  * Bogdanovic (SAC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Gallinari (OKC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Wood (DET - HOU) - Bigger Market  * Crowder (MIA - PHX) - Bigger Market  **2019**  * Durrant (GSW - BKN) - Bigger Market  * Walker (CHA - BOS) - Bigger Market  * Butler (PHI - MIA) - Smaller Market  * Russell (BKN - GSW) - Smaller Market  * Horford (BOS - PHI) - Smaller Market  **2018**  * James (CLE - LAL) Bigger Market  * Anderson (SAS - MEM) Smaller Market  * Jordan (LAC - DAL) Smaller Market  * McDermott (DAL - IND) Smaller Market  * Ilyasova (PHI - MIL) Smaller Market  **2017**  * Hayward (UTA - BOS) Bigger Market  * Reddick (LAC - PHI) Smaller Market  * Milsap (ATL - DEN) Smaller Market  * Teague (IND - MIN) Bigger Market  * Hill (UTA - SAC) Bigger Market  There are a few big names in here, but most of the guys on the list were overpaid to move and didn't make the team they went too a lot better. This year remains to be seen.   The mid tier free agents or sleepers are where any team can find players. And these players will go to any team that pays them the most.   A lot of player movement is done by trades and not the result of free agency. Teams generally fight to their talent or trade them away for compensation."
"I don’t think LeVert or Brogdon should be in any teams long term plans. So makes sense for Indiana to get a building block in Simmons while Philly gets a couple great rotation players in their primes.  Do it every time imo. They signed Brogdon as an FA, got LeVert in the Dipo trade, so you’re basically turning Dipo (plus some picks) into Simmons (or if you want to go even deeper, turning Paul George into Simmons and Sabonis."
Cap on what? Them not being favored to win the championship despite him playing with those players? Lmao.   That’s cool but that belief is wrong from your own admittance. You just said Jrue won a chip on a team that has been worse than past Westbrook teams lmaoooo.   Paul George played at a MVP level one time and underplayed in 2018. The difference is I don’t have to be bias and ignore one side of Westbrook like you do. **Westbrook wasn’t good in 2018 and was awful (albeit hobbled) in 2019.** That still doesn’t deny the fact that the Thunder had zero chance to win a championship in those years.
"&gt;Do you not think Westbrook has been apart of teams better than the 2021 Bucks fuzzy butt scratcher?  Yes he has. Multiple times.  And no, im not comparing competition. Although I think an argument could be made that Westbrook only having made it to 1 finals despite playing with KD, Paul George, or James harden in like what, 8 of the last 10 seasons? kind of says a lot about his ability to be the primary ball handler on a championship team."

"Tbf I can’t think of one example of a guy forcing a trade somewhere, and then again after it.  Closest thing I could think of was Paul George, but I’m not sure he forced his way out of OKC - I thought it was kind of reciprocal"
"They've seldom gotten very high placement in the draft, so it's had to hit on All-Stars every time.   But they draft Leonard, Paul George, Danny Granger, Lance Stephenson, Al Harrington, Austen Croshere, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis, Reggie Miller, and the highest pick among them was 10.   So, yeah, over the last 30 years, I'd say they've done a good job with the draft considering how seldom they've gotten a top ten pick."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
imagine googling “Paul George excuses” lmao  That is just sad
watch how he guarded paul george in the preseason
"I'm open to both possibilities. The reality is, no one knows but Paul George."
"&gt;All his other excuses and their validity are completely irrelevent  Not when it was brought up in the same interview to coverup for the same folly.  And notice how I didn't criticize Rui's leave of absence in a thread about Rui. Mental health is real and people deserve support.   Could Paul George's mental health issues be real and could I be completely off base? Yes.   Could Paul George be making it up to avoid accountability? Yes.  If we think the latter is happening because of a pattern of other behavior, should we be obligated not to mention it because the former may still be true? I don't think so. He's a public individual getting criticized for doing a bad job at his public job."
"He said he was being misused because Doc Rivers wasn't putting him in PnR's. He had a career high in PnR... And there are supercuts of him making excuses in the immediate aftermath of the bubble. Google ""Paul George Excuses."" And you'll find multiple supercuts."
"I can't take basketball references hof probablity seriously, they have kawhi and giannis below Kyrie, Paul George, Lowry, Dame, and Davis.  They use some sort of formula to determine players probability."
Paul George should average 25-5-5  Clippers probably a play-in team
Ok? Plenty of stars have requested for trades. Paul George forced his way out of indiana. Obviously it worked out well but oladipo forced his way out too. At least simmons is doing it for a good reason (the entire fanbase hates his guts).
"You think Curry would do as well in a Jason Kidd offense? Or if he was drafted on the Kings or something? Obviously he's an incredible player but he's also incredibly fortunate. I'm not making a judgement but claiming objectivity as if we're able to control all the circumstances around a superstar is silly.  Plenty of people have said that Harden was elevated by playing with D'Antoni, KD always has an MVP on his team, Bron has 2 All-Stars, etc. They say Kawhi is a system player, Paul George is a choker, Kobe is a chucker, Duncan is nothing without Pop, etc.  Silly to assume that Curry only benefits his teammates and does not benefit from them."
"&gt; He's had just as many fails in the playoffs as successes but has the reputation as some kind of ""ultimate winner""  That's because out of the Top 20 players in the NBA (he's in the 14-20 range), he is obviously the least talented that's why he's not held to standards to the likes of Tatum, Paul George and everyone in the Top 10. Like nobody expected him and his squad to actually reach the Finals during the bubble."
"Best in what sense? Most attempts? No disrespect to Harden but in terms of volume efficiency, he’s not close to Curry. If you set the minimum at 500+ attempts, in most recent years, Klay, Lillard, Paul George, Hield, and Duncan Robinson are all ahead of him. Even at 700+ just looking at last season for them and literally any Harden season (since he had far fewer attempts in Brooklyn), he would still be behind Lillard and Hield (and Curry obviously)."
"The answer should be either a wing or a very athletic guard as rebounding is the key here. That's why guys like Dame and Steph will rarely record a triple-double while, for Luka and LeBron who play as PGs, it's almost too easy. Therefore:  De'Aaron Fox is the first name that came to my mind along with LaMelo Ball. Jokic is an unusual Center who can play like a guard so I'll pick him next. Paul George, this season specifically with the expected high-usage, can be a regular triple-double guy."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"The problem is that they ONLY go to LA, NY or Miami. Kawhi had his 1 year in Toronto then straight to LA where he added Paul George. LeBron went back to Cleveland and then straight to LA where he made himself GM and added Anthony Davis.    It's not good for the league, it's not good for fans, and ratings reflect this. /r/NBA is obviously an NBA-focused community, but the NBA itself is losing ratings hand over fist."
"The clippers are going to rely a ton on Paul George staying healthy and Reggie Jackson continuing his great play from the playoffs. If both of those things don't happen, they could fall into the play-in but I don't think it's super likely."
"People are acting like this is a harden or Paul George situation where the team got blindsided by the request but it’s really not all that comparable. Both sides are just done with each other, and I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything quite like this happen before"
"Basketball is pretty big in Indiana too. The fans are **loyal** to their players, to the point I think its a great fit for Simmons. If Paul George and Danny Granger were kings there, so could Ben Simmons. There aren't these unreal expectations when you play for the Pacers. Show up, try hard, fight for your team, pull off the occasional upset and the fans will go bananas for you. If he goes to New York or Cali, he's just another dude in a box full of famous people. In Indiana, he would be a top tier celeb.  Any to your actual point, Indy is a pretty fun place to be. It's not Chicago, New York, or LA, but that's not always a bad thing. There's nice dining, lots of events/concerts/plays, and amazing venues. Both the Fieldhouse and Lucas Oil Stadium are absolutely stunning places. There's the museums, the malls, and enough nightlife to keep a person occupied. The summers get hot, but not Texas hot. The winters get cold, but not Wisconsin cold. And for someone thats going to fly a lot, Indianapolis International is an accessible, easy place to fly in and out of.  There are also plenty of *really* nice, quieter areas nearby Indy to live. Carmel/Fishers/Zionsville... Noblesville/Westfield if you want to drive just a little further. Those are amazing places to live that have high end real estate, which by the way, is much cheaper in Indiana than in New York. A million dollar crib in Indiana is night and day to a million dollar crib in NY.  Ben Simmons would be a big deal in Indy."
"If this roster as-is can't even make the playoffs, then they probably should rebuild. I personally think the playoffs should be a lock if they're healthy. But the team as currently constructed is completely capped out, and I wouldn't consider any of their contracts particularly egregious.  And they have a no. 1 overall pick that has the talent to be the best player of all.  If that team is healthy and they're still struggling for an 8th seed, then Ben Simmons is definitely not the answer.    Not saying they shouldn't put any draft capital on the table, but when it starts approaching the Paul George trade, then I think that's way too risky."
"First comment was incomplete don’t know why it posted but no one is saying Lebron is exempt from the aging process that’s a dumb straw man you are making.  His injuries have context outside of “oh he’s getting older” because they are of the acute bad luck nature that he has been lucky enough not to have suffered.   As long as I’ve been watching LBJ, I ain’t never seen someone dive at his leg the way Solomon Hill did and even rarer have I seen an NBA player suffer a high ankle sprain in the way that LBJ injured his. It’s literally a freak accident.  Like Curry running into a metal step and breaking his tailbone, or Paul George running into the bball stanchion and breaking his leg. Or the kid who played for the magic who dislocated his ankle so bad that it broke skin and he was bleeding on the court.   These are literal freak accidents and have less of a bearing on your ability to get repeatedly injured than say wear and tear injuries like low ankle sprains or knee injuries.    So saying LBJ got injured 2 of his last 3 years without the context of the type of injury (acute v chronic) and the actual track record of the player is disingenuous. In constrast ppl seriously worry about Curry’s ability to stay on the floor as he gets older due to the frequency of injuries he’s had over his career. Same with Kahwai due to his knee condition.   It would be a bigger deal if the injuries he suffered were related to chronic issues indicating breakdown, but they are not."
"Look at 0:07 to 0:10. Paul George is trying to walk down Davion Mitchell and Mitchell is having none of it. He perfectly mirrors George's movements at the top of the key. When George decides to drive to the hoop, Mitchell is right there with him. It's incredible, really."
"This was good defense. It would take better offense to win the possession, and Paul George is absolutely capable of it, but he didn’t execute this time."
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris Harden, Irving, KD Embiid. CP3, Booker, Young, Jokic, Donic. Kawhai, Paul George, Jimmy Buckets, Bam AD, LeBron. LaMelo. Lillard.Tatum. Zion. LaVine. Brown. Murray. Klay. Steph. Gobert. Sabonis. Westbrook."
"Yep, just trade the guy already...  **10 NBA Superstars Who Forced A Trade**   NBA players switch teams all the time, whether through free agency or a trade. Sometimes a player is traded because another team wants them to improve their roster, or because of salary cap constraints. But other times, players get traded because they request the trade themselves, and then end up at a destination that they prefer.    NBA superstars’ trade requests carry a lot of weight. These players are the face of the franchise, and are usually the highest paid players on a roster. If they request a trade, then their franchise usually trades them to avoid dealing with a disgruntled superstar, and in hopes gaining value for the future in return, such as high draft picks. If the franchise holds out, then the player forces a trade using the leverage that they have. Here are 10 superstars throughout NBA history that have forced trades to other franchises:      1. Anthony Davis   2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Wilt Chamberlain   5. Chris Paul   6. James Harden   7. Kyrie Irving   8. Vince Carter   9. Carmelo Anthony   10. Paul George"
"Ok but literally everyone just saw it, acting a little surprised just shows u can respect and appreciate a good play. It’s not like if his eyes got a little big his player would be humiliated.   We gotta take time to appreciate great plays when they happen. I don’t like Paul George, but when he makes a great play I’ll still at least say “dannngg that was tough”. I’m not selling out my team, just showing respect where respect is due"
"Underrated: Paul George, people just see the clips of game winners on him and think he gets cooked all the time or something  Overrated: LeBron after the 2016 Finals, he’s still strong and is fairly good against guys like Giannis but top tier perimeter players can do pretty well against him"
Didn't indiana make a prodigy out of paul george?
"Basketball isn’t played on paper, we’ve seen the level Giannis has played at despite his flaws. Would you take KD over similarly flawed players like prime Shaq or Wilt? Would you take a less flawed player like Paul George over Giannis?"
"Yup, most players who play like shit are just injured or not 100%. Same with Paul George and his shoulder in the bubble."
"between Paul George and now Simmons, I think MAX contracts should have a hard no trade until 50% of the contract is up or 2 years.  dont sign a max contract if you don't want to be there.  maybe it will even make teams think twice about offering it too"
"He had negative win shares for that series.  For all the heat Paul George got in 2019, he was nowhere near as bad as Jimmy was in 2021"
"Paul George (31)  and Malcom Brogdan (29 this Dec).  Paul George was a 7 year Pacer and the leading scorer of that team for many years. Malcom Brogdon was a rookie of the year in 2017 and took over as the Pacers leading scorer last season.  Also, Malcom sounds like former president Obama. Just a fun fact."
So it's the Paul George story again minus the two trips to the ECF ?
Bucks match up with the Clippers incredibly well. Clippers love there small ball 5 out lineup and Giannis at the 5 would decimate whatever the Clippers would try to throw at the Bucks.  Paul George also said his toughest matchup in the league is Jrue Holiday. PJ &amp; Khris would’ve done just fine on Kawhi too.
"Paul George didn’t force his way. He only signed the extension on the condition that okc would facilitate a trade in the future if he wanted to leave. https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/11/07/when-re-signing-paul-george-thunder-gave-him-trade-option-windhorst-said/  Not sure what point you’re trying to make with cp3, the rockets wanted to trade him, he didn’t force his way out. Harden wanted him gone. My argument had nothing to do with max deals being traded. My argument was that Kd lacks the leverage to force a trade because he committed to 5 years of contract this summer."
Paul George also forced his way out after a max deal.  CP3 signed a max contract with the Rockets and is playing it out on the Suns.  Max deals are moved *all the time* in the modern NBA.
"There has will always be situations like Simmons but what makes his situation weird is that in normal cases the players mostly top 15 players like Harden,Davis, and Paul George  is that they want to be traded to a contender while Simmons is willing to accept a worse team and situation to get his way while not even being remotely the type of players that came before him."
"I'd say that the KD and Harden hate is the most permanent as well tbh  Draymond goes between ""he's so underrated"" and ""fuck the donkey"" on here depending what day it is, the opinion on him is mixed overall  Simmons and Kyrie are hated because of current NBA events, but it might be a one year thing like with Paul George who is a lot more respected now for the most part  KD and Harden have very few stans compared to other superstars and still have probably the 2nd and 3rd most haters behind LeBron"
"It’s something that’s been repeated enough that everyone believes it.  You see way more guys outside of the center position needing a couple of years to really get off the runway.  Lowry, Paul George, Kawhi, Butler etc"
"""I don't get why you just didn't cross him up Paul george, hesi, and shoot a fade away jumper over kawhi. that's what I would have done"""
"Just eyeballing Klay and Dame feel maybe a bit early. Maybe Manu and CWebb. Possibly Ben Wallace deserves to be in there, Kyrie. Paul George has to be close too. Adrian Dantley is always underrated. Your list is good though.  It'll be interesting if they go younger. Jokic, Embiid, and Luka will all qualify in a few years if they don't already."
"Wasn't Paul George similar though? All of those other stars had bigger salaries and multiple years. They also weren't thrown under the bus.  I don't agree with what Ben has done. He could've easily gone in and just done nothing or played badly, but this comment is bs when it's happened in the past."
"OK. So we might be talking about different things when we define a ""wash"". Yes. This season might be a wash if they can't get a trade package that gives them a really good chance to go to the next level and make the Finals or win it all. But that assumes Ben Simmons should command a player like Dame back in a trade and I don't think most people would agree with that. Not getting a HOF player might make this season meaningless but it doesn't mean the transaction was a failure. What the Sixers need to get where they want this season is not something that's sitting right there for them. They need a Harden or Steph or a Dame. CJ or Beal probably doesn't get it done. But it's way off base to assume any team would trade a player like that for Ben Simmons. The same way the Blazers aren't getting a completely healthy two way player like Kawhi, Paul George or even Klay Thomson for CJ. It's not just sitting there for them. They don't have the trade assets. And the Sixers just don't."
No he didn’t presti himself killed that rumor and said the trade was 100% no mutual. Basically Confirming paul George is a snake and liar
"""With absolutely no context, which player is better? Player A scores 24 ppg, Player B scores 23 ppg""  ""I can't believe you said Player A! That was Collin Sexton. Player B was Paul George. You absolute idiot."""
Didn’t Paul George already set that precedent? He got a trade a year after signing his max. But he wasn’t a Klutch agent going to the Lakers so nobody cared.
"Paul George was pretty damning too. Signed a 5 year extension to dip 1 year into it, I'm actually extremely pro-player in most of these scenarios but we've swung too far on the pendulum to the point where your contract doesn't actually matter anymore, if you're good enough you can just say fuxk you I'm moving on and demand a trade like that."
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."
"With the disclaimer that I think it's highly unlikely on a case by case basis that any of these guys would be available.  Guards: Dame, Beal, Kyrie, Conley, SGA, LaVine, FVV  Forwards: Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Gordon Hayward  Maybe I'm missing someone but that's 11 guys. I'd say there's a small chance at least one of them is available at some point. That's what we're playing for."
Paul George did OKC a massive favor cause they’re legitimately in a way better position now than they were when they had him
I thought Austin was part of the Paul George trade?
Would you rather guard Embiid in the paint or Paul George at the arc?
bruh it’s a joke. he’s the only paul george
"He’s great for entertainment. Relentless drives, flashy passes, awesome dunks and just his energy is great. But, at this point, Brodie the Builder hasn’t really proven he can win in recent times even with decent help (i.e Paul George, Rockets Harden.) I hope that changes because I wanna see the Lakers win 18, and overtake Boston. I also wanna see Bron win his 5th. Overrated? Well the best way I can summarize Russ is he’s a Schrodinger’s NBA player where he’s subsequently overrated and underrated. In the regular season, he’s productive. In the playoffs post 2017, not so much."
He was the 3rd option in the playoffs on a 5-seed 1st round exit.   Also this is comparing him to Paul George
"Not as good.   Paul George is a hell of a player and I think you are overrating SGA. SGA is a good young player, great at creating for himself, but he isn’t a 2nd option on a playoff team, especially when Kawhi first got to LA."
Is Paul George a superstar or just a star?
"Hurt himself like Paul George did. Google ""Paul George injury"" (or not, it's gruesome)."
&gt; Melo top 5 worst superstars ever even in his prime never accomplished anything of value  &gt; Prime for prime worst than Paul George.  Imagine having to go home and face the wife and kids knowing you're one of the top 5 worst superstars ever.
"If you saw him lock up Kawaii, Lebron, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Paul George every time they played last year you’d change your mind about him being a DPOY. He’s one of the very best on ball defenders in the league now and is also an excellent team defender.  Being a number 3 option on a championship contending team is worth a max nowadays. Especially for durable players like Wiggins."
"Which is weird because a lot of elite tier players these days are in their 30s: Curry, KD, Lillard, Bron, Paul George, Harden, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, and some of these guys like Curry and KD are better than ever."
Listen to what Paul George said the other night about defending him. He's going to get where he wants to get no matter what you do
"Also the circumstances were so much different. He was just on a mission in 16/17, one of the greatest personal seasons ever in my opinion. Just carrying bums day in and day out. Following year, he got Paul George, and the triple double didn’t have the same allure the second time around. But yes I agree, his play definitely dipped as well."
Is it weird that I see a bit of Paul George in the way he moved on that stepback
Ja is now tied with Paul George for PPG leader at 35.0
"Yes. But he'll need 2 other all star caliber guys. Maybe a trio of Dame, Paul George, and KAT? I think Paul George is just below Dame in terms of player rankings so he sl would still be the best player."
Paul Fucking George
"This motherfucker actually thinks Paul George.... should be top 75?  The fuck outta here, /u/Pedophile_In_Therapy"
"Pretty close. Paul George is in my top 85.   AD is a lock though and has a clearly better resume than Paul George and he’s 3 years younger.    The people who think Davis shouldn’t deserve a spot are complete ducking morons with zero knowledge of the game. Please tell me why Davis is the one people are saying shouldn’t be on the list when guys like Reggie Miller, Dave Bing, Jerry Lucas, Lenny Wilkins are on the list.   There are 23 players on the list that were active in the 1968 NBA season and there are 11 current players on the list.    12 more players from the weakest era in nba history then I’m the strongest era in nba history. Make that make sense     It you fucking morons are still gonna say AD and Lillard  should be the ones bumped for Dwight.     No those guys deserve their spots, take bing, Lucas, Wilkins, Miller, Sharman off that list and add Dwight, Parker, Jokic, etc"
WHY IS AD INSISTING IN PLAYING LIKE PAUL GEORGE
"I'm not mad, the clippers absolutely bodies their future for Paul George"
Lavine and Paul George
Paul George by far. Incredible player
Surprised Paul George isn't being mentioned more.
The answer is Paul George
Eh pre leg injury Paul George and 3rd in mvp voting Paul George were smooth but other than that I don’t see it as much anymore
Kyrie and Paul George
It’s Paul George
"That Embiid is a top 10 player. I would rather have Tatum, Mitchell, Kyrie or Paul George over him for both the regular season and playoffs."
"It’s Paul George, but watching yesterday’s Hawks game, Trae had moments that made me say “damn he smooth”"
"Paul George, don’t you dare use D-Rose’s name in vain!"
Paul George
Sorry but no chance he gets MVP. That’s an awful bet    Start off with the fact that the clippers without Kawhi aren’t that great of a team and definitely aren’t a top 4 team in the west. His team has gotta be over 50 wins if he wants a shot at MVP    Secondly Paul George is way too inconsistent. He’s had a great start to the season but he is gonna soon follow up these games with some 7 point on 4/18 shooting performances because that’s who he has always been.    He’s called “PG 13 or 30” for a reason. He is trash one night and an elite two way superstars the next
"Tatum is a baller but he's not as good as Luka. I think he's as good as say, Paul George, right now."
Paul George? Lmao dude looks like he’s tripping over his own feet anytime he tries to drive
"Kawhi is not smooth, in my opinion. Paul George is much more sneaky. Kawhi just does moves and gets to his spots and bets that you won’t stop him. He’s much more like Kobe, MJ while PG is more like TMac."
Arguably Paul George Sr is the LVPG
Paul George and Kevin Durant
"Wait wut, I’m am crazy for thinking Indiana Paul George was then best version?????"
"Relax dude, this isn’t some character assassinatiom that needed an AP English thesis statement.   It’s all relative. He certainly doesn’t play with the intensity or passion of someone like Giannis, Luka, Trae, etc. and I don’t even think every star has to be like that, just look at Paul George and Kawhi."
Most Valuable Paul George  But unfortunately also Least Valuable Paul George
"He’s the prototype. Paul George at his best looks effortless.   I haven’t seen Harden mentioned. Harden is jazz to me with the big, looping dribbling style. Westbrook is heavy metal, the opposite of smooth. He’s coming at you at 120 mph."
KD or Paul George.
Paul George is really smooth for his size
"It's close between Paul George and KD, when those two have it going its a thing of beauty."
It’s Paul George guys
Paul George or KD
It’s Paul George and it’s not even close
"We thought he would break out like 2 years ago after the Blazers tried to lose the final regular season game against the Kings on purpose but rookie Simons dropped like 40 and almost singlehandedly won the game by himself. It led us be matched against OKC instead of Utah in the first round, resulting in the infamous Damian Lillard 37 footer 3 bomb over Paul George."
"Paul “Despite the loss” George should be his career tag line. Always doin work, always losing."
"Tatum is a good example but he gets called many times , the one player who gets away with push off almost every single time is Paul George it's honestly impressive."

"Is one clip really enough to make you this smug and sure of yourself? You can find a clip of Paul George blowing by a prime Miami Heat Lebron and dunking it, pretty similar to this clip. Someone getting blown by does not mean they do not play adequate defense."
Paul George with the Pacers.
I bet one of my friends big Paul George wouldn’t end up in the top five mvp voting…why do I do how I do
"Na he's a good defender.  I find he's almost always overrated or underrated.  Btw, can I ask in those 79 possessions with Bev as primary defender, how many included a double (or triple) team?  Also, usually the way they measure primary defender still considers them primary defender if, for example, Steph goes around a screen and the closest contest isn't actually Bev.  So if Bev is guarding him, then chases him and falls behind but Paul George gets a hand up, Bev is primary defender still.  So I'm not sure how to view that in context, but regardless it's a good defensive job on Steph."
"Eh, it wasn't really just Beverley.  It was Beverley holding him off ball, and the length of Paul George and Kawhi bothering him on switches.  But yes, he scores a portion of his points on ball and a good on ball defender will reduce that.  More importantly, it takes the ball out of his hands and forces our other players to make good plays, which is harder."
"&gt; But he should have been the 2nd best player on a championship team, not the centerpiece  And Paul George should be the centrepiece?   I have no horse in this race but I'll put Melo in solely for longevity over Paul George. And that's not PG's fault. He has 6 years to overtake Melo but as of right now, Melo is the more obvious option."
Uh yeah but the difference is you picked ring winners..not paul george who hasnt even made the finals.
These two games are starting to make me change my mind about about Paul George being massively overrated.
Paul George two games in a row…..
"to be fair, neither has Paul George. The furthest either of them have been is the Conference Finals."
"For each player after 11 seasons, Melo averaged 25.3 ppg while Paul George averages 20.2 ppg. Melo is a generational scorer, PG is an all-nba player but not even close to the same level of scoring. Also, you put a young Melo in this era and he would score even better than he did when he first joined the league."
"no team is perfect, everyone has deficiencies at some area but i really like when y’all go small ball, my main issue is that instead of playing team basketball like you do for 46 minutes a game you resort to looking for some way to pass it to Paul George instead of passing the ball to get a better shot in the last 2 minutes"
Wait Paul George didn't make the top 75 list??
Paul George averaged 13 points against us last year……
Will be exciting to see how far Paul George can take this Clippers team. He's still a superstar imo
Paul George is the king of hitting big shots and still losing
Paul George is putting up MVP type numbers but if his team can’t win these close games he’ll never win the award
Paul George came to play. Tough shot.
Paul George is ridiculous
OP grasping at straw men right now to make one of his favorite players in Paul George look better. He does the same shit with Kawhi by constantly trying to diminish LeBron’s accomplishments. I honestly think he’s a closet Clippers fan.
"If I know /r/nba like I think I do, they will hate on him until it's all you see when you see his name (a la Paul George prior to 2021) then there will be a 180 because it will be cool to not hate Porziņģis.   It's insufferable. r/nba is just a hivemind. No one even watches Porziņģis play, they just want him to play poorly so they can get karma."
It's sad that fans and the media are just okay with cyber bullying and pounding these players into the dirt until they just mentally boom. And then wonder why shit like this happens. I found the Paul George stuff last year disgusting and excessive as well.  It's like these people won't stop until one of these players kills themselves. Then they'll turn around and realize that millions of dollars doesn't somehow magically shield these players from depression.
Paul George in his prime on the Pacers
Paul George.
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
Paul George. Perfect followup to Reggie and Danny Granger. How could pacers not build around him and let me go for garbage.
"I completely agree. With the way we worship the rich and famous, we sometimes forget that they’re human. Poor guy probably feels so alone. I’ve never been a Ben Simmons fan, but I respect him and he deserves human decency. It’s gross to me how NBA players are treated when they have mental health issues. Same thing has happened to Paul George."
"I don't know what you mean by skill here, but through overall physical prowess, god given talent, mastered skills and on court leadership- those players are clearly better than Lillard has been, regardless of team success. Even AD who I called ""arguably"" better than Lillard has almost twice the career MVP shares which he almost exclusively earned while accumulating losing seasons on the Pelicans. Lillard at his best has been on the tail end of top ten players in the league and with most of the players in that top ten generally being in the West, he has consistently lost to better players in the playoffs. If he didn't sell the loyalty gimmick in the player empowerment era, we wouldn't be considering him any better than Paul George, who I still maintain is overall a better player than him despite saying stupid things to the press."
Paul George too
"It's still dumb to me to keep the top 50 from 1996. When they were ranking the top 50 in 96 there was less talent to be judged (let's say 2000 players). Now that they're ranking the top 75 out of say 4000, it's only natural the guys at the bottom of the top 50 list get pushed further down by all the new talent. Especially when a lot of these guys were very marginal talents.  Like by all means keep Petit, Mikan, Cousy on there. But we've got dudes who made 2 all star teams and never won a championship or MVP in the 60s on this list. Even players like Paul George and Jimmy Butler are more accomplished than some of the low tier 50s/60s players."
Some that I haven't seen:  Houston failing Harden OKC failing Russ Detroit failing Grant Hill Houston failing T-Mac Indiana failing Paul George
"Outside of CP3 and Patrick Ewing:   Carmelo Anthony, Dominique Wilkins, and lowkey Dame Lillard, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler"
"Yeah, I think if those three were together they could make it to the finals. Maybe Paul George instead of Harden??"
Lol no my dude you conveniently ignore lots and lots of   context that ultimately destroy your points  and  you keep firing out baseless takes the bubble was an even playing field and it's not like some lower seeded team made the finals the lakers and heat were both legit that postseason and you keep undermining the heat here... The lost because they had trash ass playoff choker Eric Bledsoe if you actually followed the bucks throughout the 2020 and 2021 playoofs you'd know how important Jrue was to defeating the Heat as opposed to having Bledsoe still also isn't Paul George known to dissappear and disappoint in the Playoffs? Prior to the 2020 playoofs he was tremendous last postseason and the clippers actually had a better roster my guy this is gatekeeping to the max lmfaoo
Paul George
Paul George off the side of the backboard
Danny “Paul George” Green
PG: Bob Cousy  SG: Jerry West  SF: Paul Arizin  PF: Bob Pettit  C: George Mikan  6th: Havlicek
"Yeah I think in the 4th the Sixers started guarding him much tighter and he forced a few difficult shots  Kind of like what happened to Paul George against you guys last night, you were legit hard doubling him on every single play in the last 5 minutes lmao"
"I know I'm supposed to hate the Celtics but it's very, very hard. Tatum is so smooth, man, he reminds me of Paul George."
Paul George unbraids hair so it can blow away in the wind like the clippers season.
"He doesn't dominate possessions because he is incapable. If a coach forced Durant/Middleton/Paul George into a 3D role, they could definitely do what Klay does. But they are asked to do more, because they can. Klay at best averaged 22 points and 2 assists..."
Thank you. No way Paul George is over Tracy McGrady
"Paul George game 4 2017 1st round vs Cavs. Let's not forget that after CJ Miles had a chance to win game 1, he talked about how he HAS to be the guy taking the last shot in that situation. When the situation presented itself, [this is what he did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irDfUKBwSWI)"
The irony of Westbrook is when you give him subpar players he excels. Give him actual help in the form of Paul George/Harden/Beal he underperforms.
From current players...  Midorima - Klay  Akashi - CP3  Aomine - Kyrie  Kise - LaVine/Paul George  Murasakibara - Embiid
"No he would just be another Danny Granger, who basically looked like Paul George 1.0"
"Like I said, you're pointing out a correlation.   Okay we can look at the more average joe. Shane Larkin had a wingspan of 5'10, mediocre if not bad shooter.   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.   Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.   Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.   Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.   Wilt despite having Gobert level wingspan and shooting terribly from free throws, had actual reputation for being an elite perimeter player at the time. KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan.   I'm not really seeing a pattern here."
I love the new Paul George
This sub when Paul George had a good game last year
"Russ gets the Lakers tied then bricks away a chance to win, thus forcing the Heat to play overtime the night before they play the Clippers. still coming through for his brother Paul George. you love to see it"
CJ frustrated he played like trash and was too fucking small to guard Paul George
"you guys are really not the brightest..  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-blasts-referees-after-clippers-lose-to-warriors   ""never bitched"".. go fuck off soy boy.. unreal how low IQ this sub is"
And Harden has had a much worse start than both...doesn't mean we're throwing his talents out the window. We know Harden is still a top 10 player the same way we know that Paul George isn't. If everyone stays the same for a few dozen games we can talk more seriously.
paul george has had a better start to the season by some margin.
There's no way you're saying Luka is worse than Paul George LOL
"I'd like to see another angle. [I remember the paul george no call against utah a few years ago in the playoffs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzGRV0ZysI) I was irate that it was a no call until I saw a second angle, and realized PG was leaning SIDEWAYS into gobert. This play looked similar."
Fuck them kids  -Paul George
"Paul George is having maybe his best season so far too.  Rise above it, don't bitch.  They aren't treating you any different than anyone else."
Wouldn't the best person to ask be Paul George?
"""That kid means nothing to me"" - Paul George"
I'm surprised by Paul George having that many FTAs per game when he had 4 games with 0 FTAs
Middleton is a better second option than most other team's second options but name recognition has put other players like Paul George or Russell Westbrook ahead of him. Also Jrue Holiday is a better point guard than Westbrook
"I like how the Clippers leak this after a win, lol.  Crazy that no other pictures or video of anything  inside the locker room, including any strategies, is ever leaked under any circumstances unless it’s D’Lo or Paul George trying to take another dig at Portland."
I am starting to think drafting:  &amp;#x200B;  * OJ Mayo over Westbrook   * Rubio over Curry * Wesley Johnson over Paul George * Derek Williams over Kawhi * Shabazz Muhammad over Giannis * Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray * Jarret Culver over Tyler Herro      was a mistake...
"I still think moving on from KAT may be the best answer, I'm not really sure. I just think he is criminally underrated simply for being a Timberwolf so I want to defend him. Plenty of great players struggled until getting paired with a superstar and a good supporting cast. Bosh, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Booker, etc.  There are only so many Lebrons and KDs. Even for them, basketball is a team sport no matter how much we focus on individuals."
"When Ingram sucked early, plenty of people were pointing to the trajectory of Paul George, DeMar Derozan, etc. It was met by the same response. ""Just because those players improved, doesn't mean he will.""  Sometimes you have to actually watch young talent play to see the potential as opposed to the just looking at the box scores.  Ingram was a shooter all through high school and college, but when he got to the league he couldn't throw the ball into the ocean sitting in a boat. Despite that, he showed an unexpected ability to get to the rim that should have actually increased his ceiling. Instead, box score watchers point to his inability to shoot as lowering it, rather than considering the possibility that a kid who was a shooter all his life would eventually find his shot as he settled into the NBA."
"For you, the day Paul George graced your court was the most important day of your life. But for me... it was Tuesday"
"Paul George is winning MVP, we finish 4th in seeding."
"It is not that I'm siding with Ben Simmons, but I also think Morey has been handling this like a complete moron. We legit saw this guy have a mental breakdown in his game. This is before all thsi mess. We KNEW something was up with him mentally. He does terribly in the playoffs. he's not a ""superstar""-level talent after seeing his disfunction, you don't want him on your team, yet you ask for everyoen trading for him for AD/Paul George level assets. HELL FUCKING NO. It's so fucking dumb.    As for siding with Ben Simmons, I really hope this mental health stuff isn't BS because it will do so much damage to people who really are going through issues if he's lying, but holy shit, Philly FO and coaching have done a TERRIBLE job with this. It's not so much siding with Ben Simmons, its seeing how both sides are complete idiots instead of just Simmons."
“I don’t even know who you are.” -Paul “Thanos” George
Paul George punching the air
Why people do this to only Russ . I don’t see curry fans mention injury everytime someone bring up 2016 final. Or Paul George fan on bunch of playoff series where he was injured earlier.   3.8 turnover is horrible when ur not even the main handler. By far he was handling the ball way less tha harden and still had that much turnover.
"But for me, it was Tuesday. - Paul George"
"Yeah I watched the entire game, including this moment and paul george never even acknowledged the kid. Kid was just in the camera shot flexing. Idk why journalists tried making it into a whole special moment lmao. PG’s answer in this vid proves it. cringe reporter"
"Paul ""I do not remember that little kid"" George"
Poor kid. Gonna tell all his friends at Westly Prep Academy that Paul George saw him and acknowledged him and it would all be a lie.
"Confirmed, Paul George has no soul."

~~Luka~~ Paul George: Too Freaken Small
Paul George also technically is a PG.
"I don't like Paul George, but I have to respect his game now, he just completely destroys Portland every damn time."
"Luka averaged 35 10 8 in 7 games last year against kawhi and Paul George as his primary defenders. I would say the mavs roaster besides luka is worse than the blazers roaster without dame, the mavs had better records than blazers both last year and the year before"
"You can actually rank how good a player is based on how far they carried Westbrook. Durant carried Westbrook to the finals with Harden (thunders), west conference final without Harden (thunders), Harden carried Westbrook to the second round (rockets), Paul George carried Westbrook to first round (thunder). So the conclusion is KD&gt;Harden&gt;PG."
"Come on player a kahwi less clippers should have been beaten by the jazz. They aren’t true contenders if they can’t beat a Paul George lead team . Every year this happens everyone overrates teams that are good but eith no superstar and think they’re contenders , the heat are solid but no superstar so I wouldn’t say contender ."
"Ok, his trade deadline deal for hill didn’t work. He managed to turn the albatross of horfords contract into danny green, and fleeced the mavs in the Seth curry move. Maxey, Joe and BBall Paul were a master class in drafting, and his free agent additions of Drummond on the minimum and Niang have been perfect so far this year. So. Yeah. Miss me on the injured George hill swing he took last year"
Dame cannot guard paul george
"Idk, Luka was the best player in a series where Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were on the floor. Took healthy clips to 7 with no true second option on his team   At the same time Jokic was the best player on a WCF team and has an MVP  Can go either way tbh"
Paul George on a mission 🔥
Paul George and Dame should put aside their differences and team up
Great to see Paul George coming through against blitz 1 v 8 defense.
Paul George &gt; Damiam Lillard
How was that a foul on paul George I’m still confused on that
"More or less our problem is lillard. He is the engine of the team and for the most part, we go as he goes. Imagine if Paul George was playing how lillard is currently playing right now. The clippers would probably have like one win maybe two. If lillard was playing to his standards, we would probably have one of the best records in the league right now.   About the stats for Nurk diving to the basket, I’m pretty sure I saw somewhere that he is the worst starting center in the nba in fg% at the rim. He constantly takes little bunnies and finesse shots instead of going up hard for the finish and he misses most of his shots when he does this."
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
"Gus Johnson, Artis Gilmore, Paul Silas, Al Attles, Bob Rule, Wilt Chamberlain, Darryl Dawkins, Truck Robinson, George McGinnis, Nate Thurmond, Wes Unseld, Shaq, Rodman, Karl Malone, Barkely, Marques Johnson, Lloyd Free, Shawn Kemp, Bill Cartright, Jerome Kersey, Lonnie Shelton, Vinnie Johnson, Willis Reed, Bob Lanier, Mahorn, Otis Thorpe"
"Unlike virtually anyone mentioned as a replacement for Dame on the list, Dame has played on a small-market team his entire career and without any fellow stars.  Dwight has played alongside Lebron, Kobe, James Harden, Vince Carter, etc.  Kyrie's teammates and teams have a similar profile.  Paul George has played with Kawhi, Westbrook, and Dame's career stats are simply better.  Dame's best teammates ever were Lamarcus Aldridge for 3 seasons and CJ.  To do what he's been able to do in Portland without other weapons to spread the defense is absolutely insane."
Paul George playing out of his mind bro
"Ultimately it came down to reputation. Lillard has built this aura of being a clutch killer in the playoffs while in reality he has accomplished much less than Dwight in the playoffs both as a first option and overall. However, Lillard has 2 buzzer beaters in the playoffs while all Dwight in his favour is a near decade of consistent defense and a trip to finals as a first option which should be a bigger deal but again as as I said, Dame has 2 shareable cold buzzer beaters. Same reason why people downplay Paul George. Paul George has been consistent for a decade but he also doesn't have these big moments. He has more of a right to be on the top 75 than Lillard. Perceived reputation is really important in the NBA"
"PPG Leaders:  Kevin Durant: 29.5 66% TS  Steph Curry: 27.6- 62% TS  Giannis: 27.3- 60% TS  Paul George: 27- 58% TS  DeMar DeRozan: 26.9- 60% TS  Zach Lavine: 26.2- 60% TS  Ja Morant: 26- 57% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25.8- 53% TS  Jaylen Brown: 25.6- 60% TS  Nikola Jokic: 25.6- 69% TS  &amp;#x200B;  He's the 3rd most efficient volume scorer by a good bit, and on the 2nd highest volume. What a gross misrepresentation. KD and Jokic on smth tho lmao."
you be alright ur facing some scrub with trae young  and paul george
Paul George approval
"As good as Paul George is, I always forget he exists"
"I don’t like watching Paul George play, I did in Indiana but now I feel like he’s too overhyped/always hurt that every time I see him play he’s ass but still a top 15 player.  Don’t really like watching Kyrie after ‘guarding’ Giannis in the playoffs, dude is so out of touch in so many ways it’s kind of cringe.  On the other hand tho I loved watching Harden in Houston because he was basically going to do the same thing every time and no matter what the defense was either giving up a bucket or fouling, unstoppable"
"Getting 50 points in 35 minutes on 28 shots?   Blows my mind.   This season, we are really seeing what separates great talent and basketball smarts from guys who just game the system.   I'm not a Trae hater. Love the guy actually. Hope he rebounds from his slow start and looks like his former self, but you see a guy like Curry who never cops out of an open shot by trying to draw a foul, and he just keeps on playing well, while the guys who relied on the rules to score are struggle. This game is a perfect contrast between the two.   Trae still had a great game. But you see how much better the guy who has always relied on talent and hard work is playing now that the rules have change. No difference whatever for Curry.   We see the same thing with Kevin Durant, though, in his case, the other end of the spectrum is his own teammate in Harden.   We see it with guys like Paul George, who is playing every bit as well as he ever has despite rule changes.   Love to see this. It's great for the game."
"Why does anyone have Lebron over Kobe? These same people had Lebron over Kobe since like 2013.  If it's because of MVP count, MVP's are a regular season team achievements. If your team isn't a top 4 seed, chances become increasingly lower to crack MVP even if you are putting up the best stats in the league. 2 of Lebrons MVPs didn't even turn up to be a championship nor did they even result in making it to the finals. The other 2 came from being on a super team. I guess Kobe deserves less credit because he stuck with his team during a rebuild during his prime and had to carry a bunch of people who didn't know what they were doing? Even today you always hear the phrase - ""Best player on the best team""- which is pretty accurate most of the time.  If it's about Lebrons gameplay;   Scoring wise Kobe was always more successful because he pulled multiple defenders out of the paint and out past the 3 point line, similar to Curry today, that pushed his teams into winning more in the post season. This allowed more fluid movement in the paint and much easier baskets for him, forwards and centers. Sure Lebron has a higher TS%, which is highly to do with his base FG%, but that is also highly based off of him scoring much more in the paint area, which clogs the paint causing conflict for bigs (K Love, Bosh). This has always allowed opposing teams to create more blocks and strips because of how the paint is always heavily congested. Teams with elite rim protection has always been the bane of Lebrons existence early in his career and this is why he left the East more so than anything imo with the rise of Giannis and Embiid but that's another topic.   Assists? Well, you have Lebron playing a PG type role most of his career and most of the minutes while he's on the floor. He's constantly chucking the ball out from a kick out or PnR. I'm surprised Lebron wasn't averaging PG amounts of assists (10+) for his career considering how good of a passer everyone makes him out to be tbh. You couldn't argue to me that Kobe couldn't play in a system like that, Kobe's passing was always on point. Some of his greatest assists of all time are the most skilled you could get while passing. Not to mention that the triangle offense that Kobe ran with most of his career spreads assists out and allows for bigs (forwards and centers) to become the center points of facilitating. Shaq and Pau's averages for assists during their time with Phil were at the highest of their careers meanwhile Kobe's assist average started sky rocketing with Phil out of the picture.  Rebounds? This is short and easy, Lebron is taller and is usually guarding forwards in the paint. He's going to grab more boards. Also, Phil Jackson's role for guards in his system was for them to be ready for outlet passes from bigs and stopping fast breaks from occurring which pushes them to have less rebounds by design.  Defense? I think Kobe's defense is crazily underrated for his championship runs and he's had more elite defensive runs that lead to championships than Lebron has. Lebron had probably 2 good defensive runs with Miami championships and thats it where as I feel Kobe played his best defense in all of his championship runs. Everyone said Kobe's defense went down during those runs but anyone who actually watched knows that's not true. Kobe guarding Melo and vice versa was intense af to watch in the playoffs. Kobe played mind games with players and dared them to shoot if they were average or below average shooters. If they missed it was demoralizing for them and they would shoot less often. Watching Kobe do this to Rondo in the finals was classic Kobe mind game defense where Rondo averaged less points and less assists than what he was regularly doing earlier in those playoffs.  All of this and Kobe was never on a super team (that won), meanwhile Lebron has still yet to do it without creating a super team. Miami? 100% super team and even more so when Ray Allen arrived. 2nd stint Cleveland? Got the best rising young PG and rising star from K Love who was putting up 26 and 12 for the wolves. Lakers? There were attempts to get Kawhi or Paul George with AD who was guaranteed to go, but then ended up with AD, Howard, Rondo and Danny Green who was considered one of the top 3 and D players in the league. In the end, Lakers were a balanced duo and Lebron never realistically carried the team like you want out of someone you are talking about being ""GOAT"". Kobe carried a non-superteam to 2 championships as the best player head and shoulders over the next best player on the team, which Lebron has never done a single time in his career ALL while doing it out in the grinder/gauntlet that is the west. Oh did I mention Kobe also beat the team that Lebron was so afraid of facing in the playoffs he had to create his first super team to beat? There's also that.  And obviously, 5 &gt; 4 in chips as it stands currently. I would put Lebrons 4 rings on the same level as Magics 5 rings, all done with stacked af teams compared to the competition outside of the finals.  My top 5 list goes: Wilt, MJ, KAJ, Kobe, Lebron in that order and it's pretty much solidified. KAJ never passed Wilt, but MJ definitely passed KAJ. I don't see Lebron carrying any team to a finals and winning again which he would need to do at least twice for him to be over Kobe in my eyes."
27 ppg on 43% shooting is insanely efficient?  Ja is averaging 26 on 48%.  Mitchell has been off this year and is averaging 26 on 41%. Jokic is averaging 25 on 60% Paul George is averaging 27 on 46%  Gianni's is averaging 27 on 51% Derozan is averaging 25 on 50%  Lavine is averaging 26 on 48%   From the looks of it Steph is pretty average for the top scorers.. KD on the other hand is averaging 29 on 56%
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
Paul George. Fite me.
Paul George.
"No.   Yes they are top two and they’re damn good, but I think you need a little more than that to be in your own tier. Giannis is 27.3 PPG with a higher shooting percentage than Curry. Paul George is at 27.0 and DeRozan is right behind him at 26.9.  Would you consider Durant, Curry, Giannis, George, and DeRozan in their own tier? Probably not."
"As many instances as there were in the past, they never occurred at the volume we’re seeing today.  All the instances you’ve mentioned may be true, but guarantee you the shot breakdown is catch and shoot. Orlando’s team is built on perimeter shots and Dwight. Ray Allen is Ray Allen; Gilbert is Gilbert, Reggie Miller is Reggie Miller, Steve Kerr is Steve Kerr.  Fact is the season Steph started taking 8 pull up / off the dribble 3s a game is the season that ushered in the modern era. James Harden, Dantoni / Morey Rockets, Damian Lillard, Paul George, and today’s Trae Young Buddy shield etc are all a product of Curry opening those gates.  It’s not just the volume, it’s also the type, the acceleration across seasons, etc. And with this came an entire shift in team defenses.  I’m no Curry Stan. I’m a Hakeem / Kobe / MJ / Bird are GOATs, and a Laker fan through and through. I just respect what he’s done."
"Westbrook, Pat Beverly, Devin Booker, Ben Simmons, Harden, Paul George.  That’s just off the top of my head."
"This,  before his title Giannis was getting a shit ton of criticism and he is probably the most drama free star , some people dislike Steph , I prefer to say nothing about Paul George. The moment you reach the top people will criticize you for anything"
"Yep, he would have Paul George do the same when they both were with the Pacers"
"130%. Add Kyrie, KD and Paul George and make it r/NBA’s sinister 6. I hate that Markieff instigated it, but Jokic is the MVP who should have been more sportsmanlike."
"No but they would leak ""the greedy Danny Ainge has refused the very reasonable and fair offer from Indiana's handsome and intelligent GM"". Your team has always used the media to try and leverage better returns.  Outside of our Indiana trade talks, our FO is dead silent on just about every trade we make. We had no heads up on:  * The Isaiah/Kyrie trade with Cleveland  * The Tatum/Fultz trade with Philadelphia  * The Bradley/Morris trade with Detroit  * The Walker/Horford trade with Oklahoma  * etc etc.  Our FO makes so many big trades that aren't reported on until they're already agreed to. The one exception being when we deal with Indiana.  &gt;**Report: Pacers offered Celtics Myles Turner and first-rounder in Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade**  &gt; Which was actually how those leaks generally read.  &gt;  &gt; Gordon Hayward reportedly wanted to join the Pacers. &gt;  &gt; Why isn’t he heading to Indiana? &gt;  &gt; Maybe because the Hornets offered a four-year, $120 million contract. &gt;  &gt; Or maybe because the Celtics didn’t agree to a sign-and-trade, which was necessary for the capped-out Pacers to add Hayward. &gt;  &gt; &gt;J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star: &gt;  &gt; &gt;The Indiana Pacers offered the Boston Celtics Myles Turner, a first-round pick and a rotation player for Gordon Hayward last week, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told IndyStar. &gt;  &gt; Rejecting this offer looks like a mistake by the Celtics. A center who defends well (especially in the paint) and shoots 3-pointers, Turner is good. The 24-year-old is under contract at a reasonable $18 million the next three years. A first-round pick hold obvious value.  &gt;https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/  Same as the Paul George trade fiasco.  J. Michael leaks the trade offer from Indiana, the national media says ""why won't Danny Ainge accept their fair offer"" and then Indiana fans say ""I can't believe Danny Aine would leak this to try and discredit us"".  Then after the fact Indiana's GM Kevin Pritchard, who never talks to the media btw,  does an interview with J.Michael and makes some snide remarks about Danny Ainge.   Pacer fans eat it up every time."
for paul george?  why the fuck would the clips do that when they are in win-now the next couple years?
"What's just kinda interesting is that everyone on the list has played with at least one other guy on the list.  LeBron - Melo - Westbrook  Westbrook - Paul George   Westbrook - Durant - Harden  Harden - CP3   It definitely happened back in the day (Garnett-Pierce-Allen, Shaq teams) but I also think it shows times have changed. Dirk, KG, Kobe, Duncan, AI, Wade, TMac have very little of the overlap we have now."
Saying Paul George is better because of the playoffs without comparing their teams and competition is just stupid.
"Kawhi and Paul George are usually doing heavily lifting on offense, it's usually hard to do both and they're still pretty good defensively. However their best days on that end (peak) defensively are behind them."
Paul Vuk George
I was about to say they reversed his name till I remembered his name wasn't George Paul. I've just been calling him that for so long that I genuinely forgot for a second 😩
"PG also shot 2/16 in a game 6 elimination against the Jazz with 5 points, in a game the Thunder lost by 5. Or 4/16 with 10 points in the game 7 loss against the Nuggets. His track record is a lot less stellar than Dame’s where consistency is concerned lol.  Also, if Dame was in the East for more than half his career he’d definitely have more playoff success so you can’t compare them 1 to 1. Paul George also switched teams twice, if Dame left the Blazers he’d also have more playoff success. Dame did wave PG off the court in their head to head matchup though."
"Hard to directly compare playoff success when Paul George was in the East the first half of his career and then changed teams multiple times.  Might not be fair but Dame waving PG off the court is gonna stick in people’s minds too. That and PG’s 5 point, 2/16 elimination game the year before. Or the 4/16 game 7 bubble meltdown against the Nuggets.   PG is a better defender, but Dame is indisputably a better scorer, shooter, passer, overall offensive player. The advanced stats also like Dame a lot more."
Lemme predict next week for the west  Paul George  Oh and the next week  Paul George
Paulette George and Paul George Sr.  This may be better than the 11 George Foremans.
"Yeah, I don't think so. Nobody around Jaylen's stature has ever commanded that much. Off the top of my head the guys who have commanded a haul bigger than that are:  AD (and by proxy LeBron)  Harden  Holiday (and by proxy Giannis)  PG (and by proxy Kawhi)  &amp;#x200B;  I think AD commanded as much as he did first because he's AD, but also because LeBron needed the help in LA. The Bucks were worried about losing Giannis and therefore overspent on Holiday to keep Giannis around. The Clippers overspent on Paul George to make sure Kawhi would sign with them. There aren't many guys who command picks like that on their own, I really think it's just Harden. He obviously helps the Nets, but they didn't need him in the same way as those other situations.  &amp;#x200B;  AD/LeBron, Harden, Holiday/Giannis, and PG/Kawhi are all way better than Jaylen Brown, good as he may be."
"&gt;Paul George is definitely driving his team right now and showing great leadership. Also on a similar note I would say they were the second best team the Warriors have faced so far.  The first few games were PG vs enemy team, and it was close. Well deserved!"
"Serious attempt an an answer - I don't know. You need a true stretch-5 (i.e. KAT) along with 3 other great 3&amp;D players. That's a hard sell, and I don't even know if that's enough given Westbrook's playstyle.  i.e. Westbrook, Mikal Bridges, Paul George, Robert Covington, KAT"
"What is your proposed trade that would be worthwhile for the Sixers? They have a very deep bench. They don’t see value in the Paul George return, which at the time was a player written off as a bust (Oladipo) and a lottery pick. If the Sixers got an underperforming young player and a lottery pick for Simmons, they would not be in a materially better position to compete for a championship this season."
"The idea that anything less than Lillard / beal is selling low Is the issue. It's ignoring all the issues that have put the guy on the trade block in the first place. Embiid is maybe the most skilled scorer in the league and the presence of simmons has prevented him from getting out the 2nd round. A player with the correct skill set, even if not currently a star could 100% make Philadelphia a contender. Oladipo + Sabonis were traded for Ibaka, when the pacers gave up Paul George for the same players everyone thought they were crazy but they became all stars. If Morey put in as much effort into scouting for a good package as he did exploring legal options to deny Simmons money, the sixers would be contenders right now."
"Both of them deserve it. Paul George is definitely driving his team right now and showing great leadership. Also on a similar note I would say they were the second best team the Warriors have faced so far.    As for Allen I really like him and what he’s done with the cav’s, it would have been easy to get down on yourself to get traded from a top team in the East to a rebuilding Cav’s team."
"It was some great coaching from the Clippers. They found a weakness and ran with it right on through to four wins. And as much as I hate to admit it, Paul George did show up for them big time with Kawhi out.  Gobert took a lot of flak for it, but it wasn't on him; we had an Achilles heel in our team composition and were slow &amp; stubborn to trying things that may have remedied that (although I don't know if there was much that could have been done).  I agree that they don't use Gobert enough on offense. He consistently has the highest FG% in the league; just get the man under the basket, throw him the ball, and not many players can stop him because of that wingspan."
He is gaslighting the reporter. Dunk? What dunk? Who is Paul George? Why are we even here?
"The Nets have guarded really well going back to the playoffs with Brown-Harden-Harris-KD-Griffin.  I think they shouldn't touch that starting lineup as long as those guys are healthy.  Insert Kyrie for Harris if he comes back.  I get the intrigue with Claxton, but when they had him as the 5, Griffin was forced to guard more on the perimeter and Claxton was often late getting back in transition (though not the only one).  Plus if Griffin is going to play on the perimeter on offense, his handle, passing, and shooting are much more of pluses at the 5.  The ball moves faster with this group.  Mann and Kennard continue to kill other teams' benches.  At some point I think the Clippers might have to be quicker to get to their best lineups, though I give Tyronn Lue credit for figuring out last year in the playoffs that their best lineups included Mann with Batum at the 5, and going back to that in games this year.  Paul George is not a great passer, the reads get tougher and he has been very turnover prone with Zubac at the 5 and Bledsoe basically being a non-shooter.  Bledsoe is also not really taking the playmaking burden off of George's shoulders right now.  Terance Mann might be their second best player.  Zubac individually is a solid player, but I think their defense is at its best when they have 5 quick players pressing and trapping and playing on a string"
"&gt;*If they somehow manage to lose their second generational talent in Zion Williamson, the league will seriously need to think long and hard about the franchise's future in the Big Easy.*  Alright, well Cleveland lost Lebron so get rid of Cavs.  Melo left Nuggets/Knicks so get rid of them.  Kawhi left San Antonio, Paul George left Indiana so get rid of them.  KD left OKC! Get rid of OKC!  It's not like star players leave their home draft teams ever anymore, right? /s  And all our young stars are going to stay exactly put, eh? None of them are going to Miami/NY/LA in the future. Just NOLA stars? The end of superteams as we know it?"

"This definitely is a myth cause dude does not look like he's  6'10  https://www.clipsnation.com/platform/amp/2020/7/5/21313957/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-los-angeles-clippers  In this article, you can see pg's height versus kawhis and they are not that different."
He was in the second quarter but I don't think he was really in danger of fouling out cause tht foul on paul george was overturned
Clippers are currently the 9th seed. I watched Paul for 7 years. It was David West who was our closer not Paul George.
TRIPLE DOUBLE WATCH: Paul George is currently 1 REB and 2 AST away from a Triple Double!
Is Paul George really that good defensively? I e heard it before but I didn't know he was in that conversation l
"Lamelo’s current stock could net a Paul George type player, even younger since SGA  was the centerpiece of the PG trade"
"Maybe it's because I just woke up, but am I nuts, or did Paul George send the Clips Mavs game to OT with a buzzer beater? Is that not on here?"
"Some of those Pacer teams were pretty legit, since they always had Paul George at the time"
"that because people like Giannis, not because they hate the Suns.  Some people dislike Chris Paul, but the rest of the team is fine.  The hatred for Paul isn't any more than the hatred for Westbrook, Harden, Draymond, Pat Beverly, Kelly Olynick, both of the Morris brothers, Jokic, Paul George, Grayson Allen, etc.  If you really think the Suns are hated like the Lebron/Westbrook/Dwight/Rondo Lakers or the Kyrie/Durant/Harden Nets or the Draymond/bandwagon fans Warriors , you are delusional"
Paul George would be stressed🤧
"But there's a fine line between fun shit talk and being an asshole. The former is fine, the latter is not and an ejection is warranted.   Went to a Raptors-Pacers and some drunk idiot just kept yelling out, ""PAUL GEORGE LIKES GAY SEX"" over and over again until he was finally escorted out. We were all glad to see him go."
"That may be the reason people don’t bring them up but what I mean is compared to the games I mentioned, people don’t bring up his 40pt game against Indiana in 2012 in a very crucial game, 30 pt game + game winner in a duel with Paul George in 2013, or basically his performances in the Cavs’ 4 wins against them in 2018.   He balled out against them plenty of times but those games don’t get as much attention as the ones I listed above. That’s why I said “lowkey”. Because  his monster games against Indiana don’t usually get as much attention."
"Chris ""Paul George"" Duarte."
"For me I value the playmaking. And solid defence. That way he's my backup 1 and 2. Perhaps taming a younger kobe might work. But I think he matured as he got older.  That way I can take curry, MJ, Kobe and then everyone else I take can be big wings or there exclusively for defence such as Gary payton.  Honestly though I think this exercise Paul George is the guy you take in the 12th slot I know it sounds crazy but a 6'9 guy who can defend 1-4 can 40% of his 3s in any situation and be lockdown is super valuable as well. He's the guy who I took as my 3rd sg for this. And my 4th ish SF. Seeing as LeBron and Kawhi will play time at the 1 and 4."
McGrady was a bonafide superstar and in discussion for best player in the NBA. Paul George isn't on that level and never really has been.
paul george is an elite defender
"Curry, KD and KG are musts. They are the only guys who fit with every player ever well. You got LeBron and Jordan put out 2 of those 3 and your lineup is fantastic. And you can put whoever else out.  Who is out for me: Magic is a defensive liability at guard and I'm not sure you want Jordan chasing around curry all day. If you take curry the opposing teams gets magic who won't be a bug threat with the walls you have in the paint. Pippen is redundant with prime LeBron. Duncan is a centre in the modern game and you can't risk going with Shaq, kareem and Duncan. Just not smart to load up with 3 non shooting bigs who can't switch when you have access to KG and Giannis to get 5 out lineups that have no defensive weaknesses.   I'd also take Giannis Small ball is the dominant defence of the era and with KG and Giannis you can go giant whilst still switching everything and battling on the boards and not sacrificing 5 out really. You also have to take Hakeem for defence and iso scoring. No centre ever is better at both. If you need a bucket late you put MJ, KD, Hakeem and 2 shooters on the court and they just can't stop you.   So  PG: Curry  SG: Jordan, Kobe  SF: KD, LeBron, Kawhi  PF: KG, Giannis  C: Hakeem, Shaq (unstoppable force he has to be on the team can't let the opponent get him - coincidentally I now have the 4 best rim finishers ever and the goat rim defender and 2 great help defenders at PF, and 2 solid ones at SF).  Right now I have 2 slots left over. Since I'm planning non curry PG minutes with Jordan or Kobe at the 1 and LeBron running actual Point I need more shooting and defensive depth. This means Paul George. 6'9 near Dpoy and MVP at his absolute peak and 40% 3pt shooter perfect fit to play as a 2 or 3. And I don't see any reason to not go Gary Payton or Kidd for the defence I think I go with Payton for shooting."
Kawhii would have went there if not for AD and Lebron already being there because he has some semblance of self respect. Paul George would have ultimately ended up there if Kawhii wasn’t a clipper. To say they only get talent because of Lebron and Kobe is just not true. Guys will still sign or force a trade there
Paul George has already done much more in the playoffs than T-Mac did over his whole career. He's a better player than McGrady was.
"god bless paul george?  dude, it's a basketball game"
"it was a lot of picks, but I think the Clippers saw it as a bunch of picks for Paul George and a bunch for Kawhi"
Paul George is a rich man Tracy McGrady
"Jesus the clippers trade for Paul George seems kinda brutal now, sure Paul George is a good player and they’ve made it the playoffs but damn ain’t no way he’s winning you a chip and they gave up everything"
He was the [anti-clutch](https://eu.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2017/04/17/how-clutch-paul-george/100570384/)
"That's fair, I do agree that traditionally 25 seems to be about the average to be starting your prime but lately it feels like there's more late bloomers that don't seem like they're fully finished products by 25.  For the more traditional superstars that were hyped in their early college days and given the keys to the franchise in their rookie season, it does seem like 25 is the sweet spot. Looking at players like AD, CP3, Wade, and DRose.  I don't have the stats to back this up but lately it feels like there is another class of player that bloom later and keep pushing their prime so they peak around 28-31. Players like Paul George, Kawhi, Jokic, Giannis, Embiid, Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry and Steph somehow manage to find new tricks and evolve their game. Paul George is playing the best basketball of his life right now at age 31, he is a much better shooter and defender at 31 than he was at 25. While Embiid is pushing further and further up the MVP ladder at 27 building on his defense, I suspect that we haven't seen the best version of Embiid yet.  Giannis has improved his FT and shooting over the past couple of years and I think he also has a little bit more to give. I can see Giannis at age 29 being a better player than he is today given his improvements year-over-year and the gut feeling that he fits into the more late-bloomer mold."
Tmac was also a pretty good passer. I think he’s a bit better than Paul George at his best.
Paul George was the only man to challenge LeBron in the east before his gruesome injury.
They’re both long athletic scoring wings but paul George is a much better two way player and tmac is a much better consistent bucket getter. They’re not really *that* similar
He did a great job on Paul George  and others. He plays bigger than he is. We have Nance and Little for when that just isn’t enough.
Paul George is a lock
Paul George is playing like the guy again. I said that because he’s leading the Clippers like he did the Pacers back before.
Should Paul George make it?
Paul George said “OT tonight” but didn’t say he was going to play in OT
I don’t know how people watched this game and aren’t more impressed by how good Paul George has been. You add Kawhi and that team will be on another level.
"""God bless Paul George""?  Love the excitement, but that's crap."
God Bless Paul George!
"Ya dude, veteran guard Paul George just decided fuck it, I'ma take 4 steps this possession...  The ball is clearly dislodged/bobbled mid play."
“GOD BLESS PAUL GEORGE”

Noted Laker Paul George
"To your edit - I'm still not sold an eastbay is all that difficult on an open lane.  Guys like Vince, Richardson, Lavine all used eastbay variations in their dunk contests, yet none ever did one in-game.  I think it's just taboo as its use started in the dunk contest rather than in live play.  It's incredibly unlikely anyone would ever need to eastbay in order to avoid a shotblock whereas a lot of the other maneuvers have some practical use so those have become fair game. ex. Bridges uses a windmill to avoid Thybulle from blocking a regular dunk from behind.  Ignoring tomahawks, you have other stuff like Blake Griffin's windmills, Derrick Rose reverse/reverse windmill, Gerald Green windmills, Paul George reverse 360 windmill, Jason Richardson 360s.  All very excellent dunks considering a number of attributes.  I think of ranking dunks like they do in diving/gymnastics/etc - you are awarded more points for choosing a higher degree of difficulty maneuver, but execution makes up a large portion of your score as well."
Probably because of Montrez racial slur or Morris intentionally trying to injure Luka. There does seem to be mutual respect between Paul George/Kawhi and Luka tho
God bless Paul George is a great call lol
"It comes a full circle, no? A year and a half ago, Luka did this against the Clippers in the playoffs. Watching it live, was exhilarating. But over time, I have become more of a Paul George fan and watching this as a PG13 fan has been great. Life indeed does come a full circle."
"Assuming the starters are: Jokic / Davis / LeBron / Luka / Steph, then you have back up guards (2) back up forwards (3) and 2 wildcards. So in theory KP has 5 spots to compete for.   Booker, Westbrook, Paul, Paul George, SGA, KAT, Gobert, Mitchell, Lillard, Green are all going to be competing for those 7 reserve spots. I feel Booker, Gobert, Mitchell, Paul George and Lillard are locks, which would be the 3 forward spots and 2 guard spots. KP would have to beat out 4 of Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, SGA, KAT and Draymond Green. Not impossible, but coaches always tend to vote longevity so I'd bet on CP3 and Draymond getting the coaches nods."
Lebron is the obvious one. He’s the one who started the whole trend. Harden doesn’t take heaves either. Can’t speak for these guys specifically but pretty sure guys like Paul George butler dame giannis don’t take them
"MAN IS ALL GAME, PAUL GEORGE"
Paul George played 48!!! Minutes lmao
Right before Paul George made that shot at the end of regulation the Clippers announcers said that they had already used 2 of their 3 wishes. Paul George hit that shot using up their 3rd wish and the Clippers scored 1 point in OT.
GOD BLESS PAUL GEORGE
Good bless Paul George!!
God bless Paul George
Paul George will never escape that commercial for the rest of his playing days
God bless Paul George
Paul George underrated as fuck man… he’s incredible   He got it off with 0.001 seconds on the clock. Wtf
GOD BLESS PAUL GEORGE!! WHAT A CALL!
Paul George goated.
Paul George got a 3 pointer to tie the game. We're in OT now.
Paul George with the luckiest shot I've ever seen
Paul George turned into to Jesus Christ himself and drilled a corner three at the buzzer to send it to OT
That Paul George for ya. Knew he would make it
PAUL GEORGE
To quote the Clippers announcer….  #”GOD BLESS PAUL GEORGE”
hahaha I wanted to go to bed hahaha thanks Paul George
"&gt;What was Miami's last big FA? What about the Knicks? What about the Nets before Kyrie?  Jimmy Butler? Lebron and Bosh?   The Nets didn't even move to NY until a few years ago. You think KD was signing with the Nets if they were still in New Jersey?   &gt;Harden didn't sign with Brooklyn in FA. Neither did KD. AD didn't sign with LA in FA. Neither did Paul George.  LOL you don't know how the NBA works, do you? If you think PG or KD or Davis ""trades"" were just honest to God pure trades then you don't deserve a reply anymore."
Paul George 360 windmill
The best PG would be Pau Gasol  So the 2nd is Paul George
Why is Paul George the graphic for this post.
Paul George
"I don’t know why AD insists on playing wing  Like why  He could dominate at least at 90% of what Giannis could do but no, he wants to be Paul George"
Paul George definitely deserved the thumbnail.  Played great this game!
"i hope harden, doncic, paul george, phoenix and brooklyn never win a ring, Curry never gets out of the West again, Nuggets realise they wasted all their money on Michael Porter Jr for nothing, Kyrie gets waived, Daryl Morey destroys the 6ers by not trading simmons, and finally Boston stay mediocre"
Paul George suffered a gruesome leg injury and came back months later to become an even better player and be named an all-star almost every year since the injury. Breaking his leg as bad as he did could’ve massively reduced or straight-up ended his career so that’s legit fantastic.  But he also nicknamed himself Playoff P. He has no memorable playoff moments. I hope he misses every late-game shot he takes and never gets to the Finals.
"So many good teams one zero titles also, there were so many good teams in the 90s that made the mistake of existing at the same time as Jordan, in the 2010s there was the Drose bulls, the paul George pacers, the KD Westbrook OKC team. All great teams that didn't get rings"
"I can't blame you. I don't think I've ever seen a star leave a fully-built contender that just won the title and had the capacity to bring everyone back.   Like sure he was traded their against his will but it still seems crazy to me to leave that just to team up with Paul George lol (no disrespect to Paul George, he's pretty fuckin good)."
Going from cucaracha Clippers to Paul George is probably how a valet feels parking a Ferrari
Paul George can't lead a team or be the number one option on a team. Dude is a cancer
I don't want Paul George to win anything for the remainder of his sorry career.    Pacers fan btw
"I kinda just want Kawhi Leonard to retire to allow the Clippers to actually get some high caliber &amp; healthy guys for Paul George. Playoff-P can be a frustrating guy to root for too, but at least he shows up every night."
I feel like Paul George looks more like squidwards house than Klay
"No, Paul George will have to play Dallas all by himself, but they'll allow him 30 personal fouls and a 25-point lead to make up for it."
"if you take out the spicy first sentence, i'm fully onboard with this take. shit, Paul George going to GSW in 2016 would have netted 2 rings just as easily as KD did."
Lol yeah. Or Paul and Paulette George naming thier kid Paul
"not really a ""let's all get together and make a superteam"" bcs the front office made the superteam, while now kawhi talked with Paul George to team up just like KD and Kyrie did.   Offcourse i believe KG and Pierce and Ray Allen might have talked with each other  but it was mostly the front office while now its the players talking first."
"no one feared lebron its dumb if you say so, look at those teams between 2010-2018 in the east not one really good contender except the older celtics in 2010.   The conference always had a superteam with Lebron on and no other superteam!  There was the Bulls led by a very young Drose (also very good but just to young).  The paul george led pacers, a good player to play against but the pacers' team wasn't on the same level as that of the Heat.  After that it was Hawks' average team, the raptors with lowry and derozan two really good players but neither were a real superstar able to put up crazy numbers or my boston celtics led by IT against Lebron, Kyrie, JR smith, K-Love and a mediocre/good bench???  The team differntial in the east was always to big a difference, so they honnestly didn't fear him they feared the whole team if there even was any fear."
Bro its like so unfair lol. Trae got to Julius Randle and Ben Simmons while Luka has to face Prime Kawhi and Paul George haha.
George Paul
"Imagine trying to defend kd with no help defense. In a 1 on 1 he doesn’t even have to worry about where the help could come from. Oof.   If you’re under 6’7, it’s an automatic L. He’ll just shoot or finish right over you. If you’re tall but not quick enough laterally, also not worth playing.   And you can’t just plan on finishing over a 7 footer at the basket 11 times. So also need to shoot it well. Generally probably need to be a decent scorer to keep up with the 2k created player that is KD.  Good candidates? Lol I dunno maybe Kawhi Leonard and Paul George? 2013 Lebron would be fun to see"
Cade becomes a Paul George type player in my eyes. Albeit these eyes are always off so.   I thought Suggs was gonna be better at his start honestly. But hey he’ll take time to get there 🔥
"Lowry, Siakam, &amp; Co won that ring for Kawhi. Paul George and the rest of the Clippers couldn't do that for him."
Tatum plays defense tho  Also he’s just an even better scorer than Danny tho injuries and Paul George breaking out hurt him
No he would not. He’s not even as good as Paul George. He was never an MVP candidate
"It’s not that. I’m looking at the talent in the league . I believe we’re heading into a Golden age talent wise , and a lot of seasons will look like the 94-96 years with several all time greats trying to grab titles, MVPs, whatever   …Right now , what puts Luka over Giannis? What puts Luka over Jokic? Over Paul George? Over Kawhi when he’s healthy (did you know he’s “only” 30 holy shit)  What will Luka’s unfair advantage be that puts him over everyone else in the league?"
You mean to tell me that I shouldn't put 2x NBA Champion Adam Morrison over Paul George in my all time ranking?  Nonsense LMAO
Paul George is a scrub. And I’ve said it to his face.
"Do you guys understand Luka is only 22 and on his 4th season?     Giannis didn't even make an all-star team let alone a 20+ppg season until his 4th season. Same thing w/ Jokic.     Luka has 2x all-nba 1st teams already while averaging 25.7/8.4/7.7 for his career. He led the Mavs to 7 games against the Clippers w/ Kawhi and Paul George while averaging 35.7/7.9/10.3. His supposed #2 Porzingis disappeared averaging 13ppg for the series and averaged less rebounds at 7'3"" than Dorian Finney-Smith.  He might not be the 'greatest player of all-time' but he certainly has the tools and drive to be talked about amongst the greats when all is said and done."
So he can guard Ja Morant 1 on 1? Or even old Lebron James? James Harden? KD? Chris Paul? Devin Booker? Jimmy Butler? Kyle Lowry? Paul George?
"if the playoffs started next month and you had to pick one player to lead your team through the playoffs, who would you pick?  Lebron or Paul george?"
Paul George a top 5 player??
"Paul George and Reggie are the only true superstars the Pacers have ever had. Oladipo almost was one, but injuries ruined him"
Free John wall. He wants to join his best friend Paul George
"Blake played almost the entire season before getting injured. He was All-NBA 3rd Team but that was the strongest year for Forwards in a while with MVP-vote getting Paul George, Giannis, KD, and Kawhi in front of him.   Blake was in the playoffs injured but outplayed Giannis during Blake's first game back in game 3 - definitely wasn't enough since the Bucks were just so much deeper."
When you guys started making 45 posts a day about Paul George and the Clippers and how much you didn't want them to win
Scoring 36 being guarded by Paul George and Kawhi wasn’t enough?
"Uh you should check the recent thread, people are still slandering Paul George in the mental health thread today."
"At this rate, Paul George is better than Kahwi."
"Because not one fucking person is talking shit about him because of his mental health, it’s because he talked shit and then couldn’t back it up. He clowned Lillard, he kept saying he was in the drivers seat against Denver, then he shit the bed. No one is saying “oh Paul George is such a pussy cuz he’s depressed”. This is such a cop out for him, this dude has a fucking house full of excuses for everything. If he seriously does have mental health issues, I hope he faces those with a professional and gets better. That said, I’m not gonna not talk shit about him from a basketball perspective because he continually says the exact wrong thing and doesn’t show up when it matters."
TIL Paul George is better than Kawhi.
Rumors? Those were statements by the girl in question. I am sympathetic to the girl and I am judging Paul George for running away from his responsibilities. And who the hell are you to judge ME for judging someone based on recorded facts?
"I've never interacted with Paul George so I've got nothing to say about him either way.  But from interacting with you just now I can tell that you're an angry and weird person.  I never said Paul George was an upstanding person.  Read through my comments, I just said people were weird about attacking him for personal reasons.  And I was right.  Look at you digging up a strangers court records to hate on him.  Believing rumors he offered $1 mil for an abortion.  Like, what is wrong with you."
"Do you know Paul George personally, or do you just white knight everyone?      It was the girl herself who talked about the $1M abortion offer to her. And yes, she had to file a paternity suit to get him to acknowledge the kid."
"No you're just revising history.  &gt;“The day of the trade at 12 noon the deal was off,” Rivers said. “I was at home in Malibu and Lawrence called me and told me, ‘It looks like he’s either going to Toronto or the Lakers.’ The Lakers part just threw me over. **I told him that can’t happen. … I remember I kept telling him, ‘We cannot allow that to happen!’**  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2019-09-18/doc-rivers-hero-clippers-signed-kawhi-leonard-paul-george"
It changes week to week and whoever is playing good or bad.   Paul George chokes in the playoffs? Bad guy and this sub will have dozens of posts about him.   Paul George speaks out about mental health struggles? Good guy and this sub will have dozens of posts supporting him and criticizing the media/this sub.   And then the week after we're all back to normal and the cycle repeats itself.
Dame got clowned for missing two free throws and lost his team a game the clippers literally tried to lose that only mattered to Portland. He then mentioned sending Paul George and pat bev home in the playoffs. Then it became a whole thing.   I think the main reason people think dame was wronged here is because they like dame. Which is a good enough reason I guess if you feel you have to take a side. The whole thing just seemed like something we wanted to matter more than it did.
It’s just the fact that he’s on the Clippers and nobody wants to be mean to Kawhi like they are the other superstars so Paul George gets slandered for a living.
No way KD’s a super bitch to this day for that. People will forget this Paul George thing in a year or 2.
"I know this sub likes to meme on Paul George, but come on. Tobias Harris has never been anywhere close to the caliber of player PG is. Harris has never been an All-Star or an All-NBA selection."
at the end of the day i just really need all of you toxic idiots to take a good look in the mirror and remind yourself you’re a loser on reddit and paul george is a superstar nba player with a hot wife that wouldn’t look at you twice 😘
Nah. He's just got an alter ego. PG and George Paul. One melts down under pressure.
That headline is bullshit. It makes it seem like players are now trash talking George because he revealed his mental health issues and not due to the fact he joined the clippers and then that team started acting like they had already won the championship while proceeding to choke in the playoffs. If Paul George would have stayed in Oklahoma like he said he would and put his head down and balled out nobody would have any ammo against him
"trash talk is a part of the game lol. and paul george got on social media and ""bullied"" Lillard himself"
"I have. I’m not the only one. The guys been a rebounding, playmaking bucket getting beast the whole fucking time.   Wasn’t hard to see.   Bare in mine. The numbers are slightly bloated. He won’t put up 7.5 assists for the whole year. But he’s been a ball handling triple double threat for a while but again. Was crucified and made the villain by an armchair analyst that somehow got their point across to people.   Guys long been a hooper. I’m no expert. JusT a fan that doesn’t make a player out to be complete shit because of one flaw in their game (see how people are with Westbrook over the fact that despite him being amazing at almost everything, he can’t shoot so hey. He’s a bad team mate. A shitty leader. A locker room cancer and culture wrecker. All cos he can’t shoot and we should hate him too)   It’s not about anyone being a big brain genius. To summarise, I guess it’s “stop comparing a player to another and just watch them”. Guys don’t need to be compared to others and cut down at the knees. Anyone averaging 20-10-3 in. Any stretch is fucking talented. Whether you wanna spin a shit narrative on them or not. On any given night. They would tear anyone’s favourite team up.   Look at how people look at Westbrook. Or Paul George even. There’s meme city about George. George had a great year last year. Has a couple bad games in the bubble and he’s all of a sudden got no respect.   This year he’s giving 26-5-5 at 50-50-90 and people still clown him any time he misses a shot. What’s the narrative gonna be when at seasons end he’s an All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense??   There won’t be one. People will jump back on and act like they loved him the whole time."
"God damn, any time Bagley, Paul George, Siakam have a good game it gets downvoted a lot! Never understood why so much hate for these guys to succeed!"
"Personally, since the bubble, I make a personal choice not to make fun of Paul George. I wish him well. I'm not telling everyone else what to do. But, I don't have respect for anyone that would belittle somebody for experiencing depression or anxiety."
"1-[The notion that I’m putting the blame on Doc is not the case... I’m the one who blew the 3-1 lead](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/1334958680731602944?s=20)   2-[""I take full responsibility,"" Paul George said after the game.](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-takes-responsibility-on-51-point-loss-against-mavs)  3-[Paul George takes blame for loss on Friday: 'I put this one on me'](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/12/15/oklahoma-city-thunder-paul-george-responsibility-loss-denver-nuggets/)"
he jumped after a foul had already been called and landed on a leg which Paul George had a bad break on a few years ago
Paul George is back on top because he is actually good at basketball
"First 8 comments and not a single one in support of Paul George and his struggles with mental health. In fact, they're all taunting him. But if something were to happen to him because of it you all would be the first ones offering ""thoughts and prayers."""
"He was never ""on top"", and he never had a downfall, he's just Paul George lol"
1 thread before this: Paul George facing more trash talk because he shared his mental health struggles  This thread: Paul George is on top now because he shared his mental health struggles
Paul George sucks
"yeah you’re right, paul george isn’t as good of a center"
"I’m sorry but Jimmy Butler is not the 4th best SF. He’s getting really overrated because of some of his playoff games. He’s a inconsistent offensive player who isn’t as good as he once was defensively.   I’d put him in that 6-8 range. Tatum, and Paul George are better and I could make a case for Ingram."
I can’t imagine getting triggered by a player doing good like r/nba does everything good about Paul George
He already admitted during the bubble he was a bit depressed cause he would go on social media and just seeing everyone hate him. No one cares about his mental health it seems..lets just shit on paul george cause he wanted to do whats best for him and play for a team he wants to play for! Oh he had a bad game? ahahaha Playoff p fucking kill urself ur so bad
"Next Paul George interview: “Ya know, people can say what they wanna say, I’m just gonna keep playin and doing what I do best, and I’ve gotta job to prove the critics wrong and do great things with the Clippers organization.”  ESPN Article: “PG to Sharpe: ‘I... [Will] Prove [You] Wrong’ “  r/nba top comment on the article: “Prove-it P coming!!!”"
"Noted. Also, I'm not OP. And I like Paul George as a player."
Paul George
The Wall/Westbrook trade of PFs. I’m calling it in a couple years Tobias Harris for Paul George is gonna be a thing too
"Did you forget that fast?a combination of Marcus Morris doing dirty shit,Harrell saying he's Dennis Rodman,Pat Bev being arrogant even though he tricked y'all,bad chemistry in the team,Paul George talking all that shit,and doing some bullshit off the court and also Lemon Pepper Lou.I honestly don't care at this point,but that game 7 was the funniest game I ever watched."
"Paul George talks too much, Pat Beverley is unlikable, and Harrell showed his true colors in the playoffs"
Doc always does well in the regular season. He becomes questionable come playoff time. He’ll try to do the same thing over and over even if it already failed multiple times like putting Paul George or Trez on Jokic and giving his son playing time on the Clippers during Lob City. This is the reason why he shaved his head. Not much adjustments necessary.
Like actually. But anything to slander Paul George I guess
"Technically, Paul George has had plenty of attempts to address this narrative. I think, in part, George has done a decent job at addressing this narrative, just not any time in the past 5ish years."
I've heard those comments too but he was talking about how he was coming back from two shoulder surgeries last year.  He wasn't saying he's back to being 2019 OKC 28/8/4 Paul George.  More like he's just back to being healthy again.  I think I've heard him say that once and it was after the opener.
"&gt;Clips aren’t the too seed though  But that’s not really the point, this post is about Paul George. Who is playing at an MVP level right now. Just like the Raps used to be a top seed year in year out, no one will think it’s real until you shut everyone up in the playoffs."
"Exactly. If Paul George was an nba team, he would have 3 consecutive 60 wins seasons where he got bounced in the second round."
"You can look at like [RAPTOR from 538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/) for an advanced metric on their 'impact' or the adjusted plus minus based on when they are playing and who they are playing with for a 1 number summary but that's not an end all be all since that start seems to overvalue or undervalue players based on the team. It's a good place to start looking at before you dig in and compare players though.  [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) definitely has player tracking data on for example the 10 minutes where [Paul George](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/202331/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) covered danny green during 2019-2020, that site has some pretty interesting numbers if you can figure out how to navigate it well enough.  It definitely is necessary to actually watch the games to understand why a team and or player is having positive or negative impact on defense though."
"Yeah I scrolled past an older article first with the 15 number, I edited my comment.  Point still stands that in Saint Paul alone during the George Floyd protests over 500 were arrested, only 2 died, and that didn't involve storming the United States Capitol building while they are in session."
Welcome to how we felt Sunday vs Paul George.
"Doc, Draymond, George Hill, Paul George have spoken about the Capitol and they were all on point. Yesterday, AD and LeBron mentioned Jacob Black as well. The NBA as an organization and the press around it have been very open about getting players' voices heard. It's a great tool that's been used effectively, I think."
Rivers &gt; Paul George and Kawhi Leonard.  Doc shoulda had his son clutch the Nuggets for him.
"Not a great comparison, he was a more athletic but less efficient Paul George imo."
"I feel like his link proves himself wrong. Beverley ranks above Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Damian Lilliard in career 3 point shooting."
You got downvoted bc Paul George sucks it up at the end of the season and in the playoffs?   Are Clippers fanbois moderating this sub now?
"Obviously there were some possessions where they didn't manage to get 2 or 3 on him because the warriors will also try to stop the trap, but it was clear the game plan was to deny curry the ball before he even gets the ball and to deny him the ball the moment he gets the ball.  Once you're double teamed the only real way is to either get help or pass out of tthe double/triple and hope your teammate makes the shot because once the ball leaves your hand the defenders will key in on them too and the clippers have fast defenders.  There are literally clippers fans in the post game thread saying the exact same thing, and ty lue said at half time that was their strategy as well (bltz steph) so I don't see how this can even be debated.  The strategy would be less useful if Oubre could shoot more than 10% from 3 and GS's next best player was Paul George instead of Andrew Wiggins. But the Clippers know this and more power to them for capitalising."
"Where was this energy for Paul George, Kawhi, Lebron, and AD when they have bad games?  Most coddled superstar in the league"
"You know what I meant. It wasn’t Pat Beverly shutting him down, it was the whole team. They have Kawhi and Paul George out there so he had an off night. It happens"
"I’m not gonna lie, I expected Oubre to drop like 30 tonight and have his best game of the season since he and Paul George seem to hate eachother. He... did not do that."
what a flop by Paul George
Paul george can be so frustrating. But he absolutely has one of the nicest looking jumpers in the game.
Well he's already a better Paul George
Paul George back already?
Paul George got swatted into the shadow realm.
Paul George AAAALWAYS catching strays lmao this man can't get a break
Causes no problems? He caused all kinds of problems in San Antonio and forced his way out. Had a great year in Toronto then apparently caused some locker room issues with his being treated like royalty along with Paul George. That’s far from causing no problems.
Tatum and Brown are like a young Paul George and Kawhi.
Pulled a Paul George
I remember wishing that the Sixers would trade down from 3 to 5 and draft Monk. I thought this kid was a smaller Paul George on offense.
"I’ve noticed a pattern with NBA players and shoulder injuries. Unless you are a Paul George who has been shooting one way on an elite level his whole life, it’s really hard for people with inconsistencies in their mechanics to recover"
There’s a difference between sharing valid criticism of a player and some of the personal attacks we see here. I have seen more “Paul George has a stripper wife 🤣” comments here than I have actual analysis of why he underperformed in the bubble.
"I'm sorry my joke offended you, should I go back to the same 4 Paul George jokes to protect your safe space? Seriously I'm making a joke on the internet not writing a dissertation on the profitability of women's sports no need to get so salty"
"He’s a commentator. His literal job is to give takes. It’s not a bad take that gobert is slightly over paid. He’s a defender with minimal offensive skill, his post foot work is  a joke, it honestly makes a lot of sense why an extremely skilled center would not approve of a guy like gobert getting the bag he got.   I just don’t understand the rush to protect gobert when Paul George gets 10 times more shit.  Give it one playoffs and the entirety of r/nba is gonna say meaner shit than shaq about gobert."
the likelihood of the pick conveying wasn't bad at the time of the trade - OKC still had Westbrook and Paul George and it didn't look like they were going anywhere.
How is Paul George going to win it when he's not even the best player on his team?
Because Devin Booker was 10 and 0 in the bubble. Paul George was pathetic p in the bubble.
"Yeah, how dare he block Paul George..."
"That was a bad shooting night regardless of TS%. But I do agree with you 24pts,0 TOs, 9 AST, and 5 REB. Along with being +5 is not the same as Paul George. Be worried about the bench."
"If they have the best record in the league and he puts up 25/8/8 I think he wins it. Curry, Luka and Harden's teams won't have good enough records. I don't think Giannis will win another MVP until he shows post season success. I imagine his main competition would be Durant, Paul George, Jokic and Embiid if the 76ers top the East. I don't think Kawhi will play enough games to be a real contender for the award."
"Great response, genuinely.   If you want to compare superlatives used about the two you should listen to Taylor’s semi recent podcasts about the playoffs/finals. He seems genuinely shocked at AD’s awareness and mobility and really goes heavy on the modern Bill Russell comparisons, which is basically the most superlative defensive compliment in Ben Taylor’s book:   I do agree that KG was the best perimeter defender of his era amongst bigs but AD is also arguably the best at that among bigs currently. The problem is you’re seeing more and more bigs with KG type mobility so it’s becoming less standout ish in a way. You have guys like Ben Simmons, Giannis, Bam, Jonathan Isaac as well, a collection of 6’11 hyper mobile defensive minded guys the likes we’ve never seen at one time.   Also for DRAPM, it is ultimately an all in one statistic. And clearly has its flaws. On that same list you linked, Jokic is top 20 in DRAPM, Eric Bledsoe has a higher DRAPM than Paul George or Kawhi, and Ricky Rubio is higher than Lebron. None of that makes sense, which puts into question how good of a metric it is at assessing overall defensive impact."
I read somewhere that the average expectation for a player picked with the first pick is Paul George
*Paul George has entered the chat*
So I came in and saw Paul George and Roy Hibert working on their Ju Jitsu with Roy's girl as the ref.
If you average out all the #1 picks stats you get Paul George
Paul george
Paul George per some post way back when (average of all #1 picks)
No Paul George
"Good thing Paul George and Morris are out against these bum Spurs, wouldve been a boring blowout against a trash ass lottery team."
Do you think Kawhi and Lebron would not win a title? Do you think that AD and Paul George do?
Who should be the MVP right now according to you? Embiid? Sabonis? Paul George?
Neither was Paul George.
paul george has been our best player so him being out makes this much harder for us. hopefully kawhi has a good game despite the mask
Great Value Paul George
Should’ve seen last year. Doc would do that in the 4th while Paul George is just standing in the corner. Was so frustrating to watch sometimes
Paul George had the best season of his career on OKC
Yes because they know paul george helps them right now and gets better quickly. Pacers knew kawho had all star potential but wanted hill right now. They didnt kno he would be a superstar
Paul George
&gt;Sabonis now is better than Paul George has ever been in his career  How so?
Paul George is literally better right now lol
"Nope, Sabonis now is better than Paul George has ever been in his career, and Oladipo is just icing on the cake"
"*Paul George has left the chat, muttering something about “chirping.”*"
Oh yeah Paul George is one of the ones that stands out in a bad way on that.   Booker's a good passer he's just volatile. This graph is also better [high value assists so assists on 3 point shots and shots at the rim](https://twitter.com/knarsu3/status/1216786685016625158?s=20) actually shows the same thing Booker is in that same upper quadrant.
Kobe Bryant 0 games played. Eli Manning 0 games played.  Other successful trade demands: Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Kyrie Irving  You can go to whichever team you want after your rookie deal. Play two years for Charlotte and go to the team of your choice you whiny bitch.
Paul George. Look how big of a disaster Kyrie is in the playoffs (or lack of playoffs) without LeBron.  LeBron was the man on the Cavs team. Only LeBron could pull off winning with Kyrie lol
"Makes sense for the Nets imo, just make Harden the primary ball handler with KD/PG13 - PG13 can help improve their perimeter defense too.   Makes sense for the Clippers (ignoring Kyrie's eccentric personality) because they have a guy who can takeover in games in Kyrie and get pressure off of Kawhi.   I don't think Durant would be happy with Kyrie being traded though, and maybe the same for Kawhi with Paul George being traded as well."
"Kawhi:   2016, 2020  Paul George:  Well-documented   Steph Curry:   2016 finals, 2018 (when CP3 was healthy), 2020 Raptors   Lebron:   2008, 2011  KD:   Memphis, and OKC 3-1  I can keep going.  All times when they played below standards."
"I've watched a lot of clipper games because of my location and you can tell they have been working on strictly offense, the wide open shots all the players have is insane, PG is wide open every other shot, watching kawhi facilitate is cool, he's very patient in the post and just waits and lure you in, his pass or the hockey pass because of the double or triple team on him is dead on.    Paul george with the second unit then takes on that roll when kawhi sits and the bench is getting wide open shots.   Lou unfortunately does not fit this system well for some reason, he's been off and can't get into his butter pick and rolls as easily as before."
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
Paul George is a sniper and it kinda gets underrated in convos about great shooters in the league. Only kinda because a lot of people acknowledge he is a good shooter but I really do think he’s an even better shooter than just a “good” shooter.
"Sure ownership matters too, players didn't want to play for Sterling or Dolan, but location certainly matters. LeBron, AD, Kawhi, George, Durant, Harden, and Kyrie all pushed their way to NY and LA in the past 2-3 years. The proof is in the pudding there. Had any of those guys wanted to go to Denver or Indiana those teams would have made the requisite moves to make it happen.    The point is if in 2025 the Nets want to offload these guys similarly to how the Clippers pulled the plug on Paul and Blake, they can turn this thing around a lot faster than people think. They're not destined to be down for more than a year or 2. They just have to be smart and decisive."
You could also have a front court of like Paul George - AD (or some other SF converted to PF) if you want improved spacing and want to match the small ball the Warriors would probably run a lot  But with AD-Embiid the Warriors would have a lot of trouble defending that size and strength.
"""Thats a bad shot""     - Paul ""Damian Lillard"" George"
"There are plenty of people shutting down as well. between Paul George, Harden, and Kyrie (players I dislike btw), the amount of spite and judgment being passed around freely is extraordinary. Especially considering the story of the NBA player who just killed himself."
I've always appreciated the simplicity of George Paul
Paul George has gotta be up there
Paul George???
George Paul was pretty funny too
Paul George and Kawhi are both posting the worst defensive rating of their careers this season.
"This reminds me; if James Harden teamed up with Paul George on a team that had Mook, who would wear 31 and what would the third player wear?"
corny paul george jokes incoming corny paul george jokes incoming 😫😩
"&gt; I understand that. But you never seen any of them signing for less now do you? It’s also a status thing. I’m #1 and I should be paid as such.   Yes, all the time. Anthony davis turned down a supermax contract to go play in LA just last year.  In fact the supermax is a great example of how it doesn't work. It was specifically designed to make it more lucrative for players to stay in the market that drafted him, which would by extension help small market teams keep the stars that they drafted.   It hasn't worked that well.  * Kawhi forced his way out of San Antonio even though he was eligible for the supermax * Paul george forced his way out of indiana even though he was eligible  for it"
No Fans.  Every site is neutral.  Paul George is shooting 52% from 3 on 8 attempts a game.  Better than prime Curry numbers.    Not really surprising all shooting #s are going up.
but... Paul George is an elite defender
Paul George really like using the backboard
Paul George has now mastered the art of the backboard... IMPRESSIVE
Man Paul George has been amazing this year
Paul George
Probably threw in a lightly-burned Paul George jersey as well
Paul George charging at the rim to fix a shot when up by so many pts.... respect it.
So that Paul George is left in a sticky situation
"Lebron is an upgraded Magic Johnson Steph is an offensive minded Steve Nash with the shooting touch of Reggie Miller. Kyrie is a poor-man's Allen Iverson (with the personality too) Chris Paul is a tough Stackton. Drummond is a poor-man's Shaq Derozan is a poor-man's Jordan McGee is a poor-man's Ben Wallace Combine Kawhi and George and you have a 3/4's Larry Bird Davis is Shaq with a shooting touch, or maybe Karl Malone"
"Hate the Clips, but lowkey like seeing Paul George doin good and havin fun."
Paul George is a man on a mission this season.
Paul george is crazy from three this season
"I am curious as to why you blame tilman? Like they tried to get harden everyone he wanted.   At the end of the day, I guess the only blame i can think of was trying to make harden a 1 cause he clearly disappears in playoffs when it counts and cant win like that.   Like to me, harden is part of the reason they have the less than stellar crew. It's kinda like Kawhi with paul George and the clippers."
they are for paul george
how many upvotes do you think this post would have if it was paul george
"LeBron ""Paul George"" James"
Paul George signed an extension and I don’t think kawhi is leaving. Clippers will be fine.
Playoff p Paul George. There I said it. Fuckin scuz
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2723814-paul-george-trade-for-kyrie-irving-reportedly-repeatedly-rejected-by-cavaliers
nah this is wrong too.  [The Pacers backed out](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-cavs-had-tentative-trade-agreement-for-paul-george-before-pacers-backed-out/)
"You mean like having Harden and Dwight Howard, or Harden and Chris Paul, or Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Westbrook, or Westbrook and Paul George, or Kawhi and Paul George, or I think you get the point."
"Yeah stars don't just switch teams after only a few years.  Well, except for LeBron, Durant, Kawhi, George, Butler, Kyrie, Paul, Westbrook...  Harden and Oladipo were literally traded *today* and you really just said nothing crazy ever happens."
"At least Paul George committed to you guys long term. Despite all the shit he gets, unless he gets injured, he'll keep you guys in the playoff race for a while"
Paul George was 100% considered a superstar going into the 2019-20 season. He was fresh off a career season and finished 3rd in MVP voting. Him choking on the Clippers doesn’t change that
"Kawhi was considered by many to be the best player in the NBA at the start of last season and Paul George was fresh off a career season where he was firmly in the top 10 discussion. Add in the sporting cast, including Montrezl and Lou, and the teams are very similar.   Also worth noting that AD was NOT considered top 5 going into the 2019-20 season."
*Paul George has entered the chat*
Paul George is one of the best defenders in the league and is versatile in all aspects of the game.
Its not about that. Both Paul George and Oladipo asked to be traded. The difference is that George torpedoed his trade value before he left. Most pacer fans didn't even know that Vic still wanted to be traded.
You missed the Paul George and Westbrook trades?
"You're starting to see it, but there are still issues.  1.  He did glamorize tanking.  ""Trust the Process' is literally a masterclass in rebranding basically austerity as something positive.  There was no cutesy marketing phrase for Donald Sterling's cheapest possible teams he'd regularly throw out just to take advantage of locked in rookie contracts and revenue sharing.  Trust the Process is the basketball equivalent of The Patriot Act as far as PR spin.      2.  There is no inequity in the league.  There are well run organizations (Miami), lucky organizations (Cleveland), and poorly run organizations (philly, ny, chicago, sacramento, minnesota, cleveland).  ""Big market"" NY, Chicago, Philly, Brooklyn, LAC, Houston, Phoenix, and Atlanta, combined have fewer finals appearances (0) in the last 20 years than miniscule market Oklahoma City (1) or Orlando (1) and have way fewer finals appearances than either medium-market-at-best Miami (6) or San Antonio (5).  You can make an argument the CA teams, especially the Lakers, are in a different tier, but even there, the Lakers are coming off a 6 year playoff drought and until recently, GSW were a perennial afterthought, and the Clips were arguably the worst organization in north american sports.      3.  Teams that can't get good players to sign are almost always complete garbage organizations in how they run things.  Either the owners are cheap as hell or the front office is incompetent, so naturally they blame the ""Big Market"" draw.  Teams that do wind up signing big free agents almost invariably have a winning culture and solid management.   4.  Drafting a star outside the top 5 is damn near the norm:  giannis, steph, kawhi, harden, jokic, butler, murray, bam, klay, draymond, Lillard, donovan mitchell, siakam, paul george, and even rising stars like booker or lavine and I'm probably missing a couple.  The best teams are always a combination of good drafting, good development, and good front office management, not blind lottery luck, like say minnesota.    5.  Exploiting a loophole when it's that harmful to the overall product is a problem.  Moneyball worked because they figured out a way to WIN without stars.  Not only did they raise the value of the team, but they raised the level of interest in the league.  Trust the Process straight up cost everybody in the NBA money, from the owners to the players, because nobody wanted to watch the Hinkie sixers except like 50 diehard sixers fans that drank the koolaid.   I watched parts of a few games against good teams and invariably when they lost, but kept it close, you'd see those diehard sixers fans super excited about their g-league squad.  Only it was in the same way as someone watching their 8 year old barely losing to their disinterested teenager - fascinating for them, boring as fuck for everybody else.    6.  I would 1 billion percent not accept 5 years of tanking for a championship anymore than I would willingly watch 5 years of bad movies for a possible chance of 1 good year of movies.  Basketball is entertainment, there's no tangible value to a championship, five years of deliberate boredom do not justify one year of possible excitement because that's 5 goddamn years of boredom.  Imagine purposely boring yourself for five years like you have an infinite number of years to live.      7.  Yeah, you're starting to see.  Walmart is predatory and awful.  It shuts down small businesses because it's big enough to sell at minimal margins or losses that competitors simply can't survive.  The end result is the only store left is Walmart.  It's great for walmart because now they can charge whatever for anything and it's awful for literally everybody else including the customers who now have no options and no buyer power and competitors who have to shutter their businesses and hope for the best in a saturated employment market.  It's an awful and flawed model, but perfectly legal.  If only there was an Adam Silver to say, no, Walmart, you can't exploit that loophole, even though it is legal, precisely because it is obviously to everybody else's detriment.  Hinkie was Walmart."
Am i missing something here? I feel like this is a bad trade for houston. Four picks and four swaps for three years(?) of harden feels worse compared to five picks and two swaps for two years of paul george at the time. Also add on that okc got a rising young star in shai compared to one year an injury prone oladipo. I just don’t get it. Getting lavert wouldve made more sense.
Pat bev isn't passive aggressive lol.  It would definitely be LeBron and the last 1 maybe Paul George.
It literally doesn't matter how you do it. People will hate anyone who asks for a trade that didn't come from a bottom feeder team.  Paul George played on two fucked up shoulders in the playoffs and requested a trade quietly during the off-season and still got a ton of shit.
Unless we get a Paul George/Giannis situation and someone resigns immediately.
"As long as you got pat ""next 5 years is ours"" bev and paul ""still in the driver's seat"" george you won't be out the spotlight lol"
"Ben Simmons with less picks would have been a great package, he’s a proven star and #1 pick  A trade for CJ, who Imo is better than oladipo to pair James Harden with Lillard  A trade for Anthony Edwards, to team James Harden with KAT and DLO. Minnesota is desperate to win something, and there’s no guarantee any of those draft picks are a #1 pick and Anthony Edwards has looked good  James Wiseman maybe, with Wiggins or Oubre or Draymond. Gives Curry help and Harden might fit well in the Warriors offense  Clippers for Paul George  Nuggets maybe for Harris, Michael Porter JR, some other players  Bucks for Middleton and some picks  They’re other trades they could have pursued Celtics Jaylen Brown, Raptors Siakam,   It’s not 2K and I’m not a GM and I don’t know of any of these salaries match but they’re ideas. Oladipo is a great player but I think the players I listed above are better and Oladipo has been dealing with a lot of injury issues the past few seasons"
Or because he didn’t want Paul George.
"Yeah, he really helped bring us hope after Paul George left that first year, I was extremely happy for what he did for us.  I know he wanted out, but I can't really blame him for wanting a change of scenery -- his career with us basically got derailed for a large part of TWO seasons after that injury -- only played 36 games in 2018-19, and 19 games in 2019-20. And during this period Brogdon was really starting to blossom with us.  Still, I can't forget that Dipo brought us that initial hope in the period where we thought we were hopeless after that Paul George trade. I got nothing but love for him, and I wish him the best."
"Lol, that’s like when Paul George references his “MVP season”"
"They absolutely got fleeced, look what okc got for Paul George and the pelicans for AD."
LeBron refused that Paul George trade and was the only reason it didn’t happen.
"i think there were reports of kyrie doing something similar when he heard the cavs trying to trade him for paul george, so this certainly seems plausible."
"By my count, it’s:  Pacific - Curry, George, James, Leonard, Davis with Paul, Fox, Booker, Lou Will, Schroeder, Montrez off the bench  Atlantic - Irving, Harden, Durant, Tatum, Embiid with Lowry, Siakam, Brown, Walker, Simmons, Dinwiddie, Smart(?) off the bench  I’d take Pacific but Atlantic is probably deeper"
OKC got a more valuable hall for Paul George.  I don’t think you guys got “fleeced” though. I’d give this trade a C+ or B- at best.
Thunder got more for Paul George.
Am I saying it's not? I'm just surprised about the actual haul. On par with the Paul George trade return (but that ensured Kawhi signed with the Clips so you have to view it as a 2 player trade).
"I think Durant on GSW is really the only team that felt unfair. And maybe the LeBron/Wade/Bosh Heat.       The current Lakers are great and LeBron and AD are top 10 players but is that that different from any other competitive duo with solid teams around them? Shaq/Kobe, Kobe/Pau, Garnett/Pierce, Duncan/Parker, Bird/Mchale, Jordan/Pippen.  Just looking around the league there are plenty of established duos that are very talented Booker/Paul, Kawhii/George, Kyrie/Durant, and even younger talent like Ingram/Zion, Tatum/Brown, etc. At a certain point when so many teams are loaded with talent, none of them are a head above the rest"
"* I didn't make this situation what it is; where do I criticize Harden's playoff record? When did I criticize his playoff record? Barring that one series against the Spurs, Harden's pretty consistently played well in the playoffs. The past few years, he's been more or less unimpeachable.  * Nique is an odd comp. Ever heard of Karl Malone? Charles Barkley? John Stockton? Chris Paul? Plenty of legends retire ringless. Malone and Chuck are pretty universally regarded as top 20 players of all time, and CP3 and Stockton are considered some of the best to ever play PG. Harden is an MVP who has averaged over 30ppg for multiple seasons. I don't think he'll suddenly be forgotten.  * Let's talk ""actions have consequences."" Forcing the Westbrook trade pretty clearly had negative consequences. Does Harden get a pass for that too? Part of the reason his team's contending window seems to be closing is because he forced an ill-conceived trade for a limited player on a bad contract, costing picks in the process. I know CP3 was more or less universally regarded as a negative asset in the summer of 2019, but his contract was shorter than Westbrook's and it didn't cost picks to keep him. And, even going into that trade, the fit with Russ and Harden was questionable.  * If Harden wants out because of the shitty ownership or because he can't win a ring there, fine. But you don't have to publicly shit on your teammates in the process. Even Kawhi, who sat out for a year and garnered a ton of hate for it, was able to get traded without actively shitting on his teammates (besides Tony Parker, and that was more about Tony being a prick than any limits in his game.) Paul George gets tons of hate for quitting on multiple teams, he didn't shit on his teammates like this. When Lebron got flamed for the decision, did he kick the Cavs on the way out? If Harden sat out citing cheap owners who he felt weren't invested in a title, I think most of this sub would support him. But the way he's handled this in regards to his teammates is embarrassing."
“That’s a bad shot.” -Paul George
"Yeah less is more with AG offensively Zach Lowe has said it for years needs to be more like Draymond but he keeps wanting to play like Paul George.   I brought up Gordon because it's really hard to find good defensive wings who can play 30 min a night after the first round of the playoffs. The teams who have them arent looking to deal them.   Garrett Temple is another option but this team really needs a big wing, Durant types are the real issue. Maybe ""small forward"" Larry Nance is available. I havent kept up with Miles Bridges but that might be another one also"
"If Durant wants to go, his return would be close to Paul George, Anthony Davis or any Harden trade."
"Sure, but why is what okc fans think more important than what Paul George does to the rest of us?"
"Yeah, but if the issue is what trade demands do to a team, didn’t Paul George do basically everything right to be worth that value to okc? I mean, even here to stay ups his value when his trade demand isn’t public"
"Honestly, this sub goes way too hard on the ""must win a championship or everything was a bust"" train. Especially here where the Clippers are in the middle of finding out whether that trade ultimately results in a championship. It's not like Leonard and Paul George died or something."
"How the hell do the 76ers not just give up Simmons. You could literally pair Harden with Embiid. That duo rivals Lebron and AD, and is easily better than Paul George and Kawhi."
Paul George staying in OKC for life
Chesapeake Arena was built on a Paul George burial ground
Loyalty. Dirk stayed with the mavs even after his failures. Paul George ran once problems started appearing.
It’s not. How they handle it could lead to problems. Or if they are going back on their word like Paul George.
"Adam Silver says no.   Paul George signed an extension with the Clippers, so he cannot be traded anywhere until next season at the earliest."
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
Uhh yes they do  Paul George  Kawhi  AD  Harden   All did the same shit
"You sound like Paul George trying to walk this back “this wasn’t a must win season” lmao  You just brought in a top 5 player, a top 5 point guard. To say you aren’t contending is a laugh my bad take.  &gt;kyrie will be sorted out by the end of the season   Yes, the dude who has been a head case for several seasons will suddenly get it together"
Three team trade?  Houston gets: Paul George Brooklyn gets : harden Clippers get: kyrie   Kawhi gets a point guard. Houston gets a player to play alongside wall and cousins and Brooklyn gets harden.  Who says no?
"If you’d like then only 60% of Giannis’ dunks are assisted. That puts him up there with lebron, John wall, Paul George, and a bunch of guards like Wall."
"You take the best player and at the moment that’s Luka.   Trae has a chance to have a better career than Luka (because he is an insanely talented young player), however at the moment Luka looks like a future MVP, who has won at every level pre-NBA. Also Luka showed up in the playoffs with a matchup that had Paul George and Kawhi taking turns guarding him.   We won’t know who won the trade for a few more years, but at the moment Luka is the best player and the guy you would prefer to have."
I thought MVP was Paul George?
"I never thought he would be a good defender, then in the playoffs a couple years ago I remember watching him block a bunch of jumpshots from JJ Redick, Paul George etc, where he was the primary defender and managed to stay in front and contest quickly enough to block them cleanly multiple times. I hadn't seen that often, so that made me take notice"
"Paul George is putting up better numbers than Kawhi right now. If he keeps it up, the Clippers get the one seed, and Kawhi misses a bunch of games, I'd think he'd be the favorite. Best player on the best team is always going to get votes."
"Good calls. I think McCollum is having a better start than Dame so that's a fun wrinkle. I can't see anyone actually voting for paul george for MVP though, no? Kawhi won't play enough games. I see AD actively campaigning for DPOY this season so it wouldn't surprise me if he takes a minor step back as far as offensive output."
"He doesn’t have the scoring ability to be a top 10 player yet. Every single top 10 player is the best player on their own team, and can be the best player on a playoff team.  The best rookies in the past 15 years have been Luka, Blake, Trae, Simmons, Mitchell, Rose etc. have all been very good, and close to all star level, but nowhere near top 10. Players like Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Embiid, KAT, Trae, and even Luka are all players in the later part of the top 10 or outside looking in. Lamelo isn’t even the best player on his own team."
same thing with paul george westbrook and others lol people dont know what overrated means at this point
But then you'd have to applaud Paul George for something. Are you sure you want to do that?
"Paul George probably the best facsimile for Tracy McGrady thats playing today for kids that didn’t watch Tracy. Tracy was a more consistent scorer but you can tell PG modeled his game after TMac, huge guard with slick handles, looks absolutely effortless, ridiculous when hes on. Similar record of playoff success, and TMac cant get past the first round is an OG/street meme"
Danny Green pulled a Paul George lmaooo
So did Paul George
I wonder what the comments in this thread would be if it was Paul George that said this
Kind of like the guys on the Clippers not being happy with Paul George.
We really need to get Kyrie and Paul George together for the all-douchebag team.
You could say dwight’s superstardom died the moment he left magic.   KD’s career as Mr Nice Guy died the moment he slivered out of OKC.  Paul George became a meme after leaving Indiana.  Melo’s king of NY status left him after he got traded to OKC and got betrayed by them unfortunately
You do realize Shaq averaged 59% TS for his *career* right? That would have made him as efficient as Paul George and Kawhi Leonard last year. And more efficient than guys like LeBron and Butler.
You obviously don’t read what I write man. When did I ever say doc wasn’t at fault? I said him AND the players are at fault. Zubac holding Jokic at 46.9%? You think he could’ve done that the whole series by himself? Jamal got his numbers down? He still torched the clippers in game 7 when it mattered dude while again the clipper duo didn’t score in the 4th. And for argument’s sake let’s just say jokic was the only one killing the clippers you don’t think kawhi or Paul George could’ve helped? Make someone else beat them? I don’t see why you don’t get that even with bad coaching kawhi and Paul George shouldn’t have lost three games in a row man. Especially since in most of those games the nuggets were the ones trailing.
"I guess whats interesting about the sample size is that Paul George has already made 55 3s, which is equal to or greater than 2 of those 8 50% season."
More so because Paul George was so good to watch that season. Complete 2 way player and is delighting if you realized that he came back stronger from an injury.
Paul George is even better
"It’ll be hard to count anyone who is a teammate of James Harden as truly in the MVP race.  Honestly I don’t know who I have as my candidates right now.   Jokic is doing incredible but the Nuggets aren’t, same with Luka and the Mavs  AD and Lebron are coasting  Giannis will have to face some serious voter’s fatigue  The Blazers won’t do well enough for Dame to be in it unless he goes absolutely nuts, likewise for Steph and Golden State  I think Paul George has a shot (I think he’s better than Kawhi lol) but everyone will disagree + he’s on the Clippers"
Paul George fans really love bringing up his distant 3rd place MVP votes.
"Who said the player next to you had to be better - they just need to be competent. Look at all the top scoring guards I mentioned - they all have allstar teammates. Look at the Bulls roster - youngest starting lineup in NBA with no allstars, let alone players that complement Zach on both ends of floor.   Lavine is def a star, at least based on NBA fans' qualifications. The guy has been putting up top 10 scoring numbers over the last 2 seasons at pretty nice efficiency. He was 4th in unassisted 3pt% last season (39.9%). The 4 others in the top 5 were Tatum, Lillard, Paul George, and CP3. In terms of skilled scoring, Zach is a star"
PAUL GEORGE as HOL HORSE
Paul George has done this every regular season for the last four years though. Looks like an MVP candidate then chokes hard.
"&gt; Clippers fans honestly know how to take it on the chin  Eh, I dunno. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Clipper fans totally mystified as to why people don't like Paul George or Pat Beverley and complaining up and down that they get shit for no reason. I understand why they as Clipper fans would defend their players, but acting like it's completely baffling as to why fans of other teams wouldn't like those guys is silly."
how fuckingg dare you compare KC3 to George Paul
Paul George
"You can’t blame everything on Doc, at the end of the day the players are the ones on the floor. That being said Paul George looks better and they’re probably top4 in the league somewhere"
Kyrie over Jokic and Paul George with the season he's having rn is a crime
"Bol bol, Danny green, Paul George: Am I a joke to you?"
When do we have the conversation that Paul George is better than AD?
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.   Chris Kaman Central Michigan  Kevin Martin Western Carolina  Danny Granger New Mexico  Patrick Bryant Bradley  Paul Milsap Louisiana Tech  Rodney Stuckey Eastern Washington  Jason Smith Colorado State  Jason Thompson Rider University  Courtney Lee Western Kentucky  George Hill IUPUI  Steph Curry Davidson  Gordon Hayward Butler  Paul George Fresno State  Larry Sanders VCU  Jimmer Fredette BYU  Kawhi Leonard San Diego State  Kenneth Faried Morehead State  Norris Cole Cleveland State  Shelvin Mack Butler  Damian Lillard Weber State  Kyle O'Quinn Norfolk State  CJ McCollum Lehigh  Isaiah Canaan Murray State  James Ennis Cal State Long Beach  Cam Payne Murray State  Larry Nance Jr Wyoming  Richaun Holmes Bowling Green  Ja Morant Murray State  Obi Toppin Dayton
YO Paul George is doing good but I didn't expect... THAT.
"I don't think the worry for the Clippers is Kawhi Leonard leaving. He's almost certainly gonna stay. Their problem is that Paul George, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Patrick Beverley are all 30+ and likely to get slightly worse with each passing year."
Paul George is a MVP contender player. His twin Playoff P is a scrub though.
"I’m sure this post that makes Paul George look good, and Luka look bad will be heavily upvoted on r/nba!"
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
"Playoff P is worse than Paul George, its the law in these parts!"
A lot of the missed shots have been luck. Did you see that potential game winner by Paul George? He missed but Wiggins was late on the contest. No OT tonight.
Klay has decent handles. He has enough handles to make the separation for his jumpshots. He just isn't as flashy and fast as the upper tier like Paul George or Jaylen Brown.
"No, Paul George is just worse than Paul George. r/NBA paradox"
"The Clippers blew a 22-point lead against the same team, yet you think they’re the favorites over the team who is clearly coasting? Blowing a 19-point lead isnt something that a championship calibre team does, but blowing a 22-point lead is?? Not to mention that the Clippers (particularly Paul George) are on a super hot shooting streak rn. Paul George hitting 50% of his threes is absurd and is unsustainable.   And the Lakers were never invincible to begin with... they just happen to have two superstars who have always brought it during the playoffs. Rn, theyre coasting hard, and deservedly so because they had a shortened off-season break."
bold of you to assume they don't think Paul George is a scrub
If they are worse then Paul George they are a scrub!  -r/nba probably
Obviously those types of players aren't often available. But they could *try*. They shouldn't go down without a fight.   They could've tried to get Harden. Or back-channeled for Giannis. CP3 was available. Maybe Paul George suddenly grew up as a Warriors fan. Maybe Joel Embiid is tired of playing next to Kangaroo Kidd-Gilchrist. Lowry is an expiring contract.
**Guys averaging 20+ppg on 65%+ TS:**        Kevin Durant - 31.3 PPG on 66.9% TS            Joel Embiid - 26.4 PPG on 66.3% TS            Nikola Jokic - 25.1 PPG on 65.8% TS                      Paul George - 24.4 PPG on 68.5% TS                    That's insane efficiency. KD in particular is pretty jaw-dropping.
Paul George with the revenge tour.
"Not to mention our top priority at the time was matching up against the kd warriors. Paul George would have given us a prayer towards defending against durant. Thomas on the other hand was the worst defensive PG in the nba, and unlike the Celtics we did not have the defensive team surrounding him to help hide him."
"Right but don’t you think that it’s unfair for Clippers fans (who have dealt with months of nonstop jokes after the 3-1 meltdown) that they seemingly can’t celebrate or be happy for regular season success? I see so many Paul George comments about the great season he’s having flooded with “wait until Playoff P shows up”, but nobody else really gets the same treatment except for Giannis (for example a guy like Joel Embiid is receiving praise for his performance thus far). Everyone loves to bring up that embarrassing 50 point loss the Clippers had to the Mavs after Christmas, but then say “regular season doesn’t matter” after they have a big win."
"paul george so disrespected man, mans literally averaging like 25/6/5 in the 50/50/90 club, tied for the best record in the west and he gets placed in honorable mentions lol"
"Paul George didn't dunk much last season, I'm guessing it had to do with him being afraid of contact after his shoulder surgeries... He had 2 this game and one last game so that's promising! I mean he still has ups so there's no reason he shouldn't be getting into the lane once in a while     This Clippers offense makes me wonder if it's going to have a few off nights to come down to the average but I'm hoping it doesn't"
So I see Paul George decided averaging 50/50/90 splits is indeed the plan for the year.
all Paul George does these days is dunk and sink 3s. Morey's masterpiece
"History says Paul George. Maybe not next, but within the next three."
Osman is making the Nets look like Paul George
Nets making Osman look like Paul George
Look at the vote breakdown during those years.    KD finished around 7-9 each year.    Players like John Wall Paul George Joel Embiid Jokic and Damian Lillard all finished above him. And he finished slightly above Demar DeRozan.
"I mean there's not really a hard and fast rule lol; KD and AD have been referred to that enough to know who they are. And it applies to usually the top players since they get talked about so often.  We don't really go by CP but CP3 for Chris Paul, like PG13 for Paul George."
"DeMar, Jrue, Klay, and Paul George are some of the big active players that are missing  tons of decent starters and washed up all-stars too that are active"
"Some players, sure. In the examples you gave? Eh.   One of those players has intentionally injured other players with his dirty play. One of them is known to be a pseudo-intellectual who talks down to others and causes large problems for his teams (threatening surgery in Cleveland while going weeks without talking to the team, the shit he has done in Boston, what he is doing now).  Paul George I will give you though. His hate started out meme-y and people have seemed to take it weirdly far with him. I dunno if I have seen it as much lately but it is there.  I also dunno what post you're talking about with LaMelo and Gordon but context would be needed. Is it a race thing or because there is such an age difference? Gordon gets meme'd on pretty hard for being the Utah white boy with a Trump supporting wife, I wouldn't be surprised if it has to do with that too."
"Lmao how many times have you asked this already? The team isnt good, Wiggins is the second option ffs. This isnt like Harden who had CP3 with him, or Westbrook who had Paul George.  And also the reason why Curry isnt criticized to the extent Harden and Westbrook did is because Curry has already won it all in 2015. Yeah there were injuries in the Finals but he was still able to lead his team to that point in the first place and beat LeBron fucking James. Not a lot of people can say that.  Unlike Harden, who was unable to beat the Curry-led Warriors in 2019 when KD went down (series was tied 2-2 when KD went down), or Westbrook who had PG with him and couldn’t beat rookie Donovan Mitchell.  Seems like you’re pushing hard for this sub to hate Steph Curry."
"I think he’s a perfect fit with the clips it’s almost a given. They need a selfless PG who can run the offence for Kawhi and Paul George, plus he’s good on defence. But I agree idk how they will trade for him this season"
"Paul George, who last month signed a 5 year Max contract, and Kawhi Leonard, who it took 4 years to finally get to LA, will leave?"
"“Notice no star wants to go there”? I guess 2x FMVP and the most coveted FA in 2019 is not considered as a ‘star’.   Their last FA include: Paul George, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka and Nic Batum. Tell me who does not want to go there."
"This dude just flat out ignored the 2017 offseason which consisted of the Butler Trade, Paul George Trade and Kyrie trade"
"their sixth man of the year bailed on them and walked across the hall at a discount. They’re a sinking ship, once they get bounced again kawhi and Paul George are gone"
"Curry, Dame, Luka, Jokic, Boban, Alex Caruso,   On the flipside.  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, PatBev, Kyle Kuzma"
Yea it really bit them in the ass when paul george and Kawhi went there....
"""you really have two first names huh mate, ya sound like a cartoon characta on the tele that mah twins watch, oi lad""  paul george: https://youtu.be/V7spXwATNxc?t=37"
Tatum drives like paul george
Y’all forget what harden did to pat bev and Paul George
You forget that Ingles has taken up permanent residence in Paul Georges head.  I really wish I knew what Ingles says to him to get him so riled up.  Whatever it is it always forces George to start making stupid mistakes.
"I'm sure clippers fans are pretty happy that they made the right decision instead of sitting too long on that fat ass contract. They traded blake while they felt they could get a good haul and turned it into paul george and Kawhi leonard.   The clippers realized that he couldn't do it with an all time great like Chris Paul, then he's probably not doing it with anyone else either. Cold and calculated, but fair. Blake got paid money that will last for life. And besides, who's to say he wouldn't have soured on the clippers asap after realizing that they weren't going to win and he was getting older. We just watched Harden do it to Houston."
Paul George over Giannis
Yea but then Paul George and Pat Bev also stop themselves so it’s almost a wash
"Well Paul George is an efficient T-Mac, so I'd say that's pretty good. And he's basically ""the guy"" in the Clippers org."
Paul George?
"Missing the point. He has Paul George syndrome. His behavior and comments made leading up to this point has only brought more scrutiny than he otherwise would’ve gotten. The guy doesn’t have to say anything, yet he opens himself for criticism by saying stupid and unprofessional shit. He shouldn’t get a pass for that"
"I thought the media portrayal of AD leaving was weird too. They made it sound like he was leaving for a signature shoe deal, and not to have more chances at playoffs before he's outta his prime. Dude heard the words 'Lebron' and was like ""alright that's a ring fr fr."" lol.  AD tried to go play with Paul George in Indiana before that, so he was ready for any market size. Just wanted to win."
"LMAO you don’t even know people’s race on this sub. I thought you were saying OP is salty about Kyrie or the Nets or just singling him out because of his superstardom. Kevin Love helped bring a title to the city of Cleveland, Paul George plays for a team nobody wants"
I don’t really consider the jury still out on the Paul George trade. That haul is absolutely fucking stupid. SGA is a stud who probably has more trade value than PG already. Then *five* first rounders and two swaps.
Same season Paul George won his mvp
I don’t think Paul George is at his peak. He doesn’t get to the rim anywhere near as much as he used to and that’s super important for pressuring defences and playmaking. He isn’t the defender he used to be (although he’s still really good on that end)
paul george won't play better than this  vucevic too
"r/nba: lmaoooo playoff P!!! Pandemic P!!! Side of the backboard P lmaooooo  Also r/nba: Danny Ainge didn’t trade Jayson Tatum for Paul George, is he even a top 25 GM?"
"Dawg. Giannis lost to a team with a best player who is worse than him and a bunch of dudes acquired via trade or developed by the Heat. What are you saying? The reason the Bucks lost to the Heat isn't because the Heat are in a desirable situation -- the Bucks are MORE TALENTED than Miami. They lost because they got outcoached severely and because Giannis woefully underperformed. This woe is me attitude has to stop from small market teams. They secure superstars and then fail to materialize competent enough teams around those stars.   Miami secured their star and he was surrounded by Bam Adebayo (developed all star), Tyler Herro (rookie), Dragic (traded for YEARS ago), Jae Crowder (traded for), and Iguodala (traded for). Jimmy Butler was signed in free agency, but he's a worse player than a lot of the stars on small market teams... Maybe teams should draft their own Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, trade for their own Jae Crowder and Iguodala, develop their own quality coaching staff that's up to snuff and surround their home grown superstar with that instead of bullshitting around keeping coaches like Budenholzer as the head of their program.  I mean, OKC had Paul George AND Westbrook and couldn't make it out of the first round... Is that because they're a small market? Kawhi and Paul George JUST LOST TO DENVER."
"there is nothing wrong with player empowerment, but a lot of these players are weak cowards that aren't prepared to fight for something, overcome adversity and build something.  dame said it best to paul george"
I forgot Paul George just won back to back MVP’s too. My bad 🤦‍♂️
"man Shamet's career is so tragic, dude has been trade bait 3 times now as a rookie. Yes he's literally gotten to play with Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant and James Harden but mother of god the dude is treated like livestock"
"eh... we are ok. Some definite boneheaded decisions in there (Hansborough when multiple PGs were on the board, TJ Leaf when Collins nad OG were right there)   but Aaron Holiday at 23 has been solid for us, Turner at 11 was pretty good (oof didn' trealize Booker dropped that far lol). Hell, solomon hill at 23 wasn't horrible at all that late in the draft.  Without high picks, it is hard to ""hit"" but we jumped at Paul George and Danny Granger when they fell to us in the past."
Paul George showing up in playoffs shooting game winner for the rest of the contract he is on would be a good start.
Paul George is Toby
We’re making fun of paul George. Keep up
"Steph is your Tom Brady. Works hard, inspires people to follow him by leading by example rather than blowing smoke and talking a big game (cough Paul George). It’s why they  are my 2 favorite athletes"
"Most people count the brawl for us on the ""injured"" list. Artest brain got injured by that cup of beer lol  - brawl season when it was our best team ever - jermaine oneals health started breaking down in his prime - Danny Granger's knees gave up at age 28 right when our Paul George/Hibbert/David West team peaked. Imagine adding prime danny granger to the team that pushed Miami to the brink - George broke his leg (and then turned into a snake) - Dipo blew his knee and is still not the same (and now gone)  Then we lost Sabonis before the playoffs last then and then TJ Warren this year already and then traded for a dude with a Kidney mass lol  Our injuries are a bit more situational because they kept ruining promising teams where we had a shot. And small markets don't get a lot of shots... so each time it happens it hurts more and more.   We can't compare to losing future HOF's like Walton and Oden like Portland though."
"Paul George slander and r/NBA, name a more iconic duo"
"A lot of overrating Jaylen and underrating Paul George going on. Paul George, right now and historically is better than any player on the Celtics including Tatum. They are probably better at a younger age and look likely to get better but they also have the chance to stay the same."
Paul George is way better than everyone on that lmao
"Paul George is an MVP candidate type of player, no one else on that list is close to that. I think Booker is the best of the rest, while the other 3 are all similar and can be swapped in any order.  1. Paul George  2. Devin Booker  3. Ben Simmons  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Donovan Mitchell"
"Paul George is tiers above the best player on this list loool, don’t let recency bias fool you when he was just an mvp candidate 2 seasons ago 🤨"
"1. Paul George 2. JB 3. Ben Simmons 4. DBook 5. Mitchell  However, 2-5 are close and are interchangable."
Paul George is better than these guys what in the hell is going with the PG slander on here
Paul George  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  JB  Ben Simmons
But we can definitely fault Paul George in the last quarter of game 7 as a SG when he airballs it.
*lakers choke a 3-1 lead to 2.0 Paul George       “Well we already won one so who care”
they probably got put on probation for a couple months after they tore Paul George to shreds for absolutely no reason in that post game interview the other day lmao
I nearly downvoted bcoz I thought Paul George. LOL! But good point. I put Kawhi/AD (ring winners) fighting for 5th spot over Paul (7th). Harden is also ringless but he is a historic player and peaked higher than CP3.
Paul “Hitting back boards in the clutch” George?
"You act like I said he should’ve blamed the refs. All I said was he’s proven that he can show up on the biggest of stages; so people won’t take this quote the same way as if Paul George said it, because he hasn’t proven he can do the same"
"I always pull for the Blazers to win it if it's not going to be us - and then any other teams that I like the way they play.  But I gotta admit, watching the salt flow from a Paul George FMVP would be pretty dang amazing to see."
Why are we talking about Paul George here?
Paul George
"Doesn't make any sense for the Clippers. Paul George is playing amazing right now, and they'll bank on the fact that ""he can't *possibly* choke that hard again, right?"" As they should. Kyrie is a headcase and a worse player than Paul George."
"Chris Paul, Paul George, Jamal Murray.  Their names are too plain. I think basketball players should have cool names."
Pels and Grizzlies need another piece or 2. They might get them in the draft this year they might not.  Mavs will be good but they also probably need another star specifically a wing defender and scorer like a Paul George or Khris Middleton.
"&gt;magically make him Paul George or Kawhi Leonard  I looked it up, and was very surprised to learn that, quietly, Tobias has roughly the same amount of career points as Kawhi. He also has more career rebounds, while trailing slightly in blocks, and more so in assists and steals."
"I don’t think anybody would care if Beal left  With the Dame quote, Paul George kept talking shit like he didn’t switch teams after Dame eliminated him. Paul George shouldn’t be talking any shit cause he keeps switching teams, good teams that underperform  Beal isn’t Paul George, no one would care if Beal left"
"Was having a discussion today with a friend about this and Paul George. I personally am not the biggest fan of his game. Sure, in the East he was one of the top dogs, but he just leaves something to be desired in clutch situations, and playoffs. I’m sure there is a stat that will prove me wrong, but these last 3 years, his superstar stock has tanked, for me. Gimmie Hayward, I’d rather bet on him staying healthy, then rely on PG in the clutch. Decisions like these are also why I’m not a Coach lol"
Paul George was also a douche.
"Contract or not, any player can just demand a trade whenever they want regardless or whether they are free agents. Kawhi, Harden, Paul George, Davis and Wall are all stars who forced themselves off their team in the last 3 years. Beal would be gone in a week if he wanted to."
I don’t think Paul George has ever left a team as a free agent.
"Paul George. Cheated on his girlfriend, arrogant and toxic as fuck"
"Lol why you thanking Tobi? He finally got to a good system then Doc followed him over. He's prolly having PTSD flashbacks. No but he seems like he's playing a lot better than he did on the Clips. Also you might have a Paul George shooting 40-something from 3, but we have...a CARUSO!"
"This is why we got him and yes, why we paid him. Not because paying him the max would magically make him Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. But because he's the exact type of player that fits perfectly next to Joel and Ben. Can be a scorer when necessary, a spot up shooter when necessary, and can defend and rebound when necessary. And we needed elite three point shooting from the PF position and we had a large sample size from his time in LA that showed he was just that.   With this spacing and him back at his actual position Joel isn't the only one that is shooting better. He also has a ton of room to operate this year."
Never realized how nice Tobias hairline is. Got that Paul George Gene.
You really don’t think it’s a problem to have a 30% usage rate player score on low 50 TS%?   You don’t wonder why the Thunder didn’t really improve after adding George and why the Rockets got worse trading Paul for Westbrook?
"Tobias Harris, Wiggins, Paul George.    Who should we make fun of next?"
Bruh 😂 man signed that contract knowing he could get traded just like Paul George did after securing the bag STOP
"I think he gets in over shai and ja, cj depending on how many games he plays before they vote.  Paul george should be a forward"
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
Joe Ingles and his son Paul George.
"Why does Beal not get a pass but other NBA stars do?  Anthony Davis, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, etc.  All these guys demanded trades out of their organization.  It's quite obvious the Wizards have done little to put their team in a position to contend.  I mean John Wall comes back and they make a pretty lateral move to trade him for Russ.  If I was Beal, I'd be upset with the organization, and the Wizards should absolutely trade him before they lose him for nothing."
The Paul George special
"The Pelicans definitely didn’t lose the trade. They got more for AD than the Kawhi, Russ, Griffin, and Harden trades. Couldn’t ask for more really, the only superstar trade that’s superior is the Paul George trade."
Paul George is better than Jaylen Brown

"He still might come up short since Curry, Dame, Luka, and Mitchell are basically locks at guard.  If only 6 guards make it, you can only pick 2 between CJ, Booker, and Conley.  Biggest question mark to me is CJ since he just got injured, how many games missed is ""too many"". Pre-injury he was lighting the world on fire, like 1st or 2nd team all-nba fire.  There's also Paul George who probably can be a guard or forward?  Guys like CP3, Jamal Murray, SGA, and Fox will get tons of fan votes too even though they don't really deserve it."
"I think if AD played with kd, oladipo, or Paul George they might have been a better team bt that’s just my opinion"
KD hasn't lost a step but I guess its more its expected of him seeing how well he can still play.  Paul George right now is playing @ 50/50/90 splits but nobody takes him seriously anymore. Guess we have to find out how he pans in the playoffs
Paul George gets bagged on constantly and no one ever gets a chance to talk about what a talented player he is.
"Oh hey, didn't know Paul George was on this sub"
Pretty easy to figure out why but lmfao at some of the people above Kawhi. Dame? Lowry? PAUL GEORGE? Lol
Kawhi was requested by SAn Antonio  ahead of the George Hill trade.  We did legitimately pick turner and Paul George though
"If I were the Pelicans I would throw a Paul George type trade to get Bradley Beal.   Beal, Ingram, Zion would be sick."
Man remember when Paul George got shit on so much saying he was used wrong by Doc and people came out of the wood work to defend him and shit on PG?  Well turns out now it's more like:  https://i.imgur.com/pj8B0O8_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium
I get that they aren't allowed to but what's the punishment? Would they force Kawhi or Paul George to leave?   I'd be fine with the NBA taking away draft picks if I get star players like Kawhi.
I think it was Paul George and Eric Bledsoe (in a three team trade)
Off the top of my head:   Thunder got CP3 for Westbrook. Good deal.   Pacers for Olidipo for Paul George.   Rockets Injured Westbrook for Injured John Wall
"In 19-20 season the MVP was won by Giannis, with voting points followed by Lebron James and then James Harden. In the same season, Harden won fantasy points, followed my Giannis and then Lebron.  In 18-19 season the MVP was won by Giannis, with voting points followed by Harden and then Paul George. In the same season, Harden won fantasy points, followed by Westbrook, then Giannis, then in 4th Paul George.  I could go on in the history of comparing fantasy leaders to MVP voting, but there is always a strong correlation.  As of right now Embiid isn’t even a top 10 in fantasy points, meaning he isn’t at the very top of the league in scoring, rebounding, assists, blocks, steals, etc. I don’t think he’s being looked as a top MVP candidate currently and this is part of the reason why.  Not sure why you think this is a bad take, when it actually makes a lot of sense. Fantasy points doesn’t mean you win MVP of course, but only someone who is blind or ignorant doesn’t see the correlation between fantasy points and MVP voting."
"Nah it really doesn’t make sense why people hate him or the clippers. It’s actually pretty irrational if you take a second to think about it. Especially to the level of genuine hate people have for them.   You were the one to bring up the stat post in the first place haha, don’t why you even needed to say that.   My comment was mocking the idea there would ever be a positive circlejerk about Paul George on r/nba. That’s just a delusional thought if you’re on here often. Every comment that got downvoted was because it was corny or just negative for no reason or substance."
"Maybe from an individual perspective, Trez did more. But Ibaka is a much better fit for our team and our spacing is on another level because of it. I would say it's a major reason why Paul George has looked much better this year. This kind of spacing just isn't possible with Trez."
if it wasn’t for paul george you would’ve been eliminated in game 5
"Clippers fans know. We were upset to see him go, even though it meant getting Paul George and, as a result, Kawhi. He was just so good his rookie year that we could see a future star in the making."
Where is Paul George on this list.
Paul George and Lou Will
Almost like Paul George having parents named Paul George and Joe Ingles
Paul George is good at basketball
Paul George?  No shot that goes in is a bad shot at the end of the day.  Especially if it seals a game.
Almost like Paul George having parents named Paul George and Paulette Goerge.
Paul George is shooting 50/50/90 so far this season
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30614082/the-brief-history-damian-lillard-paul-george-rivalry%3fplatform=amp
"Social media is the biggest problem with this. NBA twitter is a toxic waste. I really felt bad for Paul George earlier this year too, they were attacking that man's family over fucking basketball. NBA fans can be pathetic."
"I like Paul George but this might be overrating him while underrating Lowry.  Even last year lowrys like a top 15-20 player, that’s not a huge gap from Kyrie even in a vacuum."
Replace harden with Paul George and they are a better team same idea
"which teams wanted that trade? i recall there being talks of paul george and carmelo anthony being traded to the cavs and it falling apart partly because they couldn’t find any team that wanted to trade for love, given his huge contract."
Paul George has been so fun to watch this year. Great to see him bounce back.
My names Paul George and I'm addicted to splitting the trap off the pick
"Paul George,  Paulette George"
"One thing to hate on players who deserve the hate (ala Irving/Harden/Paul George), but why did he have to hate on LAKERS big man Dwight last year?! When he was nothing but a perfect teammate for us? And Mitchell? Who is one of the most likable players presently? Jesus like I said, he's a disgraceful representative of Lakers. We need to dissociate with him."
"Damnnn, so Paul George is like that now huh"
"He's also played with Kawhi, Paul George and now Kyrie, Harden, and KD.  All he literally has to do is to hit open shots lol."
"Paul George has been great. Expectedly, no comment from the sub"
That sounds like Paul George
???? This issue of playmaking people talk about is so strange considering that Paul George and Kawhi have both improved in this regard and that the Clippers are running a very different offensive system that has produced something like 83% open threes so far in the season.
"So was Paul George. I know he gets clowned, but I think there’s a reoccurring theme here. Pacers front office doesn’t seem to be the best of the bunch."
he literally carried the jazz to the playoffs and past the Paul George Russel westbrick thunder his rookie season.... hes perfectly fine in the playoffs
"This Paul George play is the most gangster shit i have seen on the court, its up there with the Harden staredown.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XT400FGMJKw"
How about 8 first round picks and young players for Harden? How about 4 first round picks and Chris Paul for aging Russell Westbrook? How about 5 first round picks and a young stud for Paul George?
Theres literally people here who will shit all over Paul George and Giannis for not taking their teams to the next level while attacking Shaq for trying to motivate Mitchell by challenging him.
"&gt; They also didn't have Pandemic P hitting the side of the backboard  Putting that whole shit show only on Paul George is not right, seriously"
"I get frustrated when I see that. Or when people talked about Middleton last year not being a traditional 2nd guy. Like what is a traditional 2nd guy? I mean, he isn’t as good as AD I guess. But is as he as good as Paul George? It’s close! This season he averages 22/6/6 on 64% true shooting and good defense. Is there any weakness there? He’s averaging 52/44/92 on 22 a game and 6 assists, where’s his offensive weakness?   And Jrue holiday was constantly spoken of as the most underrated player in the league, a guy who could get you 20/5/7 on all NBA defense. That’s the ultimate 3rd guy. Jrue is better than the 3rd best player on the Lakers, Clippers, 76ers, Heat. Jrue isn’t as good as Kyrie, but the Nets have their own problems."
"Provided Paul George is ever healthy again, I'd still take either LA team over Utah. The Jazz have nobody to guard big wings, and if you can't guard LeBron or Kawhi it's gonna be very tough to win."
"We need to see if and when Paul George is ever gonna be healthy again. It's odd to me that he's been out like this with an injury that often implies a fracture and the Clippers really aren't giving much clarification on him. Maybe he comes back this week and he's all good, but if he's out for a few months then obviously that's gonna have major implications, especially for seeding purposes."
"When people give Paul George hell for saying he grew up a Clippers fan (and to all the deniers, yes, it's true, dig up his scouting reports), they forget this was the team he was watching."
"I have to wonder how well you remember the 3 games between the Lakers and Jazz last season when you say all of this, because the Lakers absolutely abused Utah all three times last year. None of the games were even particularly competitive. Utah relies heavily on Gobert to protect the paint and on outside shooting. Anthony Davis always pulls Gobert away from the basket, which renders his defense far less effective, and the Lakers are one of the best at covering perimeter shooters. Just look at how masterful they were in the playoffs at absolutely locking down other teams' 3-pt shooting. For Donovan Mitchell the Lakers have a bunch of guys to put on him who are bigger and stronger than he is, in KCP, Caruso and even LeBron if they want to (just look at LeBron's defense against Jamal Murray in last year's WCF). And the Lakers can match his quickness with Schroder, who is also a great defender.   The Lakers weren't built with the Jazz in mind, but nonetheless the Lakers are perfectly equipped to neutralize everything Utah wants to do, and that was painfully evident last season. But on the other end, the Jazz have a *major* flaw when it comes to trying to defend the Lakers, as they have nobody to put on LeBron. They really don't have anyone to guard AD either, as he always roasts Gobert. I mean, [just look at their last meeting if you doubt that.](https://youtu.be/bOLwalTFgCA) The Clippers represent a much bigger threat to the Lakers, IMO (provided Paul George is ever healthy again, of course). I would love it if the Jazz could take out the Clippers in the 2nd round and leave the Lakers to only have to face Utah. That would be a very easy series for the Lakers, IMO."
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."
Paul George is  shook.
If Paul George plays like he has i think Clippers will knock off Lakers..Clippers are like 3-2 against them since last year
"It's exactly because he bought the team to feed his ego that he wouldn't even entertain the idea of moving the franchise to Seattle. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George just forced a move there with the latter already signed to a 5 year extension. Do you see that happening in Seattle? Salary cap in North American sports make being a super rich owner in an unpopular player destination pretty much worthless. He wants to win titles, and there's a way bigger likelihood of that happening in LA."
"Fair point, I’ll look forward to it but in the meantime I’ll never trust Paul George in the playoffs.   Kawhi has something to prove too, because last year was embarrassing."
By the criteria of performance+popularity those are the only superstars in the league.   Kawhi would be here if he and Paul George combined scored more than Patrick Beverly in the second Half of a game 7.
"Nah, even if they win a chip they absolutely aren't contenders because they still wouldn't have a superstar. They'd need to sign Paul George to be considered a contender."
"Ah yes Paul George, the player famously given a universal pass for his playoff performances by r/nba"
"Aite, I'll concede the Beal point. I'm just trying to say that Luka isn't ""EASILY"" top 5. Not only are there 5+ people better than him atm, he has tons of competition like Tatum, Paul George, ect who are his caliber."
Holy shit Paul George was still on the Pacers in 2016? Why does it feel like he left that team ages ago lol. It's only been 5 years wow
"Imagine someone owning the Clippers and the Lakers and then just trading Kauai and Paul George to the Lakers for... I don't know... Caruso, Kuzma and Marc Gasol."
Paul George soft
"""Dame should be on there""  - Paul George probably"
"https://twitter.com/FTFonFS1/status/1270836319074291713?s=20  Harden legit put up more efficient numbers than Kawhi against a harder GSW team(Healthy KD/Klay, not as much help as Kawhi, and focal point of offense). That CP3 Rockets team was second only to the greatest team of all time with Harden as the center piece...you really think he’s losing to Sixers/Bucks and you’re comparing him to Paul George. Y I even bother."
"I value how each player plays in the in the playoffs and Kawhi is on another level to Harden. Only Lebron and KD can put up Kawhis numbers while being as insanely efficient as him. Also the Raptors with Harden would have lost to both the Sixers and the Bucks. Frankly Harden is as streaky as Paul George in the playoffs, hence his constant failure to show up in crucial moments."
"Jimmy Butler is beloved for being a ""tough-nosed tough guy"" despite what he did being 10 times worse than Harden lol. Kawhi is overall liked but his haters are clear whilst Paul George is more memed for his playoff failures/quotes than swapping teams and he did it twice."
What star forced a trade and didn't get shit on by the public for it? Kawhi still hated by spurs rightfully. Vince still hated by raptors.  Paul George has burnt many bridges.  Jimmy Butler earned a lot of hatred for a bit.
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
"Ad-lebron - best combo of scoring, playmaking, and defense and two top 10 players with arguably the #1 player. Only weakness is shooting.   Kd-harden- two of the best offensive players of all time together in their primes. Only weakness is defense.   Paul George and kawhi - two best perimeter defenders in the game and elite scorers. Main weakness is play making.   Those 3 are above the rest by far imo with the ranking as I had above."
"yesterday i called someone out for calling paul george “a piece of shit” and then he proceeded to call me an idiot. some people on here are just really hateful and as a clippers fan, i try to just see it as their problem.   also, a lot of people here have a really hard time separating themselves from the teams. they act like they’re superior people and can say more than someone else because the team they root for has won more. it’s sad really, fans are an important part of the nba, but they aren’t the reason teams win rings so i wish people here would stop acting like they’ve accomplished anything."
"Dipo wasn’t the player he became after playing with the Thunder yet. He even said himself that playing with Westbrook slowed him how to lead a team, hence the all-NBA season in 2017-18. Steven Adams is one of the most overrated player in the league, and he couldn’t do a damn thing without Russ setting him up other than offensive rebounding. And Andre Roberson? Really? You just listed three players that couldn’t create offence to save their lives at the time. Just look at what happened to their leads whenever Russ went to the bench, especially in the playoffs. Grant and Sabonis were both rookies, so I don’t even see the point of mentioning them considering they barely played and weren’t good yet. Mentioning them would be like me saying a few years from now that the 2021 Warriors were actually really good other than Steph since they have James Wiseman. Peak Kanter means practically nothing, dude couldn’t guard a cardboard cutout and once again, couldn’t create his own offence without Westbrook.   I never once said that Russ was better than Curry from an efficiency standpoint. But Russ outplayed him in pretty much every other area of the game.   And like I said, Sabonis and Oladipo would both later go on to credit Russ for helping them improve. Besides, if the offence was “all about Russ” and if he didn’t raise his teammates when he was on the Thunder, tell me why almost every player he ever played with had their best (or at least one of their best) seasons playing beside him? Paul George looked like an MVP candidate for the first (and only) time in his career. Ibaka is a better offensive player now, but he probably peaked with the Thunder since his defence was so game changing. KD was the runner up MVP like three times playing beside Russ, and then won his only award in 2013-14. You said yourself that Kanter and Adams peaked beside him. He also made half that awful roster look like semi-capable NBA players, and now those players are completely out of the league. I don’t think most of this Warriors roster will be out of the league in just a few years. Shit, even James Harden had a monster season last year and Bradley Beal is also playing his best ball right now."
"Except stats and efficiency have inflated league-wide since 2016. There's 10-12 guys with numbers that would have been crazy outliers in 2016. Dame, Kyrie, KD, Harden, Luka, LaVine, Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, Paul George etc.  I mean, there's 6 guys averaging 25+ on &gt;65% TS: KD, PG, Embiid, LaVine, Curry, Jokic. That's insane!"
Lakers can't win games with only Ad Lebron is way more valuable. Kawhi can't even beat the Kings without Paul George.
"Yeah these records look like they definetely will be touched. People were saying similar things a few years ago similar, but since then Harden already had a season with more 3-pointers made than in almost any Curry season. Paul George also got a higher number than several Curry's season. And those are not even players considered some historic freaks of shooting.  Every year there's more 3-point shooting in the league, and any of these Curry's record seem reachable when we see the trajectory of other players.  Career 3-pointers? Let's put it like that, Harden is a year younger than Curry, and he has made 245 3-pointers less in career than Curry. And his average for the last 5 full seasons is almost 300. So... it's not crazy to say Curry's record is reachable by a player that actually already plays."
"I’m assuming you mean right now, yes, the pacific is better, two years ago? The warriors were the only good team in that division. You forget the pre Lebron lakers and the pre kawhi Paul George clippers? Not going to even mention the suns or the kings ."
"Paul George is a shooting guard, I'd put him second."
Marcus Smart is elite on the perimeter but too small for bigs. Paul George is elite on the perimeter and ok against bigs. Paul George is not a better defender then Marcus Smart.
A similar comparison for me would be Butler (Brown) and Paul George (Tatum). PG has higher highs but Butler is more steady. Its basically a take your pick on whos a better player.
You mean Paul George
"No order lebron, Kawhi, simmons, Embiid, AD, Paul George, jimmy butler, Giannis, Tatum, brown."
"It's evident Kawhi thinks he carried. He doesn't show his ego but it's obvious. He was telling Toronto to get Paul George during his free agency period shortly after the raptors championship. The entire reason he delayed his free agency decision was to wait until Paul George was dealt. Kawhi was coming off a finals mvp so he most likely thought he was on brons level if not better. And it seems he thought he would run the league with him and PG, stealing the LA market spotlight."
"Kawhiis a better defender then smart, personally I'd also take jimmy Paul George over smart"
"I'd also have Zach at 5, but behind Mitchell.  For me it's Harden &gt; Brown &gt; Beal &gt; Mitchell &gt; LaVine &gt; Booker &gt; Holiday &gt; McCollum &gt; SGA.  I'm not including injured players (Klay) or guys that Bball ref lists as SGs who don't really play that role (Van Vleet).  If you consider Paul George a SG then slot him in at #2"
No Paul George? He's technically a sf but he does play SG for the Clippers
&gt;all speculation   If by speciation you mean well known then sure...  He told them get a second star and personally called several stars to try and get them to agree to come to the clippers (Paul George was third on his list behind Kd then butler)
10th man Paul George is definitely in the drivers seat
10th man paul george &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"When it comes to getting news and highlights, /r/nba is better than anywhere else. My buddy will tell me about some highlight, and while he'll send it to me from Twitter, I literally just come to /r/nba from my phone and that same highlight is probably highly upvoted and easily findable.   I don't come here for discussion, since I think most of the opinions here need toilet paper cuz they're shit. Some opinions of mine are unchanging, and some of them are completely contrarian to this sub. I hate certain players this sub loves, I love certain players this sub hates. I don't come here to discuss those things. If I want discussion, I talk to a few IRL friends who watch as much basketball as I do.  I also come here for the memes. I love the 'Le-X"" memes, I love the Kelvin Benjamin memes, and I love anything that shits on Paul George or Russell Westbrook or James Harden. Obviously, I'm one of those guys who likes to hate on players as much as I like to stan other ones.  Despite the memes, I do hate how shitty hot takes said specifically to be funny get so highly upvoted. But that's only because I don't think they're funny, and what I think isn't funny shouldn't be allowed. I'm narcissistic that way."
"Giannis and kawhi need to switch, jokic and embiid are better than luka, Paul George has been amazing this year and is probably too low."
"I kind of disagree with this, that game 7 vs the Nuggets kawhi looked gassed. Have them have to go through the tough western conference would tire him out, and Kawhi has a chronic injury so he’s gonna have to play through that injury in the playoffs  Kawhi looks good now to be fair so I don’t know if it still affects him, but it would be smarter so that Kawhi and Paul George are both tired by the WCF"
"Lmao   &gt;because he could form a super team in a nice place that was obviously a consequence of the cap.  They took paycuts to do that so what is going to stop that from doing it in any other situation?   &gt;When LeBron was done he went back to Cleveland who by that time had great talent,   They had Kyrie and TT and nothing else. But I'm ignorant.   &gt;Next year, signed big free agent like everyone knew they would,  Dudley is good but I wouldn't say he was a big free agent. Unless you mean AD, who we famously traded for. But again, I'm the ignorant one lmao.   &gt;And if the teams weren’t good because the east was bad at building that still has nothing to do with the argument.  It's the main reason LeBron made the finals all those years. His biggest competition was Paul George and Kyle Lowry. Not exactly the cream of the crop.  In the future if you're going to be this rude, at least be a tiny bit correct."
Curry would not have made it through health wise 2016 to 2019. Even with KD on the team Curry missed a lot of games. His body can’t really hold up that’s a major reason why the Warriors needed KD. Since 2013 the Warriors wanted to pair KD and Steph so your comment under looks those two points. Historically in the NBA you need your main guy to be 6’4 to 6’9 to win. If your guy was too small he could get crushed like Curry did in 2016 and if your guy was too big then it would be harder to get the ball in key moments because they would be double guarded. It’s also disrespectful to KD to not give him respect it’s not like he was Paul George.
"The Nuggets destroyed the Jazz bench. They staggered their starters to play specifically against the weak Jazz bench. That is where their advantage came from. Jazz starters killed it all playoff series long.  This year hapless Tony Bradley has been replaced by Derrick Favors and Joe Ingles is pushed to the bench because we have Bojan back (who was our second leading scorer last year and will probably end up there this year too.)  Last year the Jazz bench was a -8 points per game on average. This year the bench minutes are a positive. The starters are ridiculous.   Are you just going to ignore that a major cog of the Jazz offense was missing in the playoffs last year? I mean no excuses, you still gotta win, but yeah, the offensive rating will definitely be affected. I guarantee that if Paul George misses the upcoming games against the Jazz you will factor that into the pot if the Jazz sweep.  In any case, it would be a good series, even though i think you are vastly overrating the Clippers Pick and roll defense. I guess they could entirely neutralize one of the best pick and roll combos in the league. They haven't shown an aptitude for doing that either this or last season, though."
"He shouldn't. There's just too many good players this year. Paul George, AD, Gobert, Ingram are all well ahead of him. But I've been very pleased with his performance so far this year"
Paul George fucking Roy Hibbert's wife
"But he is a SG but is playing SF/PF because the Spurs have good guard depth. Its like how FVV plays SG because Lowry is there but in reality he is a PG. Same goes with Paul George.  At the end of the day tho this positions dont exist anymore, its just guard, wing, or big tbh"
"Yeah that’s fair enough. As much as I hate to admit it because I hate him, Paul George has been great this season and probably deserves it over AD. He probably would’ve got more votes if he wasn’t such a piece of shit."
"Depends on matchups. Rotates between smart, jaylen, tatum  smart would be on bradley beal. Jaylen would be on Paul George. Tatum would be on Kawhi."
"That's great for Kawhi's case if the Clippers still win those games despite not having Paul George. If they struggle, then the argument is only further cemented to the voters that Kawhi needs PG's help  As things are currently, I wouldn't want LeBron winning MVP, but c'mon man AD is shooting 70% from the FT line when he normally shoots in the 80%.  I'm saying, and many others are, that Embiid is doing really well considering the help he has and if the Sixers keep it up, the MVP is his. It seems unlikely that the Sixers record will keep up now that they lost one of their greatest floor spacers in Seth Curry.  Jokic, as much as I love him, is on a losing team right now. If Denver turn it around, he's definitely in the conversation.  Narrative does play a role in electing a MVP and I think a lot of people, myself included, want to see LeBron get another MVP before he retires akin to what Kareem did. KD had a case to win MVP himself off of narrative until Harden joined the Nets. Giannis is still the monster that he is, but will voter fatigue kick in for him? Mitchell the star player of the first seed right now. As it stands KD and Jokic are out of the race. It's just LeBron, Embiid, Mitchell, Giannis, and Kawhi. Embiid and LeBron, imo, have the best overall case but if the Sixers lose more games are Seth recovers from Covid, then LeBron and Mitchell are the runner-up. Hell, Mitchell might just win it if the Jazz keep up their performance due to being the best player on the best team."
Paul George kinda resembles Rudy Gay. They could be cousins
"Sure because you know Paul George personally huh? and Paul George has never cane close to reaching Kanye levels of stupidity and narcissism, so that's a pretty shit comparison."
lol paul george is about to miss like 7 games...AD is still better and when he plays Lakers blow teams out while lebron alone has been taken to overtime by bad teams....lol what? Embiid only has Simmons who is playing poor aside from defense and averaging 29/11/3 on 50/37/85 and Jokic is dropping 30-40 each night...have no idea how lebron is front runner...media and reddit are legit in love with lebron..you can show all the stats and impact of Jokic/Embiid/Kawhi and they ignore it
I'd think Kawhi would be in the convo if Paul George wasn't having the season of his life right now on 51/48/91 on 24/6/5 with relatively equal +/-.   LeBron got AD tho AD playing like trash relative to his standards. Mfer playing like he's in his 18th season right now.  Embiid has Simmons who does what he does very well but what he can't do he REALLY can't do  Jokic should definitely get it if his team had more wins because God damn does he not have help out there.
In 2013 he had a game winning buzzer beater in the ECF over future Clipper Paul George  And hit the dagger in game 7 of the finals over future Clipper Kawhi Leonard   I think you mean 2011
"Lavine has a lower TOV% than James Harden, Ben Simmons, Paul George, Kyle Lowry, Lamelo and Trae Young and is only two spots behind Lebron. So no, I wouldn't say the advanced metrics show this."
Do u feel the same about Paul George?
"I’ll be honest, personal preference though, it’s Paul George. I have a pair of PG 2.5’s, and the PlayStation ones? Sheesh. Some of his kicks are so fire."
Paul George was going to the ECF and taking it to Miami LeBron in his first 6 season...  Giannis also went to the ECF in his 6th season and won mvp.
Paul George sends his regards
"Throw in Giannis in there as the back to back MVP. And to lesser extents, Jimmy Butler and Paul George. SF position at its peak."
Well if it’s Paul George he’s shooting over he’ll make it.
PAUL GEORGE BAD   HAHA CLIPPERS  PLS UPVOTE ME
"Im trying to think of a slash first combo forward (3/4) that can shoot threes and can shoot fts efficiently. Granger wasn’t as physical but i reckon a mix of granger, kawhi, and paul george minus the midrange game and a little less smooth offensively but boy, Grant IS smooth. This is what surprised me the most, him being smooth offensively and still having a respectable TS% as the no.1 option (!!!) crazy leap indeed"
"When it's Paul George (heh, more like PG13% amirite??) this sub is too busy nursing a hate boner of course"
Where was the love when Paul George said he’s had mental issues? Oh right we run a double standard in here.
"When has anyone since Paul George left acted like the pacers were anymore then a second round exit? The sixers are usually predicted to be a top 3 seed, don’t meet expectations, and lose early. Although you guys do look better this year."
"How is Giannis losing to the eventual champions (in the conference finals no less) chocking while Harden's losing to the eventual champions isn't?  I get that the Warriors were a super team but the fact remains that Harden never actually reached the finals as the best player of his team, same with Paul George BTW. It seems as if people's prior overrating of Giannis makes them think that he is now worse than he actually is.  BTW only Kawhi and KD are legit above him because they won rings as the best players on their team. Giannis punked Kyrie in the post season and had no more nor less success than the other two.   Only Kawhi and KD should be taken seriously because they reached the finals multiple times and won 2 FMVPs each, they are simply on a different level than the others when it matters. I am not convinced about *any* of the others until they prove me otherwise."
Yeah I'm not saying he doesn't deserve his money. I'm just saying I think it's wacky that Paul George has made a quarter of a billion dollars.
"I see your point, but in another comment you were comparing Melo unfavorably to CP3 and Westbrook, but those 2 players had Blake Griffin, KD, Paul George, and Harden as their teammates in their primes.   The rosters around Melo in New York were unbelievably bad - every year. If you look them up it makes Anthony Davis' teammates in New Orleans look amazing and he couldnt do much there either. There's a reason why they went 4-40 without him after he had knee surgery during the season.  It wasn't just Melo taking a lot of money. Knicks are infamous for their poor management and decisions, and even after he left they haven't been able to attract any good free agents.  Again, I see your point but CP3 and Westbrook have had way better teammates so it's apples to oranges"
"I may be in the minority here, but I'd love to see Paul George turn up in the playoffs and win a ring. He's very enjoyable to watch when he's cooking."
If Kobe was doing a Jordan impression Paul George is doing a bad Tracy McGrady impression
"MDs in medical research save millions of lives. The difference between someone who discovers a therapeutic breakthrough and someone who does not is an immeasurably larger gulf than whether a bench player jumps two inches less or shoots 5 percent worse than Paul George. Entertainment and medicine being seriously compared is laughable. You could pull 50 people out of pick up games, market the shit out of them, put their shoes on shelves, broadcast their games and say they are ""entertaining millions"" as well. There will always be another Paul George but good luck conjuring up a Jonas Salk. We have placed far too much value on entertainment at the expense of much greater priorities."
"A single MD can only help a few people at a time. Paul George can entertain millions at a time. In addition, there's a huge dropoff in performance if you replace Paul George with a random NBA player, there's not that big a dropoff if you replaced an infectious disease MD with any random one."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"I mean you can put them together because they are opposites, I find people in the middle who can generally do both but maybe not to an extreme level more fun to watch, i.e paul george, Kawhi etc. Also my main issue with luka is foul baiting."
"Paul George has had 1 bad playoff series, Lillard has had 2 good ones"
"Even if they specifically tell your team to wait for FA for them it can be risky (Paul George, unfinished business, etc.)"
kawhi but y’all bullied paul george and russell westbrook into that for me too
"I guess I could be wrong, just going off 10+ years of watching both consistently. Paul George has the more well rounded game, but if the game is on the line and I need one of those two to take a shot, it’s dame 10 times out of 10"
I don’t know why but it blows my mind that a doofus like Paul George has made a quarter of a billion dollars.
"lmao FUCK KD but this is adorablelol  &gt;Durant said he started to feel better about his decision during his time with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  “I was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,” he told Steinberg. “In my profession, that’s the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‘Congrats, man, do your thing,’ and Paul George was like, ‘Congrats, man, I am happy for you,’ and Kevin Love was like, ‘Shoot, do what you gotta do,’ that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.”"
Not Houston or okc but ‘Paul George fans’ and Russ fans
"OK I'd say Brown isn't a ""franchise"" player. He is probably top 20 right now and will end up top 15.  But is Paul George a franchise player because thta is what I reckon JB will be.  Shai has more potential imo but is worse right now. So if I knew I was going to get another high draft pick JB all day. But if not I'd go with tank Commander Shai hope he develops and get myself some nice teammates."
If JR drew a shit I’m sure we’d all like it.    These were made by Paul George.
"Well there's Reddick who will pass him, Klay would have passed him if he never got injured, and there's an outside chance Paul George passes him as well before he gets to 6th  I don't think it would have been likely though"
"&gt;&gt;Superstar  &gt;C'mon bruh he's not even the most important player on that team.  You replied to this, w/ all of this:   &gt;Man the disrespect is unreal. As a team we lost against Denver in last year's playoffs but yall so quick to forget Donovan had a historically great series- he scored 57, 30, 20, 51, 30, 44, 22. He has never missed the playoffs and knocked off Paul George and Westbrook in his rookie year. He is an all-star. Yall need to start acting the part.  What is the correlation? Did I call Donny a bum? I said he's not the most important player on that team, you didn't refute the single point I made, and then you add in ""he's an all-star, yall need to start acting the part"" for whatever reason, as if me saying he's not a superstar is blaphemous.  Do you get it now? I genuinely can't tell if you're a troll or deadass just confused"
"Man the disrespect is unreal. As a team we lost against Denver in last year's playoffs but yall so quick to forget Donovan had a historically great series- he scored 57, 30, 20, 51, 30, 44, 22.

"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
they’d probably need to beat the clippers twice for me to put them in the same tier as the lakers clippers cuz the clippers are missing paul george right now
"Do you think tanking teams don’t do this? Derrick Fisher got blasted for winning a bunch of games at the end of the 2015 season. Gilbert Arenas explained when he was a sophomore on the Warriors they would sub him out when he plays too good because they wouldn’t be able to pay him. Gilbert circumvented that in his Gilbert Arenas way and said if they kept doing that he was gonna shoot every time he touched the ball. Miles Plummer was signed to give Hayes a pick and roll partner and still be bad enough, combine with Blake breaking down and there you go. Can’t win when your pf is broken physically, and your center can only play basketball the way he is taught and he has the touch of Andre Drummond and fluidity of a baby gazelle. Jerami Grant playing like same age Paul George while super amazing isn’t gonna do shit. Not when you need HOF verticality badge Roy Hibbert to win games. If they had a legit center (not Andre he would try to be like Jokic and look as coordinated as Plumlee yuck. (But if he played like Deandre Jordan then but I don’t think he can mentally right now) Pistons got the Lakers because outside of LeBron there isn’t the post scoring needed when a team like the Pistons has so many solid or good wing defenders."
"Bird wasn't good. He got into it with Paul George through the media and was telling the media PG needs to play power forward without ever actually talking to Paul about it. PG didn't want to play power forward and was one of the reasons he asked for a trade.  Bird also fired Frank Vogel because he wanted 'new blood', then promoted an assistant coach."
"Just beat Paul George for us again okay?   Like, I won't even be sad if you guys win it all. Incredible franchise and very likable superstar"
"Said it above: What’s a harder shot, a turnaround fadeaway (Kobe’s signature shot) or a 30 footer (Curry’s signature shot) ?  Clearly the 30 footer, it’s worth more points. If a 30 footer was easier than a post fadeaway, Kobe would’ve just shot 30 footers. To put it another way: sooo many players have a midrange fadeaway in their repertoire: Kawhi, Bron, Wiggins, Irving, Paul George, Tatum, Brown, etc  Almost no one has the 30 footer in their bag: Steph, Lillard, Trae... none of which shoot it at near the proficiency that Steph does.  Another way to put it: Steph shoots 43% from 3 (again, the hardest shot in basketball, that’s why it’s worth the most points). Kobe shot 45% from the FIELD. Curry makes the hardest shot at near the proficiency that Kobe shot it.  Then you throw in Curry’s superior handles, passing ability, and under the rim finishing ability, and it’s gotta be Steph"
&gt; Lebron was never trading kyrie for paul george lol  But he was.
"Since Tatum emulates his game after Paul George, it only makes sense that Ingles fathers him too."
Lebron was never trading kyrie for paul george lol.

It happens with Paul George all the time
basically paul george vs middleton/utah hayward  I'd say 1 tier probably separates them. if you're good enough your market won't hold you down too much
Thanks for the input &amp; downvote pussy . I looked up the info to help you  You asked about fg% then brought up pg13 having a higher true fg%. Why bring up true shooting %. Nobody said anything about paul george
"Melo- 6x all NBA, Probably shouldn’t be on the list in retrospect, but I’m not going to change it now.  Dantley-3 seasons of 30 ppg and a known leader of men who helped mentor the Bad Boy pistons into the team they ended up becoming.   King- 4x all NBA One of the greatest scorers in NBA history and was able to bounce back from injury again and again.   Championships are a team thing and with few exceptions, I don’t give individual players a ton of credit for team accomplishments. Kawhi has only ever played on amazing teams. San Antonio, the Raptors, and the Clippers (to a lesser extent). His run with the Raptors was incredible, but he was hardly the only good player on his team. If Marc Gasol doesn’t play as well as he did against Embiid, the Raptors lose that series with the 76ers. If he doesn’t have the dogged determination of Kyle Lowry, they probably don’t beat anyone. In San Antonio, he had 2-3 hall of fame players on his team and a top 10 coach of all time. He has Paul George and a solid bench with the Clippers. We’ll see what happens there.   If he continues to play amazingly, he’ll be on my list. If he fades with age, he might still get on my list."
I mean Paul George also likes to trash talk way more so it makes him an easier target for getting clowned on
"Where's the repost of LeBron hitting the side of the backboard? According to the internet, Paul George is the only player in NBA history that has done this before"
"[Likewise, here are some incredible Paul George highlights.](https://youtu.be/4TruRZhWRCY)"
Paul George liked this
Paul George also did it on the Playoffs in a do-or-die game. 🤷‍♂️
Paul George does this and its on the front page with a dozen awards
lebron doing his best paul george impression
id put chris paul over mitchell rn and over paul george i might put sabonis? but thats only cuz of the games played
"&gt; iso  isolation, meaning one-on-one. on some plays you will notice the guy with the ball working with a screen, other times they clear a whole side of the court and just let him try to beat his man. that would be iso.  &gt;3&amp;D guys  just means guys that can shoot threes and play defense well. valuable archetype of player, because everybody needs good defenders and if you can just stand there and hit open threes you are valuable on offense. it's basically the ideal mold for a role player.  &gt;wing defenders  wings are a pretty broad term for guys that play the 2 or 3 (usually 3s probably?). bigger than your small guards, but not big guys that sit in the paint. lebron, paul george, kawhi, jayson tatum type players.  &gt; off ball players  just meaning they do a lot of work without the ball. creating separation so you can shoot is huge in basketball, some guys are very good at creating this without the ball in their hands.   if you have any other specific questions feel free to ask.  &gt;Which player's highlights would you recommend to get me really hooked on the game? Damian Lillard's half court game winners are absolutely electric imo.  my favorite non-sun to watch is kyrie irving. probably the best dribbling skills in the history of the league, and just one of the smoothest players to ever do it. i've heard people say before that he plays the game in cursive and i think that fits his playstyle  https://youtu.be/HeK6Z-OR7gY?t=43  one of my favorite highlight videos of all time"
He wasn't a traditional lane clogger and rim protector. His defensive worth came from roaming all over.  He could switch between being paul george on the perimeter one second then go back to contesting shots the next but he definitely lagged behind a guy like shaq in straight up shot blocking. Doesn't mean he wasn't the better defender though
"It seems like a guy who is 6’6,” 225 who has the same skill set as a guy who’s 6’2” 190 will just end up being more successful in the NBA. But once you’ve established yourself, it shouldn’t matter as long as you are successful. Chris Paul, AI, those guys are considered all time greats, but that’s because they were successful in spite of their height. You could argue that it would be tough to win a title with a smaller guy as your best player, but Steph Curry would beg to differ. And even when it’s a bigger guy, they always have help anyway. Lebron is amazing, but didn’t win a title until he had either a future hof (wade, ad) or a super star in their own right (love, Irving). I firmly believe the blazers could win a title with someone like Paul George as their second best player, and Lillard as the first. Sorry, mini rant about player height over."
Paul George fucked Lisa Ann and I still don’t know if I respect it or am disgusted by it. What do you guys think
"Paul George was a freak back then, had too much free time in Indiana"
Start: Paul George  Bench: Jimmy Butler  Cut: Tatum
Start Paul George   Bench Jayson Tatum   Cut jimmy butler
"Damn this is really hard, if we ONLY take this season into account that I’d have to start Paul George because his numbers and efficiency are surreal this season. Then it’s hard to choose between Tatum and Jimmy since Jimmy has been sidelined for the majority of the season so far but we’ve seen what he can do in the finals last season. If it’s really only this season and we forget everything that happened in the past I’d go with; start: PG; bench: Tatum; cut: Jimmy"
“He gets Paul George to get on skates”
"Keeping in mind it's only 1 game and I'm only talking about 1 play, but there was another possession where the offensive rebound actually went to Rudy, but it was a little contested and he just batted it straight to Paul George.  I really thought Rudy could've had the rebound entirely on his own.  His hands are big enough for it, and the Clippers player was certainly fighting but they weren't totally reaching the ball whereas Gobert had great access to it.  But instead he just tried batting it, and George was watching for that."
The anti Paul George
"Pacers: Rik Smits, Domantas Sabonis, Paul George, Reggie Miller, Vern Fleming"
"How would you not take Kawhi + PG + a great supporting cast who are all playing really well and have a solid offensive system. AD is not better than Paul George in this scenario.   Like I’m not sure if you‘ve watched AD this year, but hasn’t been good(for his standards). He’s getting out rebounded extremely frequently, has dropped 10% in his free throws, and is taking(and missing) contested midrange shots. His points pretty much all come from easy dump offs from lebron.   If that’s the AD the Lakers get, then no the Clippers and Jazz are definitely favored"
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"Seriously, I think people just have a hate boner for the clippers and it comes out in things like that and saying Paul George isn’t a good second option because he had a bad bubble. I loved this game despite our rocky first half and think a WCF of clips and jazz would be amazing basketball and it’s what I’m hoping for"
"GG Clips! I’m not gonna stress over this loss, tons of fight against an elite team. They played great defense, hit a lot of big shots, and we couldn’t get things going offensively pretty much the whole first half. Three ball wasn’t there, layups were lipping out, it was tough to watch. Would’ve loved to see more effort from us on the boards too, Clippers got way too many Oreb. Sloppy hands leading to turnovers, just an off night against a great opponent.  All of that said, Paul fucking George pushes off with his arm on almost every possession, it is egregious and unbelievable that it’s not getting called. Like I couldn’t rage quickly enough in the game thread because it kept happening over and over, even Clipper flairs were saying “I can’t believe they didn’t call that.” Obviously you can’t pin the whole game on that, but still very annoying as a fan watching him get away with that over and over."
"Paul george was really trying to give the Jazz the win for his dad Ingles, terrible mistakes in the last 2minutes"
"If I had a dollar for every time Paul George pushed off I’d have enough to by the Clippers.  GG Clipper bros, it was good to actually see these teams at full strength."
"Paul George with the dumbass foul at the end of the game, then proceeds to bitch about the call."
Paul George. A couple of dumb plays at the e d
Paul George. Couple of dumb plays towards the end
Paul George in playoff form
"lol during the run where the Clippers pulled away in this game, it was from scoring by Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, and Lou Williams.   But sure, let's be lazy and pretend the only guys who hit buckets in the 4th were Paul George and Kawhi."
Draft Kawhi and Paul George
"I'd like to bitch about the game. Kawhi leonard is very good at basket ball, so is paul george. I still think morris and beverly are trash though."
"Look we got outplayed tonight, I ain't mad at the L  But oh my god these paul george pushoffs are just maddening"
Paul george literally has a broken shoulder every post all star break but lets gloss over that since AD is the only injury prone superstar in the league
"I dont even know what this dude is on. Embiid has been injury prone since he was in the league, kawhi has his tendinitis. Paul george always has a shoulder problem after the all star break. Kyrie literally didnt play theone season with the Celtics and last year with Brooklyn and we know what happened with kd, but nooo lets single out AD."
"I respect letting them play, but that Paul George push off? Come on mannnnnn"
That's like the third uncalled offensive foul committed by Paul George tonight.
Fuck Paul George.
Fucking Paul George man
Is Paul George good again?
Did Paul George just make a fingering motion? LMFAO.
"I’m telling you, If Paul George keeps this level of play, not even the Jazz will have answers."
Paul George is such a great defender
"Lol that sequence reminded me of that play in the 2018 playoffs when Paul George drove, saw Rudy Gobert in the paint, and immediately did a literal 180"
Now we just need KD to pick Paul George
Clippers announced Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were playing after being questionable to play
"Please tell me which nba players got over a million votes more than him despite not getting nearly as much attention.   He got the 18th most fan votes despite basically being a rookie on the team with a bottom tier record. Unless the nba / media thought that the current set of superstars will play forever then it makes perfect sense why they would heavily market one of the most exciting young players in the league.   I also don’t think they feel comfortable yet in their next generation of stars. Sure you have Luka, but then you have a bunch of players that in my opinion still have some questions on if they could be face of the league type guys. Keep in mind we’re coming out of a generation that had Steph, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden, Dame, AD, Westbrook, Paul George, and because he transcends generations Lebron.   Guys like Tatum, Trey Young, Donovan Mitchell, etc should definitely be there, but after Luka its yet to be determined if any of that generation can reach Steph / KD levels of superstardom (Lebron really doesn’t count) and the NBA is clearing hoping that Zion can"
I'm convinced Paul George is Chris Haynes's source in the Clippers for all the Montrez/Doc turmoil he wrote about last year since he defended PG a LOT in the podcast. Talking about how he looked like the MVP in the bubble.. WTF CHRIS?!
It makes no sense. It’s like comparing Paul George to Lebron and I’m not kidding.
"Yep, the next year was Dwight and the Superman cape and then a handful of good dunks that were ruined by props - like the Paul George glow-in-the-dark dunk - and a bunch that were just stupid - Jeremy Evans dunking over a painting of himself??  It wasn't great before this either because you had contests like Birdman getting 37 attempts at a mediocre dunk, but the props were a mess."
"Yeah I think you mean the overall game. Because [this can be done on pbpstats](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy/nba?0Exactly3OnFloor=202331,202695,201587&amp;TeamId=1610612746&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Type=Player&amp;StarterState=5v5,5v4,4v5,4v4).   This for ex are hte games this year where the Clippers have PG/Batum/Kawhi on the court and the Clippers and their opponents both have at least 4 starters on the court. Paul George is at 34 pts/100 poss for ex in this. You can even add a date or opponent filter."
Paul George hits a buzzer beater  in the playoffs
"If you're talking about the team suddenly forming now, then they wouldn't have much of a chance. Maybe 5%.   If you're talking about if Yugoslavia had never broken up, and these guys had been playing together on the national team for the last 5+ years, then they'd have a great chance, around 30%.   Team USA often underperforms, relative to their talent level. A lot of that is the guys on the team don't play together much, and the roster has constant turnover because guys don't want to commit multiple summers. As a result the team rarely builds much on-court chemistry, and has to rely on individual talent or very basic plays like high P&amp;R.   Coach K wanted to build a Team USA ""pipeline"" that started with HS players, who would be on the American team throughout their college and pro careers - mimicking many European national team setups - but it never went anywhere. International play just isn't that important to Americans. The Olympics are important to Americans, but not any other FIBA games. And FIBA certainly isn't important enough for Americans to take on the injury risk (eg, Paul George) and wear and tear which can impact their real job, which is playing in the NBA."
Yeah bro Paul George nailing threes brings out the worst in people
Hmm you prolly disagree with what Paul George/Beverly did tho. Shit talking ≠ Being disrespectful about a mans career. Definitely unwarranted.
Like how Paul George is Joe Ingles’ son
Yawn.  Lillard is playing without McCollum.  Steph is playing with a lottery team with all centers injured.  Clipper is playing without both Kawhi and Paul George.  And they all still manage to win games.  Quit whining.
"“Paul George, listen to me when I say this. You are trash.”"
"&gt;Clippers lost to the Kings  And? It's a RS game without Paul George and Bev, who's our best guard defender."
"These are neat little facts, but media awards are not a statistics, nor do they change the dominant stats Utah is putting up right now.  Like, Rudy Gobert was All NBA 3rd team last year, are you seriously implying that Utah's Championship hopes are dashed simply because there were 2 better centers than Rudy Gobert?  Utah is a well balanced team with a lot of weapons from a lot of different places.  You seem to like media awards a lot-- this team has a legitimate shot at COTY, DPOY, and 6MOTY right now, and none of those awards even involve Donovan Mitchell, who has already shown he can flip a switch for the Playoffs.   A much worse version of this Jazz team has already taken out MVP's and All NBA players like Westbrook and Paul George before.  Just last year, they were 2 points away from beating the team who made the WCF while missing a 20ppg scorer.  I dunno, man, I just feel like people saying Utah isn't a contender because they don't have these cute ass media awards this far into the season is just a really dumb take at this point."
Think Paul George deserves to be there more than kawhi if you are picking a clipper player. Dame missing out is tough but luka numbers are too insane not to be there
"Paul George Is always blaming his inconsistent playoff performances on his injuries he’s not a cyborg, but no player is. Not even KawhI  Each player will deal with some injury, and AD isn’t the only player who’s injury prone. Embiid, Simmons, Steph, Kyrie, and Kawhi have all been injured during the playoffs"
Cmon bruh the paul george hate has gone too far this ain’t a debate
Any contending team without their second best player won’t make the finals  76ers without Simmons? Nope Lakers without AD? Nope Jazz without Gobert? Nope Clippers without Paul George? Nope Bucks without Middleton? Nope  You can say the same about literally every team about making the playoffs the only team that still can make the NBA finals is the Nets but that’s cause they have a big 3 with 2 top 5 players with another top 10-15 player as the 3rd best player
"Lavine, Paul George is mentally soft. flounders in the big moments."
3 on 5 if both Paul and George are in the game during the playoffs.
I’m a Bulls fan but Paul George...
"Being a playoff team that has little championship probability with a guy who’s going to be clowned constantly is basically just a worse version of the Carmelo era, so overall it’s not worth it.  Paul George is not moving the line for us to be a contender, we need more than that either development wise or player wise, so realistically there’s no reason I need to take him over Lavine if it realistically just means more negative headlines.    It’s honestly that simple, the only time a better and more controversial player is worth it is if they’re going to vastly improves your odds."
Paul George is good on both ends of the floor and has been to the playoffs you dingus
"That’s not what I’m saying though, what I’m saying is as somebody’s who had to wait 20 years to be competitive, and I think like it’s safe to say Paul George isn’t going to single-handedly drag us to the finals, that I’m comfortable in the level of success we’re at and becoming a little better and nobody bullying our players because they’re press chum is more enjoyable for me as a fan than being still not at the level I want with a guy who’s going to rub honey on himself and try to fight the NY Post bear.  That’s really all there is here."
"I’ll be the first to say that Lavine is amazing and doesn’t get the recognition he deserves, but Paul George is just on a completely different level"
I love Lavine but it’s Paul George and it’s honestly not particularly close
"As an asset for rebuilding team, then Lavine. But if I'm a contender, it's definitely Paul George"
how are you guys not done with shitting on paul george
Imagine doc is the coach and Paul George ends up on team Durant
Paul George
"For this season, Paul George.  If we get to keep them for multiple seasons, Lavine because of age. PG is 30 while Lavine is just entering his prime."
Paul George most def
Fuck Paul George but Paul George
Paul George is exactly the kind of player the Rockets have been going after but his injury was too long ago.
Paul George you fucking nephew
Absolutely biased but probably still Paul George
Paul George.  And I hate Paul George
"Defense  So Paul George. Lavine plays lost on defense, doesn’t know what he’s doing."
Paul George
this is clearly just a George Paul thing
that would be paul george
I think so. Obviously Paul George has been better than AD this year but he’s a lock and he’s only played 20 games.
The turned on him when Paul George was playing well and he’s team was losing and he was doing bad
Paul George should not be able to play
"The stats mean nothing when you’re relating it to game script especially in regards to best and most consistent teams in the league. The Nets have underperformed since the Harden trade. I find it easy to look at stats and prove the narrative you more pushing but a Lebron/Joel Embiid have had a better year and bigger impact, as has a Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry, or even Paul George when he’s not busy dealing with COVID issues. So those stats are impressive for sure but you’re not gonna tell me that Domantas Sabonis hasn’t meant more to his team than Harden has at this gesture which is what MVP awards are mostly tailored around."
Being an elite 3&amp;D doesn't mean being elite at both. Very few players are elite at both and none of them are just 3&amp;D. Take Paul George for example. And Trent himself is showing that he's more than a 3&amp;D.
"To be honest if it was 2 years ago or more, I’d have LOVED to see Russ and Dame.  I think all the players that Dame has “beef” with according to the media would all be incredible teammates.  Russ and Paul George being the top of the list"
"yeah but Paul George is also the one defending the best players on the other teams so he has to deal with the tiredness of that while attacking.  you can stretch anything to try to shift arguments in your players favor, but a comparision was never my intention.  i don’t know why you had to defend LaVine as if I made a diss on him, or attack PG here.  i just wanted to point out another nearly unprecedented split that’s going on in the league right now.  can’t believe you are so salty, downvoted my comment and then went ın a rant about it. how insecure are you?  relax, get a life"
Yup.  Play looks similar to Bron's game winner v Paul George in that heat/pacers series.
"Bradley Beal was inefficient in college, as was Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, and Zach Lavine. I’m obviously not saying he’s going to be close to those guys, but he’s going to be more efficient then he is now. How efficient, I don’t know and neither do you. It’s incredibly ignorant to say Ant is the next Andrew Wiggins this early into his career. Just let him atleast finish the season before saying he’s a bust"
Paul George would be better though. But I’d take any talent
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
but Klay is 42.3% on 7.7 attempts a game in the last 5. 3.4 % is actually a big difference. thats Steph Curry to D lo difference this season lol  you should tell more people Paul George is a better shooter than Reggie and Ray Allen tho
"Come off it, the gap between Klay and George in shooting is massive. I agree that most teams are taking Paul George unless you're a team with multiple dominant ball handlers like the Warriors or Nets, but acting like there's not much in it when it comes to shooting isn't big is ridiculous."
Paul George is shooting 40% over the last five seasons on almost 8 3PA. The difference in shooting between him and Thompson doesn't even come close to making up for the difference between the two in shot creation (very important skill) and defense (also very important and valuable regardless of team).
"I would take prime, healthy Paul George over prime, healthy Klay Thompson"
top 10 shooter ever? ive literally never heard anyone refer to Paul George as this
Klay Thompson won a ring averaging 15.0 PPG on 50.7% TS for an entire playoff run. He got to play next to two of the greatest offensive players ever for 2.5 of his playoff runs. Paul George would've made the Warriors even better than they already were in Thompson's place.
"People are gonna say that most teams would because they like Klay as a person and dislike Paul George.  The reality is Paul George being able to play *both* on and off ball at a high level instead of being limited to *only* off ball like Klay makes him inherently more valuable. PG can do what Klay does, Klay can’t do what PG does.  Add to that PG being a better defender and I think very few teams would choose Klay."
"None of them. Paul George is a high volume, 40+ three-point shooter who is a better overall offensive player. The gap between George and Thompson on the shooting front isn't big, and George is so much better as a self-creator and defender that it's not even close overall."
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
"Oh? you're a clippers fan?  I assumed you were a Raptors fan because of the name, plus I saw T so I didnt even notice it was Tampa bay at first. I'm not trying to insult your team, Kawhi as much as I dislike how he acted, especially the baby sitting in the corner routine, he's a great pickup for any team. However, personally Paul George just sucks in the post season. I mean its easy to root against him because he talks so much shit and then hurts his team with turnovers and a lot of missed shots. I believe if this was Pacers Paul George then the clippers would be a REAL problem for the west, but current PG13 just I think gonna hurt the team again."
You’re Anthony Davis/Paul George in 2019. Lebron/Kawhi already on the Lakers/Clippers.  You think about joining him but realize you’re gonna be competing with your teammate for an all star spot for 3-4 more years. You might not make another all star team for several years. Making the all star team means a lot to you. You don’t think that will be factor in their decision making??
We're actually 2-1 vs the clippers in this season and last season. Paul George and Kawhi seem to struggle much more against us than we struggle against them.
Maybe Paul george.
"Zion did not Booker's spot since he got one of the front court spots. The wild cards were Mitchell and Paul George.  So for Booker to make it (ignoring injury replacements), you have to take out one of CP3, Lillard, Mitchell and George."
KD should pick Paul George as his first reserve (after the obligatory teammate pick) just to fuck with him
"From what I understand, Zion wasn't the wildcard, he'd need to be replaced by a front court player.  If you want to get Booker in, you need to replace a guard, or one of the wildcards. I believe the wild cards were Donovan Mitchell and Paul George."
Bit better than Paul George wherever that is
"But he might have to coach is least favorite son, Paul George"
"Yeah I forget how often Davis missed the playoffs, I shouldn't have included him. We're just going to have to disagree about Jokic's playoff scoring because I just don't think that's a large enough sample size against enough different opponents to draw any concrete conclusions from. To me you are what you are in the regular season and then in the playoffs you usually play more minutes. Most good to great players see their raw counting numbers go up in the playoffs die to increased minutes.   Jokic is having an amazing season (he's second in the MVP race in my book) and his scoring and efficiency have both sharply raised. And you can see he is playing about four minutes per game more as well. Looking at his numbers in the regular season I didn't see anything last season in the bubble that surprised me with Jokic. I knew he could score more than 20 a game if he just played more minutes. And he was clutch in the regular season so I was not surprised by his performances in the playoffs in that aspect either.   Basically I think people put too much stock into playoff performances that are smaller sample size than the much larger 82 (normal) game series against a variety of opponents and in a variety of different situations. In the playoffs players can go on hot streaks and win a series, or cold streaks and lose one. Same with Paul George, he was ass in the playoffs this past year but his body of work told me that that was an anomaly and not a long term concern.   Comparing the two players they're both high level scorer a especially for their positions. It's Embiid's ability to play bully ball in the post and draw fouls from there that separates them imo. He scores more in three fewer minutes this season and this season is by far the closest the two have been in scoring. They are both shooting the lights out from all over the court.   Obviously Jokic's playmaking and Embiid's defense are well known and don't need too much discussion. It really depends on what you personally want from your center."
"Jimmy Butler got traded, Paul George got traded twice, Mike Conley got dealt. There's been plenty of big names that they had the salary and assets to get and would fill a need but they didn't. Obviously we have incomplete info, but I don't think saying ""who should they get"" is really ever fair today.   Also, look how easily the Sixers improved this year by minor roster changes (plus obviously Embiid going nuts but I think their improved spacing has really helped).  The Nuggets rolled back a worse roster than last year when they were a few games away from the finals last year. I feel like its fair to question that."
"Wait, how is Paul George a wildcard?  Paul George should be in the MVP race, not a wildcard lol."
Definitely Paul George
Zion wasn't the wildcard ffs. How hard is it to comprehend. Wildcards were Donovan Mitchell and Paul George. Whom are you replacing between these 2.
So OKC overall benefited from getting Paul George. Clippers have built a contender getting him too.
Paul George is that you?
Paul George frowning at this comment
"Nah I’m not mad about that, dude just hit a crazy shot. Idc who it is, I’ll let a dude put up a 30ft step back 3 with 2 hands in his face anytime they want it. Just at the end of the day good offense will always beat good defense.  Just like Paul George said, it’s a bad shot. Just the issue for us is that sometimes bad shots go in"
Good thing they've literally never considered Paul George a guard at any point during his career!
I forgot about Bradley Beal so u are right about that.  Paul George is definitely the 2 of the Clippers. Idk why they had him as a FrountCourt candidate for MVP but he definitely is the SG  1- Pat Bev   2- Paul George  3- Kawhi  4- Batum  5- Ibaka
"It's just a gimmick. Might as well start calling Giannis, Paul George point guards."
doesn't mean shit to paul george if the cap gets rolled back
"No, he wasn't Paul George was."
"Paul George, Galloway, Bertans, Lavine, Joe Harris are a few that come to mind"
Well yeah that's where I got it from. And Zion made it over Paul George probably due to PG missing games (which I personally don't agree with)
"I haven’t seen that cited anywhere but one CBS Sports article. If that is true though, that is even more ludicrous because Zion has literally 0 argument over Paul George."
Devin Booker over Paul George  Trae Young over James Harden
These Paul George minutes restrictions be killin me
"Paul George career stats, regular season to playoffs:  PTS/REB/AST: 20.1/6.4/3.4 --&gt; 20.1/7.1/3.8  FG%/3P%/TS%: .436/.385/.568 --&gt; .419/.356/.557"
Why did AD get it but Paul George misses out?
Paul George is a wild card? What are the coaches looking at?
It's been awhile since we saw the charge right at the basket repeatedly version of Paul George.
"Which of the guards would you take out. There must be three frontcourt player (AD Zion and Gobert) 2 guards and 2 wild cards. So you have to get rid of PG, dame, donovan mitchell or cp3. Dame and mitchell are so easy. They have to be there. And as a suns guy i guess you probably arent insisting him over cp3. I guess that leaves Paul George. And i dont know the comparison super well. Im just leaving this here so you know what you are arguing. Its not book vs ad or zion."
"Paul George was loudly called a p***y during the game with the nets which led to some pushing and shoving and the refs did nothing. Which I’m glad about, but yeah the games are reffed very inconsistently when it comes to this stuff."
I saw the ghost of Paul George
They would be borderline warriors level if you threw in Paul George
Chris Paul George Carl Landry Fields
"I don’t agree with Paul George or with Zion.  I’m not bugged by any of the East names, though there are East names that I would have chosen others for, but Paul George and Zion shouldn’t be All Stars in the West, end of story."
"This season book has a winning record against every reserve in the west, except paul george. What else does he have to do to get an all star spot that isn't just injury replacement"
Missed opportunity to just say Chris Paul George
"Small forwards are front court players. Paul George is a small forward. That means PG/Gobert/AD or PG/Gobert/Zion would be the 3 front court reserves, meaning at least one of Zion or AD would be one of the two wild card reserve spots"
Paul George is listed as a small forward. That means at least one of Zion or AD was a wild card.
"Paul George. He plays like Tmac, smooth af"
How on earth is Paul George an all star?
"it depends on what they considered Paul George, if PG was treated as a SG, Zion wasn't a wildcard, if he was considered a SF, Zion could have been a wildcard"
"Wrong. Per Yahoo,   Western Conference G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  FC: Anthony Davis  FC: Rudy Gobert  FC: Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: Paul George"
"We haven't had an injury replacement yet so as far as we can tell it goes  Required Replacement back-up 5 (2 Guards/3 frontcourt) -   (Paul George?)/Lillard/Gobert/AD/Zion  2 wild card spots (CP3?)/(Mitchell?)  I assume Lillard, barely losing to Doncic, was easily one of the required backups  That means he could have only replaced either PG, CP3, or Mitchell"
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"It's important to note that the coaches choose this. That's why I think Ben Simmons and CP3 are making it, because I think coaches value them. Anyway, here are my predictions:  **East**:  Harden, Brown, Randle, Sabonis, LaVine, Simmons, Tatum  **West**:  Lillard, George, Mitchell, Gobert, Paul, Davis, Booker.  Though I would not be surprised if Conley makes it due to coaches respect, or Williamson as an injury replacement for Davis"
Chris Paul George. You ain't slick Shams
Paul George has a smooth handle and jumper and overall aesthetically pleasing game. Love watching him play
&gt; Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.  Remind me how that turned out lmao
"Wade in 2013 shot 71% around the rim, Zion shoots 67% rn, there was a post about it, but it's hard to compare the two as for Wade he got set up by Bron allot and for zion we are in a era where scoring is much easier then the 2000s/early 2010s and there is better spacing  Wade was still the better slasher because eof his finesse, sure he was strong for a guard, but that's not what he relied on, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest slashers of all time, personally would only put young MJ or young LeBron over him  And given how many players developed a serviceable jumper or 3, it's easy to assume a talent such as pippen would, if you switched him with Paul George starting from Rookie year and had him develop from that point on, it would be basically the same player but better, always thought of PG as Pippen lite"
"If you think about it, every team that Westbrook has joined has made the other superstar better.   OKC - Westbrook helped to elevate KD to another level.   OKC - Paul George had his best, near-MVP season during his time with Westbrook   HOU - Harden had his best statistical year the year Russ was there.    WASH - Bradley Beal is having his best season of his career so far with the Wizards.   Not to say that Westbrook is the *sole* reason these guys played well, but it's definitely not a coincidence that they've all had some of their best seasons the year that Westbrook joined them."
"In a single 14 month span they got:  10 firsts (5 from clip, 2 from rox, 1 from Gallo, 1 from CP3, 1 from oubre) 2 first swaps (rox)  AND Shai  For Westbrook and Paul George both on max contracts. Psychotic gains"
Surprised I had to come this far down to find Paul George. He gets hated on but when he gets it going on offense it’s beautiful and there’s nothing he can’t do.
KP is not top 25.  Let's see. No order   LeBron Leonard Durant Curry  AD George  Harden Iriving Giannis Pascal  FVV Randle Young Booker Buttler  Bam Hero  Beal Jokic Murray Luka Embid Simmons  Lillard CJ Gobert  Mitchel Paul Tatum Brown KAT   Maybe more ..I got annoyed  of typing on my phone
Paul George deciding to change his own diaper
Paul George is so smooth when he plays. He has handles. He has a nice jumper.
"In his only playoff appearance he was the best player in a series with Kawhi and Paul George on the court.  I respect your opinion but personally I think Luka is going to go down as a top 10 player of all time barring injury, no 20 year old ever looked as good as he did last year except LeBron who's the 1st or 2nd best player ever.   I just don't want to see the narrative change in 15 years, ""Luka was already top 5 from the start and we all knew it"" when clearly it's an unpopular opinion right now."
The same gap between Harden and Paul George.
"Paul George is up there, but I really like watching Donovan Mitchell. His bounce, footwork, speed, all done so smoothly.  On the flip side, I love him so much but Jerami Grant's game isn't aesthetically pleasing. Effective, but not pretty."
Paul George
Both Lebron and Simmons in the open court have a beautiful gait. Paul George pull-ups are so slow and so smooth that they're really pleasing to watch
"I mean do they need any of those picks to turn into a player of his caliber though?  I mean, if the two best players they get out of those picks are more on Paul George and Kyle Lowry’s caliber and they get another superstar from some other means, I’d consider that a success for sure"
"How is that true?   OKC got Paul George trading Oladipo and Sabonis. We’re they not young?   What about Cousins being traded for a Hield based package   Hell Jimmy Butler was traded for 2 role players and the 76ers had him walk and they are still better than the Celtics. Only reason why they lost was because they actually had an injury to a star player preventing him from playing.  But yeah the Celtics have Langford, Edwards, and all the other 1st round picks they drafted in the last 5 years outside of the lotto that didn’t pan into anything."
They were right not to pursue Paul George at the very least. That dude is playoff cancer. At least ever since he got to OKC.
"Thunder got in a way better situation by trading for Paul George.   Raptors got in a way better situation by trading for Kawhi  Rockets became a contender trading for CP3 (and the Suns are looking like a fringe contender trading for him).   Even the 76ers became a contender trading for Jimmy Butler, Butler left in free agency (in a sign and trade) and the 76ers are still better than the Celtics.    You can say “they all would leave us” but there is a chance they don’t leave you, and all the teams that made big trades and lost their guys are in better situations for trading for those players."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Cowturd isn't wrong here though. They didn't aggressively pursue any of Harden, Kawhi, Paul George &amp; AD over the past couple of years despite having the assets to do so."
"Thank you people get way too obsessed over what guys position based on who they play with.   If Sabonis magically becomes a 4 then last year Bron was the best Pg in the nba, one of Lamelo or Terry is a sg, and the clippers have 3 traditional sfs starting that now all need new positions and Paul George takes a backcourt slot in the all star reserves."
"What big trade should they have made that they didn't? Keep in mind that Paul George, Kawhi, and AD both said they would not re-sign with any team not in LA, and the 2 that were traded elsewhere followed through on that promise even after one of them won a championship."
"Lol it’s funnier because he played well. When you dog a star player for their fuckup it’s funny (except Paul George, people here take that shit too far). When you dog a player playing badly it’s bullying"
"Happens every season with him, it's like a Paul George MVP narrative."
"RPM has Lebron and Curry way above the rest of the MVP contenders. Embiid is behind Giannis and Paul George too, and Jokic isn’t even top 10 in rpm.  If Lebron gets mvp, the advanced stats argument is his strongest case right now...Embiid and Jokic are the ones that make the case on traditional stats."
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
"I miss getting got by this meme. He looks so happy and he's such a good dude, so getting jingled was always a good time.  Unless you're Paul George, of course."
"In no particular order, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Mike Conley, And more. Not to say they don’t deserve an all star, but the west is to stacked for me to rank them above these guys."
"Westbrook, Paul George, and Melo"
"East: Harden, LaVine, Brown, Young, Tatum, Randle, Sabonis  West: Lillard, Mitchell, Paul, DeRozan, George, AD, Gobert, Zion (injury replacement)"
"He's not better than the entirety of Kawhi's help, which is the point.   Harden only had CP3 and a bunch of role players he made much better while Kawhi had Parker, Manu, Duncan and Aldridge for years at one point, then Lowry, Siakam, Ibaka and Gasol, then Paul George, Pat Bev and a bunch of other role players who were hailed as 'the deepest bench in the league'... and that was before they added guys like Morris, Reggie Jackson, Batum and Ibaka.   Everyone considered the Clippers to be fucking stacked the moment they got Kawhi &amp; PG alone, adding all those guys in trades and buyouts made em even more stacked than any team Harden has had until now."
I'll die on this hill that 4 years from now everyone will be wondering how Bouknight didn't go top 5 just like we've done for players like Paul George and Klay Thompson
"I started to get back into watching basketball regular season games this year, and I was absolutely in shock when Paul George was taken out last night. I mean I'm happy because I'm a Nets fan, but it's just f****** embarrassing for a professional to not be able to play the last 2 minutes of the game for some b******* arbitrary made up amount of time.  Think about any other profession if that happened. Would a doctor take the last 2 minutes off of surgery? Whould a teacher end Class 2 minutes early? What is Chef's stopped cooking that steak 2 minutes early? It really f****** boils my blood and makes me annoyed. You're getting paid millions of dollars, get out there and f****** play the game"
"Nah I was arguing Paul George has never been a top 5 player and everyone shitted on me lol.  I mean c’mon even in his best season there was still LeBron, KD, Steph, Giannis, Harden, and Kawhi.  One guy told me Paul George is definitely better than Harden and Steph because those guys only play one side of the ball.  Another told me he’s definitely better than Embiid and Jokic because his position let’s him do more for the team.  Another told me he’s been better than AD every season except last season and he’s a better player right now.  Everyone agreed he’s better than Luka even though Luka is averaging 29/9/9 and completely outplayed Paul George in last years playoffs."
If refs called pushoffs like that then Paul George would foul out in 5 minutes.
Paul George 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Butler isnt even top 10  1. Harden 2. Lebron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. KD 6. Kawhi 7. Embiid (6A) Jokic (6B) 8. Lillard 9. Luka 10. Paul George
Philadelphia Clippers:   PG: Ben Simmons SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard PF:Tobias Harris C: Joel Embiid
"&gt; You know who else should be clowned for not trading for Kawhi? Every team that could match an offer of Demar Derozan.  Well, every *Eastern* team anyway, as Pop was extremely adamant that he would not trade Kawhi to the West. But this is my point with Ainge: just look at what the trade packages were for Paul George in Indy, Jimmy Butler in Chicago or Minnesota and Kawhi in San Antonio. The Celtics could have *easily* beaten every one of those and still had a shitload of assets/players left over. The fact that they didn't get even one of those guys is a huge red flag, don't you think?"
Klay really put up Kyle Kuzma level stats in a championship run and people still say wild shit like I’d have him over Paul George.
"ill give you more than 15 guys better than booker:  lebron, giannis, harden, jokic, embiid, lillard (6 mvp guys ahead of him rn), curry, luka, AD, kd (10 players for sure better)  butler, beal, kyrie, tatum, gobert, KAT, paul george, cp3, bam id say are all certainly better (this is 19 now)   personally id take: shai, trae, zion all over him as well."
"I think 2017 proved the seeding doesn't matter too much if they're so ahead in other statistics. Jokic is ahead of second-place Embiid in BPM by the same amount that Embiid is ahead of 13th place Paul George, kind of like how Westbrook was far ahead in the pack in that."
"I think you are a prime case of over rating him then. I think Tatum has that Kawhi potential, JB is more of a Paul George."
"Here's a list you could argue for being ahead of him: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)  1. Luka 2. LeBron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Kyrie 10. Lillard 11. Harden 12. Durant 13. Anthony Davis 14. Beal 15. Gobert 16. Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Ben Simmons 19. Devin Booker 20. Karl Anthony Towns 21. Zach Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  That's all I could come up with. I think I would personally put Tatum ahead of 3-5 guys on this list, so he'd be in the 15-17 range for me."
"I'm too lazy to list like 20 players but id put players like Zach Lavine, Donavan Mitchell, and Paul George over him. Even players like Sabonis and Vucevic can have a case being ranked above him."
"you're not wrong if you limit that to #7-8. You cant tell me guys like jimmy butler and paul george are on the same level as him. I agree kawhi, curry, harde, ad are on his level."
I think Clippers are playing at a higher level than last year and Paul George + Kawhi are better together after another season together under their belts. Paul George has his issues in the bubble too and we all know Doc Rivers' playoff track record. I think outside the bubble the Clippers would take care of the Nuggets.
"&gt; It’s nothing if you totally ignore where he has been drafting.  Joe Dumars drafted Khris Middleton and Spencer Dinwidde in the 2nd round within 3 years-- he's still considered a GM who didn't keep up with the times and was fired too late. It's not enough to be right about a player in a draft.  &gt;Yeah, they aren’t on the team anymore; he only traded Sabonis for Paul fucking GEORGE.  He traded Sbaonis and Oladipo. For 1 year of George."
"It’s nothing if you totally ignore where he has been drafting. He drafted a future all star at 11 and a starting caliber center at 12. He’s been drafting in no mans land because the team is good. Yeah, they aren’t in the team anymore; he only traded Sabonis for Paul fucking GEORGE. What a bust, lmao."
"In recent years the following players were available via trade: Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Paul George, James Harden and Jimmy Butler. Ainge was generally thought of to have the most trade assets/best trade package possible and got none of them. That's pretty telling. That's what the guy you responded to meant."
"Who’s he better than today lol on defense?   Giannis, Jrue, Draymond, AD, Gobert, Simmons, Embiid, Bam, Lebron, Paul George, Kawhi are all better just off the top of my head"
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
Hawks and Pacers fan here:  he's bad.  He's never been good.  NOLA gave him a 4 year $48 million contract just because Paul George got injured and they thought that somehow meant Hill was a legitimate starter during the end of his time with Indiana.  It is up there with Ian Mahinmi's Wizards contract for bad deals.

"Yeah man, Paul George, Chris Paul, James Harden, TMac, Nash, Iverson, Melo, Charles Barkley... List of scrubs right there.  FOH and put some respect on his name."
Paul George joined La but didn’t want join the lakers just like Kawhi. Paul George never wanted join the lakers I don’t know why your saying that. If La is such a great market why did no one join in 2013-2019 when the lakers had their worst streak. People like Lamarcus Aldridge didn’t want to join. Lebron was our first big name in like 7 years since Dwight. Your just wrong people rather join another contender besides La just because they don’t want LeBron to win. People don’t take pay cuts to come here the only person u can say is Trez which is a valuable argument.
Your comment is a contradiction in itself &gt; before Lebron came no one wanted to sign with us Paul George made it clear he wanted to go to the lakers &gt;  Players don’t join us for just being la Why else would Lebron join a team with a young core that wasn’t championship caliber? Cause it’s LA and they had the assets to trade for another player that wanted to go to la (AD).  The other guy I responded to even admitted that the lakers are at an advantage when it comes to signing free agents. Just scroll up and you’ll see it. Just stop it dude you’re making yourself look like you don’t know shit
That's your personal list based on personal preference not substance. Kawhi has missed way more games than Lebron and has worse advance stats. Kawhi is also 1-6 without Paul George playing this year. Lebron is 7-2 with just Davis out.
Marquese Chriss Paul George Hill
Chris Paul George Hill
"When i was new to the sport, it was Chris Paul, Paul George. They just looked kinda similar and the names were similar"
Chris Paul George
“WHY WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH PAUL GEORGE????!!!!”
Random fact. Paul George's parents names are Paul George Sr. and Paulette Anne George.
Draymond: it's ok guys. Paul George isn't packing heat.
He has the same agent as Paul George... only reason he got a contract that big
all i'll say is paul george should have like 6 FTAs by now
Paul George? More like Fall George neheheheheh
[Paul George thought he took a vaccine for COVID-19 but turns out it was just a bad shot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fh8e8c/charania_the_nba_has_suspended_its_season/fk9xo06)  Still funny lol ^^sorry
"Hmm.  - Bridges was a good pick in the business sense, since we got two extra second-rounders which were then packaged in another deal... to move back all of one spot. It's blurrier in the basketball sense, since in the long run that trade helped lay the groundwork for Paul George to LA. We sort of facilitated the Clips getting their guy in SGA, and SGA is really good.  I suppose the final judgement is going to come down to how much you as an observer hate things working out for the Clippers.  - PJ has been more of a good pick than an amazing one.  - LaMelo, well, yeah.  - Graham, well, yeah. Anytime you get an actual NBA player out of the second round.   - I'd quibble a bit with the description of Cody Martin as 'good'. Longterm for second rounders I'll be rather more interested in Jalen McDaniels or one of the bigs we drafted this past draft.  - People had jokes about the Terry contract, and it did take a while for Terry to actually start being good on the regular. His raw numbers were definitely masking a guy with a legitimately lethal jumper, and part of why he's been so improved is cutting back on the things he's not so hot at (in addition to simply getting better at some of them). Likewise jokes about Heyward, but signing a guy with All-Star type of talent to Charlotte is generally going to require a lot of money."
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"I think he’s actually really good. He’s incredibly young and honestly is the kind of player where going to college would have probably helped him a lot in terms of development.  He started the g-league really well but then fell off. He’a got a lot of issues he needs to work out, but he’s so young I think he will. He’a got raw skill, and I think he could really end up looking like a Paul George-type player once he puts it all together"
So are they the Paul family or the George family?
One of Foreman's kids needs to name their kid Paul George Foreman
"And khris Middleton, Steph curry, Zach lavine, Kyrie Irving, Kevin durant, Paul George are also close"
"&gt; Gary, PJ, Green and Sap have all missed close to or more than double digit games.   Right, but that's one starter and then your bench players. Imagine if Murray and Jokic were both hurt. Plus you still have injuries from guys like Harris. Where would your team be right now?  And like I said, we only started getting credit for those injuries because things turned around. Without the recent 4-game win streak we'd be getting the exact same complaints we were getting 2 weeks ago, the same complaints Murray has been dealing with.  It's not a small market matter, injuries don't get taken seriously until the player is either healed back up or run out of the league. Look at Paul George, Russell Westbrook, etc etc.   Also, as much as Boston has a big internal market, we're really not a big market team on the national stage. Half our roster is unknown for the national commentators."
No one in the NBA is taking Paul George or Beal over Kyrie.
Paul George is too high
"I think George Hill to Philly would be cool if they don't pull off the Buddy deal that's been in some unsubstantiated rumours    Hill won't fetch you a Maxey or Mitlon or anything because of age, but maybe Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed or something as the young player. I haven't looked at the salaries to see how it would work"
Paul George has 2 middle names.  One is Clifton.  One is Anthony.
I could see kawhi staying being a bigger what if. Paul George and Westbrook would probably still be in okc and harden might still be in Houston with the rockets trying to dump cp3.
"Jokic has a lower usage percentage than trae. Does that mean that you think Trey is better than Jokic?  As does LeBron, Kyrie, Paul George, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Zion Williamson."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
pacers would have Paul George and Kawhi
"I mean, OKC was a decent situation, but I don't think the events since 2016 have necessarily shown he was wrong to leave OKC.   The Thunder lost in the first round 3 straight years after he left, including 2 years where the Thunder had Paul George to pair with Westbrook."
"I mean if PG is gonna have another awful playoff run then there's no point even arguing about this. But if he could just be the PG that we see every regular season game then yes I do believe PG would be a better fit on the Nets cause that's what they need.   And no, I wouldnt say the same if it were Lebron because a guy like Paul George isnt what they need. KD is levels ahead of PG but just how they fit on their team. Lebron's the perfect player for the Lakers so why would you swap him for PG?"
"I think you are underestimating how good KD is in relation to Paul George. The Clippers might be able to beat the Nets with PG, swap him with KD and it’s curtains.  I also don’t think PG is a better defender than KD. KD off ball is insane when he’s engaged."
"Whoa, no it's not. It would be an extremely close game because you still have 3 superstars on 1 team and Paul George is a pretty good defender and that's what the Nets are lacking. KD and Kawhi tho? Now that would be a scary duo so it's very even"
"Don't understand why people are claiming the Clippers would be better.   Kyrie, Harden &amp; PG is still an insane Big 3. And Paul George gives them the elite wing defender they lack."
the nets would not be contenders with a washed up paul george
"they have a wing defender  you know, the guy that was guarding paul george  just because you don't know his name you say pg was bad   casuals smh"
"Both Rockets and Raptors win. 2020 was competitively weak since Durant and Curry were injured. Kawhi also was hobbled all season long and even to this day hasn’t returned to form.   2019 Raptors would crush the 2020 Lakers they had Marc Gasol who was better that time to defend the paint. Siakam was a high-energy player that would bother Davis. Then ofc Prime Kawhi can go toe-to-toe with an older Lebron. Then you have a great and deep backcourt of Lowry, Green and VanVleet. Raptors in 6.  2018 Rockets are a closer matchup imo but would still beat the Lakers. People forget that this is a team that took the Durant Warriors to 7 games. Capela would protect the paint. Then ofc you have Harden and Paul tearing up the Lakers’ backcourt. Gordon would come off the bench for more scoring. But the key is Rockets have Ariza and Tucker who would hound Lebron all day. Rockets in 7.  2020 was weak. Only team with 2 superstars were the Lakers so it was expected they would win. Closest was Clippers but Kawhi was hobbled and George is a borderline superstar anyway."
"Honestly, it’s probably more on the Gordon Hayward injury.He played the long game, admittedly. But the teams he had a chance to build while he had those picks, I mean, the trades he made were smart, they’ve drafted the right player long term pretty often. His decisions. his biggest risk was going for kyrie and even that, considering the nature of what they were giving up, still left them with a lot more room to work with for moves they can make with their team. And still, even disregarding that and what we  now know about  Isaiah Thomas post-injury, relatively low risk. Yes they gave up a good pick and a player who lead them to the conference finals, but they still had a metric fuckton of assets to work with to build a championship team.   But who knows, If this iteration’s Celtics win more than this iteration’s nets, or win before them, then he was right to do so, but so far, the Celtics passed up a lot of chances to make trades that could have brought the best talent to Boston to try and make a gamble to build around the team they had, and passed and watched other teams like the raptors or even Houston trading for cp3 or my clippers with the Paul George trade.  Ainge passed a lot of chances to make high risk moves that could have Taken his conference finals team  to a finals team.   Tl;dr: in a vacuum, all of presti’s decisions are smart, but it’s not unfair to say he played it very safe"
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"In terms of catch and shoot 3s, he's on track for a GOAT-level season. '21 Harris, '15 Korver, '20 Duncan Robinson. Paul George is also having a historical season from 3. 8.4 attemps at 45%. For perspective, Paul George and Duncan Robinson's shooting numbers are better than Klay's career high in both attempts and 3pt%."
I just don’t see you guys making much noise with Vucevic as your best player. You won’t get a Paul George player because he’s just not on that level as a player.
"Just talking about in general.  Everything I’ve heard is ship him to a contender. Well that only works if they have young guys and can include picks. The paul George trade was perfect for Oklahoma City. They got back picks and  sga. Even if they picks don’t work out, sga will.   That’s not a haul people are looking to give up for him though from what I’ve heard. We’re better off building around him. We finally have a good pick and some cap space clearing up so we could potentially go after a player like derozen, which would help fix our scoring problem."
If signed with literally any other team.  People loved the Clippers implosion last year and are looking to Nets for they're next spectacle  If they win then the well is already poisoned cos they were broken super team. If they lose then everyone gets to treat the big 3 like they treat Paul George
Only one that actual dosnt make sense is paul George
"Paul George is just a case of a very talented player that lacks the basketball IQ and knowledge to be an amazing player, and still he's a top 25 player. I absolutely hate the guy but he is a smooth ass scorer"
"Also the transition to the athletic and larger Small Forward swiss army man.   Even lower tier teams like Memphis with Rudy Gay was in the mix. But LeBron and Durant were having an outsized impact to teams looking for wings that could pass, shoot, dribble, drive, post, dunk, run the half court, run the fast break, complete ally oops...   Throw a smaller defender on them and they were getting either shot over or backed down, put a big and they were blowing by for monster jams. It was great with coaches and players struggling to keep up with these amazing guys except by the opposing guy defending.   * LeBron vs. Paul Pierce * LeBron vs. Paul George * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. LeBron * LeBron vs. Iguadala * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. KD (sadly didn't get to see the full picture) * LeBron vs. Jimmy Butler  More too, but these were some gems.   It was a great blend of some teams still having their Bigs (Memphis, Dallas, Duncan) and pace + space vs. more complex creating open shots (mostly 2's), switching defense with also some heavy grinding defenses.   One of my favorite times as. a basketball fan: 2008-2017  At the same time I will say that in the playoffs, a lot of teams try to just jack up 3's and it doesn't work as well."
"He's appropriately rated, he turns in Paul George in the playoffs. And for anyone who puts him in the same tier as Kawhi or Curry don't understand basketball."
"This is such a bad post.  Jayson and Kawhi are both above average playmakers. Jaylen and Paul George are average.  It’s not about them, it’s about what’s around them."
Paul George the most disrespected all star player of this decade
"I completely agree, and it is really hard to establish an objective criteria for when exactly a player becomes top two on their team. For example when did Paul George become a top 2 player on the Pacers? I spent way too long looking at advanced stats and things such as box plus minus, vorp, etc and finally concluded that I would give folks the benefit of the doubt if it seems close. For george, by his second season playoff parents I think there's an argument to be made that he was amongst the top two on the team, especially playing the key role of wing scorer and Defender. But if someone said it George Hill and Roy hibbert, I don't know that I would strongly disagree. but finally I realized that this was going to take this post in an entirely different direction than what I had set out to find out, which was about how often you got to the playoffs not which player was a top two player on their team. So if it seemed at all reasonable I left it in"
"I mean there are other players around the league.  Giannis and Embiid are unlikely. But if the Clippers frame out again maybe Paul George becomes available, he’d be a better fit than Beal."
"I mean, if your options are trading them for peanuts or drafting a cost controlled pack of peanuts, whats the difference? They've traded away some picks pretty flippantly, honestly. Trading Desmond Bane to get off Kanter's $5m contract sticks as a recent example.  He did get greedy. He kept all of his assets for one of two trades; Paul George or Anthony Davis. The George one he got done in by awful timing, thanks to Isiah's injury. If he was all-good, they don't have to trade for Kyrie to address that issue and can instead re-route more assets elsewhere, meaning they wouldn't have had to put the eggs in the Hayward basket and wait for him to sign, effectively taking them out of the PG market.  Then Anthony Davis just rightfully didn't want to come. Ainge didn't get stingy, he just took a big risk to hold out for the star and then when that star didn't come... the whole league knew the position they were in and NO ONE would take the picks for more than 20cents on the dollar.  This is just what happens with promising young teams with lots of assets, man. You can be so prepared and have all the assets but it's still so hard to take that team to the next level... promising futures fizzle away so often. You need lightning to strike to be great, and it just didn't with this team, despite Ainge standing outside waving his lightning rod around."
If the Pacers managed to keep PG and Kawhi (No Sabonis sadly)  &amp;#x200B;  Brogdon  Paul George  TJ Warren  Kawhi  Myles Turner
okay Paul George. Steph and Dame have bad shot selection too? Trae's long distance shooting is only behind Steph's.  Trae:  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629027/shooting/  Dame: https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/shooting/
BKN is my playoff team with HOU tanking so I’m going with Clippers. Lakers don’t have 3 point scoring to keep up with BKN. Bubble was a weird anomaly but the Clippers are motivated and have better chemistry together than last year. Paul George more than anyone has something to prove and Kawhi could flip his Michael Jordan switch like he did in ‘19.
Gotta assume Paul George wins 1st team handedly on that one.
They’re just the old Paul George era pacer jerseys
"&gt; Ainge isn't doing much to get Boston over the ECF hump  Most of the time there's just not much you can do. You can't predict Kawhi and Ibaka going to the Raptors, or Kyrie, Durant and Harden on the Nets. You can't predict Morey on the Sixers and sometimes free agents you want just don't pan out. I'm sure we were going for Randle, for example, but you can't bet New York's offer if you're, well, any team in the league.   C's are always gonna be up there in talent, like a perennial playoff team, but it takes a lot of luck your way to get to be a contender.   And honestly, for all the flack Danny gets, he didn't trade Tatum and Brown away for Kawhi, Paul George, Harden, AD, Westbrook, Blake Griffin. Guys who would have fallen off or left after a year."
Not even Paul George does anymore 🤷‍♂️
"As a a fan of a team featuring two guards who love shooting mid-range jumpers and floaters, it is a lot more fun to watch but unfortunately basic math beats fun to watch. The Cavs/Clippers game where Paul George went off is a great example. Garland and Sexton both scored at will but we got blown out anyways because Paul George was hot from the three and 3&gt;2."
"What’s your source on lebron being the most dedicated? What’s your measurement of dedication? Do you think jimmy butler doesn’t train hard or eat well? Do you think Paul George breaking his leg was an example of poor diet? What about Gordon Hayward? Kevin love was famous for his diet and training and he’s been barely able to play for years. James Harden has a shit diet and partied late and is a god damn iron man. Is Kevin love just didn’t training or eating well? A huge part of genes is determining if your body reacts well to training, too. Not everyone can handle the work load, some people develop over working conditions like tendinitis or lose their cartilage. Plus there’s shit like lebron’s teammates mocking his diet.   Yes, lebron maximizes his potential. But his potential is defined by hitting the absolute gene lottery. If you ever played sports you would see first hand how working hard is not the greatest determination of success, health, potential, etc. Some guys are born jacked, put on muscle easily, and just don’t get fat. It’s ridiculous how much advantage some have. Some guys are just always injured. It’s just the way life is."
"&gt;Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.  No, I said stats using all shots from 30+ ft shouldn't be used for shots from 37 ft, because a 31ft shot is significantly different from a 37ft shot.   So stop lying please.  The first three pointer Lillard hit in the game was from 30ft. I think you mean the one from the start of the third quarter which was a 34ft shot.  I don't care who uses a lot of 31-32 ft shots to justify a 37ft shot, it's lazy and bad statistics. If you don't think even 3 ft matter (much less 7 ft if you think that using any shot over 30ft is useful) then you should tell all those nba teams that guarding the corner isn't important because there's no real difference between a corner three and an above the break 3.  I was using a hyperbolic example of how uncontested warm up shots are different from contested in game shots.  Also Damian Lillard needs more than 1 season shooting above 40% from 3 to be called a top 5 shooter in nba history.  Paul George just wanted to stop being memed by fans who think every shot that goes in is a good one and every shot that misses is a bad one. He's also speaking with two years of hindsight that wasn't available at the time. At the time Lillard was 1 for 8 from that range.  I'm comfortable being in a minority on the point, people mocked PG when he said Dallas wasn't playing great defence on him in that series. If you go break down the stats you'll find he was getting a lot of open looks and missing them, but people don't care.  So yeah, if I'm on defence and a player wants to take a shot from a range he's never hit in a game before, I'm comfortable thinking it's a bad shot and giving it to him, because based on the information at the time that's true.  But we're not going to convince each other so might as well leave it there. Goodbye."
"Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.      Now you are comparing Dwight Howard, a notoriously bad shooter, and his proclivity to not be able to translate practice to the game, to a top 5 shooter in NBA history and arguably the most clutch player in NBA history. Hardly the same.      ""I didn't want to put it into the referee hands,"" Lillard said. ""Where if there was contact or maybe they get away with contact or I end up having to take a **tougher shot** because there was contact and they don't want to decide the game. So I was standing there looking at the rim and I was like this is a comfortable range.""   ...  For most anyone else, it probably is. For Lillard, it has become maybe his most lethal. Per Second Spectrum, Lillard is 8-of-12 from 30-plus feet this postseason, compared to 6-of-38 for everyone else. ""  Source: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word)  "" Yet if Lillard can play anywhere close to this level going forward, it requires at least a brief reevaluation of everything. He had 34 points in the first half alone on Tuesday and hit three of his four attempts from 30-plus feet, including the one that sent the Thunder packing.  Lillard’s ability to sink those shots — paired with Oklahoma City’s surprise that he’d even have the audacity to try them in some cases — was one of the key reasons Portland ran away with the series 4-1. The Thunder allowed him too much cushion, largely because defenders haven’t adjusted to the realization that Lillard, with nearly limitless range on his off-dribble jumpers, has arguably become the closest thing we have to [Golden State’s Stephen Curry](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/basketballs-other-3-point-revolution/).     ...   And unfortunately for the Thunder, that one — **which might have been a bad shot for just about anybody other than Lillard** — was enough to end their season in the most brutal way possible. ""  Source: [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damian-lillard-hit-a-series-ending-game-winner-for-the-ages/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damian-lillard-hit-a-series-ending-game-winner-for-the-ages/)     "" “I mean, I see this guy’s \[Lillard’s\] range is crazy, their ability to knock this shot down. And like you said, it’s not like it’s a half-court heave. **These are shots that are well in their range. They probably could shoot them deeper**,” George said per [Tomer Azarly](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/1368782815001604096).

You think it's a bad shot but no one in the NBA world does. I guess that's up to you"
"You sound like a clippers fan and no disrespect but I don’t believe they have what it takes to win it all. last season they clearly had a better roster than the lakers and lost bad. This season they got worse, Paul George chased terrez out of town and they have no play makers they’re just praying some one helps them right now and it’s sad."
"Sure, and Dwight Howare shoot free throws well in practice and there's a dime a dozen stories of nba players who hit 3s in warmups and don't in games.  Paul George was waiting for him at a little over 30ft, where he had had success in the series, as the clock runs down he then closes slowly out since Lillard has less time to go anywhere.  1 for 8 for his career at the time doesn't exactly scream well within his distance, credit to him for extending his range with practice, but he'd never shown that kind of range in a game before. Which is why PG was happy giving him a contested shot from there and why, at the time, calling it a bad shot when he was a career 1-8 from that range wasn't unreasonable."
"I’m not trying to hate on Randle, and I think he’s closer to too 30, but since I already did 19 players I’ll keep going:  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic, KAT, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion, Zach Lavine, Trae Young, SGA, Luka,  Bam Adebayo  That’s 28, there’s probably some players that are slipping my mind right now. But that puts him right around top 30, like I said. Idk about 36th though, unless we start counting guys that are out like Klay Thompson, Nurkic, CJ, etc."
"I’ll just name players I’d rather have/think are currently better or more valuable:  LeBron   Durant   Curry   Kawhi   Giannis   Jokic   Embiid   Harden   Davis   Lillard   George   Butler   Doncic   Beal   Booker   Paul   Zion   McCollum   Gobert   Mitchell   Brown   Tatum   Irving   Lavine   Sabonis   Bam   Vucevic   Simmons    So that’s twenty eight players off the top of my head and not in any particular order.  Not mentioned are young guards like Morant, Fox, and Young, as well as vets like Lowry, Holiday, and Derozan, who if I wanted to win a game today I would likely trust all those vets more, and if I wanted to build for the future I’d rather have the younger guys.  Honestly I think if I thought about it more there are a lot of valuable guys left off the list, and I think I personally see Randle somewhere in the top fifty but healthily outside the top thirty- if I was pressed, I’d put him closer to forty than thirty."
"That’s too high  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic  No particular order, just naming dudes off memory that are playing this season. That’s 19 people right there, and I think there’s a lot more above him."
Getting Paul George vs Jaylen Brown was a legitimately stressful moment I love this.
"&gt; I think George was last better in the 2018 season  Paul George was really unremarkable in 2018 by his standards. 20/3 on slightly positive efficiency with the Thunder collapsing when he was on the floor without Westbrook, and his D wasn't amazing that year either"
"I mean, Dame has done it tho, along with Klay Thomson, Dirk, Kemba, Brad Beal, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, etc.  Not quite the same as the dunk contest.  And a lot of times the best 3 point shooters are more role type players anyway.  I'd say vet players just tend to avoid entering, but I do agree Steph is build differently and would probably compete in it when he's 40."
"I’ll say this, I believe Kyrie is a better non first option than Paul is. He’s 8th in the league in scoring with 2 top 5 players on his team, he’s more clutch, a better finisher, goat handles, and despite belief otherwise I think Kyrie is a very good passer. If Paul George is the main star I’ll take him because he’s the better leader and has proven he can string up a MVP level season with elite defense. However the fact Kyrie can play with KD and Harden and constantly not get out shadowed does it for me, and I feel the Clippers just get better with Kyrie instead of Paul.   Paul George is the more complete player but I want Irving."
Paul George is a much better more complete player than Irving.
"I don't think Chris Webber's prime lasted long enough. Joe Johnson's best years weren't productive enough.        Personally the bar for my hall of fame would be Paul George. A 7x All-Star, best player on multiple ECF teams and a guy that's had an unbelievable near MVP calibre peak season"
"""the pendulum has swung too far back the other way, to the point where there's people who now think he was never good""  This is what happened to Paul George"
Paul George with hard Jesse Spano vibes
"Chauncey's on the edge, imo, I think he deserves to be in but I could see the argument.  Basketball Reference puts Chauncey at an 84.4% chance to get in (comparable to Paul George, Jack Sikma, JoJo White), Wallace at 45.3% (comparable to Clyde Lovelette, Chris Mullin, Paul Westphal), Rasheed at an 8.57% (comparable to Glen Rice, Elton Brand) Rip Hamilton at a 1.76% (comparable to DeAndre Jordan, Antoine Walker, David Lee).  I think their formula is a little conservative, since there are a few real notable players with way too low of chances (Pistol Pete at 10.2%, KC Jones at 28.7%, etc), and almost every player with at least a 30% chance is in the Hall as is.  For those who may be curious, the best eligible players not in the HoF per this stat are Paul Pierce, Chris Bosh, Larry Foust, Chauncey Billups, and Tim Hardaway."
idk why but that fucking paul george story has me dying
"&gt; Who is making somebody else better on that team?  Paul George, Lou Williams, and Nic Batum mainly. Kawhi's gotten better at it too but he does go through stagnant stretches.  We had our worst stretch of the season right before the all-star break, but for most of this season our offense has looked fine. It's our defense that's been a more consistent issue. But I guess Simmons would rather talk about coffee"
I could literally counter that argument by saying stats can help you if you’re on a bad team ... we’re not comparing Jerami Grant to Paul George even though they have similar stats
"I don’t disagree that Paul George might even end up staying. The thing is, the trade for him felt like an “all-in, win now” move and if you’re heading further away from that direction, what’s the solution?   You also have limited assets. Trading for a star will be hard but maybe signing one could be an option. The Clippers need to show they’re legit though, which is why I said if it’s a bust or an early exit, there may be some doubts both within the organization and even outside."
Read this as if Paul George was now on the 76ers. Was very confused. Also wasn't sure how him and Seth would work.   Need more coffee.
"He used to be better on defense in college, not sure what happened. He was so good on defense we put him on paul george haha its funng how poor his defense was while he was elite on offense and now a lot has changed"
"For me, and as vague as this sounds, something needs to happen with that team. Unfortunately, that might mean some roster changes. I can’t specify who exactly they will or should go for, or what addition makes them better, but I think they need to load up on all sorts of assets so that they can have future leverage in trades and off-season moves.   I’m only speaking about this from the organization’s point of view. It’s a lateral move, but it puts them in a better position to make more competitive offers.   The Kawhi-Paul George pairing is an experiment at best and it might not pay off. Might as well get something out of it by trading away George."
Dallas wouldn't want Paul George to pair alongside Luka?
"We should be clear this narrative started when the Celtics didn’t trade some combination of 2-3 of Smart, Crowder, Bradley and/or rookie Brown with draft assets starting with the Brooklyn pick that was used to get Tatum and Langford for Paul George or Jimmy Butler.  At the time I remember people like Woj being flabbergasted that we didn’t trade the Brooklyn pick as if it was an expiring asset rather than one that could be used to get a great young player. But by not making a trade at the 2017 deadline, not only were the Celtics able to draft Tatum, but they also were able to sign Gordon Hayward. And then the Kyrie trade happened without rumors suggesting it was something being talked about before it happened."
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."
"I’m calling it now. If another bust or early exit happens, Paul George will be traded this off-season. Kawhi will stay.   They need to bring back some package that includes a mix of players and picks just so that they have leverage in future trades.   If they make WCF and it’s close, I can see them running it back. But anything short of that requires some serious internal discussion."
its not a reach luka is clearly the more profound player than paul george
"&gt;err on the side of giving the players more power and control over their careers, and err less on the side of helping the owners.  While I almost always agree, there also needs to be some kind of ramification for the Paul George move of signing a max deal and demanding a trade the next season, as the idea is that a max deal is what prevents a player from being traded and they are committing to that team long term.  I'm fine with the player movement, but if that's the way the league is going to be, guys should be signing 1+1 deals instead of 5 year deals they are not planning to honor.  (Same goes for teams signing guys to long term deals they don't plan to honor like with Blake and the Pistons)"
"I think we're all missing the bigger picture here. We've always had this buyout market and it's always been fine. Older players get to play 1/2 year with a playoff team. It actually makes the NBA product better for the viewers. Think of Joe Johnson signing with the Rockets a few years back or Carmelo signing with Blazers (I know the 2nd one was a bit different). What's changed is that we're building super teams now. Kyrie &amp; KD built that super team and added Harden. LeBron and AD and Kawhi and Paul George. That's the problem. Because once you build these super teams, the buyout players are all going to go to one of them. It's no longer a playoff team like before. We know the few teams that can win it all. That's what needs to be fixed."
I bet they eventually package alot of those picks for  a star. Problem is it's not easy to get a star who also has significant time left on his contract and if you're a small market team makes it harder to get him to stay. Not everybody is Paul George and even PG one year into his extension wanted out
luka averaged almost 31 9 10 on 50/36/65 against paul george and kawhi leonard in the playoffs so they couldn’t put the clamps on him either
"I think a differentiating factor is just that for example, Luka could get some clamps put on him in the playoffs by Kawhi and Paul George(yes I know he's younger in the league).  I just don't think anyone will be doing that to Zion on the league, and no combo of players as well.  He'll be bouncing them off of himself left and right.  He's physically an anomaly in that sense, and so when it would come to crunch time or playoffs (if he ever gets in that position), and he's healthy, from a physical standpoint he's a pretty unstoppable force and no combo of defensive players can really do anything unless they leave gaping holes to be pretty easily exposed."
"36.6% from 3, only Paul George (38.6%) and Jerami Grant (39.2%) shot better for us."
A more driving heavy Paul George
"You'll get downvoted, but Donovan Mitchel and Rudy Gobert have proved much more than PG has in years.   Paul George is not anywhere near super stardome."
"Right, and he didn't have to take shots against the Nuggets because Paul George was mak- wait"
"Joke, PG said the clippers were still in the drivers seat right before game 7 last year.

a little bit of trolling on Pathetic P (paul george if you didn't get the joke). just a little trolling
"I’m not blaming KD for putting together the best team possible, but you’re acting like he wasn’t involved lmao  And I think it’s a lot different for an FA to be recruited, than to have a dude locked up for multiple years on a max contract force his way onto a single team. All of Paul George, AD, and Harden doing that has been whack to me."
Paul George? am i insane or was there a time when the pacers were trying to be the nemesis of lebron heat
caruso's almost as bad at finishing around the basket as paul george
"&gt; I do know that the current system is broken.  Here's the thing though. I would argue that it's NOT the buyouts that are a problem. In a balanced league with no clear favorites (like we have now) that the buyout players wouldn't choose between 2 or 3 teams. Look at Carmelo. He went to the Blazers. Or when Joe Johnson was bought out and went to the Rockets. These were playoff teams but definitely not clear ring winners. So I would argue that what LeBron and AD did, and what Kawhi and Paul George did, or what Kyrie and KD (and then Harden) did is the real problem. Once you build a superteam, all the buyout players are going to want to go there. It's the same thing with vet min deals. For years, the Warriors were getting first crack at those guys and now we can't get any."
"No, it’s dumb to post below average statlines of stars just to hate on them, no matter who the star is, whether it’s LeBron or Curry or Harden or Paul George or Lillard or whoever. If you’re going to, at least post the entire statline."
"In 2017 team not named houston went 14 games above .500.  Again not that big little over a win per team.  You just looking at just production is the huge problem with your overall argument, it completes a very incomplete picture as it doesn’t account for defense or spacing.  One of the main reasons Okc maintained their defense even though they lost George and went to gallo(bad defender) was Paul was better than westbrook on defense by quite a bit.  Schroder also got significantly better.  Small sample stuff for ayton as everyone else has pointed out.  Rubio has value but it’s not that debatable Rubio is a below avg pg imo with how many good pgs are in the league.  I’ll also point out he’s not good this year though minny is a terrible situation for him."
"&gt;It doesn’t matter.  The west went 42 games above .500 in 2017, 24 in 2018.  It’s just not the big difference you’re trying to paint it as with selective win totals.  West teams not called ""Houston"" went 562-586, or 24 games under .500.  &gt; Yes it is no contest, westbrook was a much better player than gallinari, I will harp on it for him but scoring efficiency is not close to everything.   The salary difference is 100%.  I have to disagree that Westbrook was twice the player that season.  &gt;Shais production did not come close to making up for George’s production   I said it canceled a good portion of the missing production, and it did.  The delta was 9 points, 2 rebounds, and 1 assist... and $29M dollars.  Can you buy 9/2/1 for $29M?  Generally, yes.  &gt; You realize defense matters too and George was an all nba defender.   It does, but the Thunder only dropped from 4th to 7th in the league, so apparently Gilgeous-Alexander, or someone else who was receiving that $29M, was defending a little bit.  &gt; Rubio isn’t even an above average point guard. That’s a big dropoff from Paul.   Not statistically, or in the W/L columns.  After Ayton came back last year, the Suns went 14-7 with Rubio, and Rubio posted 14/9 which is only a bit worse than Paul's production this season.  One can definitely argue that Rubio is the better value per dollar."
"It doesn’t matter.  The west went 42 games above .500 in 2017, 24 in 2018.  It’s just not the big difference you’re trying to paint it as with selective win totals.  Yes it is no contest, westbrook was a much better player than gallinari,  I will harp on it for him but scoring efficiency is not close to everything.  Shais production did not come close to making up for George’s production who was top 5 in the mvp convo.  You realize defense matters too and George was an all nba defender.  Shai wasn’t a great defender last year, he actually had kind of neutral impact.  Rubio isn’t even an above average point guard.  That’s a big dropoff from Paul.  You can’t just look at 40% of salary because any good pg makes over 50% of Paul’s salary but you can get a decent bench guy for under 5 million."
"&gt;If you think the Suns could have kept the same pace they are keeping this year without Paul, you are out of your mind  With Rubio + $24M ( the difference in their salaries )?  Given that they played nearly as well for 1/3rd of the season?  That's not an unrealistic proposition at all.  &gt; If you don’t consider the 2018 Warriors as one of the best teams of all time, idk what to tell you honestly....   On paper, yes.  So were the 2013 Lakers... on paper.  On the court, those Warriors won just 58 games in the worst Western Conference we've seen in decades.  They had the 3rd-best offensive rating and the 11th-best defensive rating that season.  Then they faced one of the worst slates of playoff opponents ever, and lost games to 3 of those 4 teams.  That's not remotely an ""all-time great"" resume.  &gt; OKC was indeed 49-33 the season prior... with Westbrook and Paul George on their team, who weren’t there the season CP3 played for OKC   And without Gilgeous-Alexander, and Gallinari, who were there in 2020.  They were different rosters.  &gt;With CP3 Houston almost won a title basically. Without him they were never even close to that.   Houston also lost in the Conference Finals three years earlier."
"&gt;Adding ten wins to a 55 win team is very very hard  The Western Conference getting substantially worse accounts for many of those wins.  In 2017, 2 West teams won 60+ and 5 won 50+.  In 2018, only 2 even won 50+.  In 2017, 2 West teams failed to win 30+.  In 2018, 4 West teams failed to win even 28 games.  The 2018 Western Conference was one of the worst in decades.  Also, the Rockets averaged 59 wins with Paul, which isn't that much harder than 55.  &gt; For Paul just look at his teams do relative to preseason expectations.    ""Expectations"" are not a reliable metric -- especially fan expectations.  &gt;  You are being disingenuous calling trading away Paul George a “roster change”.   I wasn't referring only to George.  They also added a very talented sophomore in Gigleous-Alexander.  And traded away Westbrook and his .468 effective FG%.  And added Gallinari's efficient 19ppg.  They made a number of changes."
"Adding ten wins to a 55 win team is very very hard, there’s a point of diminishing returns.  We saw kd went to gs and they won less games.  For Paul just look at his teams do relative to preseason expectations.  Suns fans who were optimist thought they be a solid playoff team, they’re a 2 seed in 55 win pace.  You are being disingenuous camping trading away Paul George a “roster change”.  Almost no one had them making the playoffs and they were roughly a 50 win team"
"I tend to break the categories down to:  1) superstar - perennial MVP candidates;  2) all-nba - considered a top 15 type of player and may receive MVP votes (I.e. Paul George, Jimmy Butler);  3) all star - multiple selections and potential for all-nba i.e. Aldridge, Lowry, Walker;   4) fringe all star - not regularly selected. May have 1 selection or none at all - I.e. Conley, Randle, CJ, Tobias, Dragic.   Of course these aren’t static and players can move between the groups."
"1. If you think the Suns could have kept the same pace they are keeping this year without Paul, you are wrong.  2. If you don’t consider the 2018 Warriors as one of the best teams of all time, idk what to tell you honestly....  3. OKC was indeed 49-33 the season prior... with Westbrook and Paul George tho, who weren’t there the season CP3 played for them  4. With CP3 Houston almost won a title basically. Without him they were never even close to that."
Ppl hating on paul george dont know ball one bit just dramaqueens
"I still believe Paul George wanted to go to the Lakers all along, but not if it meant signing as a FA and losing the supermax."
"Ah, yes, Paul George, known Superstar, definitely didn't lose to an inefficient rookie and a center with no offense."
Paul George is not a superstar.
Clippers have Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It is a superstar league always has been.
"The future pick can be traded before the draft.   Look at 2021 Miami pick as an example.  Heat used it to get Dragic in 2015. Suns used it to get Mikal Bridges in 2018. Sixers used it to get Tobias Harris in 2019, and then the Clippers used it to get Paul George in 2019."
"Paul George went crazy in the playoffs. Playoff P, however...not so much, and that's put some dirt on his rep in the last few years. Indiana PG was a monster - I'll never forget how badly him and the Pacers made the Heatles sweat. PG, Danny Granger, Roy Hibbert...they used to have an [expletive] squad"
Yea paul George was really helpful in last years playoffs
He has Paul  George
Is Paul George really a superstar though? He’s a very good all-star but not the level of superstars as lakers and nets have
"Because when superstars go public with their demands for a trade, the team makes it happen   See Kyrie Irving 2017, Anthony Davis 2019, Paul George 2019, Russell Westbrook 2019/2020, James Harden 2020..."
yeah so fucking weird that they basically crowned Kawhi as the best player that time and now he gets.. idk what he gets but I heard more Paul George this season than Kawhi.
Paul. George.
Wtf are you dumb? Those post season stats are not under performing by any means.   Its actually good considering he is the first option and primary offense in his team and defenses become 100% more intense in the playoffs.  Underperforming means Paul George in OKC and Giannis when trapped in the playoffs.
"Hmmm well let’s see. LeBron couldn’t win in Cleveland, leaves in free agency and makes a plan to go to Miami with his buddies, gets two rings.   Then creates a plan to get K Love to CLE, gets a ring, leaves in free agency. Goes to the Lakers and tries to recruit Kawhi and PG. Plan fails. Can’t win in 2019 so recruits AD to the Lakers. Idk how that wasn’t tampering considering they’re with the same agency. Team signs 3 vets on the buyout market. Then they win a ring. All this and we still debate whether he or MJ is the goat.   Kawhi forces a trade out of SA, goes to the previous 1 seed and wins. Leaves in free agency to the Clippers and recruits try to recruit Harden. Doesn’t work. Then aims to recruit Paul George. Apparently Kawhi is ‘One of the top players in our league’.   Charles Barkley couldn’t win in Phoenix, goes to Houston and takes a ridiculous pay-cut to join by signing a $1 million dollar contact. Joins one of the greatest players of his generation in Hakeem and another HOF player in Scottie Pippen. ‘One of the goats’.   Imagine being KD, sitting at home resting your hamstring. Your GM calls and asks you if you wanna go for a certain guy if he’s available. KD says “No I wanna do this by myself, let him just go to a contender to make the road even more difficult for me. I really care about what ‘HoodieLebron (29-17)🤴’ on Twitter thinks about my legacy”.   When Drummond goes to the Lakers, there won’t be nearly as much outrage compared to us signing LMA even though Drummond is 27 and in his prime (or approaching). LMA is 35 and very much on the decline. Why weren’t people upset when Marc Gasol went to the Lakers? He started on a championship team two years ago.   So my answer to the question is no, he’s always the best player on any team he’s been on and considering the amount of talent he’s played with, that’s not a small thing."

"If we waited for FA for AD to join us, we would've kept the draft picks, and possibly one of the original core players dealt?  In any case, that gambles that AD would have indeed signed with us (Paul George eventually admitted to being bothered by Lakers not trading for him), and of course the playoffs broke in such a favorable way for us.

"Everyone suspected Sabonis was going to be good, he was only traded because it was for Paul George. He was playing out of position in his ROOKIE year with the thunder because of Adams. He apparently was afraid of westbrook though so there was that.   Adams was always good, but not necessarily offensively. People already knew how good/not good he was at the time.   Oladipo got in crazy shape and took a giant leap the next year. Credited westbrook in how he learned how to train.   Grant couldn't really dribble at the time.   All the box score stuff, especially in recent years is true, but Westbrook was GREAT that year. The most you can say is that the team was a very good defensive team. Kind of like a worse version of those AI phili teams."

Paul Pierce. Peak Paul Pierce is better than peak Paul George. He's in that Embiid Lillard tier.
T-Mac. He would be a better Paul George
1. Are you okay dude? hahah  2. Donovan averaged 28 points as a rookie against the reigning MVP and a DPOY candidate Paul George.   3. Are you sure you're okay
"Depends on your perspective, I don't think you can say that trading away Paul George for picks is how you build a competitive team. Same with trading Westbrook for CP3 and picks, and later sending away CP3 himself for more picks. This team not too long ago had PG and Westbrook, now they're in a tank. I don't think it started today..."
The NBA has and will always be a players league. The teams are just a byproduct of the players.  The Bulls got Rodman and several role players in their prime for next to nothing as well while having the greatest basketball player of all time alongside a player who was essentially a prime Paul George.
Paul George about to lead Sixers on a comeback
Paul George shot that after the buzzer on purpose. Kennard would never
2020 Clippers. They ain't dead yet but watching Paul George basically destroying his professional relationships to form a super team only to lose in the second round to Jokic and Murray was magnificent schadenfreude.
"Yeah everyone says Gobert gets played off the court but the only year he averaged less than 30 MPG in the playoffs was his first year in it when he only played 10 seconds before spraining his knee against the Clippers. That was the year that Curry made him a shooting star meme so everyone kind of just gathers their opinion off that  In his playoff career, he has a net rating of +18 per 100 possessions, which is higher than pretty much every superstar in the league today (Harden +11, LeBron +14, Giannis +10, Embiid +3, Dame +6, Jokic +15, Durant +12, Curry +11, CP3 +15, Paul George +7). Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only other top players I can find in this search with a +18 per 100 in the postseason. The Jazz just never had the offense to keep up with Houston, and then last year they didn't have a reliable backup behind Rudy.  Rudy didn't get played off the floor, Tony Bradley did lol  For what it's worth, Donovan Mitchell is -7 per 100 possessions in the Playoffs. He did play a lot with the 2nd unit in those Rockets games, though. We were desperate for scoring"
"That was the move that sparked the rebuild though. Lesser scale, but our equivalent of trading Paul George. I love Jrue and always has but I’ll be the first to admit that all star was a fluke too sadly"
"Paul George isn’t a superstar, especially in the playoffs"
"You mean Paul George whom the Jazz bounced in the first round with a rookie Mitchell? The same Clipper squad that blew the same 3-1 lead to the Nuggets last year? The same Clipper squad that lost the season series this year to the Jazz?  Nephews on this sub acting like it’s better to have a worse record than a better one, to have a shallow team than a deep one."
"Kawhi has, Paul George has albeit it was awhile ago. These dudes have been playoff performers and they have the stars.  The Jazz don’t have that level of star power. Are we forgetting the Toronto teams before Kawhi? Or the “starting 5” player of the Month Hawks?"
"Is Paul George currently better than Dame? If not, he's not a Superstar. Dames my cutoff point."
"Paul George choked, but he was ranked super high after coming in 3rd in MVP voting"
"I think by normal standards the Lakers and Clippers kind of are. It isn’t normal for two top 10 talents to team up (Lakers) and Paul George isn’t too far outside the top 10.  I know this era has changed the definition of a super team, and we went straight from the Heat to the Warriors vs Cavs, to the Nets.  But the Clippers and Lakers still have above the typical amount of talent imo. And in a Pre-Heat (lol) world they’d be super teams"
- Kawhi could very easily have been impacted by a plethora of issues from being in the bubble.  - Paul George was having mental health problems which impacted his playing ability.   I don’t blame them for losing Game 7 lol the bubble environment hurt their team a lot
"Playoff p isn’t any better than KCP. If it’s Paul George, yeah ur right"
Lakers with paul george is going 16-0
"In the past 3 seasons the nba franchises in Los Angeles and New York have gotten Lebron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge. And likely Andre Drummond. This isn't healthy for the league."
Yea when you bang your teammates wife it’s def going to effect your team. Or when you air out private info about someone cheating on their girl it’s gunna effect the team. Yea I mentioned 3 cases where it directly effected team chemistry because it had to do with your team. Did Carmelo Anthony fucking a stripper ruin team chemistry? Paul George cheated on doc rivers daughter and they still seemed okay with each other. Cheating doesn’t matter for NBA guys unless it effects the team bond
I'll try just for shits:  Durant Embiid Harden Kyrie Curry Lebron AD Jokic Luka Dame Jimmy Butler Beal Booker Mitchell Kawhi Paul George Giannis Gobert Zach Lavine Zion Bam CP3  I do think that simmons is arguably in there somewhere.
"its def wrong. But that isn't an issue for most NBA fans tbh. How many of our favorite players are cheating on their girl?   DLo is a dumbass for what he did. He broke the trust of his teammate and recorded a private convo and leaked it to the world. If you have a problem with someone cheating on their SO, talk to them about it or go rat them out to the SO if you are so concerned. WOnce again, not saying cheating is ok but it's dumb that anyone brings up DLo recording a private convo with a friend/teammate everyone jumps to ""Hurrrr durr shouldn't cheat."" We all know cheating is bad, but that doesn't effect team chemistry the way something like this does (unless you're tony parker or allegedly Paul George)"
"Acting like Danny Green was useful for anything besides defense, Dwight and Javele were barely used, KCP was only somewhat consistent, and Rondo was useless all of the regular season  Not their fault Kawhi and Paul George turned jnto George Paul and Cry Lonard, and that Russ was trash, Harden gave up 2 games in, and that the Bucks have a coach that is holding back that team terribly in the playoffs and let the Heat obliterate them with shooting"
I’ll declare Kawhi a top 10 player of all time and forgive Paul George
"How did George Paul net a stud center piece (SGA) solid role player (galo) 5 firsts and 2 pick swaps??  Yet Houston couldn't even get one solid player to show for it??? Yes they have some picks, but id want a solid Yount center piece along with those picks at bare minimum for James fucking Harden"
"All I’m seeing are poor defensive efforts and rotations.   In that first clip Paul George literally lets Kyrie go right by him with no resistance, Nic Batum than just stands there and Kyrie gets a uncontested layup."
Kawhi and Paul George are the same as Lebron and AD? lol
"Kawhi is somehow the least boring player on the team due to his commitment to the bit  Paul George is to basketball as Big Sean is to rap, and the rest of your team is a bunch of anonymous guards and wings that aren’t Mo Harkless but stink of his essence"
"Dude we traded CJ Miles, Jonas Valuncinuas, Delon Wright, and **an extra** 2024 second rounder for a 34-35 year old Marc Gasol.   I understand our situation was dire given how we were a full out win now mode but that's the difference. Do you think 12' OKC wouldn't have went full out let's go for the ring if we could go back in time?  I don't think teams are grasping how hard it is it get to the Finals or some shit. These players' windows are very limited, if 76ers, the Bucks, or even I'd say Heat (repeating)/Celtics don't reach the Finals in the next few years I'll be the first to say it's the same OKC situation. Deep regrets.  LeBron when he returned back to Cleveland after their Finals run remember how hard Tristan Thompson fought tooth and nail for his extension? Check that shit up right now, 4 months a contract stalemate that included missing training camp.   People probably forget right? I remember people here were giving shit to everyone. Tristan 8.5 points 8 rebounds ain't worth 20M! Tristan Thompson is valuable he can defend all positions! Look at LeBron and his posse helping his buddies get rich and ruining our future! We are screwed if we sign Tristan long term if LeBron leaves! Dan Gilbert is too cheap once again!   Seriously. Prime example of a win-now. Houston fans and media already praised Houston for attempting to go for a win-now mode even against arguably the greatest teams of all time. They seriously capped their future but they were very close and majority agreed it was well worth it.  Lowry is a needle pusher. How many times did Boston fans go on the fence about Danny Ainge not trying to win-now. They had chances to get Paul George/Jimmy Butler remember? Seeing Jimmy Butler's success on Miami would he + Eastern Conference Finals that went 4-3 against LeBron not been a good try in 2018-19?  Trying to protect your future is very important but when you have a realistic shot at the title there should no question you go for it."
All of this is gonna piss of Lowry. He'll see that the only ones who valued him were the Raptors. Heat and Philly did not value him. Paul George and Kawhi were hurt when the Lakers did not trade for them. They passed on the freaking Lakers. You think Lowry is gonna crawl back to them in the summer?
Paul George
Um bro. Paul arizin could score like crazy but he retired in 1962 and that was 59 years ago and george mikan retired in 1956 which was 65 years ago. Mikan had his own  dominate skyhook but being a good player nowadays is harder and the competititors are much more skilled and to dominate you have to have skills similar to them
Some 60s and under player wouldn’t need to adjust. George Mikan **and** Paul Arizin would be dominant if they played today (if you transported them to today).
"sorry, it's not gonna be that interesting from our side either :( no pat bev, no ibaka, one legged paul george"
"Brogdon is not as good as Jrue but he is younger and cheaper and can fill out maybe 85% of Jrue's production. I'm in the minority around here who doesn't think Jrue is worth potentially five FRPs since he's an injury-prone 30-year old PG now on a max contract.   The Bucks are small market and therefore obviously have to overpay to get people which is its own set of bullshit but I also think the timing screwed them over a bit here. Off the heels of AD and Paul George being traded for massive piles of FRPs kind of changed the market. Just a few years ago, the Celtics got Kyrie Irving for a single FRP and a serviceable PG and wing.  Ultimately I don't think this works out for the Bucks unless they win a championship in the next year or two, and with the Nets looking unstoppable that might be out of the question.   I foresee the Bucks making a run yet losing in the playoffs again this year, leading to the coach getting fired, leading to a new coach and optimism abound, followed by a really strong first year where they come close to the finals, followed by Jrue getting hurt again and coming back at 32 years old and dealing with a laundry list of injuries plus age and therefore not being super effective anymore while on a massive contract that makes doing anything else with the roster prohibitive. The Bucks kind of stall out, they have no lottery picks to help the team grow because they're all in New Orleans, Giannis sees the writing on the wall and bails, and the Bucks are back to square one in a rebuild.  I don't want this to seem shitty towards Bucks fans because I think more than anything they get screwed because of small market bs. But this is my honest assessment. I think the Bucks bought in on Jrue when the market was fucked as kind of a panic move to make Giannis happy, which sold out the franchise in the near future, and I don't think it's going to work.  I think the same thing is going to happen to the Clippers for the record. My prediction is we're going to see a reckoning on all these teams that sold out all their FRPs. The same thing happened with the Celtics/Nets Pierce/KG trade and that was a fraction of what all these mega-trades recently have been."
"1st Dame, harden, kawhi, Giannis, jokic 2nd Steph, doncic, lebron, _____, embiid 3rd: kyrie, booker, tatum, _____, gobert   I cant think of more forwards having good years. Maybe Paul george, Siakam. Butler has missed half the season it feels like so i dont think he should be on it. But he might be since his team instantly wins when hes on tye floor it seems.  Even with time missed theres a good chance lebron is on 1st or 2nd team.  I doubt he'll go down to 3rd.   And i used Tatum has a placeholder thought of him at the last second but i havent really seen what he's been doing.   More guards are having huge seasons. Cp3 i dont think makes the cut unless he replaces booker or maybe kyrie.  But the top 4 guards at this point are guarantees.  dame, harden, steph n doncic."
"embiid's really having an mvp season, like paul george in 2019"
Paul George would actually be a good 1v1 player and he's a SG sometimes
"Paul George isn't the level of player needed to be 1st option on a Championship team.  If Thunder want a player at that level, it's gonna have to come from the draft."
"Damn, how did we get Paul George again? Where did we draft him?"
Rather my star shoot poorly ala George Paul then get walled off and become nearly useless
Youre spitting facts lol Im not sure why youre getting downvoted. Can anyone really imagine Paul George being the factor that helps the Clippers win a title this year. Lmao.
"KD, okc fan and he just seems like a dick lately.  Paul George. not because he left since we got a monster haul for him, but he genuinely seems like a dick"
"If things were that cut and dried, you would take Paul George over Steph Curry and Harden. I’m not saying that Harden is better, but there is a certain level of offense that’s more valuable to winning than 2-way prowess"
Dame Death Stare into the camera (and soul of Paul George) after finishing OKC
im only comparing to other big markets. lakers got anthony davis and clippers got kawhi and paul george in the same way.
Wasn't their a video of KAT and Paul George playing 1on1 at the set? This Lakers superfans house?
"Paul George blows the layup, Batum blows Paul George"
"They actually alternated throughout the years just like Paul George and Jimmy Butler. Because I remember in 2015, Harden was considered better, then in 2016, Westbrook was considered better, in 2017 they were constantly compared to eachother as equals."
The whole team deserves a low light after Dame shooting that Paul George special.
"So true, Thunder fan! How many rings did yall win with Westbrook, Harden, Serge Ibaka. KD, Paul George, CP3, and Shai on your roster at various points in time again? Must have been more than the Knicks in the same time period, right?"
"Availability is the most important skill to have in the NBA. You can be the best player in the league, but if you're questionable to last an entire 82 game season, it doesn't matter. Looking at the Anthony Day-to-Davis's, the CP3-6 weeks, and the annual post-ASB Paul George ""injury"" slump. Due to this, Wiggins is the clear choice in my opinion. Levert's had a career full of injury questions, whereas you can just about expect Wiggins to play in every game."
Paul George and Derrick Rose? Derrick Rose was the MVP year and I don't know it they get past Dallas since he was but a baby at the time all things considered and if they got past the Cavs in 2014 i don't see them beating the Warriors at all. 13&amp;14 George but even then does that Pacers team beat the Spurs?  &amp;#x200B;  you could argue 2012 Melo but like those Knicks weren't beating OKC  now if he beats the Nets this year in the finals that's a big one on Harden. last years rockets weren't winning a title but this is probably the Nets best chance at a ring
Waste of assets dude  Trade that for a roleplayer and you lose all leverage to get someone that actually makes a difference. We would still have the worst bench in the league. We need at minimum a Paul George level player to cover for this shitty bench
"Harden, Westbrook, Carmelo, Paul George, and kinda D rose"
Paul George 2012 Pacers
paul george?
"Me and my friends recently started a podcast where we discuss what's going on in the NBA. Most recently we discuss whether some players are overhated, underrated or ranked correctly. Also released specific videos on [Kemba Walker,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAvxPapIX8k) [Paul George](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrfmf7LXA00&amp;t=4s), [Westbrook&amp;Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP9JJBblam4). With the full video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJRrGfDgJfU). We're all from Nairobi, Kenya so our accents may be a bit unique."
"A couple thoughts:  1. Durant can say what he wants privately to his friends. I'm not taking the ""he never should have said that"" mentality. But once it becomes public (no matter how) he is responsible for them. Perfectly reasonable discipline.   2. If the NBA believed his comments were ""homophobic"" in nature, he would have been suspended at least one game. No doubt in my mind.   3. Some people are acting like the NBA is equating the Meyers Leonard situation with this one because the fines are the same. It's a max fine. They determined it didn't need to be a suspension, so the fine is all there is. But if you don't understand the concept of a max fine, think of it like a max player. If they were both on the market right now, Kevin Durant and Paul George would both more than likely receive max contracts from two different teams (assuming the supermax is not possible). That does not mean anyone, including the two teams involved, thinks Durant and George are the same level of player."
"The cycle of Paul George. Shit the bed in the playoffs, come out next season and shoot lights out, people say we might have judged him to harshly, post all star break slump with a few solid moments to take his team to the playoffs. Shit the bed. Repeat"
"Read what I wrote below  He said trading Paul George for Paul George, so I was trying to clarify what he meant. He then edited it."
Paul George
"I think there’s less and less stars that seem to be in situations that would lead to a trade demand  The closest 2 is probably KAT or Beal (but Beal has been insistent that he is happy on the Wizards, so even that is iffy).  Only other ones I could see is Paul George or Kawhi S&amp;T if they flame out again"
"It still doesnt tell the full story. Paul George already wanted to play in La and Kawhi said I wanna play with him so Clippers go full on Pg13 that caused that huge haul include Sga, Gallinari and shit ton of 1st rounders so they basically got Kawhi+Pg13. Okc need to be stupid to pass that. [For example I would consider Kd to Gsw was pure recuitment job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6D0lg94lhA&amp;t=27s). They got him without giving away any assets and he gone there knowingly that whole nba would hate him and burn his jersey."
"Paul George is not a dpoy caliber defender. I am not even sure he is a good defender anymore. Lots of dying on screens and his hips don't really turn anymore on change of directions.  It's really sad to see, his recent patch of injuries took a lot from him.  Also, Warriors are giving up a lot."
"Paul George is exactly the player the Warriors need--a wing who can shoot, defend, and create his own shot.  But that's a ridiculous haul for Beal: the #2 pick from last year, another high lottery pick (MIN), plus another FRP and two SRP. Even with having to take on Wiggins' contract, that's far too much to pay for Beal."
"PG has a condition that requires rehab/months of rest and you want to trade for that in the hope that he doesn't get hurt.  If Warriors are willing to give up that package, they might as well keep their ear to the ground looking for disgruntled stars. There's one every year.  PG isn't putting you over the top with his health concerns along with his post-season struggles.  Getting Beal on the Warriors will do more than trading for Paul George."
"His original post said “Why would Paul give up... for Paul George” something like that, so I was trying to get clarity lol.  But yeah, it’s a lot to give up, but it also helps the Dubs win immediately. I don’t know who else becomes available in the near future to make the Dubs a true contender."
"Paul George can't even bend his toes right now because he's out with bone edema. The last thing the Warriors need is to add another injury prone player to their roster.   Beal is also more offensively consistent than George. If we're talking fully health PG, I'd agree because his defense is still a strong suit when healthy. It's just that he's never healthy."
"Eh, I feel you, and if Wiggins keeps this pace for sure it’s bad.  But I think it’s a safe bet that Paul George helps this team win more immediately than those pieces."
"Why would GSW give up so many assets for Paul George? He's not getting any younger, he's got a huge contract, and he's always injured."
"Paul George, wouldn’t be the first time he’s out after an extension lol"
"Reg season doesn’t matter much man, Paul George was clearly injured and shouldn’t have been playing. The clippers were missing Beverly and serge, 2 starters."
Paul George leaves the arena in cuffs if that was Lebron. Shit would make the news.
Why we can say Harden joined to the Nets and we cant say Cp3 joined to Rockets. It doesnt make sense at all and how can we say Kawhi is better recuiter. He chose to play with Paul George and Clippers paid the price Im pretty sure If okc would have liked other teams better they would choose other packcages. All these in your logic btw there are so many conflicts in your statements
"/u/musicnothing  Supposedly, the toe injury (bone edema) is still giving him problems and may be a lingering issue all season. He says he has no “pop off his right foot” because of it.  &gt; https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31181181/la-clippers-paul-george-trying-figure-how-manage-toe-injury"
Yeah Paul George is the only nba player who has ever cheated... lol... At least bro made a clear upgrade and wasn’t married with kids when he cheated. And now Seth got some leftovers so everybody is happy.
He solid when he knows his role a defensive althetic slasher. He can't play like paul George in denver.
"Everyone in this thread is talking about AG's defense (which is great and I totally expect him to be like Shawn Marion 2.0 on this nuggets team), but this clip for me highlights Kawhi's reduced explosiveness. He doesn't have the same speed to blow by Gordon that he used to. People are wondering about the Clips lack of free throws and late game struggles, and I think this is an important part of it: Kawhi and Paul George are jump shooters who can get to the rim if someone overplays them or goes for a pump fake. But they don't have a guy who can blow past their defender and get to the rim. They take A LOT of midrange jumpers because they can't create space or create an advantage moving north-south."
Just Paul George being Paul George lmao.
"So, we saw George Paul last year against Denver?"
Paul George is easily the most streakiest star in the game. He has this hot and cold streaks every single year...at the same exact time.
That was Paul George that had 60.3 TS%.  Now his alter-ego George Paul is playing. Simple explination.
Isnt that Paul George who got blocked?
Because Paul George bad. Upvote me.
But it might have caused the Clippers to require less draft compensation to get Paul George.
"Offensively I just don't know dude moves off the ball like a 6'10 Klay Thompson sometimes but has on ball skills/shot creation skills that are a bit underused because he plays with an even better offensive player. So maybe a more consistent Paul George on offense.  Defensively I won't lie I haven't really focused on how he looks this year, will see in the playoffs how he holds up when teams start go at him like the Jazz did"

Paul George doesn’t even know you exist and you still cryin this hard over him💀
"I'm riding with Dame because Hulu doesn't just have live sports.  To be serious though, I feel like Dame has always been in the shadows of the his peers (Steph, Westbrook, CP3), but also always been the man in Portland. He has earned the respect of those that doubted him and continue to put up numbers. A place that doesn't necessarily attract free agents. He's been in the playoffs every year and for the most part he's always done more with less. He and CJ are what's good about basketball as far as fighting the food fight. I respect it.   I'm originally from Chicago so I've witnessed Jimmy's ascent and he's protypical example of work ethic and development. He fits in the mold of the Kawhi Leonard and even Paul George types, that made their names on the defensive end and developed into the 2 way wings that are having a Renaissance. Jimmy has grinded, but in all of his stops he's played with better talent on paper whether it be Rose, Wade, Rondo, Gasol in Chicago or Kat, Wiggins, and Rose in Minnesota, or Embiid, Simmons, Horford, Harris in Philly than most of the teammates of Dame. Jimmy showed me some stuff in the Finals, but Dragic and Adebayo damn near carried them during most of that playoff run to get there. Even Herro was killing during the actual playoffs. It's almost like Jimmy had impostors syndrome until a few games in the Finals. Being in Miami he'll have a much better chance in getting free agents based on location alone. I still don't know what that Miami team is because that bubble was fools gold in some instances."
"Paul George.....Paul George, listen to me when I say this. You are trash - Doc Rivers"
"They wouldn’t be available lol, that’s the biggest problem.  The only star I want, that realistic demands a trade in the next year and a half to me is KAT, and I doubt the Wolves do that for a bunch of their own assets back, and a player they could have drafted lmao.  I just don’t think even Beal moves the needle for the Dubs with the awkward fit. And that would probably be the 2nd biggest star that COULD demand a trade (though he’s always indicated he doesn’t want that).  Other than that who else demands out? I doubt Giannis does, he’s on a playoff team and even if they flame out they can still scapegoat Coach Bud. Maybe Simmons if the Sixers don’t work out in the playoffs? Maybe Paul George? Kawhi on a S&amp;T? All those are possible, but not realistic."
"Q4     01:33     Foul: Personal     Paul George     Nikola Jokic     CNC  **Comment:** George (LAC) maintains legal guarding position while knocking the shit out of Jokic (DEN).  -NBA L2M report, probably"
"Lol he's playing with one leg... Even if his shots won't fall, he'll provide elite defense. Paul George is my favorite player, so I'm used to this. The reason he got paid is because we're the Clippers. And he's top 15 believe it or not, that's a consensus around fans that have brains and don't call him Playoff P or whatever."
Clippers need Paul George producing as a scorer for them in the playoffs so it is an issue that he is in a slump with under 25 games left to play in the season leading up to the playoffs. He can get open looks but if he isn't making them it's no use.
Honestly if the Clips drafted him he would probably be on the Thunder now as part of the Paul George trade.
Yeah he basically Thanos'd us. But like Thanos after using all of that power he was left a shell of his former self. Honestly he's lucky he has Paul George as a teammate to take most of the criticism.
"Paul George for me. He looks  so fluid and Natural when he plays. The dribble moves he does at his height with the level of smoothness he has is so pleasing to me. His jumper is also really smooth, as well. When Paul George is on, he is the most pleasing player to watch in my opinion"
Mitchell was much more efficient and was a rookie who led his team past Westbrook and Paul George. If you think him and Wiggins played identical besides their teams then you’re clearly not watching games lol
"Orlando traded Sabonis and Oladipo for Ibaka, who they then traded for Terrence Ross  OKC traded Sabonis and Oladipo for Paul George, who they then traded for SGA, Gallo, and 5 firsts"
"&gt;Paul George starts off season great,   &gt;comments on how he’s finally healthy.   &gt;Gets into mid season slump.   &gt;Team loses in playoffs.   &gt;Comments on how he wasn’t healthy after season."
Its just the Clipper curse man. Paul George and now Kawhi simply can't take over games like they used to because of it. Watch them do it on literally any other team and they'll be fine.
that's generally how a paul george season goes
That paul george and zubac on campazzo sequence sums up this game
"&gt;Paul George has a message for his haters: ""I'm back with my trainer that I had my MVP season...I'm locked in. As locked in as you can be...I'm on motherf**ker's asses."""
"That was way too close for the Nuggets in the 4th  The bets had Nuggets going from -150 to +200 purely because of Paul George, ridiculous"
Don’t forget Paul George turning back the clock with a Vintage Pandemic P performance
Paul george is dogshit
Paul George is legit so trash these days. PG-24 looked like a soon to be superstar
Did Paul George play in the 4th quarter?
I really don't understand the Clippers running no Paul George most of this quarter. I feel like the Nuggets are getting looks the wouldn't be getting if Paul was on defense.

Paul George with some game seven energy there
Paul George lol
Paul George playin?
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
"He’s not near them offensively though, and that’s more important. Nobody says Jimmy Butler or Paul George are better than Steph and Harden"
"I agree. I think everyone is misguided here. The buyout market isn't the problem here. The problem is that LeBron and AD started a team. And added Harden because he demanded it. Kyrie and KD started a team. Kawhi and Paul George started a team. When you have all these players starting super teams, the buyout players are all going to go to those teams. In a normal year, these players would be going to different places."
"Joe Ingles and Glenn Robinson III just becomes like, Paul George right"
"As a Thunder fan I am contractually obligated to argue for Sam Presti. He has the most difficult GM job in the league. Building a sustainable contender in freaking Oklahoma should be impossible. He essentially has no access to the free agent market. He had to show up on Mike Muscala's doorstep in Minnesota at midnight when free agency started to persuade him to sign. *Mike Muscala*.   Yeah, he fucked up trading Harden (because the owners made him), and he lost KD for nothing (because KD is a snake), but what other GM could rebound from those losses as well as Presti? The year after the Harden trade his team was a #1 seed title favorite entering the playoffs. One year after losing KD he replaced him with Paul George when folks thought OKC's assets were tapped out, and when PG asked out, he pivoted and put together the biggest collection of draft assets in league history (and acquired a new foundational star in SGA).   He's had some rough draft picks...but he's also had the best run of draft success in NBA history. He didn't put enough quality role players around KD and Russ...but now every player he puts on the roster seems to turn into gold.   Presti is and always has been OKC's best asset. There are other guys who can rightfully be called the best GM in the league over him because of their success in winning titles, but I'd take Presti over anyone."
Paul George is kind of a joke at this point.
Paul George is underrated at this point
Paul George is the most overrated player then Kobe.
"Shades of the 2015ish Pacers with Paul George, George Hill, Solomon Hill, Jordan Hill, CJ Watson, CJ Miles, Myles Turner, practically had to use every players full name"
PG: Ben Simmons   SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Bam Adebayo
"""It's a bad shot.""  \- Paul George, probably."
There's nothing about defense that Klay Thompson does better than Paul George does. Just another part of the Klay Thompson mythology that he's some better defender than a guy like Paul George.  &gt;That means nothing to me in this scenario. I have those needs filled by other players.  Any worthwhile coach in the NBA will take a multifaceted offensive weapon who is easy to integrate over a catch and shoot weapon. Again none of this is controversial it just becomes controversial to say when one guy is a fan favorite and the other guy is Paul George.
He was also not hailed as Paul George the Savior of Basketball and Hero of Circle City at that age
Are you Paul George? Hang tough Paul!
Whatever the criteria is the fact that it was juxtaposed to Paul George's 4th straight 30+ point game (37/6/9) can't be a coincidence. The media has been especially anti-George lately.
"He spurned the Lakers  They really hated when he signed with the Clippers  National media (ESPN) knows the formula for engagement is to talk things relevant to the largest fanbase in the league, good or bad  Most of you don’t follow/watch basketball enough to form your own opinions  So you base your opinions off of the popular discourse  Just listen to people try to tell me I’m wrong and tell you why they actually HATE Paul George and think about how stupid it sounds. They’ll bring up “Playoff P” like no ones ever given themselves a nickname,  or “bad shot” like he wasn’t right and the quote continues to be taken out of context. Just listen to how stupid it sounds for the level of hate he gets, its hilarious."
"no, i’m discussing what was aired on espn tonight and think it’s weird that it was so misleading. you’re doing worrrrrk to keep the pg hate alive when clearly most people on this thread are over you guys being such intense haters. honestly, congrats, you’ve bullied paul george into being liked again hahahaha"
"The absolute best part about this is that y'all got super mad at ESPN and claimed they were lying when it basically came down to semantics and the truth is that Paul George is actually 6 for 50 on these shots lmfao.  Also, stop projecting lol. You ain't on the team. You're not Paul George. You don't work for Bally Sports. He won't see this and appreciate you defending his honor.  You're literally claiming a conspiracy by ESPN to make Paul George look bad.  lol"
"It's not arbitrary. It's commonly used across all NBA media. The same stat for other players has been posted to /r/nba ***hundreds of times***. Mostly coming from ESPN with the same criteria.  It wasn't done to make Paul George look bad. Paul George made himself look bad by shooting 6 for 50 lmao.  LeBron this LeBron that.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1649603-comparing-lebron-james-playoff-buzzer-beating-shots-to-michael-jordans-best  &gt;So, what is clutch?  &gt;For our main focus here—buzzer-beaters/game-winners—we're going to use the criteria provided by ESPN's Alok Pattani (via Henry Abbott of ESPN.com):  &gt;Playoff games only (no regular season)  &gt;Go-ahead or game-tying shot attempts (free throws, turnovers and the like were ignored)  &gt;**Final 24 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime**"
"The point is that the criteria is completely arbitrary and specifically designed to make Paul George look bad. ONLY in the last 24 seconds of the 4th. ONLY in the last 24 seconds of OT. ONLY in the regular season. That's the problem with this graphic.    Nitpicking criteria like that can make anyone look bad in one realm. I'm sure if you look up LeBron's FT% in the last 24 seconds of regular season games to cut the lead to 5, to tie the game or to win it'll be incredibly lower than his averages."
"a lot of people in here really want to defend espn on this one just cause they hate paul george. hate him or not, you should not be defending this blatant disrespect to a player who just had his 5th game in a row with 30+ points. it’s bullshit."
"As a lakers fan let’s not act like it’s one and done. Kawhi and Paul George are still threats. Ad is coming from an Achilles injury and even before that injury he hasn’t been his normal self. We know how great rondo can be in the play offs, and provides leadership which is something the clippers desperately need.   Clippers do seem lacking in the center position though with serge out, but zubac ain’t the worse especially since Drummond ain’t really an offensive threat. Realistically gonna be a close series"
"I think Chris Paul is a better point guard than Damian Lillard. And Jimmy Butler is a better small foward than Paul George. These are just my opinions, don't hate me."
Paul George and the Clippers were preforming too well. Cant have that! - ESPN logic
Paul George played better than his regular season averages that series while Westbrook put up 40 points on 40 shots multiple times and got personally humiliated by Ricky Rubio. The games the Thunder won that series were both when PG had good games where Russ was consistently bad across the entire series. PG isn't without fault that year but the amount of shit he caught in comparison to how he played was absolutely ridiculous.
It's also not wrong. They just forgot to include the time.   These stats usually use a 24 second time window.   Watch the video. Take out the 1 shot in the playoffs and the others than are made with over 24 seconds being left   Guess how many are left?  #6.   This is so fucking dumb. ESPN isn't lying about this shit. There's no conspiracy against Paul fucking George.
ESPN Adlibs Stats   **Paul George** is the **first NBA player** to **miss a shot** in **crunch time** while down in an NBA game
"You did see that the Clippers got Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, right. They got them for being in LA."
"i mean i just find it hard to believe that Paul George, 11 year NBA veteran, 7x All-star, 5x All-nba player, who represented USA in the Olympics, is not getting to the line because... he's disrespected by the refs  there seems to be a belief among some people that any star player who doesn't go to the line much is being slighted by the refs, as if if the refs treated everyone the same the FTA numbers across players would more or less flatten and i just find that ridiculous. a former ref literally came out and said Allen Iverson was hated by half the referees and he still went to the line 9-10 times a game. just like any other skill some players are just better at it than others."
Paul George on 3rd under Zion on 2nd is criminal
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
He needs to stop watching Paul George playoff highlights. That’ll fix him up easy.
Didn't Paul George just drop 36 on Simmons while getting fouled quite a bit with no calls?
"hes one of those guys whos always injured, along with porzingis and paul george. at some point you're just inconsistent lol. Hes never going to be consistently healthy"
"Ben Simmons is DPOY, why is there an argument  If Paul George got Joel Embiid's calls he'd score conservatively 700 points a game"
"Embiid was called for a flagrant for blocking Morris landing. Two minutes later, Cousins bull rushed a Milton 3, hit him and blocked his landing. No foul.  Ben Simmons was called for multiple offensive fouls for elbowing. Paul George was not called for a single one despite doing the same.  Ben Simmons was called for a tech on a play where Paul George initiated contact and held Simmons.  Rondo in a crucial Green FT, was standing at the line, touching him and talking to the refs in the lane for 10+ seconds. No delay of game.  Zubac tackled Embiid and sat on him during rebound opportunity. Nothing.  Refs were ass tonight."

Paul George  37 pts L  Paul Watson 30 pts W  I rest my case.
he did deserve his free throws but paul george deserved some free throws the second half and got none
Really like Ben as a player but he’s doing too much with how much he’s campaigning. If it backfires he’s going to get the Paul George treatment
"hes neither a role player or super star. He's just a regular star. He can do everything aside from shoot at an elite level and there is a reason he was voted into the all star game by the coaches   Actually had a decent game tonight if u look beyond the box score. He set his teammates up very well and his defense, especially on Paul George in the closing stretch, helped the 76ers escape with the narrow win"
Paul George shows up when the games dont matter. Paul George cant handle the bright playoff lights. Paul George isnt clutch.  By the way the Clippers lost and were down 17.
I was worried at the end there. Paul George is pretty good at basketball
ESPN cold with that 6-50 Paul George crunchtime stat
See....good things happen when you take the ball off Paul George
Paul George thinks he has to dominate every possession at the end of every close game
Why are they letting Paul George handle the ball that much? He's so much better as a scorer
Doc wanted a tech called on Paul George lol
"32/7/6 from Paul George in 3 quarters. He's played 32 minutes, though, so I don't know if there is anything left in the tank."
Paul George is just so good
Kawhi Leonard is better and always plays well or at least steady. But the flame thrower that is Paul George is what determines where the team  goes
Clippers roleplayers need to step up - they're getting big games out of Paul George and Mike Scott but they need more help
"Eh, miami was back in the playoffs a year after Lebron left and almost made the ECF.   Cleveland was horrible because Lebron was carrying and the coaching wasnt very good.   Doc is a good coach, you can argue hes not an elite coach but to imply hes not a good one is ridiculous. A bad coach is someone like Luke Walton or JB bickerstaff.   Thats like saying Current Paul George isn't a good player because he couldn't carry a bad team to playoff success and struggled in the playoffs."
"""great start offensively for Paul George""  2-7 for 6 points with 2 turnovers, blocked twice"
beautiful move by Paul George
"Doc has a ring. Doc has improved his winning percentage with each consecutive team he’s been on. Meaning, with each team he joins he takes that team to a higher winning percentage than his previous team.   Imagine saying he’s a shit coach. Like actually imagine it. He didn’t make Paul George brick off the side of the backboard."
"Reggie Jackson is so good, they put DPOY Benjamin Simmons on him instead of on Paul George"
Damn no kawhi tonight either. Gonna be the Embiid v Paul George show
"In all time defenders, or in D-Raptor?  D-Raptor I have no idea. All time on my list I'd probably put him somewhere between 25 and 35? A solid tier below the Dwights, Draymonds, KGs, and Kobes. But a notch above guys like Iggy, Paul George, Moses Malone, and Marcus Camby."
Don’t like Paul George playing sick kinda reckless in the middle of a pandemic
[Paul George and Marcus Morris both playing](https://twitter.com/YoungNBA/status/1383187934417985541)   we got a game
"I usually defend Paul George but this is fair, Ingles owns everyone."
"Yep, Kevin Durant leaving a team that just went to the WCF is because the Thunder were bad. Paul George forcing a trade off the Thunder who he committed himself to after one year is the Thunder's fault for being a bad org, despite him knowing exactly what he was getting into when he signed with them. Kawhi bitched and moaned about the team that gave him everything he wanted and forced his way out, only to wind up in LA. That's somehow on the Spurs?  Show me how the context proves that guys don't want to leave small market teams for greener pastures. Orgs being bad doesn't change the fact that people don't want to play for them. Now, if the question was is it those guys' fault in every case, then no. But the question is whether or not big name players stick around in small-time markets when they've got opportunities at big-time markets. The answer to that question is generally no. The irony of a Lakers fan arguing this is hilarious."
For us it's pretty obviously Paul Clifton Anthony George.
I think I’ll just blame Paul George and call it a day
"&gt; Ah yes PG13 is a better offensive player than Embiid or Giannis and Lebron isn’t a top 5 offensive player. &gt;  &gt; Big brain takes  That's not what the statistic is. It's just ranking their performance *this season so far*. And Paul George is shooting 48/44/90, which yeah, is probably a top 10 offensive player *so far this season*. Meanwhile Lebron's assists dropped this season because he came in with Schroeder and they wanted to hand over the PG role to him to get him adjusted. So it makes sense that *so far this season* Lebron is not having his best offensive season ever.  Embiid should probably be on there though"
"Kawhi's main knock isn't missing games, his main knock is having an elite team around him and PG by his side and yet not doing anything exceptionally special in efficiency, points, blocks, steals, etc... Like he's a great all around player but in no way is his season comparable to Embiid's level of dominance, nor is anyone on the Sixers comparable to Paul George as a teammate. You can't be MVP if you're not your own team's MVP by a huge margin and your team isn't the first seed."
"Simmons, yes. Embiid, no. Simmons is hard to root for not really for what he says or does but the media consistently telling us he will be much better next year. We’re on year three of that shit. Embiid is a generational center, just like Jokic, AD, and Gobert.   Kyrie’s bullshit, Harden’s bastardized brand of basketball, Draymond always putting his foot in his mouth, and Paul George being overrated are bigger issues for me."

Ben about to get the paul george treatment🤣
"&gt; Kawhi on the Spurs?  Internal with front office and team doctors.  &gt; Paul George on the Pacers  PG was traded to OKC.  &gt; Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland  Again internal rift with teammates and front office.  The only two that you really were right about were AD and Lebron. Other than that you really haven't proven to me jack shit lol more like you showed how little you know and just go off of what the ESPN headlines say. You moved the goalposts around so much in your argument because the not all of those stars left for the sole reason of ""wanting to play on a superteam and/or big market"" initially. Funnily enough you didn't make the argument for CP3."
"I agree on tier 1  Jokic is borderline for me on tier 1 as well tbh, but I’m a bigger Jokic believer than most so I’ll admit it’s not entirely on tangible performance YET.  Tier 2 I’d add Luka for sure  Tier 3 I have several players over Butler tbh, but I think he belongs here, along with Kyrie, Paul George, KAT, Zion, and Beal"
And Joe Ingles owns Paul George.
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."
"The Heat are 4-11 without Jimmy Butler this season. Let’s say they win 3 more games with, which isn’t  far fetched, they’d be 3rd in the East.  I’m not sure if you watched game 6 of that finals series, but it was fairly obvious that the entire first half was Lowry vs the Warriors. Obviously Kawhi was the main guy that series, but by no means do they win game without Lowry.  Kawhi is a better shooter. That’s it. Probably a better playmaker too. Footwork is an eye test thing that I’m not gonna debate with you.  Giannis has consistently ran the best defense in the league for 2 years. As DPOY. He’s the better defender. I’m not sure there’s a debate.   Paul George is a better offensive weapon then Kawhi. Is he the better player... probably not.  It has well been document that Kawhis quiet demeanor has lead to him not being a great leader. It’s probably one of the reasons the Clippers gave up a 3-1 lead, as they had no leadership.  The game planning thing... yeah that was probably bullshit what I said. All I meant by it was that Kawhi doesn’t possess any elite offensive capabilities that teams need to scout for(Currys Shooting, Jokics Passing, Giannis Driving.)"
Paul George's parents are Paul and Paulette George.
"Steph Dame Giannis Kwhi Jokic  Harden Luka Lebron Butler Embiid  Paul Irving George Williamson Gobert  Mitchell, Tatum are the first ones out"
"Chris Paul, Prime Blake, D. Jordan, J. Crawford, Harris, L.Will, P. Beverley, Kawhi, P. George, Harrell: Never made it to a WCF's with a bunch of Hall of Famers  IT, J.Green, A.Bradley, J. Sullinger, B.Bass, Kelly O, J. Crowder, E. Turner, T. Zeller, A. Horford, T. Rozier, Kyrie, Hayward, Tatum, Brown: 3 ECF's   Now tell me again whose under performed?"
Paul George and Joe Ingles
"First off, Happy Cake Day!  The comment about the subreddit was due to what happened last year.   I was reminded of last year when Clippers fans were demanding respect only to hide after the Clips embarrassed themselves in the playoffs. I tie how I publicly rate teams based on their fans. If you can't take criticism publicly when you lose don't expect praise when you looking good. Personally it baffles me they didn't win last year and aren't the favorites this year.   The playoff P comment was due to the amount of excuses Paul George makes. He really shouldn't speak until they make it to a finals."
"Huh? The Clippers didn’t lose because Paul George played like shit, he played well before that disaster Game 7. They lost because they went ice cold for the entirety of the second halves in Games 5-7. They would’ve ended the Nuggets in 5 if Doc Rivers wasn’t a total moron as well.   The Nuggets just got incredibly lucky last year. They should’ve lost to Utah and probably would’ve if not for Mitchell’s boneheaded mistake and then they got lucky that the Clippers couldn’t hit a shot for three straight second halves."
"Selectively choosing data to support a theory is hardly good practice.  So, you have a 170 game sample and a 75% of Ws. Now let us know about other related variables regarding the games Westbrook got a W and a triple double. For example:  \- What was his teams record and what was his opponent's record?  \- What was his team's roster and what was his opponent's roster?  \- How did Durant/Harden/Beal/Paul George etc perform during those games?   \- How did the opposing stars perform and who was guarding them?  \- Which players was Westrook guarding during these games? How did they perform?  Also, let us know about:   \- What is different in games where Westbrook gets a triple double and a W compared to games where he's getting a triple double and a L?  \- How is his team different when he doesn't get a triple double?  Without answering a good portion of the above, your theory is underdetermined by data."
Imagine thinking Kawhi Leonard is more valuable to a Clippers team that has Paul George than Stephen Curry is to his Warriors team.
"but you don't have any evidence of that?  Lebron missed the playoffs his first year in the west. Rudy made it his first year without hayward even though he missed a bunch of games. Rudy has the number one seed right now without some ridiculous supporting cast. He beat westbrook and paul george in the playoffs.   You can realistically have ALL of those players above him, and it still makes him a top ten player, how is that not MVP level?  I don't care where you put him, he has an impact on the game that is at the same level as those other 9 players."
"Not the same. Barnes left and got a Max contract. Bogut started. Lebron, Paul George, and Kawhi would be a good team that could still lose with a lack of depth"
Paul George: That’s a bad shot
"It drives me crazy when this sub just like gets hate boners for whoever is popular to hate at the moment. Kyrie, Paul George, etc. as someone who loves the art of basketball, its wild seeing so many people getting so caught up in the reality show of the NBA and being angry at KD or whatever"
"The Paul George thing really bothered me.  There's clapping back at someone then there's Dame who took it personal.  * Went after Paul George's career. * His sister made fun of Paul George's wife for being a stripper. * Shit tweeting from his house with CJ when the Clippers lost.  When asked about it, said ""because that shit was funny"". * Said ""al capone"" when Paul George said he wanted to retire a clipper (an innocent comment that had nothing to do with Dame or the Blazers) * Then on top of that basically said he accepted Paul George's apology for the entire thing.  As if he was free from any culpability."
"As a Paul Pierce hater and Allen Iverson fan since my youth, I think this is actually closer than most would admit, knowing what we know now about the importance of efficiency and size.   It's sorta like picking between MVP Russ and an insanely clutch version of Paul George. Sure, Russ is the more accomplished individual player and better floor raiser, but I'd probably want clutch PG on my team, and not have to deal with the many, many pitfalls of the hard-to-coach, sorta selfish, inefficient superstar."
"If you're going for max outrage, might as well give it to George Paul or Gobert."
"Wade + Bosh + another Max guy would easily make the Finals in 2012 or 2013. By that time the Celtics were done. The best team they had to beat was young Paul George Indiana. It’s funny you assume Warriors make the Finals without KD. They would have to FACE KD in 2017 if he didn’t join them. No guarantee they get past OKC with KD, Russ, Oladipo, and Horford"
"Really miss all those Raptors squads. 2010s post Sacremento trade was really a special era built up to the ring with Kawhi and the Raptors. It brings a small tear to my eyes thinking about all those playoff moments, shortcomings, successes we had, and the individual players involved. Every year, and every playoff was special.  The whole F Brooklyn thing, losing a close 7 game series to Brooklyn on a missed layup by Lowry, getting swept by the Wizards the following year (Vasquez shimmy moment), beating Paul George and the Pacers (the beginnings of the real Playoff P Norman Powell), beating Wade and the heat, beating Giannis and the bucks, getting beat by LeBron year after year. There's just so much history and moments.  Seeing players getting traded was always tough too. Seeing JV come back to Toronto to watch our playoff games after he got traded to Memphis was rough.  Sometimes it really sucks to be a fan of a sports team, it can be such an emotional rollercoaster it can be heartbreaking at times, but for the Raptors it's worth it."
What does paul george have to do with this?
You do bring up a good point.   What's OKC superstar Paul George been up to lately?
"It happened 6 times, but two of those times it was the same player who won both awards  |Season|Player|PPG|Tm||Season|Player|APG|Tm| :--|:--|--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:|:--| |1981-82|George Gervin*|32.29|SAS||1981-82|Johnny Moore|9.65|SAS| |1973-74|Bob McAdoo*|30.55|BUF||1973-74|Ernie DiGregorio|8.19|BUF| |1972-73|Tiny Archibald*|33.99|KCO||1972-73|Tiny Archibald*|11.38|KCO| |1967-68|Oscar Robertson*|29.17|CIN||1967-68|Oscar Robertson*|9.74|CIN| |1962-63|Wilt Chamberlain*|44.83|SFW||1962-63|Guy Rodgers*|10.44|SFW| |1951-52|Paul Arizin*|25.36|PHW||1951-52|Andy Phillip*|8.17|PHW|  However, this is just per game leaders and I know at least the scoring leader award has changed criteria a few times over the years from total points to per game, along with some other changes."
"[LeBron, PG and Kyrie together on the Cavs in 2017](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cavs-trade-for-paul-george-fell-apart-2017-7)  &gt; According to a report from ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, and Brian Windhorst, the Cavs, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers had agreed to a trade that would have sent Kevin Love to the Nuggets, Nuggets guard Gary Harris and the 2017 13th overall pick to the Pacers, and George to the Cavs. However, suddenly, Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard texted the Cavs that he was backing out, and the deal fell apart. According to ESPN, the deal lives in “infamy” within the Cavs  Does Kyrie still want to leave if this trade happened?   Does LeBron stay in Cleveland?  Could the Cavs have beaten the 2018 Warriors?  How does adding Kevin Love affect the trajectory of the Nuggets?"
"Paul George still needs to prove himself in the playoffs, but when he does, its a dangerous team."
Lavine and Beal have better offensive packages than many guys ranked ahead of them. Are we saying Lavine is on another level to Paul George?
"Marlo is Paul George. Straight great player in the game, but in the end no one cares and he's being disrespected . And Kawhi is Chris Partlow, silent type doing the real work, a killah.  Analogy isn't perfect, because in NBA everyone knows Kawhi is the boss."
Imagine if he hit this against Paul George.
"I think nine of the roster spots are spoken for if they want it:  PG Steph, Dame  SG Harden, Paul George  SF Kawhi, Durant  PF Lebron, AD  C Bam  who would you have filling the other three spots on the roster? I was thinking something like this:  PG Chris Paul - good to have another floor general on the roster but might have bad blood with Harden  C Jarrett Allen/Myles Turner - backup big that prbly won't see much floor time with Bam and AD on the roster, but can be used against a big center like Jokic or Nurkic. Either of them would be a better fit than Drummond   SG Khris Middleton - thinking of a 3&amp;D guy to fill the last spot but not sure who to pick. It doesn't matter too much since whoever I pick here won't see much floor time unless someone gets hurt. I was also thinking of Tatum but he is still very young and can be picked for the 2024 team along with Zion, Beal, Trae, Fox, Mitchell, etc.  Didn't pick Butler because his offensive skills are redundant with all the ball handlers on the team already and his bad 3 pt shooting"
Or Paul George goes 2/15 to get PG13%.
anthony davis did the same thing and paul george asked for a trade out of okc as well.
"I don't know if there are underrated so much as the spotlight just isn't on them, last year they had all the hype as soon as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George signed, Kawhi Leonard had the New Balance commercial calling it his city, and had a good co-star with him and they did a lot of talking to where we all were looking forward to the ""Battle of LA in the Conference Finals"".......oooops            Long story short I don't think it's so much that they're underrated, it's just that you nobody's going to put that money to believe in them like they did last year nor have they earned it"
Wait a second. Paul George is WHAT in the playoffs?!?!?
Imagine that's Paul George instead of Allen lmao
Poku has triple double and Thunder beat Clippers 118-109 while Pat Bev gets ejected and Paul George shoots 3/19
"This years playoffs, game 7, same situation but replace Grayson Allen with Paul George. Would be the top post all time"
"“That’s a bad shot.”  - George, Paul."
Maybe paul george. It seems alot of fans and players aren't fond of him
Or just add Jrue and slide Paul George down to the SF position.
Lol what idiot staffer gave Paul George the NBA Player of the Week? Curry's been on another planet
Kyrie has a chip. Mitchell is leading the league in wins. Paul George was really dominant in the playoffs and regular season before he became a meme. The kid is young. He still needs to be about it. I totally get it and see his potential. But all these dudes mentioned have great accolades. You still got to earn it. Lebron has 4 chips and isn’t the GOAT. That’s how the game goes. I didn’t write the rules.
"This guy really said Paul George, Kyrie, and Mitchell. I hate this sub"
"I know they are exhibition games and all, but what do people think about the fact Luka started 2 all star games and only scored 8 points in each? If someone like Paul George played for the Mavs, would he be happy Luka taking all these shots? Part of the reason Nash didn't shoot a lot was because Amare and Shawn Marion  wanted the ball."
"Who got beat by Lebron that year... please further explain your point. If we only judge the regular season. Every MVP is better than Lebron LOL... but obviously that’s not true. You can literally ask every Owner, President, GM, Coach, Player and Former player if they would accept Lebron on their team given his track record. I have no doubt every single one would take at least one year with him. Even Noah wanted to come team up with Bron. Even the most butt hurt players would have played with him. Because they wouldn’t be butt hurt if they didn’t get beat by him obviously. We all know why Paul Pierce is mad. Lebron robbed him from at least 2 rings. I’m sure Paul George/ KD would have came to play with him if their pride and egos weren’t so easily damaged. Imagine paying a stripper not to have your baby / having Twitter fingers... you would think these super tall dudes with big dicks and bigger bank accounts would be secure with themselves... Or at least more confidence than hooking up with strippers or running to a 73 win team... Jesus."
"That’s Debatable. Off top I can probably put that to bed real quick. Lebron, KD, Giannis, Curry, AD, Embiid, Joker, Kawhi, Paul George, Kyrie / Mitchelle are top 10 so nope. He needs to get to the conference finals at least. (Which won’t happen anytime soon) not even because of the other teams. His team still needs work. Besides him and KP who they got over there? These days you need at least 3 stars to make a dent in the playoffs. The way it’s looking you might need a damn All-star team of starters."
"I mean...i feel like it’s not a coincidence that the Best players always gravitate towards and respect certain coaches more than other ones.  Lebron has been coached by Vogel,Spo and Ty-Lue.  Kawhi has been coached by Pop,Doc Rivers,Ty-lue and Nurse.   Paul George has been coached by Doc rivers,Vogel and Ty-Lue.  Kobe was coached by Phil Jackson and D’Antoni     Basically i think people really underestimate how important coaching is."
He wasn’t the best. But he’s one of the biggest studs in the league for sure. He’s developing really well. It’s pretty insane how many moves he has. He’s in a Paul George Tier for sure. Won’t be the best until he at least makes it to the finals.
"Miss me with Paul George, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green etc   Jimmy is a great player. And last finals were only extended because of him. But by no means was he EVER a best player. Embiid needs to play a whole season. Paul George was a legend going against Lebron back in the day. But Wayoff P was never the best. Draymond really? Word..."
"Who's ready for some hardcore analysis to dispel this myth? For purposes of this exercise, I'm going to define the Knicks ""winning"" as reaching the second round of the playoffs. Seems like a fair benchmark that I'm sure Chris Paul would agree with.  From 1946 to 1953 the Knicks were fire! Six at least second round appearances (which were the conference finals in those days), and three finals losses to those pesky Rochester Royals and two against the Minneapolis Lakers (where there were actually lakes), led by ARGUABLY (as in, you are free to argue it) the best big man in Lakers history, George Mikan!  Were the 1940s and early 50s they glory days of the NBA? Probably not! But I'm sure it was great returning after kicking the Krauts' asses in WW2!  The Knicks then suck through most of the 50s and 60s, likely because they don't have Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, or like the three other guys that mattered or knew how to dribble a basketball at that point in history.  Then in 68-69, those Knickerbockers blow up and start kicking some ass, behind Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, and Dave DeBusschere! Even Phil Jackson was on the bench reading On the Road. Over the next six years, they go to the conference finals every year, and go 2-1 in the finals. The true golden era of Knicks basketball, but how about the rest of the NBA? Kareem got here, the 60s guys were old and broken, but still chugging along, and then everyone did cocaine and no one cared about basketball until Magic and Bird arrived. What are the defining moments of this era? The Lakers winning 33 in a row? Willis Reed or Clyde Frazier (I don't even remember which one!) hobbling out to participate in a final's game? Someone on the Celtics driving a cab? I think the general U.S. populace was either fighting in the jungle or too stoned to give a shit about this era of NBA ball.  Then the Knicks suck or are sporadically (sup Ty) decent over the next 13 years. They're swept in the second round in 78 and 83 and they go 7 with Boston in 84.  So from 1974 to 1988 the highlight of Knicks basketball was one good 47-win season when 1980s Melo (Bernard King) scored a bunch of points. Seriously though, Bernard King BALLED in that Celtics series, averaging 29 on 54.5% from the field. This also happened to coincide with the era of the Showtime Lakers, Celtics, Bad Boy Pistons, and fo-fo-fo 76ers, so actually this great era of ball was in a world when no one cared about the Knicks.  Literally, we still have to endure everyone giving a shit about the Knicks because some guy hobbled out on a bum leg in 1973 and Bernard King gave Bird the business in one series.  88 until 2000 was the second most memorable time in Knicks history, when Ewing came to prominence, Riley came over, they brought in Oak and Mason, and they had a Heisman trophy winner for a point guard. Over the next 12 years, the Knicks make the second round 11 times, the conference finals 4 times, and lose in the finals during an MJ-sabbatical and in the lockout year when the rest of the east was old Reggie Miller and Alonzo Mourning. The NBA in the 90s was great for one reason - Michael fucking Jordan. Sorry if I don't pine for Ewing hitting 12-footers with bad knees and Oak and Mason beating the shit out of Rik Smits and Rony Seikaly en route to a 72-67 win.  And.... the Knicks have sucked since, except for one year when they lost to baby Paul George and Roy Hibbert in the second round. Melo had like 1.5 fun seasons in New York, Amare's knees lasted about 18 games, and Jeremy Lin was good for two weeks.  And the NBA has fucking ruled since basically the 2008 finals, so no, no one gives a shit when the Knicks are good. I hope Julius Randle goes to Phoenix or something."
"as far as #1, the decision to trade him wasn’t criticized at the time, the return package was. there were even people suggesting paul george should’ve been traded in the 2016 off-season so no one thought indy should’ve kept him until 2018 free agency, especially when he didn’t make all-nba and so indiana couldn’t offer him the DPE contract extension"
"Paul George, dude has a game smooth as silk"
"The Clippers are obviously way more stacked than the Blazers, but Paul George is 3rd in RPM and 6th in WINS. He’s easily a top 15 player this season, and he really isn’t that much behind Dame.    Dame’s a better leader for sure, and I do like him a lot more. Objectively though, PG is having a really good season—and when he’s at his best, he belongs with the elite of the elite in the league."
"It’s AI and Kyrie.   Paul George is incredibly fluid but lacks any real flair, he’s very very good at what he does, but it doesn’t have the same level of artistry that you see with some other guys."
"10.... so Russ is better then one of LeBron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi, Embiid, Jokic, Dame, Giannis, Luka, Paul George?   Even after that there are a few obviously better then him, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Tatum, Butler, Booker.   Cmon man. Y’all over correct way to much. Sure he was underrated for a while when he was actually playing well and people were saying he isn’t even top 100 or whatever, but he is not some superstar again all of the sudden. Cmon."
No one mentioned Paul George? He’s sooooooo damn smooth.
Tate = Paul George
Paul George
"""Paul George""  You mean pandemic p? playoff p? that paul george?"
"Can't be too mad at this result. To keep it this close against such a good team while missing 3 starters is encouraging, and Chris Paul is still the Point God so what can you do. Last year the Sixers probably lose this by 30. Matisse played as good defense as anyone on Booker, those blocked shots were insane. George Hill looks good as a second unit ball handler and spot up shooter and Maxey looks like he could play his way into the playoff rotation. I'd have liked to get the win so we'd have 40 before 20 but this is far from a typical season and team records won't be the end all be all. Hope they're healthy for the Bucks and that Shake can get his shit together."
"I think most would agree these guys are definitely better (when healthy):    - Giannis  - Harden  - Jokic  - Embiid  - LeBron  - KD  - Kawhi  - Curry   - AD   That’s 9 guys. Dame could arguably be #10. Luka has a good case for #10. I’d say Paul George and Jimmy Butler have solid cases too when they’re healthy and playing well. Tatum is right there too. I’d say those are the 13 players in the league with a lot of other guys having cases to be 14/15.    So, I’d say Dame is in the 13 for sure."
"Nobody--and I mean *nobody*\--has ever questioned PG's talent.  The man is one of the best two-way players in the whole League.  The ""slander"" largely comes at PG wanting to get respect as a big-time player, but coming up short when it's mattered most.  Then he comes off as a bit too sensitive about the fans' remarks.  I think most people would love to see Paul George finally get over that postseason hump and come up big when it matters most.  Bring a title to the Clippers and you'll be a legend forever, PG.  But if you're going to get the ""superstar"" treatment (where he's apparently been living it up big with perceived prima donna treatment on the team), you've also got to face the ""superstar"" music when you come up short.  Best way to shut up the noise is to win when it matters most (or, at least, not be the reason why people look at you, if the team loses big).  And don't write long Instagram posts to noisy fans being noisy fans.  It looks weak.  But I'm rooting for PG and Boogie both.  I do think they could use more respect as damn-good players, but it's not as if they haven't been whiners at time, too."
Will someone on ESPN explains to me how this win is somehow because Paul George did not play?
"I said he’s not a lock. Seems like your asking for proof that he definitely is not going to make it.   I assume Giannis and Kawhi will be first team. Then you have Tatum, Paul George, Zion, LeBron that will be in the mix for the remaining spots."
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He’s better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"Clippers having Paul George, rondo, reggie and kawhi missing today’s game is feeling like a fucking blessing rn with how today’s going"
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn’t easily."
Well we also have TJ warren out this year   domas out during the bubble   myles out extended time at least one stretch a year   oladipo hurt twice     paul george broken leg   granger knee issues      and thats just the past 10 years :(
GTJ definitely needs to understand how to pick his shots better. He’s taking shots like he’s Paul George or something
"PG: Start FVV, Bench Brogdon, Cut Sexton  SG: Start Booker, Bench Mitchell, Cut Lavine (Hard choice between Mitchell and Lavine)  SF: Start Tatum, Bench Paul George, Cut Butler  PF: Start Zion, Bench Randle, Cut Grant  C: Start Embiid, Bench Jokic, Cut AD"
"Gobert is their best player. Capela is a worse version of their best player. Less extreme, but it would be comparable to swapping Lebron for Paul George."
"&gt;You didn't hear MVP voters saying the same shit about Kawhi, AD, or PG  first of all, plenty of people DID say that stuff about them, second, none of those guys are particularly relevant or comparable to hardens situation... which of those players had a legitimate MVP case after forcing a trade several weeks into the season?? none of them.   there is a giant difference in perception between being traded in july when half the league is changing teams/being with the same team from the opening tip of the season vs what harden did with having a very ugly public divorce with his team in the middle of the season. not to mention all the covid stuff.  Also your argument is moot anyways since you're completely off base with your claim that any of those guys were legitimate MVP candidates after being traded.....  Kawhi finished 9th and AD finished 6th...... Paul George is the only one that came remotely close by finishing in 3rd, but he didnt even get a single first place vote and was never at any point a realistic threat to win or even finish 2nd. You're also ignoring that the voting for that MVP took place after 2 FULL YEARS of him playing in OKC...   harden forced his trade barely 3 months ago. give people another year and a half to get over it and Im sure theyd be more willing to vote for him just like they did for PG.  &gt;you said it yourself, Houston is a toxic franchise  yeah, and harden bares some of the responsibility for that fact as well. he's not completely blameless in all of what happened that lead to the team falling apart.."
"""That's a bad call""  \-Paul George"
"Outside of 2009 he doesn't have playoff success. In that aspect, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Jimmy Butler, and Paul George have been better yet guess who will be higher in all-time talks."
Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons  Paul George and Doc Rivers (or PG and Seth Curry)  Lance Stephenson and Lebron
"I mean you just called the award ""best player on the best team award"", so I don't know why you're getting mad at the dude you're replying too. I guess it could be argued that the Clippers are the best team right now, so Paul George should get the award?"
"huhh?? i’m a clippers fan so I was looking at my team’s post-match thread, then I saw your comment which had absolutely nothing to do with PG (was about Dame only) and pointed out that Dame performs poorly against the Clippers. You brought up Paul George. I didn’t initiate nothing about PG. I think you go on post match threads to diss on PG lmao. weirdo"
Out for the Clips   Patrick Beverley (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture)   Paul George (rest)   Serge Ibaka (lower back tightness)   Reggie Jackson (rest)   Kawhi Leonard (right foot soreness)   Rajon Rondo  (right wrist inflammation)\]
bro u called Paul George a “bitch boy” lmao u the one who has issues
this season PG vs Dame Lillard in Blazers-Clippers games:   Damian lillard 15.5ppg 5apg 17FG% 7 3FG% 0-2 W/L  Paul George 29.5ppg 6apg 57FG% 55 3FG% 2-0 W/L
"Start / Bench  PG. Brogdon / Sexton (easy ish, I like 6 man Sexton as a microwave scorer off the bench. Brogdon is efficient as a shooter and can set up the other starters)  SG. Lavine / Booker (this was hard to choose who started, possibly the toughest to decide who to cut)  SF. Paul George / Jimmy Buckets (tough to decide who starts but I went with Paul for 3 point spacing)  PF. Randle / Zion (super hard to decide who started. I like Zion with Jokic off the bench and Randle can spread the floor better for Embiid)  C. Embiid / Jokic (I debated Jokic vs AD only due to AD’s versatility as a defender off the bench, and I think he could play next to Embiid which I wouldn’t really want from Jokic. But for the best bench unit I have to go with Jokic. (He’s also much better than AD in my eyes))"
"1. The Hawks will get the 4 seed and will easily win the first round in 5 or 6, and they’ll lose to Philly in the second round but will do surprisingly well, taking the series to 6.  2. The Blazers will be swept by whoever they play in the first round, whether it’s the Clippers or they lose in the play-in.  3. Paul George will outplay Kawhi for most of the playoffs and lead the Clippers to the WCF, but he’ll have one bad game there and so everyone will make fun of him for the rest of eternity."
Paul George is playing at an elite level as of late. The slander he’s getting at this point is overboard
"Lmao he flat out said role players don’t deserve to take that shot, then went out and missed in the same exact situation the next game.  Saying “he shouldn’t take that shot but I trust him” is like saying no offense then saying something offensive. He clearly doesn’t trust mikes if he’s saying he shouldn’t shoot a wide open game winner  &gt;you’re acting like he said he hates jews  No you’re acting like we are gathering a lynch mob when we rag on a player. No one is saying kill Paul George or lock him in jail. People are giving him shit for basketball and being a hypocrite. You’re the one making this weird and trying to defend a player from criticism or jokes that he brought upon himself"
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"Start Brogdon, bench VanVleet, cut Sexton  Start Book, bench LaVine, cut Mitchell  Start Paul George, bench Butler, cut Tatum (you really had to put him with these two guys, dang it)  Start Zion, Bench Julias, cut Jerami.  Start Jokic, bench Embiid, cut Davis"
"Quite a few Clips woukd make this list.  Paul George, Pat Bev, Marcus Morris, DeMarcus Cousins."
Definitely was a bad call. It felt like a makeup call by Scott Foster for the 5+ times Paul George really got whacked at the basket and got no call earlier in this game. Really poorly officiated game.
"Finishing 3rd in MVP voting one time doesn't make you in the ""argument"" for best player in the League. Paul George got 3rd in MVP Voting a couple years ago."
"Paul George is easily one of the best players in the NBA. That being said, he's mysteriously not played like himself the past 4 or 5 playoffs, but only in the must win and important games,his numbers otherwise aren't that bad. But those are the games that people care or talk about. It's not like Kawhi or Westbrook didn't get slandered for their performances in those games too."
Bird was 6'9 230lbs. Which position do you think he's playing ? Paul george would be stronger than bird while be 10x more mobile
"I don't know.  I feel like the Carmelo Nuggets were with ""right there with the lakers"" the way that the Paul George Pacers were ""right there with Miami.""  Good enough to make it close, but no one actually believed they were going to win, and if they did win, they would have lost in the finals.  But that could be the bias of hindsight."
"Paul George is talented, no one denied this. It’s just his mouth gets him in more trouble than necessary. Also him and Kawhi hyper choked last playoffs. That being said, the team is destined for the conference finals at minimum IMO. They match up well with whoever is at sixth, unless the lakers slide and the Suns are a good matchup but not talented enough i think. Correct me if I’m wrong."
Paul George 100%
"Paul George was the best player on the floor for big stretches in a seven game ECF series that included prime Wade and Lebron.  It's not like he's never done it before.  A lot of the playoff P stuff also comes from OKC where he was actually pretty dominant and held back by the way Westbrook dominated the ball (IMO as someone whose team played them that's how I felt, Westbrook stans please don't flame me).   I think a lot of it has to do with that old school attitude that someone has to have that Jordan-ish killer instinct to be successful in the okayoffs.  The way he plays is so smooth and confident he looks soft even when he's dominating because he's always pretty low intensity."
Giannis LeBron Kawhi Paul George Zion Williamson. Pick Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum for the final spot   Those should be the forwards. Sorry Julius Randle and whomever else misses the cut.
"Paul George is amazing and continues to impress me - played 9 games in April and is averaging 29/5/7 on 52/46/89 shooting splits. It is nothing new but he deserves some love, he is really putting in work and keeping the Clippers consistent - LAC has gone 10-2 in the 12 games they’ve played in April, on course to win at least 45 games in a 72 win season."
"In the same vein though, the very season before Westbrook was fifth in MVP voting on the same team as Paul George... and George didn’t even earn a single vote. Whereas in George’s third-place-finish year, Westbrook still finished tenth.  Now you could say that George’s year was more recent, but that would be disingenuous because it’s not like they drastically changed how good of players they were. Teams just change how they play and use their talent from year to year and nevertheless both players were still elite.   Even at the time I remember it wasn’t clear-cut, as many people recognised both player’s contributions. Many of the voters had Westbrook over George on their ballots. Obviously it swayed George’s way but I just think it is kind of disrespectful to Westbrook to pretend that the consensus was completely towards Paul George that year, especially considering how you ignored the situation the season before. Again, it’s not like they became different players in one season, and to this day they’re both doing their thing.  I honestly really dislike your phrasing that George “outplayed” Westbrook: they were teammates playing together to try to win. They weren’t competing against each other for stats. “Outplayed” is a word you should only use for players matching up on different teams, in my opinion."

Paul George is one of my favorite basketball player to watch. It's a real shame he gets clowned a lot.
Paul George hahah
"ESPN “Trouble in La La Land? Cousins calls teammate Paul George ‘Cool as a fan,’ but doesn’t state whether that fan is on or not”"
"Everytime you mention Paul George being good, the twitter casuals come out"
"So now that Paul George is wrecking the league he's being called Pfizer P?! LOL Good lord, this subreddit is hilarious."
They’re definitely contenders. The reason they choked last year is because Paul George sucked and probably was too into his head being in a situation where he was expected to play well/win. You wonder if he will be more settled in and comfortable with the moment this year.
You know what I'm gonna say it. I like watching Paul George play 😤
IMO Paul George has been massively overrated for a large portion of his career. Including possibly now.
Downvote fk paul george i hate him so bad bekause he called himself playoff pee
And Paul George Is hoopin y’all what’s a bone edema
"Paul George plays well: 380 upvotes max  Paul George plays bad: 12.3k upvotes, comments of corny puns, Clippers slander everywhere  hmmmmm"

"after that shitty ESPN graphic about paul george in the clutch, this game is extremely satisfying"
Paul George
Rondo cured Paul George
Paul fucking George!
I can't wait for Paul George to go crazy in the playoffs this year   The disrespect showed towards him the past few year has been insane  He's sooo fucking good ... One of my faves
I better see every major sports media page show some love to Paul George😤
Paul George
Its Paul George
Paul George is going OFF holy shit
Kanter on defense is the freshmen who tries to study the test instead of actually learning the material. Helping in the paint and then rotating out right as Paul George is cutting because the textbook tells you just rotate for a second in case and if you follow it that must mean your good. Instead of actually trying to sense and locate Paul George if he’s coming on a cut
"I’m sorry but if you are trading arguably a top 5 player in the league you’d expect to get that type of return. Look at the package for Paul George in the same offseason, the package for Harden. Houston didn’t have leverage but we’re still able to get a huge return. The Lakers had leverage but they were also under huge pressure from Lebron to get the deal done."
"&gt;A guy like Curry doesn't do anything controversial, his most controversial moment in ages was his moon landing comment. Nor does a guy like Giannis. Compare that with LeBron on his 'I'm the GOAT' comment, China-Morey fiasco, trying to recruit AD/Kawhi/ Curry while throwing his young team under the bus, etc. The reality is LeBron says a lot of controversial shit that gets him haters even after everything he accomplished after Miami, Paul George and Kawhi are no different.  I agree. Also not relevant to anything I said.  People can't say ""omg this is r/lebron!"" then when proven wrong say ""well it's because he has had controversial moments."" Yeah no shit. Which is why it's fucking stupid to act like it's r/lebron. The sub loves curry way more than lebron. Which is fine (not like steph's ever gonna be in the goat conversation so it's w/e), but steph stans trying to act like that's not the case is hilarious.   &gt;The point is not the upvote, it's the fact that you got this many haters making these topics. You're not going to see even on r/Warriors that LeBron is not a top 2 player, that seems to be the consensus.  The point is the upvotes lol. Upvotes tell you how many people agree with the take. Curry hate posts having 0 points show that it's a very vocal minority. LeBron hate posts having thousands of posts show that it's a damn big group of people. Not hard to understand. Just a steph stan who wants to ignore reality"
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

"&gt;I don't know how you'd determine this, you really think he gets proportionally more hate than someone like Paul George and Kawhi? Hell even Westbrook who gets clowned in nearly every topic? And general fan base aside, the media is heavily geared towards putting LeBron on a pedestal, literally the only hater I can think of is Skip Bayless and that's surely an act.  I said most superstars. Definitely more than luka, dame, steph, giannis, jokic, embiid, etc.   They're exceptions ofc, which the word 'most' allows for. Paul George prolly gets the most hate (proportionally to their total popularity).  Westbrook is the guy that everyone says ""omg he's sooo hated!!"" but the posts about westbrook that make the front page are almost all positive now lol.   Pull up the posts about Curry not being a top 3 PG, btw. Let's see how upvoted they are.   The third most upvoted post in the history of this subreddit is a lebron hate post. Lol  You can be a steph stan while acknowledging that r/nba loves him. That's fine."
"&gt; It hasn't been since he was hailed as the hero up against the warriors that everyone hated.   It's funny you actually believe this. LeBron's popularity has only sky rocketed since he moved to the Lakers and even more after he got his 4th ring.   &gt; But he gets more hate than most superstars get love lol.  I don't know how you'd determine this, you really think he gets *proportionally* more hate than someone like Paul George and Kawhi? Hell even Westbrook who gets clowned in nearly every topic? And general fan base aside, the media is heavily geared towards putting LeBron on a pedestal, literally the only hater I can think of is Skip Bayless and that's surely an act.   Steph's popularity on r/nba has only reached its peak this season when people expected him to be the underdog, I guess I'm the only one who sees daily posts of 'Is Curry even a top 3 PG', 'Dame and Harden are better than Steph', 'Steph isn't a real PG', etc."
"not in the name of Lebron, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving, and Lamarcus Aldridge"
"Steph way above the rest. Steph had 2 finals run and almost two peated before KD joined. Steph makes KD look good.  Kawhi led a team he joined for one season and won.  KD is behind Kawhi because joining not only a championship ready team but also the team with the BEST regular season record ever should get no credit whatsoever. People need to stop value championship hopping players.   Harden had Westbrook, CP3, and decent teammates. Never even got in to a finals. He is overrated like Paul George, or Kyrie Irving. Harden is not even on the same level as the other three players."
And Harden got exactly what he wanted. Players aren’t GMs but some are successful in going to the team they want to. NFL players for example can’t do the same while in contract   Side note: Paul George isn’t a superstar and Kawhi eventually got to go where he wanted to play
"Duncan Robinson, Gary Payton II, Dean Wade, Seth Curry, Paul Millsap, George Hill, Mike Miller, Allen Crabbe, Thanasis Antetounkumpo, and...MEYERS LEONARD!"
"It’s crazy how the OKC big 3 became 3 of the 6 most hated players in the league(the others being Kyrie, Paul George ans LeBron)"
"i thought for a second that was paul george with the slam, but i realized nah this is way better than PG"
But that’s like saying someone like Paul George is arguably better than Lebron because Lebron is out and George has been playing well. It was just such a weird argument.
"I've been told certain players like Paul George doesn't get free throws because they're jump shooters yet I constantly see these jump shooters like KD, Harden, Embiid etc. Get these calls."
Getting one supermax player makes other players want to join them like Lebron and AD. Also Kawhi and paul George. They were trades tho. But AD specifically limited his teams and it was known he wanted to join his idol lebron.  Also paying for a 2nd star keeps the first stsr on the team like bucks acquiring jrue holiday.
Can definitely see why George Paul was saying the Refs unlock 76ers defensive potential.
*Paul George Defense Force has entered the chat*
"Fellow hustlers from Lancaster, CA all know the name of our ~~King~~ *~~Hawk~~* *Heat*  Fuck Palmdale. Fuck Paul George. Fuck LA. 💪"
"&gt;Yes the point is that Durant doesn't have the playmaking chops to place him safely in the top 20. Harden, for example, has one or two faults, like every all time great, but doesn't crater the moment he has to handle the ball and create for others.  There are multiple top 20 players who are not ballhandlers lol. Any big man before the mid 2010s is prob going to be in that list.  Harden has also played PG for multiple seasons lol. Once again comparing a scorer to a PG   &gt;Yes: there is a deep correlation between team defense and playmaking as they both have to analyze the court and adapt to the flow of what is happening. Again, Durant has never graded out elite aside from 2017; he's never had the primary perimeter or interior responsibility defensively.  this is such an awful take LOL. how many PGs are awful defenders. If anything PG is the historically weakest position defensively (in addition to them usually being undersized). Out of the top 6ish PGs rn (Lilliard, Curry, Dame, WB, Kyrie, Luka, Trae) the only ones you can make an argument for being good at defense is maybe Curry, and even in the most generous interpretation he's about average.  Durant also doesn't have to be elite defensively, just a bit above average which he is. He's never going to be the one to take the hardest assignment, and he's good enough to not be targeted every possession.  Also funny how it went from ""Durant is an average to below average defender"" to ""Durant is not an elite anchoring defender"" lmao.  &gt;You're again conflating the issue. the issue isn't about positions, the issue is about skill set as they define the player more than a strict 1-5 position. Harden is more of a wing than Durant is: Harden can score better from anywhere on the court something an elite scorer can do. people like Larry Bird, Lebron James, Jordan, Kobe all fit the wing archetype and they were able to create unlike our dear friend Kevin.  Other top 20 players who are wings and created at a similar level as KD:  Erving  Elgin Baylor  the moment you specify your criteria to ""top 20 players hwo are wings and are not ball handling guards"" you get a super small list and you still can find examples  kobe was a good passer but he averaged a similar amount of assists as KD so even if he could pass more it wasnt like he was running the lakers offense single handedly every year lol  &gt;Why did Durant collectively shoot, and respectively in chronological order, 54, 57, 57 TS% in his last three OKC post seasons? You realize this is below league average and his drop off is astronomical compared to other superstars--until he went to golden state.  KD shot 54.2% in 2016's postseason. League average TS% was 54%. KD shot 57% in 2014, league average was 54.1%. KD shot 57.4% in 2013, league average was 53.5%. These are big jumps except for 2016, which as I said before was his choke year and a big outlier LOL  &gt;2012 is his only really good run in OKC and even then he wasn't the focal point of the opposing teams' defense: that was harden and Westbrook where the coaches outspokenly said they were planning for those players.   Teams planned for harden in the finals but not westbrook. There were also 3 series beforehand where teams were planning for KD and he still did well   &gt;If you're only counting OKC years, why are you ignoring the plethora of data that shows he shoots league average (55 ts% is roughly league average) or barely above league average when he shot 60+ TS% in the regular season?   Yeah his efficiency goes down in the postseason(common critique for him before he left okc) but he still goes from otherworldly efficiency on super high volume to well above average efficiency on high volume lol.  &gt;n order for those players--who are not top 20 players (maybe Manu)--to succeed they needed all time great creation or anchored a defense so good it won championships like Duncan has.  Paul George, Erving, and Paul Pierce are all better than ginobili. Erving is very easily argued as a top 20 player all time.   Erving and Paul Pierce have also both won championships, and PP has a finals MVP and Erving has the ABA equivalent of a finals MVP lmao  So they could not run an offense, and they couldn't anchor a defense, and they still won titles and finals MVPS as arguably top 20 players all time so it literally disproves your point.  &gt;he lacks defense  once again a bit above average defender  &gt;he lacks general basketball IQ  yes kevin durant lacks bball IQ. The other team lets him score 30 ppg because he is the resident make a wish kid, and the mvp was a consolation prize.  &gt;his efficiency craters the moment he has to increase his volume   Still above average and still better than many superstars. And not even true, his FGA is roughly the same form the RS to the PO, it's just the harder playoff defenses that reduce his efficiency  &gt;No way Durant is top 20 when he never has won being the primary engine of the offense responsible for its wellbeing  crazy dumb criteria. this literally means that if ur not the point of ur finals team u don't count 😭"
"An assist is not worth the 2-3 points though. It's worth a small fraction of those points. Most of the credit goes to the guy who, you know, actually scores. I'm not saying Trae is bad. I'm not saying Sexton is comparable to him. I am saying that pretending Trae is even in the same stratosphere as Luka is either a homer or a hater take. It's like saying Paul George is better than LeBron or CJ is better than Dame. You're talking about a guy that's playing like a hall of famer at 22, and comparing him to a bottom tier all-star."
Paul George needs to relax man. Why does he always seem pissed?
Paul George needs to be canceled

Congratulations to Paul George for averaging 28 ppg for 1 straight month! Such an incredible and rare accomplishment never seen before!
Paul George in playoff mode....the infamous playoff P? If anything Paul George has always been overrated and got exposed last year.
I mean he got a point. Prime time game against the team that embarrased you last year and you shoot 5/21. Paul George is a great player but he coulda made a statement tonight.
Paul George is killing my fantasy team playoff chances with how inconsistent he is
"Still played more games than Kawhi has this year, and just as many as Paul George."
I see Paul George was quick to hop on his burners tonight with how many people here are defending him lmao
"PG: ""There's a lot of chirping and people just living in the past""   You: ""Paul George in January when asked about the 4-16 shooting performance in game 7"""
Paul George was missing shots vs everyone. And fts. Clamped himself up by settling for jumpers opposed to getting fts
"Wtf is this rounding up? 10.9 rebounds rounded up to 10, 8.6 assists rounded up to 8.  Also Jokic's true shooting this season is at .65%, not .61% big difference.  Also pretty hot take u got there chief, i personally have him 4th behind Kevin Porter Jr, Steven Ballmer and Paul George."
George Paul is coming alive.
"Yeah it's an interesting thing, the debate between what's skill and what's athleticism. I think it can be both, but if you watch someone like Andrew Wiggins, for instance, there's just an innate difference in their movements that can't be gained through skills. Kyrie has way more mobile hips, can sink lower to the grown, can twist and turn in closer spaces and just flat-out maneuver in ways that Wiggins cannot, because Wiggins lacks the coordination and his feet aren't capable of being in those positions.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152](https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152)  \^\^\^\^ this is an interesting look at it, looks at the positions he can get into, the angles he can move, etc. Someone like Wiggins, or a Paul George, cannot move this way, and the applicability of these traits are just as much as being quick/fast (which Kyrie is anyway) and probably more so than being able to jump super high. If Wiggins could maneuver like this, I think he might be up a tier as a player. It's a quality Kobe and MJ also had. You can do ball handling drills, all that, but this is NFL running back/cornerback body control/mobility. John Wall is kinda mediocre when it comes to this. DWade was great at it.   I'd give the athleticism nod to Wall because his raw power and maximum explosion I think give him a little bit more of an ability to get by on raw physicality, but Kyrie isn't far behind, and when I watch them, I've never seen a huge difference, all things considered. Similar speed/quickness, both strong (wall stronger), Wall has more vertical explosion, Kyrie has way better agility/mobility."
"Rondo AND Boogie lol they combined for like 12-15 pts late in the 4th to keep this close. You're in a bad spot if those 2 are the ones stepping up to not get blown out when you have Paul George and although he just got back from injury, he's still Kawhi"
"so why is that paul george is the only player these rules apply to? there are a lot of stars who haven’t done shit. for example, dame consistently shits the bed in the playoffs (overshadowed by his 2 game winners, but he’s a bad playoff performer), and rarely catches slack"
Paul George had averaged 30/8/5 on 50/42/89 shooting splits in his last 10 games.
"A lot of Bron's top highlights are negative, showing his split in the NBA world (even though r/nba slightly leans more to him compared to Twitter, IG and everywhere else)  Other players' 'highlights', when you look at them one-by-one, are probably more positive towards that player (ie Curry, Jokic). I bet some are a bit more negative (Paul George, Russ).  I think in your OG post you broke down specific players' highlights and compared them and discovered this kinda thing"
Games like this make me scared about the post season with Paul George. 5/21. What the fuck
Paul George gotta be a superstar for the clippers to have a chance. He’s just so hot and cold
Porter has space Jammed Paul George
"I agree, maybe not the Suns but all the other top teams definitely can. Relying on George Paul in the playoffs is a fool’s bet."
Paul George really *does not like* Campazzo
Paul George regular season vibes lol
Paul George is so hot and cold
Is he better than Paul george?
Paul George is nuts
"The best players on the best teams right now are Lebron KD Curry Harden AD Giannis Embiid Paul George Kawhi Lilliard Booker Gobert Jokic Middleton. Out of those names, 9/14 of them were drafted out of the top 5.  Out of the bottom third markets, the notable FA signings are   Hayward, Rozier to Charlotte  Conley to Jazz (was traded but got to choose where to be traded to),   Jordan Clarkson resigned (almost guaranteed 6th man of the year),  Gobert resigned (2x dpoy)  Spurs - LMA  Bucks - Resign Giannis, resign middleton, trade and resign jrue  okc - resigned PG but he left the next year so w/e  so most of the time they're not signing first team all-nba players in their prime, but they're resigning their all-nba draft picks and signing high level role players/low level all stars which is enough to compete if you draft well."
"So the year Paul George was out with an injury, George Hill also missed about half the season. Without Hill the Pacers were 12-27, with Hill they were 26-16, a much larger improvement than going from 24-11 to 38-9. Hill turned the Pacers from a top 3 pick pace, to a 50-win pace. While I think Hill was better, at the time, than even he gave himself credit, I don't think anyone is going to confuse him as a top 50 player all-time or MVP candidate.  I don't think this tells you as much as you think it does. Add any all-star level player to that squad would likely result in similar results. The difference between the Bulls two records could easily just be the difference between a hard and easy schedule."
"I think your missing a bunch of players and you're criteria is off a bit. Its usually 3&amp;D wings that people are after - guard defence is much less important than wing defence. I definitely would not have pat connaughton, lonzo ball or fred van vleet, or ddv on this list unless you'd be happy sticking one of them on paul george for a qtr (i would not). You missed Miles Bridges who I think is useful, also Trevor Ariza. Porzingis and JJJ would also be included in your criteria, but again they are centers so i wouldnt put them in."
"too much lost potential, to name a few: Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Vince Carter/Tracy McGrady, Derrick Rose, Paul George/Danny Granger, Gilbert Arenas...       not that the West didn't have its share, but these guys primes could've made the East much more competitive than the depressing Bud Hawks to Trash Bros era."
"im sure Paul George and most other people dont give a fuck, but his on court and off court actions are why I don't like the guy at all. Im sure I'm not the only one"
"For me personally.  Anthony Edwards - Fun to watch and great in interviews   Paul George - One of the smoothest looking games   Embiid - The way he dominates is just so funny, he gets calls at will and it just pisses off his opponents. I love it."
Paul George approves
"Look I get analytics are there, but facts are facts: Steve Nash is never going to be guarding Paul George calibur players like Chris does."
Paul George
"Not really, not having Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell + having by all accounts a superior Paul George makes their chances much greater. I also don't see Lue fucking up rotations as badly."
If this was Paul George it’d have 15k upvotes
"U GOTTA type that out or ppl on this sub will see ""he's not even the best player on his own team"" and start parroting that shit about AD, Paul George, Kyrie, Harden, etc."
Like a paul george move tbh
"Neither are AD, Paul George or Kyrie but they’re all top 15"
Based on what?  Paul George has arguably been the best player in the league post All-Star break.
Him &amp; Paul George want to retire there.
I could see him doing it if Paul George plays like an absolute bum and they lose in the first round
Paul George approves
Jayson Tatum is what Paul George thinks he is
"Love demar but sadly you are correct, he isn’t THAT guy. Toronto figured that out eventually amd traded him for somebody who is THAT guy. It sucks and I feel bad for demar because he is impossible to not cheer for and he is a star in his own right but he will always be that guy who isn’t quite special enough to be that franchise stud on a contender. He was so close for a couple years in Toronto that he almost made us Canadians believe he really could do it and lead us to championship contention. Both he and Paul George were stuck living with the reality that they weren’t good enough to get past the dudes of the world that really are THAT GUY even when they are among other superstars. Guys like Lebron and Steph and KD. Those three goats really ruined everyone else’s chances to be THAT GUY on other “contenders” for over a decade. Only other top 25 all time players like dirk, Timmy D and Kobe had a chance to look like THAT GUY for their teams when we were all being spoiled by seeing the transcendent talent of Lebron, KD and Steph."
"Mitchell definitely isn't. Gobert is fringe at best. Certainly not the level of superstardom that Curry-Durant, Paul-Harden, and Westbrook-George are."
&gt; Paul George - He made a mistake when it comes to his coaches daughter. It doesn’t impact our lives and there are tons of people who have done significantly worse that don’t receive nearly as much hate.  Is this really why people hate on Paul George? Pretty sure its way more the playoff performance
"this doesn't get old for me, I love when players get 50+ before Paul George and even better when they hit the big 6-0"
Paul George and Julius Randle.
Hmm several candidates imo.   KD - feel like for a lot of people it’s deeper than basketball. Like maybe it’s become trendy and some folk (Like Shannon Sharpe) take it too far.   Ben Simmons - Has the audacity to not be a great shooter but still believe he’s a great basketball player...I guess to some that’s valid?  Paul George - He made a mistake when it comes to his coaches daughter. It doesn’t impact our lives and there are tons of people who have done significantly worse that don’t receive nearly as much hate.   LeBron - This is only recently. And primarily about the police officer tweet that he walked back. It’s being blown way out of proportion and it’s kinda shameless.   Trae catches strays but he’s not popular enough for me to consider him overheated. He’s not in daily discussions where people decide to shit on him.
Paul George
I love Zion and maybe I should have given him more consideration he is the first player ever after all to average the amount of points he’s averaging while shooting over 60% from the field. I love that man but his seeding for sure made it difficult for me to put him over Paul George Lebron Kawhi Giannnjs Randle and Tatum
"Lmao just change to a Pacers flair, we’re so fucking irrelevant in the grand scheme of things that we basically can never get accused of bias**  **unless we talk about Paul George lol"
Paul George is considered a better player than Pau Gasol was lol
"Eh, not in the modern league though. Paul George and James Harden have kinda shown us how little contract length actually means.  If Giannis demanded out, even as soon as next year, he would likely get his way."
So Dame to Clippers in the 2022 off season to make a big 3 with Paul George and Kawhi? Going off the KG to Boston with Olshey use to working with the Clippers like McHale sending KG to the Celtics
"&gt; he was essentially the Paul George for the Lakers  What? The Paul George? Paul George to whom? To Kawhi right now?   I love Paul George, but Gasol was at least 1 level higher than him. I think you're underestimating Gasol now. He wasn't on a level like Kobe but Gasol was special."
"Pau Gasol was an amazing sidekick. Not to the tier Kobe was to Shaq, but he was essentially the Paul George for the Lakers at the time. His defense, passing, and scoring were all vital for the Lakers and he was incredibly efficient and had a versatile post and face up game."
"Did they actually try for Paul George or was it a pacers situation in which Paul George demanded they go get AD and the pacers told him “bruh we have monta Ellis and a handful of mid first, we literally can’t”"
"We never know what's gonna happen after this year. People thought OKC would re-go with Paul George, but he decided to leave, One guy might leave. Y'all with Fox and Haliburton are going to be scary."
Not top 10. Probably top 20. They were pushed to 7 games in 2 series. Including one against 22 year old Paul George as the best player
Sorry. Just can’t have a team that takes 7 games to beat a 22 year old Paul George lead team be a GOAT team. And than take 7 games to barely win the Finals. Look at my top 10. They absolutely smashed every one in the playoffs
"While some people may think that they have beef with one another, I think it's more of a respect thing, who knows maybe Paul George feel some type of way, because he wishes and knows if chris Paul was on his team, they would most likely win titles"
Paul George-Paul PGP
"they did have paul george and kawhi. overwhelming talent only works until you run into another team with high end talent. then strategy comes into play, then chemistry comes into play. there’s too many good teams in this league to just trust they’ll turn it on"
"dropped 50 before Paul ""Next question"" George"
"The choking was pretty embarrassing, I get that. The cockiness, I don't. The clip of Pat laughing on the bench last season came after Dame was talking alllll game. All game Dame was initiating everything, but of course Patrick Beverley is gonna get laughed at more than Dame on this sub. The drama that happened in the bubble was also pretty exaggerated. Marcus Morris trying to injure Luka was a really bad look, but again, Luka and KP were talking a LOT that whole series. The double standard is really impressive. A lot of hate stems from bandwagon Raptors fans who were upset that Kawhi left (although most Raps fans that I know aren't toxic and appreciated the ring for what it was) and Lakers fans who 1. don't want Lebron's legacy tainted by a team that's easy to make fun of and 2. are salty Paul George and Kawhi didn't sign with their team. Doesn't help that the media actively post things to rile people up and zero in on one team even though other teams act similarly. I think you'll find that most Clippers fans are more than humble."
so does this mean Chris Paul George Hill aint happening either?
Paul George is memed to death on here but he's a top 15 player.
Unless Paul George at some point said CP3 was hard to guard then it’s just bait for a sound bite. Wouldn’t call that a pure basketball question.
He should hyphenate it. Paul George-Paul
i would rathe take shai than paul george
"The hand in front of Paul George is not his hand. PG is extending his hand out to the side, it looks like he is going in for a hand shake/high five.   **Follow from George's right shoulder all the way down to his hand**  Edit: Nvm it's around the coach"
You can see Paul George holding his hand right hand out in this picture. Follow his right arm.
The Clippers got robbed giving him 190 mil. I'd literally drop him in 1 on 1 but yall wouldnt believe me because i didnt have the cameras on it was a different time. George Paul is a casual he should be getting paid the vet min after hitting the backboard.
Yeah the NBA totally disrespects Paul George. I mean the NBA gave him 190 mil to play basketball. They obviously have no respect for him.
"I can't speak for anyone else's NBA, but my NBA has no quarrel with George Paul"
Or is it Paul George vs everybody? Lol
Chris Paul or Paul George having beef isn’t strange at all.  Chris Paul has had beef with every star player in the league lmao.
"Paul George has to be the sorest loser. I respect his game, but everytime he loses he whines about the officials and that's not even including his infamous ""bad shot"" quote."
Does this put an end to the Chris Paul George fusion?
"If Paul George married CP3, he'd be Paul Paul"
Paul George: *That was bad manners*
"There are few things more satisfying than Paul George thinking he's coming off as an ultra competitive alpha, but in reality looking like a salty thin skinned bitch."
Paul George was one of my favorite players when he was on the Pacers but ever since he got traded to the Clitters from OKC he’s become a whiney lil bitch.
Marquese Chris Paul George Hill
"More like, why does Paul George have such a hard time saying the right thing?"
"""That's a bad joke"" -Paul George"
"Definitely think he's more likely than not to make it onto 3rd team, but it's going to be partially dependent on how certain players are categorized. I think he'll definitely be behind Giannis and Kawhi, since they're forwards without any question. After those, you've got a number of players that could realistically be classified either way like Jimmy Butler and Paul George, depending on how voting pans out. There's also the slim possibility some really fucky position labelling where guys like Luka and Bradley Beal get considered as forwards so that people can fit more guards in.   He 100% should make one, but you can never say lock when it comes to the lower end all-NBA players."
Lol y'all forgot what prime TMac played like and it shows. Paul george is like two tiers below TMac. Dude averaged 30+ ppg in a decade where that really meant 30+ ppg. Would take him over PG ten out of ten times.
Paul George is the nastiest skank bitch I've ever met. Do not trust him. He is a fugly slut.
"Are you kidding ??? What the **** are you talking about man ? You are a biggest looser i ever seen in my life ! You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you! You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good basketball player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And ""c""hris ""p""aul is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about lillard ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my basketball carrier, I am Officially inviting you to 1 on 1 match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all!  I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 NBA playoffs, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Paul George is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off..."
Paul George is so ducking trash bro cant wait till playoffs when hw fucking ruins another season all while getting paid the most its so fucking stupid
"I never said it meant anything. I never said he was a better scorer or player then TMac. I’m just saying Paul George is a more efficient scorer, which is a fact. Then you started replying with excuses.  My original comment is 2 sentences that say Paul George is a more efficient scorer (even regarding for era) and you kept making excuses which ultimately turned into you saying “being a more efficient scorer doesn’t mean anything.” If it doesn’t mean anything then why are you arguing about it and why do you care?"
Idk why you keep repeating yourself. I’m not making excuses. Numbers need context. Ray Allen is a more efficient scorer than Kobe Bryant but does that make him a better scorer or player?    Since you want to repeat yourself I will too. Saying Paul George is a more efficient scorer doesn’t really mean anything.
"Alright, but Paul George is still the more efficient scorer though.  TMac was better at other things, but Paul George was the more efficient scorer. You’re just making excuses. TMac was shooting a lot of 3’s given the era he played in. He was just only averaging 34% in his career.  “like no shit his efficiency looks higher.”  Yea, because it is higher. Even when compared amongst league averages like I originally said."
"TMac also came from an era where he averaged 40mpg for 5 straight seasons with usage% that Paul George only ever got to once in a single season. He got injuries and declined pretty rapidly before he even got to 30yo. As everyone as already pointed out, PG has longevity.   Saying Paul George is a more efficient scorer doesn’t really mean anything to me. 41.2% of the shots PG has taken since he came into the league are 3’s, like no shit his efficiency looks higher. TMac took 20% of his shots from 3 for his career."
"Just for this season. In no particular order: Lebron, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Jokic, Lillard, Zion, Embiid, Steph, CP3, Kawhi, Luka, Randle, Paul George"
I have him in my top 15 but again having Paul George above him isn’t ludicrous lol
It happens every year bro it was Lebron last year and Paul George in 2019 and LeBron the year before that. The last actually close MVP race was like in 2008 or 06

"Smh it was bad over Paul George, but so much worse over the shot-blocking prowess of Anthony Davis. Will Dame's shooting ever find its stride in this league?"
the blazers are clearly rivals with paul george
You brought up mvp not me.  I just told you KD only has one since 2014. No forward was a better player over that period except Lebron. Giannis has more recent accolades than Kd but he’s not a better player. Paul George was first team over Kd and he wasn’t better. Harden has more all nba first teams than Steph. It doesn’t mean what you think it does but you’re focused on that because there is no real argument that Jokic is a better player.
Paul George punching the air rn
"&gt; in a normal season I would have thought they would have faced a tougher playoff road than the east by having to face the Clippers instead of exhausted Rockets and Nuggets teams.   The Clippers had injury problems all last season, so if anything they had some benefit to Paul George and Pat Beverley getting time off to recuperate from their regular season injuries, as well as Kawhi getting extra time to rest his quad (of course, Beverley got hurt again in the bubble anyway though, because that seems to be the pattern with him). The Clippers would have been ill suited to play the Nuggets either way though. The break didn't cause their roster to have no one to match up with Jokic, that was their roster construction all along. I think to simply assume the Clippers would have beaten Denver if not for the break is a massive assumption. Look at them this year: the Clippers *still* have no answer for Jokic.   On top of that, right before the league shut down the Lakers had commanding wins over both the Bucks and the Clippers. If any team was really rolling before the shutdown it was the Lakers. They were just able to regain that momentum once the bubble happened, but what we saw from them was just more of the same, rather than them getting some boost. Keep in mind that the bubble cost the Lakers their starting point guard in Avery Bradley."
ESPN when Paul George gets all nba 3rd team: Paul George is now the unquestioned best all nba 3rd team player of all time
Paul George: That's a ~~bad~~ great shot.
Last night Paul George fell twice in the game. Kuzma hit the floor once as well. Pretty sure I saw Siakam fall too. Tacko Fall has obviously fell many times and is not injured. Basketball is a physical game. Many players have fell but not because of injuries
One player doesn’t cost you a series. It’s bot like the rest of the team should throw their hands up and go “gg guys!” If Paul George doesn’t hit shots. We ain’t expecting pg to be steph curry so him missing shots is just gonna happen. We got the squad around that can make up for it tho
"Nah, they really don’t. That’s just you trying to get under my skin. If you’re a person who feels embarrassment on an anonymous internet forum I genuinely feel bad for you.  I watched every game. Paul George played well in them. The stats simply back that up. Therefore, you’re wrong."
"&gt;You clearly only look at box scores not individual moments and games.  By far the most predictable response you could have given, congrats! This is pretty much what people say when objective, factual information don’t agree with their biased, delusional world view.  Paul George is a very good player in the playoffs. You’re objectively wrong.  &gt;Please stop you are embarassing the Raptors fanbase. Watch some games ffs  Weird, I don’t feel embarrassed and I doubt any Raptors fans do either. The only embarrassing thing occurring in this conversation is you basing your basketball opinions off memes and screeching “reeee you don’t watch games” when the facts prove you wrong."
"Paul george not shitting the bed  in the playoffs is as likely as Julius being finals MVP. Very much a longshot, but we might see it in a full moon"
"I actually do, I just don’t base my opinions off playoff poo poo memes like you do.  Against the Nuggets he averaged a respectable 21 ppg on 58 TS%. Not elite, but you can absolutely classify that as playing well.  Against the Blazers in 2019 Paul George averaged 28.6 ppg on 58.3 TS%. You probably only watched Dame’s game winner, which is why you think PG played poorly overall.  His only actual poor series was against the Jazz.  Get knowledgable."
Clippers are not winning the title ever sad to say. Paul George has bad energy and its killing the mojo on that team.
Zion Williamson and Paul George
"Caruso didn't flop, Paul George was stepping on his foot. There was nothing he could do."

"We’re not the best but I’m honestly just happy that we’re in the conversation now after years of having the most painful bench in the planet.   Shakes become a legitimately good 6 man when he’s put in an offball situation.   George Hill plays exactly how you want a bench Pg to play.   Thybulle is as elite as it gets on defense and should be on the 2nd team for All Defense.   Korkmaz seems to have finally figured it out with a bit more consistency and can catch fire from deep while also handling the ball surprisingly well recently.   Dwight is having a historically good rebounding season by minutes played. Has finally been the guy who can somewhat hold down the fort when Embiid is out.   Tyrese Maxey isn’t needed for big minutes, but when the game gets sluggish, his pace of play has provided some awesome moments.   Tolliver can be a body when needed. Wont bring much to the table but won’t actively hurt the team.   Scott sadly has taken a step back and seems to be cooked.   Paul Reed was Gleague ROTY and MVP and has been electric in garbage time lol  And Isaiah Joe’s shot has translated and should be ready to take on more minutes next year assuming Korkmaz leaves for more money.   Combo of smart signings, trades and draft picks have given us our first legitimate + bench in a very long time"
"Hey /u/Morezingis, and welcome to /r/nba. Our sub is devoted to one thing and one thing only: serious discussion of the National Basketball Association. You'll find posts deconstructing play schemes, deep analysis of players, and statistical insights of both teams and individuals. The sub isn't for everyone, so if you're looking for a place to make jokes, I suggest you join r/nbaforchildren. This sub is reserved for serious discussion about a game we hold sacred.  That said, as per your request, here is what you might call a short ""book"" that should give you some context as to the meaning of the above comments.  To preface, the players involved in the video are Alex ""Robinson"" Caruso and Paul ""No OT"" George. To properly understand the players, and their reputations by NBA fans, you have to understand a little about their backgrounds.  Caruso's journey to the NBA is one of the most interesting in league history. Much like the titular character in the novel *Robinson Crusoe* –– and also the genesis of Alex's nickname -- Caruso was involved in a plane crash in South America as a child, where the survivors were stranded for three days before being rescued. Because of his seat location on the plane near the engine, he experienced severe burns to his forehead, leaving him unable to grow hair follicles and creating a balding look at a young age. Miraculously, the rest of his body was unharmed.  In his autobiography, *Ernie's Son* -- an homage to his father, Ernie ""Elevator"" Johnson, who was a legendary NBA player in his own right -- Caruso talks about how the near-death experience was the single most pivotal moment in his life. He decided then and there that he wanted more out of life and set his goal to one day play in the NBA like his father.  Both Caruso's heartwarming journey to the NBA and his style of play on the court have made him a fan favorite. And as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, he is well-placed on one of the most beloved teams in the league, by fans and non-fans alike.  If there were an ""opposite"" of Alex Caruso -- a bizarro world version that represents everything he is *not*, if you will -- it would be Paul ""No OT"" George.  A touted five-star recruit, George spent his high school years playing for AAU team ""Pump and Run"", a name he coined to show his support of abandoning women after having sex with them. After a brief stint in college, George declared for the NBA draft and was selected by the Indiana Pacers.  If you don't know, the Indiana Pacers are likely the most hated team in the NBA due to their perennial success. With a record 18 NBA Championships, including five back-to-back wins from 2013-2017, the Pacers are always in contention. This image isn't helped by the fact the team is located in Indianapolis, considered one of the most snobby cities in the country.  But the hate for Paul George in particular comes from his antics on the court. A showboater who never seems to stop, he constantly taunts opponents which is only made worse by his stellar performance in late game situations and the playoffs. George has made a league-record 78 game winning buzzer beaters in his career, while missing only three. Not about to miss out on an opportunity, George subsequently went on to star in a Gatorade commercial in which he sinks a buzzer beating shot, turns to the camera, and says ""No OT tonight"". Soon after, he became known as Paul ""No OT"" George to his fans, which are few and far between.  So there you have it. The history of the most beloved and hated player in the NBA right now. It was a bit short of a full book, but I hope I helped you learn something."
"You're time was like 2012 to 2015. The Paul george, George Hill, roy Hibbert, Andre Bynum. Like on paper, that team could do something. Definitely missing another star element but things were looking like you could take down the heat. And then... The ankle break and Roy Hibbert forgot how to be tall"
Paul George once said in an interview. That when the time comes that he will talk about the endig of his time with the pacers. And he said that a lot of people will be surprised what really went down.
"Paul George is quietly having an all time great non-Curry 3point shooting season. He's averaging as many attempts as Klay with comparable accuracy, but only 66% of his 3s are assisted (compared to Klay's 91%)."
"Bro...trust me, I know about Paul George in the playoffs last year as well as anybody (check flair) but the man gets ludicrously disrespected in regards to playoff performance. It’s such a good indication of how short the sports worlds’ memory can be. Like how the hell can people forget what he did in Indiana? If it wasn’t for one of the best rosters ever assembled, he would’ve gotten that pacers team to the finals multiple times. Then he’s a legitimate top 3 mvp candidate in OKC, gets beat on one of the greatest most ludicrous buzzer beaters ever, has a good first regular season in la, does shitty in the playoffs (I’d argue he was not even close to the sole reason we beat you guys), has honestly low key carried the clips at a lot of points this year, and the narrative is he hasn’t proven it in the playoffs. Absurd."
"On Tuesday, Paul George hit a three going into a time out and they were just like “he’s hitting a lot of shots now but we haven’t seen that in the playoffs.” And then they just went to commercial."
*cums*  Paul George: That's a bad shot
"He carries expectations because he's always had better teammates?? Dame's best teammate in the last 7 years wouldn't even crack Russ's top5. Give him 2 years of prime Paul George and he's getting out of the first round at least , much more than you can say about Westbrook."
I was explaining what I thought was the posters intent.  I know Paul George sure did a number on Hibbert with this kind of thing
"Good thing the nets have 3 superstar talents. I would’ve considered Paul George and Kawhi 2 top 10 talents last season and look where they landed. It’s not about the best guys playing together, it’s about the team building chemistry and ALL playing together. Lebron is the ultimate glue. That’s what leads him and your team making it to the finals."
Kawhi was super dominant against Dallas. It just got overshadowed by Paul George playing like garbage
Hope Paul George Redemption Arc continues into the playoffs
"My favorite current player and the reason why I'm a Kings' fan. Him and Rondo going to the Kings did it for me and now they're back on the same team. My cousins' favorite player is Paul George too, so we are both supporting the same team for the first time and it's cool."
PAUL GEORGE sounds in the background
"Yeah definitely plays bigger than his size, probably part of his football background. He could still be growing too since he's only 19, like Paul George or Giannis who got taller after a few years in the league.  I was so high on Edwards last year (when everyone in r/nbadraft was bashing him), one of the reasons was that he didn't start playing basketball fulltime until HS, and within 3-4 years became the #1 prospect in his class over kids who were playing and had personal trainers their whole lives. To me its a sign that he can have a rapid development curve if he puts in the work.. sky is the limit!"
Paul George lookin more like John Ringo tonight  He’s not actually but I just came up with that and I wanted an excuse to use it
Okay gonna get out the tired Clippers jokes now before I turn off the game. Gonna give as much effort as Drummond  Lol Clippers  Blown 3-1 lead  Paul George hit the side of the backboard
I’d honestly be curious as to how many of the people saying the bubble doesn’t count also constantly hate on Paul George or Giannis for “choking” or whatever
2 weeks from now in the playoffs....    [Highlight] Paul George from the top of the arc clangs wide open 3 off side of backboard going 1 of 7 from the 3 point line.
Paul George throwing weird passes all over the place.
Paul George did it too. I love being a pacers fan and knowing I can’t get attached to our all stars as they all will leave us. God bless Reggie Miller.
Paul George.
"Using regular season games as an argument for how a series will go. Lmfao. Bucks are absolutely better than the Clippers. Clips defense ain't that good and they don't have the personnel to bother Giannis. And Paul George in a finals environment honestly sounds like a nightmare.   I don't think Bud is very good, but he's certainly better than Ty Lue."
"Fucking would if we can. The man can play D if locked in. People forgot when paul george was an mvp candidate, russ was out there focusing more on the defensive end and he was fucking amazing"
Paul George doesn’t have the same build as Kobe wtf Kobe was shorter and skinnier. Ty Lue just picked out some random basketball terms
"They still leave Westbrook somewhat open and dare him to shoot though.   He’s gotta make those, but none of them are “bad shots” as Paul George would call them."
"I understand what you're saying. But the ""20ppg"" comment was simply conjecture. I was saying something simple and true, if he takes more shots he will score more points. More points will contribute to the production of his team. I'm not saying points are the most important thing. Ben is a 3 time allstar for a reason. I think he is a talented player and l think he has earned all of those spots and more.  Ben Simmons certainly does enough to win games, that's why Philly wins games. Two years ago they were a shot away from the ECF.   I agree shooting is vauble, I'm a shooter myself haha, but it is not so important that he should start settling or taking shots without proper practice. I'm not saying you're suggesting that, but many have. Ben has all of the physical tools to be a downhill scorer. He does not need a 3-point shot to be great now. I think he may become one in the future and l think it will be great for him.  Finding shooters is not that difficult, the 76ers have Tobias, Seth, Shake, and Green. Of course you need to put shooters to supplement him, but that isn't difficult to do. Teams do it for LeBron, Harden, Luka, and Giannis. They also do it for Ben. If you have the ball in your hands and you are a player that generates gravity then having shooters will relieve pressure. Ben is a master at relieving pressure.   I did say having a midrange shot will make him more of an immediate threat. I stand by that.   I think Ben has a rarer more vauble skill than shooting. Ben can make plays for his teammates. Plenty of times we've seen the best shooter in college/europe struggle to adjust to the NBA but guys who can handle/pass/create for others stick around do well. Rubio and Jimmer came into the NBA at the same time Rubio shot horribly and is still in the NBA today. Rondo, Ben Simmons, and Lonzo all can facilitate and of course there are other factors involved but it's obvious it's a big factor. You can't really teach IQ and Passing but one can become a great shooter. It is certainly easier.   The argument you made about the playoff is interesting. With that position players like Paul George, AD, Harden, and Lillard should be perfect for the playoffs. This statement isn't meant to be a redherring either l am genuinely curious why you think it is the case that their teams don't produce in the playoffs."
"Do y'all just rewrite history about the Pacers? That wasn't the Pacers pick and if it was, why would they draft Kawhi, a wing, when they already had Danny Granger and Paul George? There was no way to predict the future of those two. If it was actually their pick there is a 0% chance they draft a 3rd wing when they needed a PG"
"There's been like 4 threads in the past week calling Westbrook one of the best pgs ever. Then there were some threads to counter that, and this is a response to those. Russ and Paul George are similar level players. But nobody acts like Paul George is an all time great."
Kawhi barely won a playoff series with Paul George on his team
"2020 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 10 minutes per game. 2019 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 25 minutes per game. They did not have a 'better version' of Terrance Ferguson because he was never good. They just did not have anyone at all better than him to play. I'm sorry, but even if your starters consist of Paul George and Russell Westbrook, if your #7 guy is 25 mpg of Terrance Ferguson you are a terribly constructed roster. Period.  Steven Adams averaged 3 less points, Jerami Grant averaged 2 less points, Dennis Schroder averaged 2 less points, Terrance Ferguson averaged 2 less points, Markief Morris averaged 2 less points... all than their regular season averages. The Thunder lost 2 games by 5 points or less, despite getting 11 less PPG of production from their already atrocious bench outside of Schroder.  2020: Shai lost 3, CP3 gained 4, Schroder lost 1.5, Gallo lost 4, Adams lost 1, Dort gained 6, Bazley gained 1, for a net gain of .5 PPG.  So yeah, I'd say losing 11 PPG of production for the 2019 squad while the 2020 squad lost nothing is a pretty big deal. The 2020 squad was also a fair bit better defensively in 2020 than 2019, and defense means more in the playoffs. The 2019 squad's strength was scoring, and the rest of the squad went cold in the playoffs. Russ and PG13 showed up and did their jobs. The bench didn't.  Cp3's run was very impressive, but ultimately he had a deeper roster and better load distribution among the supporting cast."
Westbrook couldn’t even win a playoff series with Paul George on his team.
"&gt; kd and harden when they were babies  KD was one of the best players in the league and harden was a 16/4/4 on 66% TS guy  &gt; OKC w infamous playoff choker Paul George  Right.. he’s the infamous choker.. not russ who played much worse both times and lost them the series   &gt; harden a second time in a gimmick offense that didn’t work  Oh please. The guy couldn’t shoot so we got rid of the center to play 5 out and give him a spread floor. Then in the playoffs he is literally not even fucking defended while harden was doubled and puts up 17 and 4 on 40% TS and loses us the series. The only thing that didn’t work was him lol, he was what was wrong with the team. Stop deflecting blame on others, it’s westbrook. He’s trash."
"Yeah he's only played with KD, Harden, Paul George, Bradley Beal, Carmelo Anthony, Oladipo, Sabonis, Ibaka, Derek Fisher and who knows however many other all time greats"
"Westbrook has played with KD, Harden twice, Paul George, and Bradley Beal. Stop making it seem like he played with scrubs. He's had ample opportunity to play with elite, creme of the crop players. Meanwhile, Dame best teammate was LMA while Giannis only has Khris Middleton. A good number of guys would kill to have the teammates he's had."
"I equate the Pacers to the Blazers. Even when Paul George was there, the rest of the roster just wasn’t good enough. Reminds me of Portland now with Lillard, and Stotts is going to be fired barring some miracle playoff run. The most productive  FAs Portland has had the last five years or so are both bench players, Melo and Kanter. Indianapolis and Portland simply aren’t going to get a FA that makes them a true contender."
paul george also has this problem. but some guys like their midranges. i guess it maybe helps them get into rhythm
Before he got hurt I would consider Paul George pretty much equal to Kahwai.
"I literally almost specifically excluded Zach Lavine because I think he’s clearly on the outside of the great young guards lmao.  Guys like Lamelo, Luka, Morant, Murray and Trae Young are reading and playing the game at an insanely high level that we’ve never really seen before. At least, not this much talent clustered in one generation of players. They’re still young and don’t necessarily know how to win yet, so they shouldn’t be on any all-time list yet of course. But in their primes they’ll just be way more advanced than anyone who’s prime occurred pre-2012 or so.  I’m not arguing we should reconfigure out GOAT lists or whatever, because how good guys were *in their era* is important. And I would assume that if AI was a rookie in 2018 and played out his career over the next 10+ years he’d end up a way more skilled player than he was in the early 2000s.  I’m just generally of the belief that if aliens challenged humans to a “Fate Of The World” basketball game and offered us a time machine to select any player from any year we wanted, something like 95% of the team should be current guys. Given his passing, shooting and athleticism, peak Paul George is probably a good deal better than like peak Scottie pippen or Clyde or whatever. That doesn’t mean we should rank him higher all time, just that if the world depended on it I’d pick him over almost anyone from the 90s. And I think PG is at best like the 9th best player of the past 5ish years."
"It's quite the opposite. The bar for Russ is sky high for some weird reason.  Most disappointing series was the Utah series that was lost primarily because we played Melo more than we played Jerami Grant.  Their 2nd year, Paul George literally lost his fucking shoulders and we didn't find out that til afterwards, that ONCE AGAIN, Russ was playing hurt.  He doesn't need a fucking finals mvp. He needs good health, and as the original argument stated, a better team surrounding him.  I'm not sure how you guys are arguing this shit."
but that is paul george recruiting anthony davis though. that the trade would be unlikely (but not “physically impossible”) is another question altogether
[it wasn’t tho](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2923333-anthony-davis-confirms-he-talked-to-paul-george-about-teaming-up-on-pacers)
[maybe Paul George was right](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kapsvy/paul_george_on_why_he_left_the_pacers_its_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
"Lol I guess the bar for Westbrook is so low now that we can't expect him to win more than 2 games in the first round even with Paul George, a better player, next to him. Give me a fucking break. If he needs a Finals MVP next to him to get out of the first round (or even make the playoffs this year lmao), maybe he isn't as good as you think he is."
"&gt; still playing the position.  Again, this even further the point. He's a passing SF who controls the ball, I'm not denying that, but he's not a Point Guard, he was not playing the position and he especially wasn't viewed that way.   2016 for example, here were the East Starters:   - Dwayne Wade - Kyle Lowry  - Lebron James - Paul George  - Carmelo Anthony   There are two people on that list far more qualified to be labelled a Point Guard then Lebron. And it's ridiculous to act like that's not obvious.   Just because Lebron passes, does not mean he's a point guard in comparison to the leagues *actual point guards*. He's a Small Forward whose a great passer."
"2018 Thunder was just as good as the 2016 Thunder if you take out Paul George and KD. With George they lost in the first round. With KD they push the 73 win Warriors to 7.  The 2018 Thunder had Melo, Patrick Patterson, Jermi Grant, and Corey Brewer. That was much better than 2016 with Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka.   2014 KD carried OKC to almost 60 games with Russ missing half the season and the other half playing limited minutes."
Isn’t that why Paul George left ?
Remember when Paul George took heatles to 7 games man..... Idk why pacers fo is ok with mediocrity
Transbronsexuals= Lebron haters  Jordashians = Jordan fans Currystani Radicals = Curry fans  KD= snake  Pandemic to Pfizer P= Paul George  Nursing shoes = Kawhi Leonard
"The author makes that point well in the article:  &gt; Westbrook has played with two full-fledged MVPs in Kevin Durant and James Harden. Paul George finished third in one of his seasons alongside Westbrook. In fact, it could be argued that outside of his 2016-17 MVP season, Westbrook has never even been the best player on his own team. Bradley Beal holds that distinction now in Washington."
"Ya'll are in this thread acting like Paul George, Harden and Beal have won championships without Russ??  Ya'll are acting like KD didn't join one of the greatest teams of all time to get his rings??"
"Lmao it's funny to see an NBA star playing GTA RP.   There were rumors about Paul George getting on NoPixel, which would be crazy. I'm not sure if that was an April Fools thing though"
Paul George replaced KD in OKC. They lost in the first round.
Which rounds bro? And what happened when Curry went out against the 2019 defensive juggernaut in the clippers (bottom 10 defense)? Oh Durant was tasked to handle the ball and managed more than a turnover per assists.   It’s not a mystery why kerr never ever trusted him with ball deep into the post season that was left to Draymond and Curry. Golly gee wonder why. Replace any Sf like kawhi or paul George into KD’s spot and of course they shine. Lol
"You see how PG did with Kawhi?  Paul George is a beast, but he’s not a contender-level player himself either.   PG and Russ are a first/second round showcase player."
"Well so far he’s had KD, Harden, Paul George as his teammates so what’s your point?"
"Most to gain in order: CP3, Giannis, Joker, Kawhi , Paul George       Most to lose: KD, Kyrie and Harden lol"
1. Chris Paul  2. Damian Lillard  3. Giannis  4. James Harden (he'd be #1 if Durant wasn't on his team)  5. Paul George
"On the flipside, Paul George and Harden might have the most to prove as far as superstars in the postseason. Idk Cinco de Drinko, I probably forgot someone hella obvious lol"
That year itself was fantastic. Amazing effort from the team and a spirited run to end Reggies career.  The following year we went down the club rio/Tinsley sinus infection/artest trade demand/peja era into the mediocre teams headlined by granger era then we came out of it with Paul George. At no point in that timeline did we have a team that sucks and doesn’t give a shit. That’s what we have right now.
Hilariously enough in 2016 Westbrook put up all time box score metrics and im sure the impact is beyond that as well. Then he had a player that provides pressure to the floor anywhere he steps with or without the ball.    MPJ is the Durant pro type wing that cannot create at a high level without turning the ball over (like paul George) but can “score at will”
"Paul George the only guy I know disrespected by fans, media, and other players"
Paul George
"Paul George literally just did that. Unfortunately years left doesn't mean anything in the current NBA, besides that teams have to give up assets for that player instead of signing them into cap space."
1.Dlo 2.Lebron 3.Tatum  4.Paul George 5. Ant
Paul George  Tyrese Halliburton  Michael porter jr Damian lillard  Kyrie Irving
Imagine thinking paul george is better than jayson tatum. You're just salty you could have had him instead of markelle fultz
Paul George should not make it
lol Tatum is much better than Paul George
"Doc got fired, Paul George got a max extension"
??? Paul George is 6’8 right now
"Apparently Paul George was responsible for the loss vs the Nuggets when in fact, yll lost beacuse of Doc's horrible defensive game plan vs Jokic.   So how is this any different? Giannis was pathetic vs the Raptors, he avg something like 22ppg @52% TS.  If it was any other player coming of an MVP avg those kind of stats, everyone would still complain about it today."
Easily Paul George
Paul George?
Want me to source quotes of Kawhi and Paul George both saying they wanted to play in LA?  At this point you will argue anything if you act like location had nothing to do with them both going to LA.
"Hayward should have gone higher  Paul George played for the Fresno State Bulldogs in the Mountain West Conference so nobody was watching him. Even then, he took a while to develop into a star"

"I like to think of them in a tier list like in smash bros or something. The players you mentioned are S tier (not sure why S is higher than A), and guys like Klay Thompson, Kyrie, Paul George are A tier. There's no reason the top tier has to be restricted to five players."
Paul George rules. Love him
"That sounds awesome. I wish I would watch Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, and Porzingis for $40. What a deal!"
"Westbrook has won less playoff series as the best player on his team than Baron Davis (no disrespect). He isn't a winning player. ZERO playoff series wins as the best player on his team, remember that. That includes when he had Paul George coming #3 in MVP voting on his team."
Watching curry reminds me of all the same lackadaisical turnovers Paul George has. Just head scratching. Loose dribbles or too much flare
True that last year was pretty close even with Zingis out.  Like you were referring to it depends on if Paul George plays like he did last year
"The Paul George hate is especially weird because he’s not a top 10 player. He’s not Harden, LeBron, KD, etc. No one expects that of him, nor should they. Yet he gets more criticism than the guy who SHOULD have those expectations, Kawhi"
You know who barely gets criticized? Kawhi Leonard. That dude gets to choke away a 3-1 lead and everyone just shits on Paul George. It's kind of sad tbh
No. First of all we don’t know how Klay’s gonna look. Could be like John Wall or KD. Might take him a year or so like Gordon Hayward and Paul George. So no.
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"Clippers will absolutely sign and trade Kawhi if he wants out, and if Kawhi goes to the Knicks outright, they will absolutely dump Paul George."
Paul George if the Clippers flame out in the first round and Kawhi leaves to Miami/New York.
a) Kawhi isn't getting sign and traded.  b) You don't trade your win-now Paul George for young guys and there's no way Kawhi signs off on that. He wants to win.
They should ask for Kawhi or Paul George if the Clippers lose in the first round
It's almost Paul George hating season again. Lord give me another stretch of poor play from this man. Last year's memes were truly gorgeous.
"""It was a bad shot""- Paul George"
That was some 2020 Paul George (alias: Pandemic P) shit yikes
Gave me Paul George vibes
The only right answer to this is Paul George
1.Kawhi  2. Paul George  3. Marcus Morriss  4. Zubac  5. Luke Kennard  6. Terrence Mann  7. Patrick Beverly  8. Rajon Rondo  9. Ibaka   10.Reggie Jackson
"Some combination of “star-power,” crazy talent, and the ability to make teammates better. I would say the cutoff for “superstar” level player in the NBA is Paul George. He is, but anyone worse than him isn’t, at least to me"
His role as a 3&amp;D wing? Except he can’t shoot consistently? He’s a slasher and wants to be like a Paul George star player except he can’t shot create and can’t finish at the rim. Along with bad BBIQ.  Oubre isn’t really a fit to be a starter on most teams
I draw the line at Paul George
Lol the 2014 ECF was pretty much a blow out for the Heat and would have been over in 5 if Paul George didn’t go crazy in game 5
"I'm rooting for you guys if it counts for anything. I don't wish failure on any former Paver, including Paul George."
"Or maybe it's because he averaged 6 fewer points on a team that only won one extra game despite adding Paul George. The way some of you talk about triple double narrative, you'd think he won averaging 10/10/10 instead of **31**/10/10"
"Kyrie is **really** good value, honestly.    &amp;#x200B;  I guess Paul George is even better."
"Also I’m not sure forcing him into pg is a good thing   He’s a good playmaker and can easily do that role as a wing. But his passes and ball handling can be sloppy, plus with the fact that his jumpshot isn’t there yet and most ball dominant points need to hit their own jumpshot off the dribble   Not sure if this is his own will or the teams but even in the g league, he plays insanely ball dominant. Like how Harden, Russ and Wall play. Coming out of college and his rookie year, a wing with ability to get to his spots and be a smart playmaker is what he is more naturally able to do. Sort of like Paul George, without the insanely crisp jumper"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
please let it not be Paul George                 Edit: yay

"Not sure about it , i mean heater don't need reason but the situation is different , teams need to build a wall to stop Giannis also even though the PG slander get taken too far, Paul George sometimes talk a little bit too much but I don't blame him for being confident in himself."
paul george - victor oladipo
Now theyre saying paul George for 3
Kawhi has two finals MVPs. He doesn’t have anything left to prove. It’s just salt from Lakers fans because Kawhi and Paul George didn’t join them like they were rumored to.
"Just Marcus Morris, Montrezl Harrell, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George."
"No it wasn't Paul George, they were injured and jr Smith and Jason Kidd  shit the bed jr Smith averaged 18/5/3 in the regular season on 42/37/76 shooting vs the pacers 13/5/2 on 27/26/76 shooting   Jason Kidd averaged 0 points he didn't score once 2 rebounds and 2 assists on 0/0/0 shooting thats after averaging 6/4/4/2 on 38/35/83 shooting in the regular   Amare Stoudemire missed the series   Melo averaged 29/8/2 on 43/35/87 shooting   Paul George averaged 19/7/5 on 39/26/60 shooting"
"I'm not your buddy, pal.  To most people it looks like he twisted his ankle and is heading to the bench. Marcus Smart just this week literally turned his ankle and had to be taken out of the game, and returned a quarter later.  Is it bad form to cheer even if you think a guy's just heading to the bench with a mild ankle twist? Yeah. Is it as evil as the media made it out to be? Not even close.  You watch it again, by the time it's clear he's heading to the locker room and not the bench (literally less than 60 seconds after he first falls down) the Raptors fans are cheering in support of him.  &gt;I'm absolutely certain that if it was a Paul George or Gordon Hayward or Jamal Murray type injury where they're clearly crying in pain that they would have quieted down almost immediately.  Do you disagree with this?"
"I said this at the time, and I'll say it again. ""Raptors fans cheered at KD tearing his Achilles!"" is such a stupid, overblown, lazy, and frankly false narrative.  [Watch the replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYrA30qcvK4). Is every fan in attendance supposed to have X-ray vision? For 99% of the fans in the arena, it looks like KD fumbles the ball, leading to a turnover and fast-break. *Any* home arena in the Finals is gonna go crazy over that.  As the fast-break is happening, KD is sitting on the ground, looking dejected but not obviously in any significant pain. He's helped up by his teammates literally 20 seconds after he falls down and hobbles around, again it's totally reasonable for 99% of fans in the arena (possible exception of those sitting courtside) to think that he twisted his ankle a bit and is salty about turning the ball over.  After the severity of the injury became clear and Raptors players told the crowd to quiet down they quickly complied.  I'm absolutely certain that if it was a Paul George or Gordon Hayward or Jamal Murray type injury where they're clearly crying in pain that they would have quieted down almost immediately.  It was an intense sequence that lasted just a couple minutes in a Finals game where fans got hyped over what for all intents and purposes looks like a routine stumble, turnover, fast-break, and quieted down after realizing how bad it was. The next day, after *everyone* knew how bad the injury was, a bunch of nephews on the internet took a couple of 30s clips of Raptors fans cheering juxtaposed with KD sitting on the ground to try and paint the Raptors fanbase as a bunch of evil dicks."
"It's this 100, if Paul George said this there'd be memes about him arrogantly calling the Nuggets wounded animals and shit"
"Plan A longshots: Harden, Giannis, Embiid, etc.   Plan B stars: Beal, Paul George, etc  Plan C pseudo-stars: Hayward, Lonzo, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, etc."
"You mean with a Paul George who was injured half of season and a Tingus Pingus who actually played to his contract for the first bunch of games?  last years mavs team was was better than this year’s and last year’s clippers were worse than this years, so idk man you can do the math"
"What other options would be there, a jimmy butler/Paul George level player? That’s a long way from what they currently have now"
Imagine Paul George saying this same shit about Lebron. What do you think the reaction would be?
That was a bad shot  -Paul George probably
"Once Paul George gets jingeld again, people will take you seriously, I gaurantee it."
"saying this is a lebron sub like you can't say anything bad about him is the dumbest fucking narrative  nobody has as many haters as he does. People really say Paul george and Kyrie are more hated.   https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n3v0h1/highlight_lebron_james_grabs_his_head_after/?sort=new  just look at this thread and how much bron pisses these guys off. He has threads like this all the time.   &gt; How people still think this dude is the best ever is beyond me. He flops, he cries, if its not going his way he shrinks. So sick of seeing him complain till he gets his calls.   42 upvotes. This place is full of kids and is no better than twitter"
You do know Paul George is like the 4th guy Kawhi tried to recruit right? It was reported he asked butler and Durant to come join as well
&gt; So there’s nothing wrong with Bron asking AD to come help support him then right?  He tried to recruit others and AD is a step above Paul George. If Lebron just asked George that would've been fine.
Just trying to do the opposite of Paul George
"Why did Lebron try to recruit Davis, Kawhi, and Paul George?"
"Then why recruit Davis, Kawhi, and Paul George?"
"&gt;So it’s players recruiting others that make super teams? Uhhhh...  Well yeah. That's how it started with the Heat. Davis made it a Super Team, and to think Lebron also wanted Kawhi or Paul George. That's as bad as KD."
"That take doesn’t inherently mean that Dame is on the same level or can directly replace Curry... if you replace KD with Paul George in 2017 and 2018 the warriors would still win. Does that mean I think Paul George is as good as KD? No not at all it just means I think the team was so good that getting 80% of KD would still get them wins. If you replace Steph in 2015 with a player at 80% of his production would they still win? Idk maybe I would probably say no I think Steph was super important but what about 90-95%... well then I’d say yeah they probably still win. The debate then becomes if Dame is at 90-95% of Curry production, which sure maybe you say no but it can at least be a discussion and debate. Trust me I’ve seen some dumb Portland fan takes as well but it doesn’t help if you don’t even understand what the take actually is lol"
"Paul George, probably: ""That's a bad shot"""
"I need you to point out to me the people that saw that stat about notoriously poor clutch shot taker Paul George and thought ""there's no way this is possible"""
"Paul ""actual player"" George: ""That's a bad shot."""
Paul George disappears in the play offs clippers have never made WCF. Stop playing money ball look at the history books. Just a big fat L here. I’ll send this post back to you next month.
Paul George shaking his head rn
“That’s a good shot.” — Steph “Not Paul George” Curry
"What effort did he make besides being a free agent and signing with the Clip Show?  He wants a piece of LeBron and if the Clips flop again, he’ll join the Warriors.  What’s he doing in LA now besides taking a 45 min helicopter ride from LA to SD everyday and even that’s been a hassle for him.  He backed the wrong horse with George Paul, he knows it, and the Clips won’t be able to bring another star in."
"They have Paul George, we have Joe Ingles.  Ya, we have a chance."
"The Paul George special, sadly"
I just think it’s fucking hilarious how hitting the side of the backboard is now universally known as a Paul George
Paul George with a smile on his face Caruso
Where is Paul George lol
Imagine if Paul George shot that
"&gt;Paul George bribed a stripper with $1 million to abort her baby  Just for context for people, they are married now."
"I don't know why this is such a sticking point for people. Teams aren't just pg-sg-sf-pf-c anymore. LeBron and Kyrie were practically 2 pg's years ago, idk why people are *still* acting like whether harden is technically a pg or a shooting guard even matters. Nba really just needs to go to g-f-c or even just g-f (me too tbh ✌️😔✌️), some teams have a fairly archetypical 1-5 lineup but more and more don't and it's pointless to argue dumb ass semantics like this.   Like seriously aside from size what is the difference between a pg and a sg? (Ignoring that Ben Simmons is literally 6'10"" and indisputably the pg of the 6ers) ...handling the ball? ok so Westbrook and Harden clearly don't fit that stereotype or HOU was playing 2 pg's but for some reason people act like that is impossible lmao.  Every position can play primary ball handler-- you're either a perimeter player, an inside player, or both. Wings guards and forwards/centers should just be how players are grouped imo. PG (edit: Paul George sorry) is a shooting guard or a small forward depending on [reasons]... But why??"
"Hardens alright in my book, if you wanna go to strip clubs in your off time fine whatever floats your boat. Paul George on the other hand is just a complete scumbag"
"Paul George bribed a stripper with $1 million to abort her baby when he was in Indiana, this was before everything that happened with doc river’s daughter"
"I haven't watched a ton of Clipper games lately but I'm really shocked to hear that they're using Paul George to run point for them. It's not like PG sucks or something, but that's asking a guy to now try to fill an important role that he has very little experience with. I feel like they tried this last year with Kawhi, and while it wasn't a disaster, that's not something that a player can just pick up in their late 20s and excel at over the course of a few months. If PG is committing a bunch of turnovers it's really to be expected. It seems like a bad idea."
They are meaningless. You can find conflicting posts and takes both getting upvoted on the same day and even in the same hour. I've seen it many time with Paul George. I've seen it with LeBron regularly. I saw it with Lloyd Pierce etc etc. Stop reading so deeply into everything and acting like there needs to be agreements on anything.
Posts that shit on Paul George get upvoted on the same day and sometimes even in the same hour as posts getting upvoted that appreciate him. Hot takes get upvoted and you can find the same take downvoted to hell down below it because they phrased it a little differently or even just because a different group of people were exposed to it than the one that upvoted the popular comment. If you use upvotes as a metric for anything idk what to tell you.
It’s like playoff P if Paul George didn’t take the heatles to 7 games.
"It’s not that Paul George isn’t good , he is a jump shooter with decent play making . But he’s good on defense . There’s going to be times where there is slumps"
"If the Clippers took him, he’d be in Oklahoma right now   In fact they would have had to add more picks in the Paul George deal because he wouldn’t have had much value after missing his rookie season"
"i was just listing out how he led in every single advanced metric. i wasn’t using BPM in particular like you did. what about his higher PER, OWS, DWS, WS, WS/48, and VORP  on-off means more for 2017 than 2018 because 2017 was literally just Russ, that is a better measure of how he alone affects his team. In 2018 PG and Melo lost them the series, not russ  David Locke told this story. HE said after game 2 in that series that he talked to people in the Utah organization and this is what they said. ""The key to the series from here will be what OKC does with Melo. If they dont play him, we're gonna push them but they just have alot of talent we might come up a bit short in the end. But if they keep playing and starting him, we feel like we are in the drivers seat and should come out ahead"". You cant stress it enough [OKC with Paul George+ Russ and no Melo won the min vs Utah big time](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612760&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=201566,2546,202331) those two with Melo got destroyed.   Melo hurt them all year. And it ended up leading to their downfall vs Utah everything said in that ended up being an accurate omen. The one area he could've helped is leading 2nd units the rare times Donovan put Melo by himself without PG/RW on 2nd units the lineups worked. But he got away from it after the early part in the season."
"""Jason Kidd went to the Finals with Kerry skittles and K-Mart. Westbrook went to Cancun with Paul George.""  Lmao"
"My point is that the blazers get better, if they could they would make thay trade in an instant...in order to a title level team, it gets deeper than who your all stars are, the blazers wouldn’t add Paul George instead of cj and then be favored to win a title...they need a couple more 3 and d guys a good 4 who can switch ball screens and a better back up pg...but Beal would make then better than just having cj...you need multiple things at play working well to be a serious contender...but to answer your question the nuggets"
"So is that also true for lebron, Kawaii, Kyrie, Paul George, KG, etc?"
"Wiggins is very underrated here, there arent any 2 way wings that are as efficient and as good defensively as wiggins out there right now, he also fits perfectly here, unless its for Paul George level player he aint going anywhere.  Tbh id rather keep the MIn pick too and try to go again with the same roster, our team is already top 3 defenses in the league, all we are missing is a little firepower from klay and improvements from our young guys and we'll be one of the best teams in the league.  If klay comes back healthy, wiseman learns to play bball, we keep oubre and the MIN pick isnt a bust we'll be serious contenders next year."
Yeah he was the #1 option against those teams trying to shut him down. Look at Westbrook’s stats in okc with Paul George and Houston as the #2 guy.
34% TS is Paul George level...
"&gt; An MVP whose style isn't as visually appealing as Paul George is still an MVP  Tim Duncan is a scrub, bank shots are lame, bottom 50 player all time"
"U can judge them, but accolades can't be taken away by the eye test. An MVP whose style isn't as visually appealing as Paul George is still an MVP"
"Yes and Russell has never even done that with players like James Harden, Kevin Durant and Paul George. Tony Parker actually won meaningful basketball games. Russell Westbrook is all stats he doesn’t help you win at all."
"Kidd is definitely over him  Westbrook without KD or James Harden is a complete afterthought   Jason Kidd went to the Finals with Kerry skittles and K-Mart. Westbrook went to Cancun with Paul George  the only reason Russell scores more is because he plays in an era with no hand checking. shooting wise, they were pretty similar in league adjusted shooting   Kidd was consistently a way better passer, every bit as good of a rebounder, and then he’s 20x the defender   even the triple doubles doesn’t do much for westbrook. Kidd was the best in the league at them for 10 years, same as Westbrook. one of them plays in a faster league with smaller dudes  Kidd is super underrated, he gets better in the playoffs"
"Guys like Paul George and Harden will get called playoff chokers for putting up better performances than Westbrook, but if you question his effectiveness you're a hater.  He's a good player, but the shit he does clearly isn't getting him anywhere."
Paul George was out too
Lillard hasn’t played with harden/Durant/Paul George. He probably wins a ring if he played with Durant/harden or at least makes it very far
Paul George played better in the Blazer series. They both were meh in the Jazz series but Russ was probably a little better.
"the point is somewhat true. Hes basically underachieved in the postseason every year since durant left. Those paul george Okc teams hsouldve done much better and choked multiple times. In houston he was absolutely horrific against the lakers, they actually might've had a shot if he wasnt because harden was so good. Then tonight he again no shows in a big game.   Hes just too easy to scheme against in a playoff series."
Youre so wrong it’s actually funny. Why are you making things up? Or did you have your eyes closed when those games were on?   Harden: 29/5/7 on .66ts   Westbrook: 20/7/5 on .48ts  Paul George: 27/7/3 on .56ts  Westbrook: 26/11/9 on .48ts
Like when he let a Spanish matador outplay him in the playoffs and the excuse was 'something something Paul George!'
"My bet is that Kawhi stays, but if he is to leave I do think it would be to the Lakers.  It’s home, and it was his second choice behind the Clippers if they didn’t trade for Paul George, whether or not that’s true we don’t know but it’s the best chance to win a title and stay home IF the Clippers don’t make the finals  There isn’t any other team, Nuggets maybe? But can they create cap space to sign him and would he wanna be there? That’s the only team I think he can make a contender they’re other good teams but would they really have a better chance to win a championship compared to the Clippers? I don’t think so, maybe on a team like Philly, Miami, Mavs but those teams would have to move players to create the cap for Kawhi, but that includes the Lakers I just think compared to other teams they’re contenders and they’re in LA."
"I mean the Clippers have also just been consistently fucking annoying as a neutral fan (I'm a Bulls fan), it's not just Lakers fans shitting on them. Blake, CP3, Doc, Paul George, not to even get into Sterling, they've had a lot of objectively annoying faces."
"&gt;They might add Jimmy Butler, Paul George and Zion if they're feeling generous. That's basically the ""they could be an MVP candidate if everything goes right"" group. If I missed someone, let me know.  I don't really watch a lot of either team but I feel like I'd pick Beal or WB before Zion, this is picking nits obviously"
Yeah we traded them Oladipo and Sabonis for Paul George. We got Oladipo and Sabonis for freaking Serge Ibaka. Idk what the magic were doingm
Lol we got Paul George for him... who we turned into like5 first rounders and SGA More like a great pick by presti one of his only good ones in recent years.
both teams had Paul George and Kawhi Leonard at some point too... coincidence???!?!?
If Paul George said this and performed like Butler he’d receive sooo much more shit
Simple Leonard's held to a higher standard than Butler and Lillard. Paul George literally only asked to be Robin and he can't even do that
Tatum will be/is better  Brown is worse  And he is even with Paul George
if tyler herro doesn't become jaylen brown level at bare minimum the trades that miami passed up on are gonna look not too great. people make fun of Boston for not trading Brown for paul george or butler so what are they gonna say about HERRO?
"Please tell me this man is better than Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum again Heat fans"
"Exactly. Peak reactionary takes in this thread. Jimmy still led his team to the Finals, PG never did that. And PG would be a better second option than Paul George for the Clippers (who btw are down to a lower seeded team with home court)."
Is Paul George better than Jimmy Butler? /s
I love Jimmy as a player. But man if this was Paul George people would be roasting the fuck out of him
"I'm still here. Paul George isn't in a better position, it's still likely he's a 1st round exit and his team is actually higher seeded. Regardless, Jimmy has led a team to the Finals as the first option, you still can't say that for Paul George. So this ain't the ""gotcha"" moment you think it is."
I for one think they’re even but they reasoning behind this is incredibly stupid   Paul George never led his team to a finals and carried them to two wins there   Jimmy is a way better leader  And stop discounting the bubble
Paul George so much better than  this dude
"&gt;Paul George shows up when it matters  Except like, all those times he didn't?"
"ridiculous take. paul george is a better scorer than jimmy but that’s it. zero chance heat get to the finals with pg instead of jimmy, meanwhile clippers get a playmaking forward that more often than not shines in the clutch. pg is a great player and a similar caliber to jimmy, but jimmy has proven he’s better suited to lead a team"
"Last year, you may blame him.  This year, I truly think its the Clippers curse. I legit think Paul George and Kawhi Leonard will be hugely successful in any other teams not named Los Angeles Clippers.   Sorry Clippers fans."
&gt; Paul George shows up when it matters   I agree that pg is better but lol
Paul George
"&gt;	Paul George shows up when it matters   Lol?  And also, being the 2nd best player on your team is a whole lot easier than being the best player. Paul George has kawhi to fall back on"
At least Paul George is still performing. Not sure what Butler did all series.
Butler wont get slandered like Paul George was despite talking much more shit
"Paul George is better than Jimmy Butler...until Jimmy has the better playofsf next year, lol. People should know by now that it flips every year."
"2020-2021 impact stats:  Paul George:  3.7 BPM  0.139 WS/48  20.5 PER  4.3 LEBRON   Jimmy Butler:  7.5 BPM  0.255 WS/48  26.5 PER  5.56 LEBRON    You'd be wrong to take Paul George by every metric, but to every person their opinion"
"His defense was more of a problem to me atleast, he can't move well and guys are just jumping higher than he can stand, or they're just pushing out of the way (see Paul George like 20 times this series).  7'3 is really tall but any athletic wing can reach there apex way before porzingis can get a foot of the ground."
"He would do better against this Bucks team, yeah, because of the players involved. You put Jimmy on the Clippers and theyre better overall. Paul George on the Heat would not make them a better team, they would just perform a little better in this specific matchup."
so you'd agree Paul George (a star with a 3pt shot) would be a lot better on this heat team than Jimmy?
Prime Paul George but with actual consistency and a better motor
I wouldn’t consider game three to be “a big game”. I’m talking more like series ending or game 7’s. Paul George has laid some absolute duds in the playoff recently
Post injury Paul George would like a word
"I attacked KP cause you had to bring up that Paul George isn’t a real star for some reason, and now it’s confirmed that you don’t actually watch the games either. “Hitting step back 3s and midranges” when he was 2/6 from three and literally spent the majority of the game just driving on kp and getting free throws lol. If you’re gonna say shit about PG then I’m gonna say some shit about how KP is literally one of the most disappointing players in the league, and is definitely gone before the end of that contract. Keep doing you tho, make sure you stay on the reddit grind bro."
"I understand how you expect Paul George and kawhi to not perform to this level, but I think it’s extremely reasonable to expect that superstars are more likely to play this well and sustain as opposed to role players. Mavericks role players are shooting the three absolutely phenomenally. Brunson is shooting 58% from three. Maxi Kleber is shooting 63% from three. THJ is shooting 65% from three. You’re a reasonable person and I know you’re not going to argue that this is normal. I think we have to consider that it is much more likely that Paul George and kawhi can keep up performances like these as opposed to Mavericks role players all shooting 60%+ from three on high volume."
More than Paul George and Patrick Beverly?
"Idk why you’re trying so hard to die on this hill. Linking stats when you’re not even saying the correct ones, neither Paul George or kawhi are shooting 65 percent for the series. What regression to the mean is going to be more impactful, kawhi shooting dipping from 60% over these last few games to 53%, or mavs 3-point shooting dropping from 50% to 36% lol. Hell even with you guys shooting 51% on 19 made threes, which is literally unheard of, you guys still lost."
"“We gotta continue to keep doing it.”  Paul George, 2021"
And they have owned up to that attitude. Literally a highlight of Paul George saying that they haven’t done shit and aren’t acting like they have. Idk why you’re so ass hurt over that still. You shouldn’t be personally offended over these things lol.
Nate and just the pacers just in general this past decade had terrible luck with injuries.   Dipo shredded his quad after almost knocking the cavs out. Some could say they would’ve win if that LeBron block gets called for goal tending.  Before that Danny Granger’s body fell apart like right as Paul George ascended.
"The Mavs did use KP’s height advantage a few times. They got Morris to commit his 5th foul competing for position on a post up and they got a couple threes for Jalen Brunson off the doubles the Clippers sent at KP (one of them was during that stretch). He also got two looks in the fourth, a fade over Jackson and one over George, both missed. Another KP post up led to a Rondo steal as he came to double on the pass.   The real problem to me with KP’s offense here is those post ups aren’t going to be too devastating if George or a similarly sized players switches onto him. The Clippers helped the Mavs here by fouling and unnecessarily doubling KP. If KP wants to post up Paul George and take his fade-away, I would live with that all day."
damn paul george finally said the right thing
"Go look at some of the other names in this post. People here are listing Kyrie, Trae Young, Kemba Walker, Kristaps Porzingis, &amp; Russell Westbrook. None of them are getting as much push back as Paul George even though he is at least on the same level as they are."
Paul George if he won and gets FMVP completely escapes the criticism he’s gotten recently
"And the postgame thread was unironically blaming KD for the loss lmao  I get this sub hates him but him and Paul George are probably the only people who get clowned when their team loses, regardless of performance"
Paul George have 2 identity Playoff P and Pandemic P.
Tell that to Julius Randle and Paul George
Paul George was always overrated. Dude was just a cog in a beautiful machine. He wasn't THAT guy.
Paul George and Pat Bev are really unlikable. Kawhi is hated by the Spurs fans.
Yo! Rudy Gay vs Paul George would've been a nasty matchup!
Sarcastic. I know exactly the reason why they hate Paul George
George Paul
&gt;Paul George says they are still in the driver seat: 1 billion upvotes   &gt;Paul George says the right thing: 400 upvotes  I hope the Clips win tbh
Paul George listen to me when I say this
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"It’s so easy to blame the Lakers lmao, but the Clippers have perennially signed and played the whiniest and most entitled players of the last two decades.  From Blake and CP3 to Austin Rivers and Pat Bev, Paul George, Montrezl, Pierce, Lance, etc. they always got at least 2 highly unlikeable players getting meaningful minutes."
Why does Paul George get so much hate? Is it because he impregnated a stripper? Why does r/nba care? Is it because of his cocky ass quotes which then r/nba equates to trashtalk? Every nba player has a certain level of cockiness why does he get singled out?
Kyrie and Paul George
"Right, 1 half of basketball, and a good postseason = better than Steph and KD. Nah, man. The case just isn’t there after 2017. Maybe he was after 2019, but Steph reaffirmed his case this year and KD still looks like the same player. Even if you wanted to say their stats were inflated, and Kawhi proved himself after 2019, what did Kawhi do when he had a relatively loaded team? He choked. *Both* Kawhi and Paul George shot like shit in game 7. I don’t feel like he came back from that just because he’s now down 1-2 against the Mavericks"
Lol nice try Paul George.
Now that's going too far. Sometimes we just ignore Paul George. Like today for example
Westbrook KD harden (when he was in Houston) paul george
Dawg a superstar is top 10 do you think Paul George is top 10 rn
Would you rather be kwahi or Paul george?  I'd pick kwahi
I think it’s mainly because Kawhi doesn’t talk much   Plus Paul George is there to take any hate directed toward his team
Westbrook and Paul George
No disrespect the clippers r a better team and def have the potential to play well pg and kwahi included. They just had the most efficient game together ever..so i am just going off whats more likley to happen kawhi takes a slight dip in efficiency like 55 percent and score 35 40 and paul george to actually take a actual noticiable dip his not reliable and has not been for sometime. To say he matchs this game is betting feeling its more than likley he doesnt play great maybe just good or decent. Luka has been killing them and just shown he is more reliable to play well. I am just taking the bet on 1 guy proven to play at the level he played at tonight. Then the other two playing as efficent and great as they did tonight.
Paul George is a superstar?
Paul George by a long shot.
Westbrook and Paul George are close but they at least get a break if they play well  Durant is probably the only player who still gets bashed even if he plays well lol
"LBJ. Even though he experiences the highest of highs, he’s experienced the lowest of lows. Also, Paul George because Wayoff P"
Luka has been killing them for two years and has the last three games they have no answer leonard i have faith in to play great idk bout perfect from the line 13-17 36 points type of performance thats stellar even for his standards. Paul george i dont even think i need to comment on that. They really need to find away to slow luka dude dropping 40 shooting 55 60 percent. I expect kwahi to have a more normal game a great one but shoot closer to 50 percent i dont think paul george will play that good so thats a dip in both performances. Kp cant play worse alot of the role player played terrible and morris did things. I just feel mavs have the more room to get better.
"I’m kidding, Paul George was an absolute animal those years. I just love to bring up Roy Hibbert because he was also a beast, and because of how forgotten he is by time"
He literally shot like bubble Paul George in most of his series losses lol
"Not moving any goalposts. Kawhi is more hated than LeBron because he doesn't get the love LeBron does and gets a similar amount of hate.  &gt; i love how u have to say ""and the Clippers"" because we both know more of that disrespect is focused on paul george ahaha  I mean it's the team he's on lol. Even delusional LeBron haters can't deny he's top 10. Kawhi haters in this sub were actually arguing Jimmy Butler is better this week."
"Oh shit thats true, cant believe I forgot about all the paul george stuff toi"
"goalposts are being moved!!!! lovely  &gt;Do you understand that Kawhi and the Clippers negative highlights also get far more traction than their positive ones?  i love how u have to say ""and the Clippers"" because we both know more of that disrespect is focused on paul george ahaha"
"OKC fan, fuck Paul George"
"Paul George didn't outperform Kawhi last year lmfao what? Even if he did, this sub (and the internet) was hating specifically on Paul George for non basketball reasons (Playoff P, some of his interviews) compared to Kawhi, who's a more quiet/reserved guy.  How many times do I have to say I don't ""loathe LeBron"" before you understand that you can't just call someone a hater for not agreeing with you. Ur being delusional by not reading what I'm saying. LeBron gets more RAW disrespect but he gets enough respect that it balances out. Kawhi gets more disrespect as a superstar because he doesn't get respect to balance it out. It's not that hard to understand. Of course LeBron would get more disrespect for that, he's the best player on the planet, a GOAT candidate, more of a leader than Kawhi is, and much more vocal than Kawhi is. He'd also get more respect for WINNING the Finals. It's really not that hard to comprehend"
Paul George isn't a superstar
bro paul george literally got more disrespect for the 3-1 choke than kawhi lmfao
"""wow how dare Paul George open his mouth when he's being interviewed"""
What a game from Kawhi and Paul George  Gotta give props to them for the adjustments
Pandemic P posseded KP this series instead of Paul George
"Lol he's a breadstick, you expect him to post up the strongest players in the league like kawhi, paul george, and marcus morris"
"I remember earlier in the regular season, I said when my team lost to Dallas, Dallas benefited from not playing Porzingis against us, as we fucking destroyed him when he is on the court in the 2 home games we played against Dallas this season.  It gives me no pleasure to say anything bad about a player, but holy shit, Porzingis was the 3rd best Clipper player today, and it only was because Paul George and Kawhi Leonard were that good. Seriously, he looks completely different from the guy I saw last year when he was good against the Clippers."
"Love me some Paul George and Terrance Mann. When Rajon Rondo is making Luka look like a traffic cone on defense, it's going to be tough to beat ya'll"
"Dude was tryng to hard carry vs Kawhi, Paul George, and KP"
Paul George was near invisible in the 4th? Doesn't matter. Kawhi with a vintage performance showing why he's still one of the best in the playoffs
Paul George heard me talking shit about his choking in the playoffs and went off
Paul George heard us talking shit today
Kawhi and Paul George was like Lebron and Kyrie versus the 73-9 Warriors today.
Kawhi and Paul George was like Lebron and Kyrie versus the 73-9 Warriors today.
I think Paul George playing well is more likely than Tim Hardaway continuing his unusual hot streak
Considering the performances of the star players I think the Mavs are fine. Clippers need both stars to play great to win and it's not happening considering one is Paul George
Shout out to Kawhi and Paul George for showing up.
Paul George whispers that into ty lue’s ear
"This sub is a hate sub disguised as a basketball sub lol. Whichever superstar loses the most recent game, they start saying bad things about him except for paul george. They hate him all the time."
don't let Paul George playing well get in the way of slandering him
And if Paul George could turn into pandemic p for a quarter
Is Vegas taking bets on whether or not Paul George hits the side of the backboard during crunch time tonight?
"Paul George is 74% FG and Kawhi is 85% from FG and the game is barely tied, no way that they win this series lmao."
I enjoy watching Paul George take L's as I imagine Clippers fans seething.
Disagree. Paul George has been outstanding tonight
If I'm Dallas I'm getting Paul George matched up on Luka immediately now
"Paul George, kindly gtho"
paul george is just so wishy washy in the playoffs
Paul George in Indiana.
Nets vs Clippers. Clippers in 7. Paul George hits the game winner
"He earned his ""rep"" that series because he's a white dude and people love to hate Paul George. Westbrook shot like dogpiss that whole series too and no one really gave much of a shit because he's got a different perception around here."
Y are you so mad that he made fun of Paul George lmao
"Fair enough. But let me tell you, the amount of Paul George slander across social media was absolutely nutty.  Dude was public enemy number one for a minute and a half"
"No one can say he didn't try with his original team. I think his shot was more at players like Paul George running from team to team every other season instead of trying to build something. Dame tried to build something in Portland, it didn't workout. No one in their right mind should shame him for wanting to leave."
"Paul George has been good lol. Plus Kawhi still has PG, Morris, Reggie, Batum which are all comparable talent"
"Skip has the best nicknames. The frozen one, number 2, George Paul, Big Penguin, and now Always Dinged."
"This is definitely one of those grass is greener type things. Middleton has a really nice all-around game but he goes AWOL for games/months at a time and be can't be relied on as a 2nd option when the Bucks really need him.  McCollum most certainly does not have a really nice all-around game, but he has the scoring tenacity you want from a 2nd option (granted maybe not your ideal championship-winning one). If you gave that attribute to Middleton you're talking about a top 15ish player a la Paul George."
"When the Clippers went down 0-2 against the Mavericks, they  made an adjustment for game 3 where Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were super aggressive driving to the basket every posession.  Lets see if Mike Budenholzer can make an adjustment like that."
"That Kyrie hate boner is real. And lol at the irrational hatred of Paul George, guess we know where a lot of r/nba lives. Might as well call this the hater map, that big ol' Harden butthurt from Texas is proof of that"
"   Mavericks vs Clippers in 7 gms:      \- when Luka Dončić and both Kawhi Leonard &amp; Paul George were on the floor in this series: DAL 537 points, LAC 532 points      \- when Luka Dončić and one of Kawhi Leonard or Paul George were on the floor in this series: DAL 106 points, LAC 100 points      In non-Luka minutes in this series DAL scored 88 points, LAC scored 131"
Deshaun Watson  Paul George  They all look the same I guess…  /s
What did Paul George do to Utah?
Based on the link u shared Utah's most hated is lebron and arizona hates paul George the most
"&gt;Utah's most hated player is Paul George  TIL Arizona also goes by ""Utah"""
that’s a powerful accusation to make especially when you wrong. you know damn well you ain’t get paul george and deshaun watson mixed up
"Damn, what did Paul George do to Arizona?"
"I don’t think you even realize how you are contradicting your self.   &gt;	LeBron was literally reaching out to his competitors who were in their primes to team up.  This is literally what KD did. And he did it with a team that won a chip and went to back to back finals and beat him after he was up 3-1 just a few months prior.   &gt;	LeBron is the equivalent of Barkley calling a prime Stockton and prime Ewing  If this is your analogy, surely KD joining the warriors is like if Jordan went and joined the pistons after they embarassed him in the playoffs.   &gt;	Good thing Kawhi rejected The Father of the Superteam Culture.  So first you say,  “LeBron was literally reaching out to his competitors”  And then end your post with this? Lmao Kawhi literally called up KD, Jimmy butler, Paul George etc, probably a few other players to try and team up on the clippers. You truly don’t know what you’re talking about."
it’s not lebron. the amount of love he gets far outweighs the extra hate. complimenting paul george in the last year used to get people crucified online
It has to be Paul George.
I dont think Kawhi going 5/24 from 3 in 4 games vs Utah the past 2 yrs is something that's predictive of anything going forward the way you might be suggesting. Ill take my chances on Paul George being able to figure out how to score vs Donovan Mitchell also who's the guy who's spent the most time guarding him this year.
&gt; Utah is one wing defender shorter tbh for a Paul George/Kawhi lineup.      Kawhi and PG have shot 51/149 (34.2%) from the field in 7 combined games against the Jazz as members of the Clippers. PG going 6/14 (43%) and Kawhi going 8/19 (42%) are their best shooting displays.      I don't think that's some magical coincidence that they all just had rough shooting nights when playing Utah.
"Yeah said this back in February when they played matchup in general no bueno for Utah. Bet on LAC yesterday.   --Rudy Gobert not gonna be able to exploit and punish LAC for playing so much Morris at the 5.   --Utah is one wing defender shorter tbh for a Paul George/Kawhi lineup. Joe ingles is also 3 yrs older now than when he handled his son PG last time   --LAC switching alot is the type of thing that can neutralize alot of the actions Utah runs. Not the same type of motion offense you saw in the past but there is still some of that and in particular rely a ton on Gobert as a screener which teams have switched in the past to neutralize alot of their actions.   --- Too many defenders LAC will hunt and that's the type of thing they do. Kawhi was hunting Donovan when they played in the reg season. Bojan will get targeted. Jordan Clarkson definitely will also. Makes it easier for LAC   ---Like the article talks about Utah is built around taking away the rim, not something that really changes how LAC plays alot.   ---Solid LAC matchups across the board for Utah perimeter players. PG's length can get over the Conley pick and rolls make it harder for him to get off especially those floaters. Batum/Kawhi can do fine on Mitchell/Clarkson."
Paul George
ahh the old paul george technique
Paul George seems like a good dude and has a good story with the broken leg and is also extremely underrated
"I feel like we overrate those OKC teams a lot because of KD.   Not to compare it to a Kawhi situation, but despite how “great” that team was it’s telling that even with Paul George they ain’t make it out the first round."
Paul George &gt; everyone else just because of r/nba and nba twitter's hate boner for him
Damian Lillard  Carmelo Anthony  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook   James Harden  Mike Conley  J.J. Redick  Derrick Rose  Paul George  Lou Williams   Paul Milsap  Demarcus Cousins
"I'm definitely on it. I love what Kawhi did for us in Canada, Paul George I was too tough on and I like a bunch of players from what I've scene last series. Would be really glad to see them win and I'm definitely always rooting for the Klaw."
"Paul George, he is doing his thing since 2012 and arguable had the best comeback in recent memory, after suffering that freak injury.  Booker is only 24 and a great scorer, he has all the time in the world to prove himself as a top 15 player or better."
"**This year**  Paul George: 23-**5**\-**6** on 46/**40**/86. *VORP* = **2.6** *BPM*: **3.7**  Devin Booker: **25**\-4-4 on **48**/34/86. *VORP:* 1.1 *BPM* \- 0.1  **Last 5 Years**  Paul George: 24-4-**6** on 44/**40**/85. *VORP* = **18.7** *BPM*: **4.3**  Devin Booker: **25**\-**5**\-4 on **45**/35/**87**. *VORP*: 6.9 *BPM* = 0.3  The stats show Booker is a slightly better scorer and is a better facilitator.  George has much better defensive metrics, rebounds more, and shoots better from 3 on more attempts."
KD shows up mad vs anyone that is perceived to be better than him (bar LeBron). there was an OKC vs. Indiana game years ago when Paul George was being talked about as better than him and KD lit his ass up to the tune of 33 points or some shit in a solid win
"It's never ""no question"" considering how many people are saying Paul George it's clearly not that cut and dry"
"Paul George is a much better defender. He is elite, Booker is not. That is not saying Booker is a bad defender, and it doesn’t disqualify Booker from this argument, but it is true."
"Paul George, but Booker is a better shooter."
"Paul George cause defense, the nuggets were targeting book on D"
Wins over Lebron:  Paul George: 0  Devin Booker: 1
Depends which Paul George shows up. He's a much better defender.
Paul George is better but the gap right now is smaller than it’s ever been
Paul George. He can do everything Booker can and lock down the other team's best player
Paul George
"Paul George, but it’s close"
"Kawhi is terrifying. There is no one on the Nets that can guard him, and you cannot sag off him on the perimeter like you would Giannis.  The Nets would probably just let him get his 40 ppg and try to shut down Paul George."
"I'm Suns bandwagon but I honestly think only the Clippers have anything resembling a chance at beating the Nets, and that's counting on Paul George to not choke it up"
"Trust me, Nets fans are giving plenty of credit to Ski Marks the Salary Dump God. Casuals may parrot the whole ""he got lucky superstars wanted to play in the NYC market"" but anyone who has actually followed the team knows just how much he had to do to get the Nets in a position where stars actually want to sign here. No ones gonna deny that the NYC market helped but lets not act like anyone could have put this team in position to sign Kd/Kyrie. There so happens to be another team in NYC with a more storied history that also had cap space that offseason but they chose to come here for a reason. That reason being Marks in 3 years with no assets of his own created an environment that was attractive to stars.  Seriosuly do people remember how dire the Nets situation was when he got the job? He had no Paul George or Anthony Davis to trade for a massive haul and start his rebuild. Legit his best players were Lopez, Thad Young, and Bojan. His next best asset was cap space (which he expertly used to get picks). NYC Market or not, it takes a special performance to turn that situation into a place superstars want to play in 3 years. He's getting plenty of credit from us."
The only player in recent times that has gotten out of a long term contract is Paul George.
Paul George
I'd say KD is the most hated player on this sub but Paul George is the most mocked(if you know what I mean)
"I agree tbh  Durant is hated here but people here generally realize that rooting for him to fail as a player is often a useless endeavor and they can't expect him to choke  This sub legit upvotes any clip of Paul George missing a shot to the front page, if he did that this sub would spontaneously combust"
Yo Paul George sucks I’m sorry
I wouldn't mind that too much. Paul George deserves his damn respect
"Based on this trend I guess we can pencil in a Paul George buzzer beater in game 7 of the NBA Finals, after a steal from Pat Bev"
"26/12 on good defense in the playoffs during his prime. It’s not on him.  Unfortunately it’s really not on him. Even Paul George, the origin of the meme who has had bad series’ before, was better in the postseason in his Thunder seasons than his costar Westbrook."
Same reporter asked Kawhi if they could still win games with Paul George playing bad last year lol
What's his ceiling? Becoming a Paul George type of player? Denver fans probably high enough to believe that haha
"KP shot 37.6% from 3 on 6 attempts a game this season. He had a poor shooting series, but you can't just abandon someone like that. Paul George only shot 30% from 3 in the series and Kawhi still kept him fully involved."
Cuz Luka just averaged 36/8/10 and pushed a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to 7 games while having a role player Tim Hardaway Jr as his 2nd best player
"lmao yeah, did Paul George even last a year after signing his extension before forcing his way out and getting exactly what he wanted?"
"I think you have guys like LeBron, KD, Curry, Harden, Luka, Jokic, and Kawhi that can do it every year, scoring high volume and high efficiency.   Then you have another group of guys like Lillard, Butler, Paul George, and some others who won’t perform well every single year, but have it in them to go on good playoff runs with the right teams around them."
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Paul George  SF: Julius Randle  PF: Giannis Alphabet  C: Kristaps Porzingis
Let’s save the Pandemic name for Paul George.
I draw the line at Paul George
"Such a dumb question to begin with. This team would go for a 48-0 3-peat and win every game by 30 points:  Donovan Mitchell  CJ McConnel  Paul George  Bam Adebayo  Karl Anthony Towns  Bench: Dragic, Robert Covington, Nurkic  So I guess Paul George (or whoever you pick) is capable of being the best player on the greatest dynasty ever"

"If you're going for a championship, I have THJ as a 4th guy. A rejuvenated best case KP can be #3. Still missing a Paul George caliber #2"
Paul George thinkin he's lebron.
"Ahh yes the super team roster of Rodney McGruder, Joahkim Noah, JayMychal Green, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George(who was injured mostly), Lou Will, Trezz and Bev Is equivalent to having KD/Kyrie/Harden and Blake fucking griffin. Before that we had zero stars."
"You know that last year still counts, right? Your team didn't just appear out of osmosis. Pat Bev being shit this year is irrelevant.  When you guys signed Kawhi and traded for Paul George everyone thought you were gonna win the chip. Especially since KD was guaranteed to be out and a hurt LeBron-led Lakers missed the playoffs."
Presti and Henny need to send the Magic some pics for that obvious collaboration that led too all this bullshit.  Henny set up the Magic to get his old job back after he got fired. That ridiculous trade that was obvious the second it was made led to Paul George and all OKC picks. Utter fucking fraud.
Kawhi   KD  Steph  LeBron  Harden  Giannis  Jokic  Luka  Embiid   Dame  Which one of these players is Kyrie better than? Here's some more that are debatable too  AD  Jimmy Butler  Booker  Beal  CP3   LaVine  Paul George
"No. Not when the championship tier of guys as #2 are Kyrie/Harden, AD, Paul George.  Middleton isn't in the tier of player and neither is CJ."
this 1st half by Middleton is worse then anything Paul George ever did in the playoffs
Better than Paul george
Middleton is last yr Siakam/george paul
"Jokic wasn’t as good as Kawhi last year. Jokic took a bug leap this season   And “Playoff Paul George” is a meme, not a real thing. Yes, Paul George is better than Murray"
"This is true that Kennard's defense is his only weakness, luckily we literally have Paul George, Kawhi, Morris, and Batum in the same lineups. Kennards the worst defender on any given lineup but the other guys more than make up for it. A big reason we traded away Lou Williams was because we couldnt afford 2 defensive sieves on the same team."
he was outplayed by paul george vs the nuggets  he shot 4/17 in a g2 loss   mediocre 54.8% TS% on the series  wut is this revisionist history
"And thats essentially what he wants: people have this idea they paint of westbrook like hes DYING to get his shots in every game. Hes on the wizards man. His main issue in houston was the front office/coaching staff wanted him to be scoring centered, when he wanted to be a floor general. They used him like Kyrie on the Nets next to harden, and Kyrie and Westbrook are totally different.  His last season in OKC he facilitated incredibly well for Paul George all season. He took a big dip to usage rate, and comfortably slid into the second scorer role.  Theres been plenty of games this season where he had some crazy statline on the table, and just willingly chose to not get it as the team was hot. (dropped 14/20/20 just because he only took 9 shots all game, this is westbrook when the wizards ACTUALLY MAKE SHOTS.) Imo a floor general for a Tatum brown duo with him replacing kembas scoring as third option is ideal.  TL:DR he dont care about getting his shots, he literally wants to be a floor general for a contending team w a legit 1+2, he only tries to score really when his team needs it/asks him to."
Let's not forgive 3 years ago when Joe Ingles played great defense on Paul George overall.
"I don’t think you’re understanding my point. Wingspans do matter in defense, it’s just Butler is a rare case because he’s a good defender despite having a less than ideal wingspan.   Bottom line is Norm is undersize for a SF, it is moronic to think otherwise, it is exactly what it is when the league average SF height is most likely at 6’6, and the top guys at those positions like Kawhi, LeBron, KD, Paul George, Middleton, Butler, MPJ even are all at least 6’7 and above"
Because it’s tiring and it’s a lot to ask of him to do that and carry the offense for 7 games   I do think going forward Paul George should take the best opponent wing player at least to start the game  because he’s an awesome defender and he’s not as important as kawhi on offense
We talkin about the same paul george that allowed joe ingles to live rent free in his head?
"Yeah, for sure. Obviously Paul George is a great player. I just think Rudy’s better this year. That should be a fun series, especially with Kawhi playing like a God like always in the playoffs."
Idk how anyone can be down on the mavs or think they need drastic change. They went 7 games against Kawhi Leonard and Paul George with a 22 year old as their best player. The future is bright.
So basically every stat is wrong. That’s your argument. Paul George is better because every stat is wrong. Genius *golf claps*
Mitchell is also better than Paul George. Fight me!
"The flip flopping on his supporting cast is getting annoying.  No one gonna bring up how the Clippers role players were struggling in Game 1/2/3 of the series, while almost the entire Mavs team averaged 50% from 3 over the first 3 games of the series.  But now they choked a 2-0 lead going back home, and up 19 in the 3rd game, and all of a sudden Luka doesn't have help?  Kawhi would've gotten eviscerated; people would be/still are shitting on Paul George. Even before it was over, people were saying Clippers are fucked because Kawhi is leaving now"
"&gt; The Jazz are easily the more ""talented team""  That is highly arguable (for example, JVG called the Clippers the most talented team in the West prior to their Game 7 win), and even if the Jazz were more talented it's not ""easily.""   You're also completely ignoring the fact that the Clippers are an all around great team as well (historic 3pt shooting team, very versatile rotations, can mix it up their defensive scheme, etc. - all things the Jazz can do as well), but they have the advantage of having a Kawhi Leonard and to a lesser extent, Paul George (despite all the memes, he'll be an x-factor in the series).  Look, both teams are great but to act like the Clippers are only Kawhi is ignorant. Kawhi elevates the Clippers from a great team to a legitimate contender capable of defeating Brooklyn (not that I think it'll happen, but still). We can agree to disagree, but that's my take."
"We aren't talking about Paul George 2 years ago, we're talking about him today vs Gobert today."
"you don't have to apologize for ""going at me"" but you are making a semantic argument that is based on just misstating what I said, no matter if you quoted it or not. I said that Luka is looking like a generational, **potential** top 15 all time **type of guy**. If you want to read that and take from that that I said ""it is likely"", or ""he is going to end up there"", that's totally fine. But that's just a reading comprehension issue.   Thinking somebody is a certain type of player, or will be, is almost completely subjective, and showing stats doesn't disprove or prove any argument, especially because the majority of your top 15 list (which I think is mostly correct) probably have worse stats than some other guys who played in their time frames. Trae could certainly end up in that same group of guys, or even end up being better than Luka. But winning one series against the Knicks isn't objectively ""better"" than losing two to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, especially considering the teams around them."
I don't understand this over-reaction from r/nba. There's a chance the Clippers could win it all or make it to the Finals. Losing to them in 7 is NOT some failure for this young team. You have a young superstar figuring things out. This was NOT a normal first round exit. The lost to Kawhi and Paul George.
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"
Bro Paul George is better then gobert. Like why is this a discussion?
Lol wtf? Forgive but ruby gobert is not as good as Paul George and he'll never be as good as Paul George overall. Let's not forget two years ago Paul George was top 3 in MVP and dpoy
Am I crazy for thinking Gobert &gt; Paul George? If I was starting a team from the ground up I'd rather build around Gobert than PG. Maybe thats my Utah bias coming out.
Paul George has more playoff wins at staples center than LeBron and AD combined
"Paul George with 30 on the road in the middle of the 3rd quarter, against the best team in the NBA w/o Kawhi Leonard is a major feather in his cap"
"So my conclusion based off of this game is that Paul George does incredibly well when he is the obvious alpha player on his team and just takes over.   He melts into the background if he's paired with another all-star caliber player that can also play with the ball in their hands, see both Russ and Kawhi.   This game is more like vintage Indiana PG rather than the shit we saw in OKC or the past couple years in LA."
Paul George being the main ball handler is entertaining
Paul George &gt; Donovan Mitchell
Still befuddled Paul George drew a foul by literally swiping his arm at bogdanovic
This the first Paul George solo run since Indiana right?
I love Paul George so much
oh my goodness you psycho I know Paul George pushes off. Im telling you Donovan does it too. weirdo.
paul george is having sex on the court
damn paul george really gets max money to pick and choose when he shows up to play
"Paul George is playing great, but the refs are not calling anything for Utah right now"
We’re witnessing Indiana Pacers Paul George tonight
Paul George is cooking
Me and the twelve other Paul George fans in r/nba are so happy right now.
"clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game  ball is inbounded to Paul George who turns face to face against Gobert  ""You took my family""  moves to the left  ""You took my friends""  moves to the right  ""You took all that was dear to me""  clock winds down to 2  ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR Kawhi!""  goes up, fire coming out of his shoes  ""PAULRYUKEN""  Ball flies over Gobert's head, goes straight into basket.

paul george. the love of my life
If I’m Paul George I’m playing the whole second half
can people stop talking about Indy Paul George? He never averaged over 23 ppg with them 😭😭 this is more akin 2019 PG
Now Paul George wanna go playoff p
Everytime Paul george drives he pushes the defender lol guess silver wants to keep this game close
Paul George haters and Jazz fans are low IQ! Sad!
Credit to Paul George for a hell of a night
Why isn't Joe Ingles out playing Paul George? I thought he was better than him
Lmfao r/nba seething now that Paul George has been showing up these past 3 games
Paul George a superstar?? What year do you think this is LMAO
"Nate’s Indiana teams made the playoffs each year and lost to  1) the LeBron Cavs (Eastern Conference champs)  2) the LeBron Cavs (Eastern Conference champs)  3) the Celtics  4) the Heat (Eastern Conference champs)  That’s one year of Paul George and one year of good Oladipo. Two of those four teams didn’t have a single 20 PPG scorer. Which coach is leading those teams to wins in series where they were consistently significant underdogs?   So yeah, making the playoffs all four years with some of those weak Indiana teams, taking the Hawks to the best record in the NBA since his hiring and winning a playoff series (and at least making the Hawks highly competitive in another) is a pretty good record in my book."
This is Pacers paul george
Where has this Paul George been all series? This dude could have been slashing this jazz team up for days now… could literally be the difference between being up 3-2 and locked 2-2
lmao paul george really got em by standing up quick
paul george got up and immediately went crying to the refs like the bitch he is.   if they call that they are fucking soft
Paul George is a bitch that pushes off on every single drive and you know it's true.
Paul George ain’t gonna do shit.
Paul george going off
For that first half give Paul George his props he was excellent and has stepped up so far
"Only winning by 5 though. Really good half from the Clips, especially Paul George. Really taking lead of the Clippers team"
Paul George haters will be weeping once this game is over
17-30 3 pointers and only up by 5 at halftime.  Got to take care of the ball and continue to play desperate because Paul George or Reggie Jackson can absolutely go on a scoring streak and take over.
i feel like i’m one of the small amount of people rooting for paul george to ball out and somehow win this shit for the clippers
this must be r/nba worst nightmare. Paul George being efficient and Pat Bev playing good defense.
"arguable imo, He was deflecting it a lot of it before tonight. Id argue guys like julius randle and jimmy butler have caught more in their respective series. Even Paul George in some games mainly cause hes become the favorite meme at this pt."
Paul George gotta play the whole second half imo. He’s been great
Paul George heard y’all talking trash
paul george and tatum would be the best push off duo in the league
Paul George has been great
Paul George having an amazing game.
How can Clippers fans be proud of their team when Morris and Paul George are on the team
Utah y’all seriously letting Paul George have the game of his life ? Do I have to go and guard him ?
Paul George has been a man tonight. Dude is playing with heart
PAUL FUCKING GEORGE
"Like the Buck's first half defense yesterday, this Jazz's offense in the first half is playing way too good to be up by only 8.  They're literally one scoring streak by Paul George or Reggie Jackson from turning this game around."
Paul George is a wanna be gangster.
Paul George suddenly getting the same bullshit calls KD gets. LOL
We put a roster together with Myles Turner as his costar and Pacers fans still mad at Paul George for leaving lmao
Paul George still overrated?
Paul George remembering how to play basketball.
Paul George playin like he’s on the pacers again
Hopefully kawhi faked his injury to bring back pacers Paul George
I’m rooting for Paul George to pull off a win for the Clippers
Paul George is killing me this postseason.  I have a massive collection of memes to drop on Twitter if he fucks up and he has mostly avoided it.  Truly a loss for all basketball fans.
Paul George came to play
Paul George has been chasing super teams when his real power was in being the star with stacked role players
Put Paul George back in
"kevin durant is an asshole, we all know this is true, but at least when his team needed it, he played all 48 minutes. We all know bitchmade paul george wont do any such thing."
Paul George is living up to KD
Paul George had a great first quarter
"I told my buddy that tonight could be vintage Paul George. He’s played second fiddle for so many years, I expect him to go off as THE guy."
Paul George is the best player in this game by far
lol paul george isnt looking like playoff p at all.  hes looking like a player who may not be as bitchmade as he usually is
Poor Paul George is probably about to have the game of his life in a pressure playoff situation and it likely won’t be enough without Kawhi
Paul George leading the Clippers to a championship without Kawhi will cause the heat death of the universe
The size of the oof can not be measured. I had a bad feeling when i saw a partial nutmeg late in the shot clock that resulted in a glass 3…  But beyond that what an exceptional choke job. This looks like a doc rivers coached team. Paul George prolly hiding a smug face on the court in Utah.  And god damn simmons looks as shook as a virgin on prom night.
"Paul George, this is your time brother. Ball out tonight, prove the haters wrong and pull off the impossible"
"5 points on 16 shots in an elimination game is the ""Paul George Game"" until proven otherwise."
Paul George is either gonna have the best or the worst game of his career tonight
Would very much like to see Paul George silence some Jazz fans
Time for Paul George to cement his legacy with 'the Paul George Game'   All Time Third Team to step up!
This could be the night paul George makes everyone eat their words from last year (but it probably won’t be)
Pacers Paul George needs to come back
Jazz fans booing Paul George for playing basketball
Paul George has had his title for worst playoff choker usurped by Joel Embiid and the 76ers.
"50 point triple dub incoming  ""Im Paul George, yall know who I am"""
we're gonna catch the jazz sleeping. Paul George 2013-2014 Pacers babbbbbyyyyy
Paul George looking like me rolling into work when everyone else called out
So this might work for Paul George?
"Just skimming through the equation, it looks like it’s because Paul George has many more top 10 finishes in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and minutes played"
Paul George will drop 60
"Paul George got 50 shades of pressure riding his ass. The slander, whether it’s deserved or not, is going to be hilariously outlandish"
Reppin' Paul George. Watch and wait y'all
"I remember that game. Harden missed a free throw, the thunder got the rebound and went into transition to find Paul George for what must have been the only clutch game winning three pointer he has ever made."
Paul George is literally the Antonio Brown of r/NBA when it comes to people making memes of his name with a specific initial letter sequence in mind
"Paul George becomes KD now, with Kawhi out. Can he pull a KD?"
Of course. Two things are guaranteed when it comes playoff time. Paul George vanishes and Chris Paul goes out. Maybe its just the name Paul
"I love when I get to watch an NBA player have an amazing performance like that, even if you don’t go for that team you just appreciate that greatness cause eventually that player will retire  I think Nash was doing that, and I feel like if most fans had the opportunity to approach KD after that performance we’d all hug him. Especially with all the criticism he got, it’s kind of why I’m liking the Clippers right now. Paul George is ballin, and I think that’s great he’s getting the praise he deserves after all the criticism"
"Because he’s not good. Every respectable draft scout/analytics guy said he was no good before the draft, but the old heads convinced everyone he was the next Paul George"
remove kahwi from the clippers and the jazz would humiliate them.     since this is not 2014 odds are paul george won't carry them
"Disagree because I'm not a moron. Pau Gasol was a top 10 player those years, Odom was extremely good but probably before you could really remember bball let alone learn about it.  Now would they have been able to beat the Heat that Durant in the Finals or or the 72-10 Warriors that Durant couldn't beat? No. But that's the dumbass shit casuals hold against Durant because they couldn't evaluate basketball ability and impact, all they could do is react to championships.  Westbrook is also extremely overrated and has embarrassing on/off splits compared to Durant, Paul George, Harden, and now Beal. It's just another thing that casuals do, completely overrated box score stats even though having an ultra ball dominant player who can't shoot is obviously the last thing you want in big games."
Anyone that said he was going to be Paul George was willfully ignoring his ugly college production.   Injuries have hampered him but he was always a pretty big gamble IMO.
I love Skip and it tickles me in just the right way to see him ragging on George Paul for the past 10 years only to end up having to cling onto him for dear life in all these Clippers games.  Surely Skip appreciates the irony.
nothing really except the paul george coming off a screen but even that seemed like a pretty standard call
"As a stubborn laker fan who thinks Kobe , lebron , Michael, magic &amp; Kareem are top five in no particular order it would be amazing to watch. This post season already is one of my all time favorites .. no LeBron, no Curry, no KD with one of the following getting their first ring ( Trae , Giannis , Paul George or CP3)"
Can you imagine if this was Paul George instead? Twitter might explode.
Even crazier that Paul George missed two crucial free throws.
Was it though? 2 of those 4 teams didn’t have a single guy who hit 20 points per game. Basically you had one good year from Paul George and one really good year from Oladipo. Three of the four teams the Pacers lost to in the McMillan era won the Eastern Conference that year.
Paul George said Dames deep game winner over him was a bad shot. I believe the person replying to you though you were talking about that and mixed up CJ McCollum with Dame.
"https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/paul-george-gotta-shot-cj-miles-fails-hit/story?id=46824191#:~:text=with%20news%20about-,Paul%20George%20says%2C%20'I%20gotta%20get%20the%20last%20shot%2C,fails%20to%20hit%20game%20winner&amp;text=%E2%80%94%20%2D%2D%20The%20Indiana%20Pacers%20let,t%20come%20from%20his%20hand.  ????"
“That was a bad ~~shot~~ pass” - Paul George
He was completely open and is a decent 3PT shooter. That is a good shot. Just completely bungled it.  That's like saying Paul George was right in saying CJ shouldn't have taken the last shot.
"lol I mean't paul george. Guess I should've said ""loves to hate"""
Trae Young said I’m not George Paul
"Let me put my Ice Trae back in the fridge. Paul George, this is how you hit free throws to win a game..."
He said I’m not Paul George
Paul George. Forgot about simmons and giannis has been making them the past couple games
Paul George must be so confused watching this game
Paul George is a bum
Ben Simmons?  Paul George?  Giannis?
Ice Trae  &gt;&gt; George Paul
Paul George takin notes.
Giannis and Paul George would like to swap last-second free throw outcomes.
"Giannis ""not Paul George"" Antetokounmpo"
Giannis at the free throw line &gt; Paul George
Agree. Good example being Paul George last night after the turnover based on a technicality through replay. Perfect “Ball don’t lie” moment
Like Paul George yesterday.
PG for Simmons who says no? I'd assume the Clippers but Paul George is getting older and they have a bunch of scorers
Paul George did a post game interview and basically said it’s on him to lead the team for the rest of the playoffs.
Lakers fans man lmao still crying for Paul George
If paul george joined lakers davis wont be there right?  Well im guessing george would have 1 ring by now if he joined the lakers
2024 I doubt. Kawhi and Paul George will still be on the roster. 2026 most likely year
This man hates Paul George
"I think you’re underrating how many people just take memes and make them their actual basketball opinions. Like, “the clippers have to trade Paul George” was a thing for a looooong time. And people buy into that.   Hell There was a part of me that totally bought the clippers being cursed to never get to the conference finals after last year."
"Apparently it went as far back as 2010, Paul George clearly was repeating Clippers marketing material ever since he was in college.   http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Paul-George-Workout-and-Interview-3495/"
It was a rumor that was never proven true and Paul George came out and said it wasn’t true either
Clippers will win on emotion. Guys like Paul George and Terrence Man will literally shed tears all over the floor after a huge basket from the 3pt line.
Old heads used to be Zbo and Duncan. Now its Paul George and Curry lol
ZUbac definitely should have punched the ball out of the hoop. It's really on him not on Cousins or Paul George missing two crucial free throws.
"Also Paul George:   “When I first fell in love with the game, and I'm outside playing in front of the house, I'm not picturing myself in an Indiana jersey or picturing myself in a Thunder jersey. I pictured myself in a Lakers jersey.”  “In a way, it's like I want to come here, I want to play for the home team and put a Lakers jersey on. That's always going to be something that I want to fulfill.”  “I grew up a Lakers and Clippers fan”"
Paul George for Ben Simmons? Don't think anyone likes that trade so it must be fair.
"&gt;… Paul George had some words on the play after the game, saying it was “a bad shot.” r/NBA, no surprise, hates Paul George. Why is that? He switched teams, a damning sin to r/NBA (unless it’s to the Lakers or Raptors, in which case force your way there by all means.) His wife also used to be a stripper. To r/NBA, for some reason, this is a massive point of both comedy and insults. Why? I could not tell you, I can only guess. My hypothesis is that the same people who like players because they’re white also hate any sort of “sexual degeneracy.” See Authoritarian Right on the political compass. Back to Lillard, r/NBA really started liking him after he metaphorically dunked on Paul George, a player that they hate. They started praising Lillard for being one of the more “well spoken” and “educated” players in the league. I shouldn’t have to spell that one out. They’re calling him **“one of the good ones,”** essentially. Now onto Giannis. Why do they like him so much? It could be that he won the MVP against James Harden, a player we’ve established they hate, or it could be that he’s European. Much like white players, r/NBA has a love for all European players. They think they’re tougher, scrappier, less thuggish than american players. **Again, they praise him for being “well spoken.”**Apparently, he’s one of the good ones too. Now all of this has just been conjecture. In fact, you might even be skeptical of r/NBA’s racism at this point. So let’s move on to the blatant stuff.  TL;DR Giannis is may be technically black but he’s European. He’s way better off than these overrated AAU breeds who just showboat and ruin the game of basketball. Also he’s one of the good ones."
Lol can you imagine someone saying that Paul George “played in the spirit of kawhii Leonard”? I love CP3 but the media takes on him are rather wild
"Yes, Paul George was repeating bs from the Clippers marketing department all the way back in 2014 when he a Pacer"
"[I picture myself in a lakers jersey - Paul George, 2018](https://youtu.be/n7qC2lIi9iU)"
This is the most Paul George thing I've ever read
"On a thread specifically created to catalyze discussion among numerous commenters  about Paul George’s epic choke, you seem to be alone in saying it wasn’t a choke. Yes, we disagree.   I think you (figuratively) stepped up to the free throw line to make an odd argument and... choked. (Figuratively.)   Like Paul George would say, though, you just gotta keep shooting! You’ll emerge from this slump."
You guys still traded a top 5 player in the NBA for peanuts. Even Paul George got more assets back for OKC.
Paul George becomes Papa George… again
They still find a way. I mean I just watched a clip of skip and shannon where it went from Paul George missing 2 free throws to that relating to skip talking about Lebron missing endgame free throws.
&gt;Paul George shot 86.8% from the FT line this season. &gt; &gt;That means the odds of him missing BOTH of those free throws are less than 2%. &gt; &gt;That's a choke.  We've seen Ray Allen miss consecutive Free Throws in the playoffs  Shit happens
Just getting Shai alone was worth it considering Paul George had the chance to leave the previous offseason and leave OKC high and dry.
"A WCF is the bare minimum for a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and it’s only being looked at as an improvement because of how much of a failure and collapse last season was for them.   The expectations for the Clippers is championship or bust just like the Lakers and Nets and if you use the health excuse for the Clippers you have to use it for the Nets, Lakers, Nuggets, etc."
"Split in LA and then win game 5 is more likely but also I’m never counting these clippers out they have a knack for just responding with these crazy shooting runs and keeping the games close. Obviously CP3 coming back is a massive advantage because now Payne is that scoring spark plug off the bench, but Paul George can get as hot as any of them and role players traditionally play better at home"
Paul George calling for goal tending is the most Paul George thing.
"Yeah I don’t get the elite playmaking talk. I really just think it’s draftniks trying to make Cade a generational prospect, which he could be considered but as a 2, not the 1 they’re hyping him up as. I think a good comp for him is Paul George although I don’t think he’s as athletic as PG was before the leg injury."
"Mikal didn’t have his shot but he absolutely harassed Paul George in the first half until Clips started working switches to get Mikal off of him in the second half, he was the least of our problems yesterday"
"Well they better start focusing on player narratives for some younger players. There have been a lot of injuries this season likely partially due to the short off season and condensed schedule. But no one has talked about it possibly being due to many teams relying heavily on 32+ year old stars. There is a very real possibility that there is only one more title won (or zero) between Lebron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, Harden and Paul George. The NBA is going to have to do a better job of marketing their younger stars soon or they’re screwing themselves."
&gt;You know what. I concede to you. Paul George is garbage just absolutely terrible.   Never said that.   &gt;He’s carried by Kawhi.   Why are you obsessed with Kawhi all the sudden?  &gt;Interestingly enough I compared PG and Giannis’ numbers  and they’re nearly identical (besides Giannis shooting 19% from 3)  That’s random to look up. . Thinking about Giannis often?
&gt; Imagine not reading posts on your own sub  Imagine having a life outside of reddit.   &gt;or listening to words said by your own star player.  Paul George was obviously just trying to downplay the loss and his own mistakes. If you're telling me the Clippers didn't want to win that game you're a fucking moron.    &gt;You even watch basketball?  Probably since before you were born. And a post-game presser isn't basketball. Dumbass.
Paul George was obviously just trying to downplay the loss and his critical mistakes. If you can't understand contextual nuance that's not my problem. You can't tell me the Clippers didn't want to win that game and have a shred of credibility.
That's the end result of all the ref shenanigans. Paul George Hooking Book for FT's or giving the clippers back the ball on what is clearly a out of bounds on Bev.   Lots of ref bullshitting .
United States: the Pandemic is over!  Paul George: Pandemic P is not.
You know what. I concede to you. Paul George is garbage just absolutely terrible. He’s carried by Kawhi. Interestingly enough [I compared PG and Giannis’ numbers ](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/#!/?PlayerID=202331&amp;VsPlayerID=203507) and they’re nearly identical (besides Giannis shooting 19% from 3)
"This is actually wrong. Paul George didn’t mock him. I hate that people are misremembering this when with a quick search you can find it was Morris and Beverly mocking him https://youtu.be/5JY0VhnHRlk. Yes pg made fun of lillard being eliminated and being sent to cancun, but they established that patched that up and it’s just trash talk. You’d swear that players don’t talk trash ever, at least they had the maturity to patch it up with each other. It’s just sad at this point, just appreciate ball for ball and appreciate good competition."
Exactly.  Paul George would be a non-factor in media attention and would have gotten a lot less all-nba votes if not for his 2 conference finals appearances early on with the Pacers.  Davis stepped from edge to center of media attention with the Lakers pursuit of him then finally acquiring him.
"awesome food, no scenery. I'm sure Russell Westbrook and Paul George spent plenty of time in Bricktown. It's like they never left."
"Narratives are so easy to spin on the fly too.   I went from wow Lebron vs Nets.   To   Wow Chris Paul first Ring?   To   Rise of Booker vs Paul George redemption arc,   It all writes itself if you stop trying to Force it."
"The figurative definition is below:  In sports, choking is the failure of a person, or persons, to act or behave as anticipated or expected. This can occur in a game or tournament that they are strongly favoured to win, or in an instance where they have a large lead that they squander in the late stages of the event.  I think Paul George performed well and exactly as we anticipated. He has peaks and valleys in his performance, this is well known, especially during the playoffs.  Also I don't think the Clippers were strongly favored to win, in fact without Kawhi (and the Suns admittedly without Cp3) the Clippers still were not favored to win.  They had a 1 point lead late in the 4th quarter when the shots were taken. So i guess I wouldn't say he choked (per the figurative definition).  But he definitely should have made those free throws and missed at an opportune moment."
Docs used to it. He shared one with Paul George after he cheated on us daughter.
"Pacers-P &gt;= Healthy Kyrie &gt; Post-Pacers-P &gt; Hospital Kyrie.  I would take Paul George I guess, even tho he sucks ass at times, if you are stupidly talented, you can carry that. Because at least he would be some sort of presence. But you can't carry a dude on the sidelines."
"As a #2 option? Definitely not. Until Paul George proves he can come up clutch in the finals, he’s not going to pass Kyrie as the better Robin"
"Paul george launched into him though, pat was going for the ball and george cut to his right quickly which caused his head to crash into bev"
"How are any of these teams boring really? Everyone of them has its own narrative.  Clippers: can they finally do it? Can Paul George overcome his past playoffs runs?  Suns: CP3 is not done and Booker is next on the superstar list  Hawks: the super young team with a charismatic star, Trae Young. Nobody expected them here.  Bucks: maybe the least interesting (for me at least) but they have one of the most popular players in the league, who after winning 2 consecutive MVPs is looking for the ultimate price"
"ask paul george if he thinks missing FREE THROWS is something he can control more or less  ask him if he thinks missing those is the same thing as missing a regular field goal  keep making excuses though, bozo"
Paul George finals MVP would be an amazing story.
"I mean, the thing is, the two gakked free throws at the end bring up the dreaded C word.  Is Paul George a choker?   Bad shooting nights happen to everyone. Trae, who is as fearless a player as I've ever seen, had one in game 7. Steph, LeBron, KD have all had them. Some nights you just don't have it.   You get a good look at the basket and it ticks off the back rim, it happens. Them's the breaks. Kobe's shooting percentage on game-winning shots from 03-08 was 25%.  But PG just doesn't double-gakk FT's. He got the yips.  And sometimes, when you get the yip,. sometimes they don't go away. You get in your head and even if it doesn't destroy your whole game (See Simmons, Ben) it can feed on itself."
"He got praised when he played well the last few games and now he’s getting hate when he chokes in the clutch. He’s an inconsistent player and is also a pretty big douche. It’s not hard to understand.       And if Paul George hate makes my dick big enough to trip over, count me in I’m joining the dark side"
If that was doc Rivers Wed be scraping Paul George off the underside of the bus he'd throw him under
The plan and hope was the Paul George or Kawhi would join him in free agency to start building a super team the same way he joined Kyrie in Cleveland. They could then trade their assets the same way Cleveland did.  Just because the plan didn’t work this time doesn’t mean he didn’t try to follow the same formula.
"It’s because the media hasn’t given any of these guys their due before these conference finals. Maybe Kawhi, but he’s such a low-key guy he doesn’t draw as much attention as LeBron, Curry or Durant.  Like they’ll talk all day about Luka, and obviously he’s very talented and has a bright future, but he hasn’t won anything yet.  Atlanta got kind of disrespected/flew under the radar, as did the Suns this year  It’s just the media likes to create a narrative and now that Nets/Lakers are out, they’re “uninterested” with the results  Suck it, Suns in 4  Chris Paul + Devin Booker/Paul George/Giannis/Trae Young winning their first ring, even Kawhi with 3 rings on 3 teams if Clippers win, is one of the best outcomes this year could have had as a fan of basketball"
Paul George not familiar with the rules i see
Breakdown? Breakdown as in Paul George at the free throw line?
"Sure. NBA.com, Paul George, shooting, last 2 games, 4th quarters, 3/10."
We roasted ben but we don't HATE him. GEORGE PAUL on the other hand gets all the hate haha
Paul George P
they do… but he’s paul george  being winded is not a good reason for missing two FREE throws in a ROW  no star player (especially ones that can actually shoot) should be missing that  should we not be holding star players to star standards?
I don't really get the comparison or the focus on the last two free throws. Paul George didn't play awesome for 47 minutes.  He missed every 3 he took in the first half and ended 1-8 on the game.  And he was 5-8 from the free throw line before missing those two at the end. Those other 3 missed free throws cost the Clippers the game just as much as the last two.
CLASSIC PAUL GEORGE
"Doc Rivers: Paul George… Paul George, listen to me when I say this. You are trash…"
Paul George is now 3 for 8 on free throws in late game clutch situations in the playoffs for his career. He is a career 85% free throw shooter
Good Guy Paul George
"George Paul at it again!! Lmao so stupid but it’s hilarious Skip actually referred to him as that, the disrespect 😂😂"
Paul George is better without Kawhi. The team isn't close lol
Paul George bricking free throws the same day a video comes out of Ben Simmons draining 3s? Are we sure the two didn’t pull a Freaky Friday?
"Again, people just be saying shit with NO evidence at all. He mentioned AD by name as a costar to play with. Tell me how we could’ve gotten Anthony Davis without including Paul George himself in a trade."
Pretty interesting how Paul George is getting a pass for missing those free throws. Nick Anderson was also a good free throw shooter and they took a shit on him for missing those free throws against the Bulls.
"The answer to your question is a definitive no.  I think a better question would be, “Does Paul George play better without Kawhi?”  I believe the answer is yes. PG is not great playing off ball. He seems like he’s playing more confidently and freely as the primary scoring option for the clips."
That’s fair but Paul George isn’t on Lebrons level but yea it’s fair to say Paul George wasn’t good in game 2.
Paul George shot 86.8% from the FT line this season.  That means the odds of him missing BOTH of those free throws are less than 2%.  That's a choke.
Damn Paul George is up for the second best player of all time debate? That's a win in my book
"Why does every argument get twisted into something about Lebron? Yes, potentially the greatest player of all time is held to a slightly different standard than Paul George."
[Let me take you back to the last time the Suns were in the Conference Finals and our best players got suspended for standing up](https://valleyofthesuns.com/2014/05/03/paul-george-robert-horry-hipcheck-steve-nash/)
"Shout out to Paul George, stepped up with a team that was missing its star player."
I will be in a discord with Paul George later...I’ll let you know
The Clippers are the only team in the NBA I just can’t stand to watch. Pat Bev is my least favorite player in the all of sports. Something another that guy just isn’t right. He’s nowhere near star level for the amount of shit he talks. It’s not the hate that legends get because they beat your team constantly. It’s the hate of that random kid who shows up at the playground and always goes way too hard on the basketball court at recess. Demarcus cousins is a bum. And Paul George is overrated. I’ve been looking forward to seeing them get eliminated
"It ain’t gonna fucking matter when Book, Ayton, and CP3 are wearing their rings and Paul George and co. are sitting at home  Edit: can’t control what over teams are doing. Clippers fans act like Kawhi made the team infinitely better. You guys were 6-5 before he got injured lol, and then won two games. Use the overwhelming amount of salt coming from yourself and put it on a pretzel or something, maybe you’ll feel better"
"I say this as a huge Clippers &amp; Paul George hater, what a run this postseason. A complete mental turnaround from last year, which I would bet anything against happening after seeing that meltdown. (Kind of ironic it was my Jazz who had a similar meltdown) Ty Lue went from ‘confused with rotations’ in the first round to a genius just like that, and Reggie Jackson is now a max player!  That being said, Paul George can win 6 straight FMVPs and he will forever be Pandemic P for me, and Pat Bev is a BITCH."
"As always with Paul George his issue is his consistency. He gives flashes of being a top 5 player who should be in MVP talks and then follows it up with a game like tonight. His average is somewhere in the middle, but man, in a playoff series that great game you had to get the win doesn't mean as much if you don't show up in the next game and you lose. Superstars bring it every game."
"what does reggie jackson mean to you? plus its a team game, to say Paul George is the only reason is pretty ignorant lol"
"Haha the clippers radio announcer I was listening to said “like a good neighbor, Paul George is there!”  I needed to see the actual play haha"
Paul George is literally the only reason the Clippers made it this far. I think we’re good
lol paul george got 21 points for the game. yall kept the wrong paul
"Fuck narratives and fuck basketball twitter, Paul George is a real one and he played his ass off this postseason."
*Depressed and anxiety ridden Paul George waves goodbye as he sobs uncontrollably*
"Damn, some of these Clippers seem like nice and wholesome dudes. It's really hard for me to dislike players like Reggie and Paul George"
Paul George: it's OK guys this is not a championship or bust year.
Prove me wrong...cp3 was a net negative on the court his first 3 games back. Book became woefully ineffcient after beverly headbutts him. Do clipper player like morris and reggie jackson go off as much as they did with kawhi even on the floor. Does paul george? Keep operating with these whats if tho..really doesnt matter.
I memed this man super hard. But now I have to give him his props. He showed up big. Pandemic P is dead. Paul George has arrived.
"Lebron has made up for how he cowered away from the moment in the ten years since 09-11. When Paul George is ever  the best player on his team for 4 straight round you let me know.  When Paul George is the best player for every game in ANY series they win you let me know. When Paul George actually has a ""fuck this you're not gonna blame this on me"" game in an elimination game  you let me know. Until one of those things happen  this entire conversation is ridiculous."
Paul George has nothing to prove. He’s an amazing and talented basketball star that came back from a horrific and potentially career ending injury to lead his team to a conference final. He earned my fandom a long time ago
if it wasn’t for pat bev this playoff series would be pretty fucking cool with Paul George an some other vets showing up without kawhi but now it’s just the series where pat bev was a giant bitch the entire time
Paul George: that's a bad shot.
"Gotta wait and see what he can cook up. Who saw the whole Paul George thing coming two years ago? You have to admit you have no clue what he wants and it's entirely possible he looks at this aging roster that's probably about to lose Jackson and Batum to free agency, with no picks to trade and he might feel like this is a sinking ship. After all, any team with cap space can offer him exactly as much as the Clippers can, since he's a 10 year vet and they don't have his Bird rights. He might want to go try to be the King of NY next for all we know."
"shoutout paul george, fuck pat bev"
Which is why he promptly went and recruited Paul George and forced the clippers to mortgage their future to pick up “playoff p”.
"Paul George def salvaged his legacy with this series, at least to an extent. With that said, FUCK PAT BEV!"
Get ready for r/nba to pretend like they’ve never made fun of Paul George and say how awful everyone else is for making playoff P jokes
"Clipper fans laughed at me when I told them Terrance Mann's 40 pt game in the series win against the Jazz was a one hit wonder.... but on a brighter note I loved the ovation for PG13 at the end, respect to Paul George I loved seeing this dominant prowess he had without Kwahi it reminded me of his prime days with Roy Hibbert and the Pacers."
Remember to give Paul George his flowers.
"Fuck this guy. Broke Booker’s face and now this. Respect to the Clippers, especially to Paul George, and especially not to this tucking guy"
Paul George definitely earned a ton of reapect
"Paul George earned some respect, pat bev is a fucking clown"
Did a 180 on how I think about Paul George  True redemption arc
"It’s awful to watch. If anyone on the Suns team played like Pat Bev defense on Paul George, he would foul out in six possessions"
I think after 3 games in the series Paul George with his historic amount of minutes had 2 fouls total called on him.
"I said it before, but the Clippers are a weird group of guys. They have some of the easiest players to hate combined with some of the toughest players to hate.  Jackson, Mann, Kawhi, Zubac, Ibaka, and even Paul George (even with all the fucking push offs) are really easy to root for.  But then they have Beverley, Cousins and Morris."
"Only Mann, Zubac and R. Jackson are worthy on that over rated team, most of those guys have no spirit, they crumble under pressure and under perform time and time again.   George tried to injure Booker's nose, Cousins elbowed C. Paul, and this is the cherry on top. They don't deserve anything, not even respect. And those who say Paul's a trash talker, that's part of the game, he will never come cowardly pushing your back. Berverley should be out of the league."
"Completely false for me in this case.   Seriously, started this series with “I’d be happy with either team winning.” I love Paul George..been a fan since he was a rookie, and the Suns were a team that were fun to watch this year..  By game 3, I was fully supporting the Suns because of Beverly.   There are a few times where he seems so crazy it’s funny, but most of the time he’s pulling that shit, is incredibly dirty and should Have fouled out in five minutes."
"""That's a small market shot"" - Paul George"
"I would say so. Condensed season. Played a game every other day through the whole month of June, no Kawhi, no Ibaka, down Zubac at the end, battered Morris, gassed Paul George. Came back from 2 0-2's. Still took the Suns to 6. Definitely a successful season."
"Paul George poking eyes and elbowing Booker in the nose, Beverly shoving CP3 like a pus. Ballmer acting a clown on the sidelines. embarrassing...I feel bad for Kawhi.  Go Sun's!!!"
So you ignore the game 5 when Paul George had 35 to put them up 3-2  Paul George was still the clippers best player after kawhi went down and played well after kawhi went down
"They were fking tired. Esp Paul George, - played most minutes by far out of anyone in the entire playoffs and played every second day for more than a month - no other team had such a crazy schedule even if they went to a game 7. I legit think they were just gassed."
"He should and will. He has no reason to stick around when you legit have Paul George and husks of what you want to call players. I am legit so fucking happy this happened after calling out all the Clippers ""fans"" a few nights ago. They deserved this."
"I agree that particular game could be considered a choke by him, but I don't think its enough to offset everything else he did this postseason. Is every player who misses game winning/icing shots a choker? It just sounds like you're going out of your way to shit on Paul George lol"
"Oh please, like you guys wouldn't boo George Paul or kawhi of they'd won? Hypocrites."
Good effort by the clips. Feel like Paul George plasy much better with the ball in his hands and a main option.
I don’t think people are giving the suns enough credit for how well they defended Paul George today. PG didn’t get any easy looks and they were determined to let anyone else beat them
idk what nephew takes you’ve been reading but in no world is khris middleton better than paul george lol
First cp3 got his Kankles broke by Paul George then pat bev gonna give my boy whiplash
"This. Paul George attempted less shots than Marcus Morris in a win or go home game. He was tired. Clippers shouldn't feel bad though, they were without their best player."
paul george is that dude fr
paul george is at worst a top 20 player in this league and his performance in these playoffs were up to that standard
*Paul George looking over to CP3*  “Noticed you copied my second half strategy”
"Ay man, the man that wanted him there was chilling in the suite just watching. Hell, even Balmer was front row cheering. Paul George was not the problem this year."
Pat Bev getting ejected I'd prefered Chris Paul never touch the finals but I want Paul George and Pat Bev there even less.
"Bad guys? Clippers came back from 0-2 twice. With Kawhi, they would've swept the suns. If anything, the suns are the bad guys. They won against a poor lakers team without AD, and lebron doing all the work. They won against a poor nuggets team without Jamal Murray, and jokic doing all the work. They won against a growing clippers team without Kawhi, and a tired Paul George. Now, they're gonna go up against possibly  either a hawks team without trae or a bucks team without giannis. And to add, they have Chris Paul, who's hit the floor more times than he's actually shot this series"
"Ran out of gas.  They played the most games with least amount of rest.  No one in this playoff play more minutes than Paul George.  Not everyone is build like LBJ when healthy.  There are limits.  Also, CP3 is god at flopping."
"paul george winded  just lost to a better team, nothing went wrong"
"Paul George, once again, goes out like a bitch. Didn't even die swinging."
Paul George looked heartbroken....
"I am not a Paul George fan and still, who the fuck cares."
Torrey craig clamped up Paul George in an elimination game lol.
"Agreed. Paul George looked really good without Kawhi. I really don't like them, but they're definitely going to be championship contenders for the coming years. Well, if they keep their current roster."
"Paul George really redeemed himself this year. I was borderline rooting for the Clippers to turn it around without Kawhi until Pat Bev did that.   GG though, looking forward to next season."
"He probably has, but I don't think he's a different player than he has been for his career. He had some amazing games, but also added to his modern day record of games shooting below 25%. That's just who Paul George is.  But this was definitely his best playoff run imo and his stock has gone up"
"Seriously, the Clippers looked great this series. Ultimately I think they just ran out of gas. Paul George showed he could be a number one option. Proud of y’all, the Clippers is a good squad. Hope PG brings a Chip to LA next time around"
What? Fuck Paul George!
I agree Paul George was pretty damn awesome these playoffs. Can we just give the suns some credit for playing extremely well today
"PAUL GEORGE, WHO ON THE SUNS IS SCARING YOU"
"First and foremost, Pat Bev the queen bitch.  Paul George is a bitch in training.  Boogie's ring chasing is clearly making him a big booty bitch."
Good for Paul George and the team. Played with some heart this year. Fuck the Clippers for all time though.
You had a good run Clippers. You'll be back here next year and actually probably will be in the finals. And Paul George has shown that he isn't a choker
"Get fucked Pat Bev. Mad respect for Ty Lue, Paul George, and Reggie Jackson, though, they were all great this series (and these playoffs)."
"I'd say yes. People will talk about him not showing up tonight, but give the guy a break. He carried them through that Jazz series, and is the biggest reason this series went to 6 games. This is coming from a non Paul George fan too."
Final totals for Paul George: 776 minutes in 19 games and 39 days.  Ridiculous amount of work he endured.
Fuck Paul George. Both of them dirty as skidrow
Paul George especially. He showed up this series
"Whether you want to admit it or not, give Paul George his credit. He truly became Playoff P this year"
"Whether you want to admit it or not, give Paul George his credit. He truly became Playoff P this year"
"Pat Bev, Paul George and every clippers fan is a bitch"
"Whether you want to admit it or not, give Paul George his credit. He truly became Playoff P this year"
He doesn't have anywhere else to go. Paul George is as good as 2nd man he's gonna get
Damn Chris Paul just leaving with Paul George
Paul George made as many FGs (5) as picks LA used to get him (5) this game
Paul George made as many FGs (5) as picks LA used to get him (5) this game
Paul George too much of a cry baby to congratulate the winning team. Bitch made
"**Fuck the Clippers, fuck Paul George, and, most importantly, FUCK PAT BEV!**"
Paul George now the GOAT Clipper on top of the GOAT hairline.
Paul George: ☹👋
Idk how to feel seeing Paul George sad
Paul George waving goodbye. How nice of him.
Paul George was straight up historic in these playoffs
Final totals for Paul George: 776 minutes in 19 games and 39 days.  Ridiculous amount of work.
Paul George looks dead inside
I feel bad for Paul George until I realize that even after this loss is life is infinitely better then mine he’s still good looking and he’ll go train on some island in the summer with his millions and a bunch of Instagram thots surrounding his every move
"Dude that contrast between Coach Monty kissing Booker on the forehead and the camera shift to Paul George on the bench looking bummed out, waving goodbye. Lol"
Paul George acquitted himself well in this series for what it’s worth.
Paul George is the softest player in NBA History
Imagine if Paul George just made his free throws smh
Paul George waving bye bye to his dynasty
"Why? Do the bulls get credit for jimmy butler, or the pacers for Paul George? Just because a player improves doesn’t mean they were molded by an organization, and especially not by just one guy."
he hasn't really fallen that far its mostly idiots on social media that said the same stupid shit about Kyle Lowry Paul George Chris Paul and now Simmons. Casual fans are dumb.
"I don't think any borderline star in the league makes moves without pushing off constantly  Bias obviously, but Paul George, Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, Book, CP3, Doncic..  I really struggle to think of any All-Star or All-Star caliber player who doesn't do what looks like an offensive foul to me on most iso plays that aren't fadeaways or contested deep shots"
"People will say anything to justify hating on smaller teams. Like, the Suns beat the Lakers, Clippers, and Nuggets, and the Bucks beat the Nets. Who cares if people were out, that's still LeBron, Paul George, MVP Jokic, Durant, Harden all to get through to the finals. If those ""A"" teams can't beat ""B"" teams with one person missing, they're not A teams."
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"He can have multiple motivations, but he reportedly stated to the Raptors front-office that he felt they didn't have the tools to repeat.  Considering he ultimately signed with the Clippers *after* they landed Paul George, it's clear that team construction was a huge motivation for who he would ultimately sign with."
[Westbrook and Paul George:](https://imgur.com/XtBWMTK)
Paul George isn’t a superstar. He too inconsistent for me to consider him a superstar. The team was also gonna beat the Suns but then Kawhi got hurt.
"Too much of a prisoner of the moment, my friend. Guy played really impactful defense for the 76ers all year and suddenly everyone just agrees he’s useless.   I just went through this with paul George last season. Guy is young, on a long term deal, and Is a great athlete who finished second in dpoy. He has time to figure it out. The question is whether Philly does"
Paul George
"btw the la clippers are the best team in the nba. They don’t need no super teams and mouses to get the job done. Enjoy seeing Reggie Jackson, Terrence man, Paul George, kawhi, zubac, and pat bev DOMINATE the nba. Cholos love the clippers. We ain’t no bandwagon fans foo"
"He’s best friends with PG13 and Paul George vouched for him when he signed there so there’s a chance he’ll take a discount to stay. I agree his attitude did change when he went there. When he was with the Pistons in Blake’s first year when Blake was all nba, Blake spoke openly about the team not taking things seriously and almost always the camera would pan to Reggie just fucking around or dancing lol"
"It's different. Kawhi said to the Raptors FO  ""get me a superstar here and I'm staying, get me Paul George.""  The FO said no, they could not sacrifice Pascal Siakam.  So it's not really Kawhi wanted to leave."
My money's on him taking a discount and re-signing with the Clippers so he can keep playing with his best friend Paul George.
"Paul George offensive charge basically every time he touched the ball but never called.  Booker getting shoved and his arms pulled every time he drove in the lane, never called.  Ayton got hacked repeatedly when he got the ball under the net.  Never called.  Paul George got a tech for throwing his upper body in to Booker's face and hitting his broken nose with his elbow.  Should have been a flagrant.  Paul George also elbowed Booker in the face early in the series and there was no call despite Booker getting a flagrant for the same play.  Cousins and Morris repeatedly shoving Suns players during dead ball situations and never got a tech.  See anyone can list this shit off it proves nothing.  Clippers shot overwhelmingly more free throws than the Suns over the series yet you still want to complain like the Suns got help.  Take the fucking L and move on."
But who is the next Paul George?
"Time is running out. Kawhi Leonard is still in his prime but for how long given how injury prone he is. Paul George has shown signs of being a superstar, but when it comes down to the wire, he seems to crumble under the pressure."
"&gt; Oscar Bucks - Not a super team. Kareem and Oscar form a 2-star core. The Clippers with Kawhi and Paul George are not a super team so why would this team be one?  lmao you have to ask, PG is not comparable to either.   &gt; Moses joining is still more of pushing them over the hump and giving them a bonafide second star rather than forming a super team.   Lame ass argument and you know it. I wasnt aware someone crowned you decider of superteams, last time I checked having one of the best in the league join another best in the league to chase rings was the definition. That star power only losing one playoff game.... huh uh   &gt; Barkley Rockets - Past their prime, last ditch effort by Barkley to get a ring. First time I’ve heard anyone try to call them a super team.  Oh snap, because you have not heard it , must not have happened. How the fuck do you not call Clyde the Clyde, Charles and Olajuwon a superteam, stop huffing glue."
"Wilt Lakers - Closest to possibly having a super team argument, though Elgin was in the twilight of his career when he joined and by the time they won anything Elgin was already gone (playing 11 games over that season and the one prior. Difficult to apply modern perspectives onto a much smaller league as well - weren’t viewed as a super team at the time and haven’t had a retroactive argument made for them being one until relatively recently. If the Wilt trade happens closer to everyone’s primes and they win the chip with Elgin I wouldn’t have a problem with this one being called a super team though.   Oscar Bucks - Not a super team. Kareem and Oscar form a 2-star core. The Clippers with Kawhi and Paul George are not a super team so why would this team be one?  Moses Malone + Dr. J - Not a super team, 2-star duo. Well rounded team regardless, especially coming off a Finals loss the previous season. Moses joining is still more of pushing them over the hump and giving them a bonafide second star rather than forming a super team.   Barkley Rockets - Past their prime, last ditch effort by Barkley to get a ring. First time I’ve heard anyone try to call them a super team.   The Glove and Pedo Malone joining the Lakers - Both past their primes, chasing rings, and importantly were not co-stars to Shaq/Kobe. Not a super team.   You’re welcome."
They would never do that. Paul George is handsomely valuable then dame
Lol why on earth would the clippers to that ? Forgive me but these playoffs just proved why Paul George is clearly better then dame who lost to campazzio and Austin rivers
"Kinda. He's like top 13ish when everyone is fully healthy. Curry, LJ, Kd, Kawhi, Embid, Luka, Jokic, Giannis, Harden, Ad. That's 10. Then you got guys like Lillard, Paul George, Tatum, and CP3.  But every year there are major injuries that lets guys like CP3 be top 10 players."
"“Tony Parker was the closest and I even think Ben is faster than that,” Brown said, via Michael Pina of SB Nation. “There are times when we all think ‘oh he’s really fast.’ What I do is count the steps from foul line to foul line and there aren’t many. Count the dribbles. There aren’t many. He covers ground quicker than anybody I think that I’ve ever coached and the closest would be Tony.  ”And you’d all go back and you’d look at Russell Westbrook, maybe early days Derrick Rose. John Wall. Like, those greyhounds that just take off. But really, forget your stopwatch, count the dribbles and count the steps. He is elite when it comes to that part of the game.”  According to private data provided to SB Nation by NBA Advanced Stats, Simmons’ top recorded speed this year was 19.7 miles per hour, which translates to him racing the length of a court in roughly 3.25 seconds.   Direct quote above  If the Raptors try to get Simmons for OG, the 76ers laugh and hang up.  I like OG a lot but he’s not the same level as Simmons.  Some stats might say OG is number 2 in defensive versatility but from the games I’ve seen, I’d say:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Giannis  3. Kawhi 4. Healthy Issac  5. OG  Paul George, Tatum, playoff LeBron (might be too old now), Covington, Gordon, Butler, Bam, Smart, and Jrue are very versatile defensively too"
Paul George named his parents Paul and Paulette George
"Dame and lillard are the same :) Paul George was traded for 5 first rounders. I think any top star is at least 3 first round picks, or at least protected pick swaps included."
"&gt; Flair bias aside, I absolutely think it would.   Then why didn't they draw better than other teams in the earlier rounds?  &gt; Probably not but both teams have enough superstar power that it would have a decent draw  They don't though. Nobody outside of more serious NBA fans know who Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and James Harden are. They are on the same level as Chris Paul and Giannis in terms of star power.  Lebron is really the only ""superstar"" the NBA has. You can see it in the ratings. Lakers - Warriors play in did 5.6 million viewers. Warriors - Memphis did 3.6.  Steph Curry is probably the second most popular NBA ""superstar"" and even he doesn't have the star power to pop the ratings."
"100%. CP3 has had a very good year, and so has Paul George. But some people have gone insane with the praise, at times washing over past criticism as if it was invalid."
1. Patrick Beverley  2. Draymond green  3. Matt Barnes   4. Cp3  5. Russell Westbrook  6. James harden  7. Kevin Durant   8. Paul George   9. Boban   10. Ben simmons
I get the frustration. I felt the same way watching Paul George push off and hunt for fouls. I think much of this is on the coaches though. It’s not exactly a secret that Booker does this until he is forced to adjust. Watching defenders refuse to stay home on challenges makes me think that they weren’t prepared and it just went on all game. On top of this the defensive scheme you all were running was less than ideal. CP3 and Booker were abusing mismatches the entire game.
Crowder has been awesome defensively this playoffs. The only guy he's struggled against was Paul George
"Melo would chuck his way into a fistfight and a black eye with KG on that team.  In all seriousness, He wasn’t as efficient as Pierce, was a much worse defender, and wasn’t close to as clutch as Pierce. Pierce’s selfless play lends itself more to winning a ring than melo posting up for his 38th brick of the game.  You can replace Pierce with anyone as good as current Paul George and they probably beat the lakers in 7, but melo isn’t one of those guys. He’s just not in the same class as Pierce.  Nephews have inflated Melo to being some all time great when he was never that guy."
"Paul George does that on every shot and they never call it. It was a weird call but the right one. My thing is just to be consistent. If you are going to call it once, call it all the time."
this is why i always get annoyed when pistons players make it lol. im glad they have the opportunity but also paul george
"If Doc Rivers can coach Paul George, I think Billups can patch things up with Carmelo."
"I guess I would say the before this postseason (which is the context we are talking in) Paul George wasn't considered a superstar... fair?  &gt;Your examples indicate as much. 2004 Pistons had 4 all stars in their prime.  If you're going to accuse me of not knowing ""hoops"" you at least gotta be right lol.  The only All-star from the 2004 Pistons was Ben Wallace.  Rip and Chauncey didn't make an All-Star team until 2006 and Rasheed did one in 2001 &amp; 2006, but not in the 04 season.  You're making a distinction between stars and superstars. In 2004 the Pistons only had 1 guy that you would consider a superstar - Ben Wallace.  &gt; a Warrior team with 1 superstar another star and a non-existent bench  The Warriors had Steph, Klay and Draymond (Klay missed 1 game)... which one of those is the star, superstar and not either of them? Because that's probably the best PG, best SG and one of the best PF in the game in 2019.  At LEAST 2 superstars.  Durant was the only one out for that series.  Like I said, if you're gonna say I don't know shit, at least know what you're talking about lol"
"Paul George averaged 27 a game and dragged the Clippers to the WCF Finals and even made the series competitive. If you don’t think he’s a superstar, you don’t know hoops and only follow headlines   Your examples indicate as much. 2004 Pistons had 4 all stars in their prime. 2019 Raptors had a superstar against a Warrior team with 1 superstar another star and a non-existent bench. Just stop"
"I don't think Paul George is a superstar but I digress..  &gt; Name a time when a team with significantly less star power beat a super team in a 7 game series  2004 Pistons, 2019 Raptors, etc"
paul george level player? you mean an all nba wing? cmon now bruh   and to answer your question mikal bridges but i don’t like naming him the “worst player in the league you can add to a team”
&gt; Who is the worst player in the league that you can add to the 2020 Heat that would flip the series against the Lakers?  &gt;Does a Paul George level player swing the series? Or do the Heat need more? (I.e. a superstar like a Kawhi or Giannis level player)  huh
nah a player who has Paul George rent free in their head should not be honored
