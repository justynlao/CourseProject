Tobago to Johnny Hamilton
"Hawks signed Johnny Hamilton as 15th man..  Couldve retained Nathan Knight (who is genuinely awesome) snagged Omer Yurtseven, or pursued Paul Millsap/Isaiah Hartenstein  Dare I say it but this was Travis Schlenk's only misstep this offseason"
"The show is fairly accurate as it's based off one of the best John Adam's biographies that we have, a David McCollugh work.  I would personally recommend it to anybody trying to understand the early years of the United States. As important as he was, Washington played the role of Cincinattus, but largely stayed above the ideological fray.  If you want to know the governing ideologies, the philosophy and the politics of our early years, Adam's, Jefferson &amp; Hamilton are the men to look at. The HBO miniseries does a great job on my opinion.  Tl;dr: Johnny is focused and dedicated to serving the people of the United States. For that he has my respect and admiration. However, his pride and temper sometimes got the best of him. It's no surprise he lasted 1-term. With that said... he accepted defeat gracefully, the first President to have to do so, establishing the precedent of peaceful transitions of power that survived until 2020."
"&gt;Jordan was getting guarded by 6'3 John Starks  John Starks is 6'5, when are you going to stop talking out of your ass lol?  &gt;Neither of those teams were better than the Pistons or Spurs defensively. They didn't have the length, or versatility of those teams.  Yes they did? Rodman is arguably the most versatile defender of all time. The '07 Pistons and Spurs was a complete joke defensively compared to them.  &gt;The 2014 Spurs would've been a harder matchup for Jordan than Bad Boy Pistons because Kawhi is better than any perimeter defender than either of those teams had and Tim Duncan is a better interior defender than either of those teams.  First of all, why bring up the 2014 Spurs from out of nowhere? We are discussing the eastern conference in '89 vs '07.   Second of all, you are correct about Duncan but prime Rodman was definitely on Kawhis level defensively.  &gt;I want you to imagine an NBA where 6'9 250 Pound LeBron, you know the same weight as Bill Laimbeer is getting guarding by John Starks, Craig Ehlo, and Joe Dumars for an entire series with no zone defense in an isolation era lmaooo.  Why would Starks and Dumars guard a SF/PF? If he would play those same teams in '89 he would be guarded by Larry Nance (all nba defender), Johnny Newman/Kenny Walker who were 6'7/6'8 with Oakley/Ewing at the rim and then Dennis Rodman (DPOY). Imagine that instead of Richard Jefferson and Rip Hamilton LOL.   You also need to think about the rule changes that would work against him. He might not face zone, but he will be having MUCH less spacing, which is significant for someone who wants to attack. Also no defensive 3 seconds so he would have two 7 footers waiting at the rim everytime, much less assists and ability to create for others with less spacing as well. His help defense ability wouldn't be as significant either with zone being illegal.  Similarly, put Jordan in this era and he might have to face zone, but also WAY more spacing, no handchecking and less defense at the rim. He would also have more freedoom defensively with being able to play zone.  I can say the same thing to you as well. Imagine an NBA where peak Jordan only has to beat a 51 win team with Tayshaun Prince/Rip Hamilton guarding him to make the finals."
