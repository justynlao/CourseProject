Trevor Ariza and McGee would help
"IDK about all time but Trevor Ariza was one of the best of the last 15ish years. Very good for the Lakers, Hornets, and later for the Rockets."
"Just don't ask us about our SFs after Ingram. It's like 115 games of Trevor Ariza, the hustle of the undrafted rookie and sophomore Kenrich Williams, or the last grasps of Peja Stojakovic's prime. And everybody else is either really bad or not a small forward."
Trevor Ariza hit Rudy with a very hard and imo very dirty foul early in his career. I think it had some long lasting effects that Rudy never let on.
Trevor Ariza by a mile
Trevor Ariza
"How come nobody is giving Denver FO shit for letting Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig go? Where's that ""letting a washed Trevor Ariza go"" energy."
"Nah. Trae Young exists. IT blocked Demarcus Cousins and Trevor Ariza. More than you can say for Trae.   Also what's Wilt's record on finals appearances, finals wins, playoff wins, compared to LEbron and Jordan. There is a reason that Celtic fans who say Russell  is better than Chamberlain, say ""he really lived up to the name 'Wilt' especially when it mattered the most"""
Rudy Gay or Trevor Ariza.  I trust DeAndre Jordan more than any of these free agent and potential buyout centers.
&gt;Trevor Ariza will most likely be remembered for his time as the starting small forward on the 65-17 Houston Rockets team  Whut?  No.
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
"Trevor Ariza was the #1 option for the Rockets that one year, if that counts."
They have any more picks? We have Al Horford and Trevor Ariza.
&gt;Active: Trevor Ariza (Miami) - 10.5/4.8/2.2 (2005- ) - The most traded player in NBA history Trevor Ariza will most likely be remembered for his time as the starting small forward on the 65-17 Houston Rockets team and as being one the best 3&amp;D players in the league during his prime.  I think most will remember Ariza for his coming off the bench (although inconsistent) play with the 07-09 Lakers where he hit some big shots and won a championship
"Hood is coming off a major injury, I'm actually surprised he's able to get on the floor at all.  Hopefully he can keep progressing and get back to being a useful NBA player, even if he can just make his spot up looks this year that'll help a lot (though I did like him before he got hurt as a secondary playmaker).  DJJ doesn't shoot a lot and he does a lot of high visibility things that jump off the screen (quite literally, often) but it's really tough to have a guy playing 27 MPG that can't/won't shoot.  It hurts the Blazers spacing overall and makes things tougher for everyone else, and if they make the playoffs it could be a real problem for them as opponents game-plan and give him the Evan Turner treatment (DJJ at least can grab some OREBs and is a good off-ball cutter, which helps).  Just gotta hope that DJJ can have a progression path like Trevor Ariza did from 2008-2009.  That season he took a lot of open corner 3s and bricked tons of them, but by the playoffs he was making some more &amp; had confidence to fire which ended up really helping the Lakers as they made their run."
I think Trevor ariza will be most remembered for Lakers
Even more surprising for me is that Trevor Ariza is the best current player from Florida...
next trevor ariza
Ahh the Trevor Ariza Syndrome
Who's the best player they can realistically get? Trevor Ariza? He would help but I dont think it's going to change things that much. And as always its never a lock any guy goes to a particular team at all players have varying priorities.  Cleaning the glass has them 8th in opponent 3 point % and 19th in mid range % seems like its evened out. I just dont see this kind of defensive personnel leading to a high end defense at all over a larger sample size. And it's starting to play out. Defensive rating was strong the first 4 games it's been terrible lately. Really the only two good defensive games theyve played the past few weeks were with alot of guys no longer on the team(ie the Utah game without Kyrie and the Philly game without KD or Kyrie). Those are the only 2 games in their past 11 where they held opponents to a &lt;111 def rating.
Trevor Ariza probably going to come in as well to add another from the Rockets.
Trevor Ariza will be bought out and in a BRK jersey within 2 months
"Lol this doesn't prove your point at all man. As I said, the first list is primarily 1s/2s, whereas the 2nd list is primarily 2s/3s. Aaron Gordon would never guard Dame. Trevor Ariza would never guard Dame. Shabazz Napier would never guard Luka, etc.  You have a few guys that are SG/SFs that unsurprisingly appear on both lists, because Dame is a pure point guard, whereas Luka is a SF/SG in a pinch. Aka, defensive minded 2s can sometimes guard both, like Jrue, Harris, etc  You are not a point guard if you are never guarding the opposing teams PG unless they're tony allen level offensive players  Idc what Carlisle says. If Stotts said Dame was center, that doesn't make him a center. Luka primarily guards other 3s/2s and almost never guards PGs, whereas Dame primarily guards 1s/2s, and almost never guards 3s - note that the **only** time either strays from their position defensively is in the case of guys who are  poor offensively.  Dame primarily guards the weaker of the 1/2. Luka primarily guards the weaker of the 2/3 - the only reason there is some overlap is because both will guard weak offensive 2 guards."
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
So what was happening is 2016 when he had 11 assists a game with Ryan Anderson and Trevor Ariza?
"We'd be so fucked if we hadn't turned Trevor Ariza, Mario Hezonja, and a couple of late firsts into Kanter and RoCo.  Almost didn't get Kanter too, since he could have gone to the Grizz, but he likes us I guess, and chose to come back to Portland."
Trevor ariza.
"That's a pretty pathetic take, I'm sure Trevor Ariza would of carried us to titles while Russ and KD had season ending injuries."
"SAS waiving DeRozan Aldridge and Mills does not make sense.  Chris Paul can tear his Achilles and the suns won’t waive him.   Players of these caliber don’t get bought out, they get traded if their teams don’t want them. The best player on this market will likely be Trevor Ariza."
Buy out market is the most likely viable option. That or trading some 2nd rounders. Trevor Ariza might be the best most realistic target. Maybe having Spencer Dinwiddie's bird rights in FA for this summer would have some value to a team in a trade but that's a small thing.
When a team fails to Trade Trevor Ariza you know they messed up.
"Harden was a product of Daryl Morey and played for MDA, MDA and Daryl Morey get to leave for free, Harden is tied to a contractual obligation. Basically the moment the Rockets traded Trevor Ariza for RoCo it became apparent that they were not going to give him the team he deserved.   Admittedly it sucks that he had to throw a little tantrum to get out of there but compare what Harden does to what Kyrie does where he has no excuse and what James Harden did seems trivial."
"Well on the plus side for them, they're going to be preeminent favorite to get whoever is bought out because they have playing time and open roster spots up for grabs.   I think your team is the only one that stands a chance because of Embiid, however I'm not sure you have enough perimeter scoring from the likes of Seth Curry/Shake/Maxey/Tobias to win 4 out of 7 vs. this team.   Like Jeff Green, for all his notable flaws as a player, isn't actually THAT bad as a man defender, he did a very good job on Giannis in their game last year in the bubble, and if you look at how much Crowder gave Giannis trouble, you can imagine Jeff Green being able to pose the same problem.   When push comes to shove at the end of games, they are probably going to switch 1-5, which is why they probably need one more 3&amp;D wing as Joe Harris is probably too much of a defensive liability on quick guards. However, I won't put it past them to get like, a Trevor Ariza, or somebody of that ilk."
"TIllman literally went on collin cowherd and play by played the play. He was on his yacht in europe, the baksetball ops were getting cold feet and not comorable with the trade and he decided he believed in business you gotta keep changing and exciting and pushed the trade.  Mind you, we also replaced Trevor ariza and MBAh our best defenders in our best years with James Ennis who he traded for a swap while we were competing and Daniel house from the gleague who we wouldnt sign for am onth while he was a starter in a short team until cap space went well.     Hes traded first round picks for space, hes ignored the MLE, ignored trade exceptions about 10 million worth(just like you guys, a real committed franchise to winning, bought in kelly oubre although many dont know if you can compete this year)  And even now, if you are paying attention he took oladipo an expiring who wants to goto miami over levert who you could use as a piece or trade in the summer.  We chose a late first round pick over allen, who would be a lottrey pick this year  Tillmans selling the snake oil and people are still listening. For some reason people even bought his book, shut up and listen.  He speaks about his amazing business experiecne when he was about to go broke in the 1980s and owed millions but the banks folded and he basically got millions in grants..."
"typically I agree, by all accounts honor your contract.  HArden is not blameless in this situation, but the dominos started and the trajectory changed with the new ownership.  HE apinted this narrative that houston did everything for harden, so let me get this straigth 2018, one game from the finals. We had all our bird rights, Hardens best friend on the team was Trevor ariza, he was also the lead switch defender in our best defensive year, a veteran champion glue guy who had the ear and respect of Harden and Paul. Just like Miami pays haslem on the roster even though he doesn't play. These glue guys make a difference.          They don't resign him, which is fine to make a move but DURING contention they replace him with a minimum contract in James ennis. He is in MDA's 8 man short rotation and just a few months later he is traded for a 2nd round swap.  Tillman also badly negotiated and chased off Jeff bzdelik, likewise with MDA.  EVen morey left 24 million on his contract.    That year along with bird rights for all our players, we had 10 million plus in trade exception(like the one you guys just used on kelly oubre), we had MLE, we had majority of our draft picks still ...we used none of them  So your telling me in an age of load management, the guy who still plays heavy games, minutes, useage....the nba i a crazy marathon, he is leading the league in points, assits and doing it while he has a target on his back because anyone who stops him is getting a Bag...that ain't laziness  This guy by all accounts wanted to be a houston lifer. He just opened a restaurant, he moved his family here, has invested in multiple business locally, has an active local foundation ad opennly says he wants to retire here.  Then new owner came. Harden is not media Savvy, his mom is his agent so on.  He doesnt  get that skill by just showing up from the strip club, he is known to be a hoop junkie who didnt even want to stop the shoot aroudns when MDA decided to.      The owner has publicly lied with reciepts multiple times, and now harded seeing the blame and a team watered down year after year of trading picks and assets for savings that only tillman sees while harden generates millions for him.        So he has 1-3 years left of the culmination of his entire career and lifes work in his prim,e hes suppopsed to waste it on an owner who has lied to him, cut cost in all kinds of ways, then unleases a PR leaks on his reptuation while for some reason also sayingthis terrible culture guy I want to pay 100 million too?  Sadly people are buying up tillmans snake oil and he'll keep dolling it out.  He even had a best seller called shut up and listen.  He talks abotu how in the 1980s he owed millions to banks and was in a sink sitaution and the banks defaulted and he just got a free millions of grants.  Good luck, but is that the guy you want business advice from?     Hes done well in his field, but in the nba he is out of his league and wen the GM, Coach, associate coach, all the guys wanted out. Harden isn't blameless, defintiely hadneld things stupidly, but the trajectory and dominos start with tillman nad I don't blame him more than I would blame anyone for wanting to leave a place you feel your boss hurt the culture, lied to your face, and made your job and dreams harder.  BC harden knows the move is away from all the comforts he has here"
"What’s the purpose of this deal for the Nets? Like beyond the “star power” how is this supposed to work? The team in the season opener was already a top contender. You had  a ball dominant PG that could do everything and anything he wanted on the court at a high efficiency, a dead eye 3PT shooter, TWO rebounding/rim protecting big men, multiple versatile “wing” defenders, Lavert who could act as your microwave off the bench, and the greatest 6”10 off-ball scorer in the NBA. They were a bit inconsistent on defense but that team would of been a favorite to come out of the East.  Now you’ve sent away your bench scorer, your starting center, and mortgage your future for what? Harden and Kyrie literally fill the exact same role. They are both ball dominant high usage PG’s that either ISO pound the ball into the ground or play P&amp;R.  It would be like if the 08-09 Lakers traded Lamar Odom, Trevor Ariza, and Shannon Brown plus 3 first round picks to get Joe Johnson. Yes you now have your “big 3” but two of them literally play the same position and basically do the same thing for your team offensively."
"Jason Kidd, Trevor Ariza, Channing Frye, Donyell Marshall, Brooke Lopez, Marc Gasol..."
Trevor Ariza headed back with Harden and MDA
"How do you mean completely reactionary?  Everyone knew when they signed the Chris Paul and Dwight Howard contracts that they were going for high risk high reward win now moves that required spending large amounts of money.  Those were proactive attempts to bolster the roster around James Harden, and in no way reactions.  If anything, they reacted quickly by trying to retool to actually take advantage of James Harden's prime.  They sign a contract for Dwight Howard to get a great player for James Harden to play with.  BUT, James Harden can't play with him. So they ship him out.  BUT, James Harden wants to win now. So they sign a massive contract with aging and injury prone Chris Paul to win now cause he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, James can't win with Chris Paul his first year. So they try to retool the team. They get the hottest 3-D guy on the market in RoCo and hope for a runback.  BUT, james can't win with Chris again and starts to dislike him. So the team ships him out and further leverages their future for Russell Westbrook because he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, this style doesn't work very well. So they retool the team. They ship out capela and go true small ball.  BUT, they still don't win. James gets grumpy and wants his new friend shipped out again.  And, now, the rockets have a very grim future and James Harden blames the Rockets.  And its not like they havent had competent players on their team throughout James Harden's tenure. PJ Tucker has been a shining example of an amazing contract in the league and Eric Gordon outside this past year was a fantastic second/third option.  They had their chances and blew it. Whether that was bad performances, bad luck, bad timing or a mixture of all three is beyond me, but I don't think its fair to say the Rockets weren't trying and spending for it too.  Rockets fans like to point to not resigning Trevor Ariza after the 17/18 season as an example of the poor management of the Rockets and their refusal to pay up.  But I just don't think Trevor Ariza is the difference maker between a winning team and a losing team.  I think the rockets could have spent more. But I dont think its fair to say they needed to.  In 2018-19, the Raptors spent $11 million more than the Rockets and won the NBA championship.  In 2019-20, the Lakers spent $13 million less than the rockets and won the NBA championship."
Trevor Ariza lol. That might be the best bet. Maybe Kyle Anderson.   If there is a worthwhile wing though was just thinking Seth Curry is a good enough asset you could probably flip him and something else for it.
"exactly.  Thanks trevor ariza, because of you patrick fertitta has a smile on his face in the mediterranean and they finally don't have to be ambarassed next to mohammad bin salmans yacht this summer.  The horror."
Tell Trevor Ariza that
"That’s fair criticism, but as someone who’s been to Houston, it doesn’t seem like he exactly based his decision on a nice place to live. Regardless, we could have offered him slightly more, and at the time I wanted to offer a Norm Powell S&amp;T as I remember thinking there would be a big market for him and Norm doesn’t fit great on our team unless we are playing the bucks. Detroit in the end only got a washed Trevor Ariza so clearly the market for him was significantly less than I thought it was."
"He literally had one “contract year” his entire career, and people treat him like Trevor Ariza. People create narratives out of nothing."
"Do you not remember Dame went into the playoffs with an injury and then missed the elimination game because of it last year? McCollum played with a fractured vertabra in his back? Trevor Ariza opting out?  The Rockets team the Warriors played in 2015 with Howard and Harden was *much* *much* better than whatever you want to call what the Lakers played last year.  Even Murray was hurt halfway into the WCF.    &gt; Not to mention KD and Russ were out with injures in the West.  If you want to compare teams that did not compete at all, a whole dynasty level team wasn't even in the playoffs last year.  &gt; A ring is a ring, but that was by far the most injury-ridden playoff run of the decade.  And that right there is just as false as it gets. You got a short term memory Nephew."
Kobe and Trevor Ariza was good
"I don't know whether you'd consider them home runs, but he drafted David Lee at 30th, Trevor Ariza in the 2nd round, Wilson Chandler at 23rd and Channing Frye in the lottery. I would argue every single one of those are picks any GM would be happy with."
"I really like Trae Young's style. Also, the NBA oldheads can be very protective of their own way of playing. For instance, what happened when Young nutmegged Trevor Ariza."
"Idk how we can say Harden was objectively more valuable. Harden’s team had a better record, and had a much better supporting cast around Harden. There were 3 great shooters around Harden — not just good, great. Trevor Ariza, the 4th best shooter not counting Harden, was as good as OKC’s best shooter, not counting Russ.   Generally I’m very down on Westbrook, he isn’t that helpful to winning most seasons. His MVP season was a huge outlier for his career. Highest TS%, best 3P shooting, highest USG, highest AST%, highest BPM, highest VORP, highest clutch scoring, best clutch efficiency, etc. etc. I don’t even know what defines BPM and VORP, it goes to show how much of an outlier it was for Russ and how the typical criticisms of his game aren’t applicable to his MVP year. Some of them still are, obviously the stat chasing, and, suspiciously, Harden’s rebounds per game numbers peaked in 16-17 and have never come close to that again, indicating Harden was also stag chasing that year.   The argument for Russ is that he carried his team more than any other star, and carried them to a good record. Takes Russ off that team and they are one of the worst in the league, while Harden’s team likely makes the playoffs based on the team’s net rating in the regular season and the playoffs when Harden was off the court.   Westbrook was by far the most clutch player in the league and carried a huge clutch load while also being efficient.   In the playoffs, the Thunder outplayed the Rockets when Russ was on the floor, and the Rockets were outplayed by OKC when Harden was on the floor.   It’s clear that Harden benefited from having significantly better teammates and a better coach/system. Harden’s team was built around him very nicely while Russ’s was built relatively poorly for him."
"Harden didn't have CP3 that year.  His second best player was Trevor Ariza according to pre-season player rankings (Eric Gordon arguably emerged as the actual 2nd best).  In fact, according to those pre-season rankings, Westbrook had the better top-end support with Adams and Oladipo appearing on all top-100 lists at around the 40 and 60 spots (on average) respectively. Even Kanter ended up ranked consistently higher than almost anyone on the Rockets."
"&gt;pat Bev, Trevor Ariza and Capela  These are not stars. Carmelo bro the washed version. Capela is solid player but without  a passer of Harden's caliber he is not that valuable. Westbrook is an aging horrible star, who we literally have to trade our big men to make it work with him to put him in the best position and we still didn't win."
"2015, he has pat Bev, Trevor Ariza and Capela  2018-19, he had Carmelo Anthony and Clint Capela  19-20 he had Russell Westbrook"
Scott Brooks and our organization don't value defense. The last good defensive players we had were prime John Wall and Trevor Ariza. And now Isaac Bonga is benched benched
Trevor Ariza
"Ah my bad, I was thinking of Trevor Ariza"
Trevor Ariza too with the Rockets
"So the worst Harden team was the 2016 Rockets, they finished 0.500 and barely squeaked into the 8 seed.   That team had Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley, and Dwight Howard. While that's not a great supporting cast, that's not abject trash.   The 2nd worst team (by win percentage) was the 2020 team. They also had Tucker, Gordon, and Covington. That's not trash, that's a solid sample of decent 3 &amp; D players."
Wall was a gifted passer the moment he entered the league. Wall is the reason guys like Trevor Ariza and Martell Webster got paid. Feels like people forget how different a pass-first PG is.
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
Might as well add Trevor Ariza and Mike Muscala for okc
Melo and Kobe went at it that series. Some late game clutch defense from Trevor Ariza won the series for LA
"Al Horford, George Hill and Trevor Ariza ^please"
"Harden and Lebron are the only ones I think you can definitevely say are better at dragging a team to the playoffs.    Our most common starting lineup last year was Dame, CJ, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan Whiteside, and either Trevor Ariza or Kent Bazemore and we had the 3rd best offense in the league"
"If they had just given Trevor Ariza, say, 12 shot attempts in that game 7, I'm sure they win. But no, Harden is a ballhog, and *THAT* is why the Rockets lost"
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"Still feels like a fever dream lol I can't believe we once were putting our future hopes in the hands of Bender, Chriss, Josh Jackson, Trevor Ariza, g league guards, and Earl Watson. No wonder we were winning 19 games a year. Scratch that, how did we even win 19 games"
"Thank Trevor-i-have-a-chip-kobe-won-for-me-ariza for taking like 5 of those shots for some reason, including the last one when harden was open. Then they traded his ass"
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
"To top it off, they gave their only other remaining veteran forward (after having let go of Trevor Ariza and Luc M'bah a Moute... And Melo if you want to count his dozen games) to Philly for a top-55 protected second round pick. Just so they could scrape under the threshold.  James Ennis proceeded to put up better numbers than Iman Shumpert in the playoffs that year."
trevor ariza
"jewl embiid is definately better than jason ""trevor ariza"" tatom"
Jayson Tatum is a poor mans trevor ariza
Trevor ariza would take offense to that.
"U can argue his 2015 MVP too, he carred a medicore team to 56 wins with Howard missing half the year and his second best player being Trevor Ariza  The 2014-15 Houston team was nowhere near a 56 win team, the amount of players that got huge minutes were basically out of the league after that, Motiejūnas, Dorsey, Terrence Jones, Jason Terry, Papanikolaou all played massive minutes and never played significant roles after that"
I remember watching some ESPN doco where they went to watch Trevor Ariza in High School
Trevor Ariza
That would be like saying the Lakers and the Rockets traded Trevor Ariza for Metta World Peace in the 2009 offseason.

"Scraped the second seed that one year rolling with Francisco Garcia, Kostas Papanikolau, Jason Terry, Pablo Prigioni, Donatas Motiejunas, Joey Dorsey, Alexey Shved and Trevor Ariza for 20 games lol"
Trevor Ariza back in the day
"In reality it’s a combination of both. He is limited offensively, and despite that his offensive number went down compared to the regular season in each of those playoffs. Furthermore, he was being exploited defensively on the perimeter. This was most notable in the Warriors and Rockets series. With the Rockets, MDA played Harden and Paul surrounded by Joe Johnson, Trevor Ariza, and Luc Mbah a Moute. This small ball and five out lineup forced Gobert away from the rim. Furthermore, they switched Harden and Paul onto Gobert repeatedly out on the perimeter to abuse and ultimately put on a clinic on how to take him out of the game defensively."
imagine trevor ariza kids having to move so much
"&gt;is more of a facilitator.  You do realize he led the league in assists in Houston playing with guys like Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Ryan Anderson, right?  His FTr was sky high (.561) in 2012 (last year in OKC) through 2017 (only drop off being 2016 when Houston sucked... Partly because refs were never giving him calls). In 2018 and 2019 it drops like a rock (.472) which is only about 3% higher than where it is now.  Swear to God 99% of people are stuck in 2015 memes and have no clue how much this man has been balling out the last 4 seasons."

"Maybe Trevor ariza was right, just deck him."
"I can't remember, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if we did. We are the same franchise who basically traded Kelly Oubre for Trevor Ariza straight up. Ariza played ~40 games for us."
"If you’re going to do the ‘the rest of his team was bad look at his impact numbers’ thing, you need to look at Houston’s roster again.   James did much more with marginally different talent (the difference is pretty much just Trevor Ariza) because he was and always will be a more efficient version of Russ, and because Donovan was a joke of a coach."
That's a weird way to say  Pat Bev Trevor Ariza Clint Capela
Great example is Trevor Ariza.
He was the next Trevor Ariza
"That has nothing to do with this thread. This thread is saying Steph playing with Wiggins (55.6 TS%), Wiseman (54.8 TS%), Oubre (50.2 TS%), and Draymond (42.7 TS%) is the equivalent to when James Harden had to play with Chris Paul (60.4 TS%), Trevor Ariza (56.7 TS%), Ryan Anderson (59.2 TS%), and Clint Capela (65.0 TS%), with Eric Gordon (57.8 TS%) off the bench."
"That team was only great because of Harden.   Who was the second best player?   Trevor Ariza?   Eric Gordon?       And yes, winning games is generally considered to be more impressive than losing them."
"I think he said he originally got the idea from the Westchester High School guys and adopted it.   https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/what-the-hell-happened-to-darius-miles  &gt;I’m 18. I’m in my element, you know? I’ll mess around and go to prom. Why not? Anyway, it wasn’t just about the girls. Westchester had a really good team, so we used to go watch Trevor Ariza and Hassan Adams and Bobby Brown and those boys. I don’t know how it got started, but they’d throw up their fists after they made a three.  &gt;So we’d be hanging with them, and they’d be like, “Come on, when you gonna shout us out? You gotta do it. Show us some love.”  &gt;So cut to me dunking the shit out of the ball, or Q hitting a big three-pointer or something, I can’t even remember, and one of us throws it up. Two taps to the head. For them boys from Westchester High.  &gt;We didn’t think anything of it. But then it just took on a life of its own. Everybody started doing it. I was sitting on the couch one day watching football, and Jerry Rice catches a touchdown and he’s doing it. Jerry fucking Rice is throwing it up in the endzone. It was totally unplanned, unexplained, uncut.  &gt;It didn’t mean nothing, but it meant everything."
"They missed KD for one close game that we lost. Our 2019 team was way worse, mainly due to chris Paul and losing trevor ariza. Stats, seeding, eye test, literally everything back this up"
"Theres a lot of no brainer ones, so just to be different I’ll say one no one else will   Trevor Ariza.   Made over $100 million dollars in his career. He has almost always been regarded as a high tier role player in the league and that’s why he’s traded so much. Any team in the league could use him. Terrific locker room presence and seems to be friends with a lot of high profile guys in the league   Obviously won a ring on the Lakers as a nice bench piece for them. Defended KD almost exclusively 1 on 1 in our 2018 series where he held KD to 3 poor games in a row (he shot 38, 36, 35% from the floor, respectively on mostly just isolation shots). Which was huge as we almost won that series and most likely his second ring after that   And despite him being old, he still is managing to get paid every season where some bad team pays him, and a playoff team trades for him.   Probably will get a buyout soon and go play for the Nets where he’ll be an important piece as they try to win a ring.   No idea how I wrote this much about Ariza. Goodnight"
Trevor Ariza
[Live look at Trevor Ariza](https://youtu.be/reAcdKO7kMg)
Trevor Ariza
In 14/15 Trevor ariza was the 2nd leading scorer at 12.8 ppg and that team won 56 games. Theres only a few guys in the league that can carry garbage rosters...its not a knock on ad
"Because he’s a 6’4 20 year old with a 7’1 wingspan who can shoot, dribble, pass, and defend. Oh and also because Kuzma was paid 13 million...  I mean shit if Taj Gibson, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Portis, Thaddeus Young, Maxi Kleber, Aminu, Corey Joesph, etc got paid 9-10+ million then THT definitely will..."
Trevor Ariza isn’t a difference maker the fuck are you on
Yeah that and you have to hope Shamet picks it up so someone talks themselves into him. Package them both whatever 2nds you can see what it gets you. Trevor Ariza is probably the hope for the buyout market
I can't believe Trevor Ariza was basically free
Harden Pablo Prigioni Trevor Ariza Kostas Papanikolau Donatas Motiejunas
They wouldn’t have.  In fact the season after they beat that same team minus Trevor Ariza without KD.
"&gt;the 2015 rockets were a bit better then some of the teams kobe/jordan/kareem whatever had to deal with  &gt;2 30% three point shooters on minimum contracts, Trevor ariza, and g league centers anchoring the defense  Are you sure? The way you're describing the 2015 Rockets sure sounds like its on par with the teams Kobe dealt with in the mid 2000s. It's almost like the Rockets had a better roster than the Warriors have now! Crazy, right?"
"Lol obviously the 2015 rockets were a bit better then some of the teams kobe/jordan/kareem whatever had to deal with, your point still doesn’t add up. You keep trying to push the narrative that 2 30% three point shooters on minimum contracts, Trevor ariza, and g league centers anchoring the defense is a good cast and it’s laughable every time"
Trevor “ No Funny Business “ Ariza
"Trevor ""10 different teams is not a lot"" Ariza"
"Mr. Trevor ""Kick my ass on MY terms"" Ariza"
"You keep using the word scorer, and your examples had Clint Capela who at that point only scored off of lobs, Ryan Anderson who primarily scored off of standing outside the 3 and getting wide open looks. Their face value statistics looked good because MDA ran a high pace offense that inflated everyone’s numbers.   No one needs your terrible basketball IQ, you don’t have basic knowledge of what made that team work and how it happened. Somehow you think that Houston team was a offensive capable team individually. Harden made them that good, what has Ryan Anderson done since Houston? What has Trevor Ariza done since Houston??   They were only good because Harden made them. Oh and btw thank you for acknowledging that Harden was the engine of a team made up of at best 3  high level role players that still somehow won 55 games."
Fuck Trevor Ariza
"I thought you just said they are all so offensively capable. I’m sure they could find a system for the 9-10 minutes Harden would sit???   Known offensive superstars Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela, and Trevor Ariza."
"You really tried to call me out and exposed you didn’t watch the games yourself. Nice job /u/FlowersForAdri   Capela was emerging but he also missed 17 games.  Nene was a bench player lmao, and Trevor Ariza was his 3rd.   It’s funny you brought up watching the games because you deadass went to bball-ref and brought these takes. Lou Williams got traded to that team so make it 4, Capela missed 17 games so he wasn’t a consistent option, and Ryan Anderson while great didn’t have the impact Trevor had.   So nice job, you outed your own self trying to call me and /u/lakersbacktoback out."
trevor ariza sucks lol
it is a huge difference tho my guy. theres a world of difference between guys like jj redick and trevor ariza offensively. theres a reason numerous teams were shelling out big money for him even when they know he was a big negative on defense. theres a reason philly's and nolas offense had a tendency to struggle without him  having guys who are elite players off the ball is huge for offenses. they open things for the rest of the offense that simple spot up shooters cant
"2016 Houston Rockets, second best scoring option was Dwight Howard putting up 14 a game (lol). Third option was Trevor Ariza (lol).  Harden put up 29-7-6 with 1.7 steals"
I'd like to think guys like Jae Crowder and Trevor Ariza have a WhatsApp group where they trade rooms and rental contacts whenever they move.
It's a myth. Else Trevor Ariza would be front runner for MVP now
"&gt;Harden  The Rockets in 2015-16 were pretty bad (Dwight had started to decline). Trevor Ariza as his 2nd best player along with Dwight. Pat Bev as third best player?   Even last year, the Rockets beat the Thunder with Harden having a pretty terrible supporting cast. Eric Gordon and Robert Covington were probably the next 2 best players (and see how terrible they look without Harden). I mean the team fell apart without Danuel House. Westbrook was an absolute disaster in the playoffs.   Harden because of his style can minimize the negative impact of the supporting cast better than Steph can.   Apart from 2017-18 Harden never had a great supporting cast (CP3 had a weird decline in 2018-19)."
"Guys like dame, Steph, and Giannis would buy a house. Unlike players like Jae crowder or Trevor ariza."
"Ingram definitely made a huge stride but also check out Kyle Lowry, Trevor Ariza and Kawhis single shooting jumps. Their shooting and efficiency improvements from one season to the next I’d argue are a bit better."
Is it wrong that every time I see Trevor Ariza play I hope someone nutmegs him?
"Not a warriors fan, but I think Klay is the piece that will create the domino effect of ""washed"" veterans joining contenders.  Guys like Iguodala, Trevor Ariza, Serge Ibaka may want to join a Warriors squad who, when healthy, have a good core. Saw it with the Lakers (Dwight, Rondo), the Nets (Aldridge, Griffin) most recently, but there are veteran ring chasers who just want to play on a team that they see as contenders."
"Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley weren't guys that the defense was OK with leaving wide open from three"
"Carrying the Rockets to 56 wins with half a season of Beverley, half a season of Dight, and Trevor Ariza"
So Trevor Ariza.
"Not really, you’re just unable to apply context and are hellbent on painting harden as bad because you don’t like him. You literally tried to use PJ Tucker and Trevor ariza as examples of help when he routinely lost to teams of curry, Durant, klay, and dray. Yeah fucking right. And then you used westbrook as if he didn’t put up 17 and 4 on 40% TS while being left open against the lakers while harden had to battle lebron and fucking AD lmao. But yeah he had PJ tucker  right? Plenty of help my ass lmao  Every team complains about fouls, not sure if you’ve ever watched a game in your life lol. He has won an MVP and deserved more, it doesn’t matter what you think about him that won’t change it"
Just came to say:   Fuck Trevor Ariza
Ohh that makes sense. It's the Trevor ariza curse. How spooky.
"Our culture so good all ex blazers are sleepers!   Remember when noted defensive specialist Trevor Ariza decided to hit Dame on the elbow right in the middle of a 3 point attempt, thereby allowing him to win the game at the free throw line?"
Pretty sure that's the game trevor ariza slapped us around
"Do the Trevor Ariza. Get big contract from young team, sandbag  and get bought out, sign for a contender in time to get your value up again and repeat."
Trevor Ariza only likes cashing checks at this point in his career and that’s been the case for a pretty long time now
So Hali &gt; Trevor Ariza?
"if yall did that, youd only open cap space for... trevor ariza maybe lmao, or feed a max to some mid tier player. This is honestly why I do root for the smaller market players."
&gt; My favorite part of Trevor Ariza is reading the amount of teams he's played for on Basketball Reference  His wiki page is all over the place.
Imagine if it was Trevor Ariza. He probably would have decked Trae 😂
I feel like Trevor Ariza only exists to get traded at the deadline for picks to someone trying to make a run
They should name a NBA Journeyman award after Trevor Ariza
The real news is Trevor Ariza is still in the league
Heat interested in player  OKC wants draft pick  Trevor Ariza being traded  &amp;#x200B;  Name more iconic trio
"Death, Taxes, and Trevor Ariza getting traded to a team he hasn't played for. Bet your life we're trading him back to Houston for PJ Tucker too"
My favorite part of Trevor Ariza is reading the amount of teams he's played for on Basketball Reference
Trevor ariza can still hoop for sure  Solid defense and 38% + 3pt shooter
Who was better for okc Trevor Ariza or Kyle Singler
The real news here is Trevor Ariza was on OKC
"Lol that’s a load of bullshit, harden made the WCF and was 2nd in the west in 2015 with Trevor ariza, Terrence jones Josh smith, Corey Brewer, patrick beverley, tarik black, Joey dorsey, Jason Terry, 41 games of washed howard, taking up all the minutes lmao  He’s a great fit with green, harden and green screen and roll would be lethal. What a dumb comment"
The 2013-14 Clippers could've won the championship if they had a legitimately good 3&amp;D wing like Danny Green or Trevor Ariza.
"Its insane to think that Harden's 29/6/6 is underperforming especially when he was the only threat as a ball-handler and primary scorer for 2 of the 7 games. His efficiency was down but it was a 7 game series, no one shoots their normal splits.   They lost game 7 by 9 points. Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza went 2/21 from three. Harden missed too but saying the supporting cast overperformed while he choked is disingenuous. They win that series and the chip if *anyone* played to their normal standards. So forgive me if I don't call Harden a choker for just barely coming up short."
He was literally posting better numbers in 2017 with Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza as his best teammates.
"&gt;I got downvoted into oblivion for saying that having better teammates elevates one’s own stats.  What a silly comment.  Harden averaged 11 assists with a lineup of Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela, Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon off the bench."
They can’t win without Rockets legend Trevor Ariza
Lol Trevor Ariza has been doing this for months! These guys are just bandwagoners! Hahahaha
Trevor Ariza and Chandler Parsons get me for some reason
For me it's Terry Ariza and Trevor Rozier.  They look nothing alike but for some reason they merge in my memory.
You would be even more surprised that Trevor Ariza is on our payroll this season.
Mitch didn’t get a lot of high draft picks during his Lakers tenure but he has a very good track record.  He’s a really good GM who’s getting a lot of bad rap because of how it ended in LA. Around 17 years as GM and signed/traded for these names but is mostly remembered for Deng and Mosgov contracts:  Karl Malone Gary Payton Andrew Bynum Trevor Ariza Pau Gasol Ron Artest Chris Paul Steve Nash Dwight Howard
He dropped like 30 that game despite the loss. Trevor Ariza went 0/12.
Trevor “Luke Ridnour” Ariza
&gt;	Lol what? Is passing to PJ Tucker and Trevor ariza suppose to easier then passing to thompson and durant/curry?  Morey designed the offense to be that way. And the warriors don’t even use spacing the way that Houston did.   Luka had arguably the best spacing in league history last year. Now Harden in Brooklyn is close
Lol what? Is passing to PJ Tucker and Trevor ariza suppose to easier then passing to thompson and durant/curry?
Trevor Ariza was such a good defender also. loved watching him play.
"It doesn't help that Simmons is worthless outside of transition, either. Trevor Ariza was able to take like two steps to double team and strip him on one play lmfao."
"Trevor Ariza is the curmudgeon of the NBA. Dude starts shit when he gets nutmegged, doesn't give effort when he's on bad teams and probably yells at kids to stop skating on the sidewalk during the off-season.   And he's getting baited by arguably the best instigator in the league. It's like a bull versus a matador drenched in red paint."
Trevor Ariza is playing great in this game so far. His stats have been impressive lately too.
Nah we also got a capable defender in Trevor Ariza and size/rebounding in Dewayne Dedmon. We good
"None of those guys are shooting as well, they have significantly fewer attempts. Not to mention that they’re significantly worse defensive players that probably would be unplayable in a playoff series so its actually super important for your starting SF to be able to knock down 3s at an efficient clip but hey maybe thats just me. Shooting 38% on 5.2 attempts is efficiency among the likes of PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Royce O’neal etc.   “but at the same it would help if he got better at it” did you read my comment?"
I feel like the Rockets got bamboozled twice with contract year Trevor Ariza.
Trevor Ariza on the Heat also. I thought  he was washed.
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."
"Ya the lakers 08-10  Traded for kobes draft right, traded shaq for Lamar odom, traded Kwame and marc gasol for pau gasol, traded brian cook for Trevor ariza drafted Derek fisher"
How was Trevor Ariza a free agent? The Heat seemingly always pick up great vets midseason and revive their careers
"Think they meant in terms of a young guy who gets it, and will he a solid role player. Not the same skill set obviously, everyone does it different.   Think Lou Williams, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Shane Battier kinda guy."
Trevor ariza
Trevor Ariza
Fuck Trevor Ariza
"No I think Jerami is better offensively than Horry was, and Horry was miles better than Jerami at defense. I’m on my phone but Horry averaged like 6 FA/game playing less than 30min a game whereas Grant has not been a defensive standout but is showing he can be relied on as a volume scorer taking 17 attempts/game this year. Bob never ever had that capability, as his strength was being a defensive anchor. You can’t build a team around that. It’s like building around Trevor Ariza as someone said below, or Joe Ingles. It’s a fair question!"
"Surprised Trevor Ariza hasn't been mentioned, he is the quintessential 3 and D player"
"I think your missing a bunch of players and you're criteria is off a bit. Its usually 3&amp;D wings that people are after - guard defence is much less important than wing defence. I definitely would not have pat connaughton, lonzo ball or fred van vleet, or ddv on this list unless you'd be happy sticking one of them on paul george for a qtr (i would not). You missed Miles Bridges who I think is useful, also Trevor Ariza. Porzingis and JJJ would also be included in your criteria, but again they are centers so i wouldnt put them in."
"I think you missed probably quite a few (probably because used the eye test). Trevor Ariza and Royce O'Neal both fit all the above criteria, both of which are omitted."
Trevor Ariza just barely missed on the 3pt % but he's been incredible on defense this year
"I get it, thats the point of bird rights for any team that wants to develop talent. That was the point of using shumpert or so we thought when we gave up a 1st round for him. The idea that in nba economics its the only way, along with MLE, TPE to add talent to a capped out team.  We ignored all of those options.  Have you cited that last front office ghost contract?  ""Trevor Ariza tells @SportsRadio610 that he expected to remain with the Rockets last summer, but that changed when Rockets GM Daryl Morey told him ""that we don't think it's gonna happen"" at the beginning of the free agency process""  ""More from Ariza: ""I believe my efforts deserved a shot (to return), but it is what it is. I'm not complaining about anything.  When asked if Daryl Morey gave him a reason why the Rockets weren't bringing him back Ariza said ""He doesn't need a reason, it just didn't happen""  From the writing, both Paul/Harden and Ariza were all interested in running it back with better health.   Morey has spoken at his own conference candidly about what you mentioned that when you are at the cap, you have to get creative including with contracts just to get assets.  But for some reason once tillman became the owner he ignored all the very assets he spoke about and worked to get along with the TPE, the picks, the bird rights.       As I mentioned, if you look at actual incentive. None of the moves gave our manager any cap flexiblity or future flexiblity, none of the moves benefits HArden,coach, or our city. The type of savings we had and assets we lost only went to the pockets of the owner.  Morey has his faults, no doubt about it. But all the signs above and the moves and change in how we go about things changed with tillman. Theres a reason Morey tried to cet cp3, harden, Tad brown and harden cited morey and each other as people they trusted and were apart of they left.  I've had a hard time understanding how people try to spread the blame when there are actual quotes about tilman's interference and lies.    I'm not ""anti-tillman"" despite me providing simple evidence of him being the reason the rockets went from a contender with at least a generational talent who wanted to stay to the laughing stock of the league, I hope he does well. Hell I wish he did well the first time around. Last person anyone on here wants to discuss is the owner. But his mandate is the reason in 3 short years his best case scenerio is an argument at the bottom of the barrel between him, Sarver, and Donald STerling as the worst owners. He has similar personality and meddling flaws as the infamous Dolan, but he at least will spend. Owners aren't required to do much else, let alone plaster himself all over toyota center.  ITs an embarassment for houston when instead he should've made his splash and not worried about oen year of an ariza payment, a premium just to run it back, then he can save after or as he is now. rebuild and punt and get his finances in order for whenever the next run is.  Suns just got back in the playoffs after 11  years and nyc is finally finding relevancy after years of being an embarssment. Terrible ownership direction can ruin it for the fans."
"PJ Tucker and Trevor ariza were about the most mediocre shooters in the league lol, the spacing they had that year was nothing special. They were both just godly in isolation/PNR"
Trevor Ariza &amp; Ryno
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
Wizards fan - hire a new coach ASAP . In the draft identify whoever the best 3&amp;D SG/SF is in our draft position &amp; pick that dude. And add another MLE veteran wing in the offseason (guys like Garrett Temple or Trevor Ariza). Maybe see how the season starts and package Thomas Bryant + some stuff at the trade deadline for another guard or wing who shoots threes
Shout-out to Trevor ariza for taking away shots from James harden during that stretch including the final shot
"Crowder has no hands imo, that Trevor Ariza stance tho, if someone knows and can link"
And Trevor Ariza
The “switchblade” nickname on bbref for Trevor Ariza is so confusing. Nobody calls him that and im pretty sure Ariza himself was like “tf is that” in an interview.
Pulling a Trevor Ariza
"I am not a Hawks fan but I really believe in Cam Reddish. He will put it together and be an great role player as his floor. Some of his best moments are show how insane his natural skill level is and he is super long, super tall. I think he has grown in height and strength a lot since draft combine. He looks massive compared to other wings to me. Floor of Trevor Ariza, ceiling of someone like current Jaylen Brown as an absolute reach if everything comes together for him."

"How the fuck was it a shooting fluke that kept us up with the warriors in 2018 lol? What are you even saying? Harden missed 22 straight threes at one point and we still won, shooting fluke? You mean for them right? Jesus Christ you guys make up something new everyday lol, so far from true  Obviously KD “can’t be stopped” is an exaggeration, he’s been slowed down, but he’s much harder to slow down then Steph and anyone would agree.  And smh, using iggy as an argument lmao. I suppose you’re going to ignore LRMAM also being injured and then pretend he’s a total bum compared to iggy as if they weren’t equally as impactful lmao. Having our best wing defender is “impactful” too, especially when Trevor ariza has to play the entire game and goes 0-12 from the field in game 7 decided by single digits. But yeah, “shooting fluke”, right?  We were up 3-2 with our guys, we absolutely were on there level and should have won. Stop trying to make shit up."
"Ok, 05 he was hurt so I don't blame him, 06 they were 20 seconds away from beating the suns, I feel Marion always gets forgotten about. The suns were still drastically better. The lakers in 08 were a top 3 seed in the west before they even got gasol.   And I'm sorry but Derek fisher, Luke Walton, pau gasol and Vladimir radmoniovic was not a stacked team in 08.   Bynum missed most the season and lamar odom was good as always just inconsistent.   09 The lakers had almost the same roster except with Trevor Ariza and again no bynum.   2010 we replaced Ariza with an older Metta, fisher was voted worst starting pg the 3rd year in a row and Odom took a small step back with Bynum missing a big chunk of the season.    We had a good team but they weren't loaded."
Lol wizards really traded him for trevor ariza.
Two of the games came down to last second steals by Trevor Ariza
"Why is Michael Jordan considered ""GOAT"" to people/media after playing 1,072 career games but Trevor Ariza isn't going to make the Hall of Fame after playing 1,081 career games?"
"Pat bev, Dwight howard, Clint Capela, montrezl Harrell, Trevor ariza, and Micheal Beasley all of these players are solid and better than almost any respective player on the warriors roster"
"I saw that coming from a mile away. Another one was an offensive rebound that Precious grabbed, got heavily contested, while Trevor Ariza cut wide open along the baseline for a dump off... Precious really is lacking in Bball IQ and passing vision. At this point in his career he's all hustle, and needs a proper offseason and G-League stint."
"Harden's 60 pt triple double without Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul and only 10 minutes of Eric Gordon   Or his 61 pts in 31 minutes against the Hawks"
“Fuck Trevor Ariza”. “I agree man fuck that dude”
Fuck Trevor Ariza
"I disagree I think Miami’s team is better this year, Jae crowder is surely missed but Trevor Ariza, dedmon, and bjelica are improvements. Our current record isn’t a great example of our potential but we’ve been trash as of late, with some “interesting” lineups"
TIL Trevor Ariza still plays. He was a very solid 3 and D player for LA like a decade ago.
Trevor Ariza is a starter for the Miami Heat. What year is this?
Trevor Ariza and Robert Horry
Why? Are they going to fine us for every game Trevor Ariza missed the first half of the season? Horford is an inactive player and won’t play another minute for OKC.
I thought you’re a Trevor Ariza Fan.
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
"So were Trevor Ariza (2nd round in 2004), Channing Frye (didn't entirely pan out for the Knicks, but other than Bynum picks 9-16 in that draft turned out to be terrible), and Renaldo Balkman (pretty good value at #20).  His only bad pick was Mardy Collins at 29. If 29 is what you're missing on, you're fine."
Ariza is despised by Suns fans. Can I get a FUCK TREVOR ARIZA?
Fuck Trevor Ariza
Who’s hating on trevor ariza?
Trevor Ariza
"David Lee, Trevor Ariza and Wilson Chandler were all solid draft selections."
"My thought is that, if this same shot was made by someone like delon wright, trevor ariza, lonzo ball, etc. We'd be impressed but we wouldn't associate the shot itself with  GOAT shots such as the trevor booker's backwards love tap w/ the Jazz. But because it's doncic, who is synonymoud with NBA david copperfield, we give him that extra association bonus.  And that's ok 😎😎😎"
"&gt; Kyle Lowry and Trevor Ariza are both 35  Which one did you think was a different age?    &gt; ALSO MALCOLM BROGDON IS OLDER THAN AD WTF  WTF indeed! Damn, I had to check that one to be sure lol"
"There are people that KD respects as at least making it hard for him.  People like Tony Allen or Trevor Ariza back in the day.  However, it's worth noting that ""being good at guarding KD"" isn't the only defensive skill that matters."
Trevor Ariza can suck my balls
What are your thoughts on Trevor Ariza though
Trevor Ariza is the nastiest skank bitch I've ever met. Do not trust him. He is a fugly slut
I wonder how an Ish Smith/Wayne Ellington/Trevor Ariza/Thaddeus Young/Jeff Green team would do
"Death, taxes and Trevor Ariza being on an NBA team"
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
IIRC Trevor Ariza also tended to do well in those Rockets/Warriors series. I think the most important piece to guarding him is insane length
That's what happens when you sign a washed Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson to be your starting SF and PF.
"People dont like trae young, get over it. Ill take 4 downvotes as sign that you don't know what you are talking about when you say ""no reasonable person would agree with"". Ask any basketball fan in NYC how they feel about trae. Youll be met with lots of the right reason. Ask Trevor Ariza why he shoved trae"
"&gt;Not a ridiculous argument at all lmfao they had shaun livingston who was still excellent back then, ridiculous argument by you  Livingston can't shoot, which means the Warriors refrained from using him in their small lineups.  &gt;Looney still was going to get minutes regardless, he got minutes the next season in the series too. Not sure why you think iggy is on the floor at all times  Sure, but he played a lot more than he would have if Iguodala was healthy. And lol, I'm pointing out that when you have a guy who normally plays around 30 minutes, those minutes are going somewhere when he is out. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they went to Bell and Looney (who isn't bad, but was overmatched against Houston).   &gt;You’re really using that as an excuse? The warriors had looney in the paint, we had capella in the paint with Draymond playing free safety. The same shit applies. You make no sense  The issue is the Warriors would normally play small for very long stretches of the game, which they couldn't do with Iguodala out. How do you not get this?   &gt;That’s on them for abandoning there strategy, they had livingston so they still could have done it.  No, because the spacing doesn't work there. Livingston can't shoot.   &gt;You’re really overrating iguadolas defense, harden put up 35 on 60% TS the next series with iguadola playing every game, we just ended up losing because we were worse that season  That was a year later lol. Harden didn't shoot well with Iguodala guarding him in 2018, and neither did CP3. Are you really contesting that Iguodala is a huge upgrade over Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney??  &gt; “A bit of defense” lmao just admit you didn’t watch a second of lrmam play. He was easily our best defender or second behind tucker.  Yes ""a bit of defense"". Tucker and Ariza were both excellent, and Gordon was serviceable. Replacing LRMAM's minutes with those guys isn't some big downgrade.   &gt;I’m not arguing we were better or even more talented, I’m arguing that we deserved to win that series and you’re not going to say we didn’t because they were missing a 5 PPG old man compared to an allstar and a role player.  You didn't deserve to win the series first of all. Injuries are part of the game. The team that ""deserves"" to win is the team that actually went out there and got it done. Secondly, the injury to Iguodala was simply more impactful compared to LRMAM. There is simply no way you can argue that the downgrade from Iguodala to Looney and Bell (especially on defense) is the same as the downgrade from LRMAM to PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, and Eric Gordon. Combine that with the Warriors being unable to play small, which was by far their best lineup for years, and the downgrade is simply much larger. Houston was going home regardless of health. I'm sure you won't agree, so let's just agree to disagree. We'll never know who would have won for sure. You have your opinions, and I have mine."
"Which Rockets team are you talking about specifically?  The 2016-17 team was basically comprised of Harden-Pat Beverley-Trevor Ariza-Ryan Anderson-Clint Capela-Eric Gordon as its main rotation.   I don’t think a lineup of KD-Joe Harris-Bruce Brown-Blake Griffin-Nick Claxton any less talented.  Citing their PPG during a season in which they played with three guys that averaged 25+ doesn’t make much sense because of course their scoring burden was lessened. I’m talking talent and tools.  Claxton is in his second season to Clint’s third at the time, Joe Harris is the best shooter on either team, Blake’s passing out of the short role would have been huge for that Rockets team (as would Jeff Green’s ability to attack the rim or dish to shooters)."
Jae was replaced by nobody.  Trading Meyers for Trevor Ariza was just an attempt at fixing that mistake.
Miami Heat in shambles   Dude couldn't be replaced with Trevor Ariza
Specifically 17-18. Because that one also has Trevor Ariza.
"He was traded to OKC (+ a second) for Trevor Ariza. The Thunder told him not to bother showing up, then waived him. Considering he's a bad player who let Reggie Evans put 22 points and 26 rebounds on his head, I think his last NBA game is behind us"
"He had to change his jump shot because his natural release took to long.      He cited a play from his rookie season in an interview where he mentioned that Trevor Ariza was in position to take a charge while Favors was rolling to the rim, the ball got passed to Ingles and his release was too slow that Ariza got back to block his shot. After that he had to change for a speedy shot."
Trevor Ariza
"He said he wasn't a floor raiser when his teammates were a rookie DA, rookie Bridges, Tyson Chandler, Trevor Ariza, and his starting PG was Isaiah Canaan. Even Michael Jordan wouldn't raise that team to shit.  At the time he made the video Booker was averaging 27/4/7 on above average efficiency. It was a terrible take at the time. But in coherence with the rest of the popular ""empty stats"" takes then"
"After the 2018-2019 season when Booker averaged 27/4/7 on above average efficiency. With his teammates being a rookie DA, rookie Bridges, Isaiah Canaan, Tyson Chandler, and Trevor Ariza. It was a dumb ass take then and it looks even worse now. Booker was as good as he is now back then."
"I think the Suns are very similar to the 2018 Rockets, but with much better ball movement and generally better across the board _____ Chris Paul is Chris Paul _____ Devin Booker is James Harden. They have a different play style and Harden is obviously a lot better, but they are the bucket getters _____ Mikal Bridges is a better version of Trevor Ariza ______ Jae Crowder is better than PJ Tucker _____ Ayton is about equal to Capela"
"This is a man who turned Jarrett Culver into Dario and Cam Johnson, found Cam Payne off the scrap heap, maybe probably the best mid level exception signing in Jae Crowder, the corpse of Trevor Ariza into Kelly Oubre, and upgraded Tyler Johnson to Ricky Rubio and then Ricky Rubio to Chris Paul. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he did his best with TJ Warren. The revisionist history around him has hit as he was coming off a season where he missed the majority of it with a head injury."
Crowder is what we thought Ariza would be. Fuck Trevor ariza
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
We literally had 36-year old Trevor Ariza and 37-year old Andre Iguodala playing major minutes in the playoffs this year.  I'll gladly take Bron as a fossil.
Trevor ariza? That's some overdue bias from his rockets days lol
"More that it was Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Mbah Moute, then Danuel House, etc..  Rockets were loaded with great defenders"
Kawhi looked like mj vs the skittish defensive team in the playoffs  Now he looks like Trevor ariza
Khris Middleton over Trevor Ariza
Legend has it if Curry never existed Kd would be a 6'11 Trevor Ariza
"Ah yes, bonafide superstar Trevor Ariza playing next to harden. Seriously? Harden dragged teams much worse than this Bucks roster to the playoffs and he had almost no offensive help around him in Houston until the CP3 trade. The NBA didn’t start in 2018 lol"
"I know you guys are mad about the series loss, but c'mon, there's no need to slander Bridges like that.  Also, fuck Trevor Ariza for all eternity."
I wouldn't be so sure Curry's gravity is so good it works from 500 miles away. If Curry went to Asia KD would revert to Trevor Ariza
"haha yeah man! if harden gave up the ball and ran around screens more we would have totally seen eric gordon, trevor ariza, and ryan anderson blossom into all-stars 😍 it’s his fault they never developed 😤"
Hahaha so true. Right now it’s either or. Trevor Ariza right now would be close to a max player.
"Not really. Luka's style is similar to Lebron's. Trae's style is similar to Curry's. I don't see what the gap between Lebron-Steph and Luka-Curry has anything to do with this analogy.     If Trae goes the James Harden route later down the road, this is all a moot point. At that point, I'd have to revise the post to see if you'd trade Lebron for James Harden and prime Trevor Ariza."
"No no secondary stars can’t step up, they can only underperform. And role players can’t underperform (relatively speaking *cough* Trevor Ariza Game 7 2018 *cough*), they can only step up"
"then just look at us last year then. We were still 3rd on offense. We had Dame, who missed a handful of games himself, CJ (who's inconsistent and inefficient), and ... that's it. Rodney Hood was elite for the first 20 games, then he tore his Achilles. Trevor Ariza was okay for the 15ish games he had him for. Melo was extremely inconsistent and inefficient. GTJ only popped off the last month or so. Whiteside can't shoot. Simons, Bazemore, Hezonja, and Tolliver were all hot garbage. the roster around Dame and CJ last year wasn't significantly better than the roster around Steph/Wiggins this year. You could even argue it was worse"
Hate to break it to you but lakers are realistically more likely to go trevor ariza hunting than beal and dame hunting
"There's still time to develop Herro and Robinson. I think THT is just gonna be a role player, a Trevor Ariza type of player."
A team consisting of Trevor ariza clones
"2004 Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala, Trevor Ariza still here."
"&gt; Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.  Why would most of these guys leave the teams they are currently on, especially those getting playing time, to be on a bad team?   In what world would Serge Ibaka for example, rather play with Westbrok and a Beal that barely squeak into the playoffs as opposed to PG and Kawhi that , while still potentially leaving in the first round, are a far better team?  &gt; I just want the Wizards to learn from Presti and just cut everyone shorter than Westbrook with shorter wingspan.   One of Presti's biggest downfalls is that he did a dogshit job of building around Westbrook's weaknesses.  It took Morey literally 3 months to figure out that you can't have a guy like Andre Roberson share the floor with a non-shooter like Russ, but here we are talking about how there can't be anybody shorter than Russ on the floor, which doesn't make any sense.  There's a lot of room between ""hey don't play 4 guards"" and ""hey don't play anyone shorter than Westbrook.""    Westbrook needs a very specific type of big to really space out the floor and frankly there aren't many of those in the league.  He needs (ideally) a guy that can play the traditional style of big *and* a guy that can go out on the perimeter and spread the floor for Russ to drive to the rim.  There aren't a ton of guys like that and they are usually fairly expensive."
" &gt;Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry.  Ya pre cp3. A lot of those guys weren't there at that time lol. And Lou for one season... pi tucker didn't become a decent shooter till much later."
"&gt;Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.    I thought i had a stroke for a second.  How on earth does that help ANYTHING."
"Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry."
Trevor Ariza 2.0
"I mean getting someone like Lowry in Free Agency, a Jae Crowder-type of guy (or even just a healthy Trevor Ariza), and a big like Marc Gasol or Dwight Howard has not and will not be impossible to get."
Kuzma is a poor mans Trevor Ariza
He also was getting inconsistent minutes for whatever reason. Trevor fucking Ariza played about the same minutes as Herro did. That’s terrible coaching when Herro is a guy who needs 25-30 minutes minimum to be able to have a chance to catch fire multiple times
Matt Barnes and Trevor Ariza. They weren’t shooters but worked hard to become decent 3 &amp; D guys
"I think the bubble fraud thing is a little bit warranted (I think more of it is Herro coming back to earth after a good series and a half against Boston and LA) but also the difference between Bledsoe and Holiday, and then subsequently going from Jae Crowder to geriatric Trevor Ariza are each pretty fucking big."
"Which surprised no Heat fan to be honest. Did you see our rotations and starting line up most of the season?  Also Spo is an amazing coach…but constantly going with a starting front court of a scrawny 6’8” Trevor ariza and 6’9” Bam vs 6’11” Giannis and 7’1” Brook Lopez was weird considering we at least had 2 (not great but serviceable) big men in Dedmon and bjelica  But if you thought we were making any noice with our current roster and situation, you’re tripping."
"Crowder played the most minutes behind the Dragic-Bam-Butler trio. Considering his replacement was this washed Trevor Ariza and that Crowder shot 43% from 3 that series, the drop off was heavily significant. That's without getting into the fact that the Bucks got massively better."
"Yeah, replace Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Junior, and Kelly Olynyk with just 35 year old Trevor Ariza. That’s a significant roster downgrade. Especially when the other team did the exact opposite, signed 3 key players Holiday, Tucker, Portis. A significant roster upgrade."
Spo is an absolute moron starting a 35 year old washed up Trevor Ariza. Two games in a row with 0 points or impact on the game. He hasn’t been a good defender since 2018 I don’t really think there’s any excuse for starting him next to Bam especially when their issue is effort on the boards
Jimmy heard y'all talking shit... and asked Trevor Ariza to stop the mean  people from bullying him
Maybe Trevor Ariza can save the Bubble Boys
trevor ariza maybe?
Now your giving mins to a 35 yr old Trevor Ariza and none of those players you kept are contributing   Proven Generational Talent &gt;&gt;&gt; fan favourites
"Ya know what hurts?  Crowder shooting like 8% from 3pt this series is still an upgrade over trevor ""0 pts in the playoffs"" ariza"
Trevor Ariza became instantly washed as soon as the playoffs started
You mean Sacramento Kings legends Trevor Ariza and Dwayne Dedmon aren't good? 😂
Trevor Ariza is sooo trash. Nothing to do with the OP but fucking hell
Trevor Ariza is so washed now
Trevor Ariza got no lift on that layup lol
"[Magic Johnson]: The Miami Heat need to play better! Specifically, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Coach Spo, Pat Riley, their fans"
Contract year Trevor Ariza is 🤌
*Trevor Ariza has entered the chat*
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
Just read an NHL article and was actually a bit stunned to read that McDavid is the highest paid player at $12.5M - less than NBA guys like Cory Joseph and Trevor Ariza.
Trevor ariza has been dreadful
The real tragedy of the Heat is that they replaced Jae Crowder with Trevor Ariza.
Yeah trevor ariza tried to start shit with Giannis and he just didn't give a fuck lol
"I remember one time when a rookie derozan stole the ball off him and Ariza swung an elbow at derozans head. Thankfully it missed, but I’ve never liked Trevor ariza after that incident."
I got told this wasn’t going to be a big factor. Instead Trevor Ariza is “guarding” Giannis and bricking jumpers.
"Trevor Ariza falling on top of Giannis and literally pressing his weight on Giannis chest, while Giannis' back is on the hardwood floor. #heatculture"
I agree with you but to be fair Trevor Ariza has been on every NBA team
"yeah trevor ariza is problematic cause you can't put him on lopez if you want to put bam on giannis. So he has to guard giannis, which he's just too light for"
Obligatory fuuuuuuck Trevor Ariza.
FUCK TREVOR ARIZA
Trevor Ariza isn’t what he used to be. That’s a disrespectful move just from the standpoint of man to man.   We have bigger goals though no need to squabble over that
Trevor Ariza doing push-ups on Giannis what the hell is he thinking lol.
Did someone say fuck Trevor Ariza
All my homies hate trevor ariza
Trevor Ariza got spooked by his own homosexuality and got mad about it bc he thinks Giannis is cute and was looking into those Greek goggles of his 👁👄👁
Trevor Ariza is such a fucking bitch
Did Trevor Ariza just check the meat?
#Trevor Ariza is on a mission 😂
"How you gonna use the guys body to push yourself up? Fuck Trevor Ariza, as always."
Trevor Ariza can hold my nuts
"Bro fuck Trevor Ariza. Nothing more embarrassing than getting your ass kicked and then doing shit like that. Get him off the floor Spo, dudes trash"
Trevor Ariza is a punk ass bitch
Lmao fuck Trevor Ariza
Fuck Trevor Ariza
anyone would be a fraud if you replace 30 minutes of Jae Crowder with 30 minutes of thoroughly washed Trevor Ariza.
Playoff sharpshooter Trevor Ariza!
Spoelstra pregame: “Trevor Ariza is in our starting 5 and flopping is our only option”
Fuck Trevor Ariza
"&gt;Harden - 2017, game 7 loss to Warriors  2017 is fair but come on you can't blame him for losing a game 7 against the Warriors who had Steph, Klay and KD in their prime while Harden had Trevor Ariza, Capela, PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon in his starting line up lol."
People hate on Trae but I actually really enjoy watching him. I thought it was fucking hilarious when he tried to nutmeg Trevor Ariza. Savagery
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."

Jae crowder and Jeff green are wayyy better than george hill or Trevor ariza
"Mike james isiah cannon tyson chandler trevor ariza josh jackson elfrid payton eric bledsoe brandon knight dragen bender marqueese chris   If you think those guys are comparable to Porzingas, Seth Curry, Tim Hardway Jr then idk what to tell you.  When booker got a real team around him they became instantly better and probably make the playoffs is ayton doesnt get suspended"
"It was still a salary dump which could have been done for more assets.  The biggest sin was not getting rid of Brian Cardinal, who still had two seasons remaining on his deal. They should have had the foresight to demand they take Cardinal too and get back Trevor Ariza back.   The trade worked out, but I think owner Michael Heisley wasn't looking towards the future as much as saving money."
I mean it’s better than playing normal basketball and having to rely on pj Tucker/Trevor ariza/Danuel house to create their own shot
Trevor Ariza
The Wizards can only trade for Trevor Ariza so many times!
"This is a take from someone who clearly never watched a second of European basketball. Every league has their Harden. When your average player is Trevor Ariza, then James Harden has to be James Harden. When your average player is Landry Nnoko, then your James Harden can be Nando de Colo, if that makes sense. The difference is, de Colo has to defer to the team, and the team has to defer to Harden. Even though they are equally great scorers in their respective leagues. The only player in Europe atm, that can be considered extremely high usg% iso-star, is Shved."
"Trevor Ariza, he played for so many teams"
&gt; The warriors gentlemen swept the 8 seed rockets in 2016 without Steph so your argument just fell apart completely. They dominated Houston who had harden.  Yeah they went 3-1 without Steph in that series. Curry had 24 points on 81% TS in their first win. That was the worst iteration of the Rockets. They went 41-41 with Trevor Ariza as their 2nd leading scorer and lost to the Stephless Warriors despite Harden having an overall solid series.
Wait is this a serious question? You don’t get why I say James harden vs the 73-9 warriors instead of Steph? Because houston had a trash supporting cast for harden while the warriors were in the midst of blowing up as one of the strongest dynasties we’ve seen recently. Lol dude Trevor ariza? You want me to mention Trevor ariza? At least make it bum ass Dwight Howard. He at least was a big name back then despite being washed and a dinosaur in the league.  You’re just looking for reasons to whine and act like I’m being unreasonable your points are so dumb. I’m not a Steph hater stop crying.
&gt; The warriors took out James harden in the first round in 2016 without Steph lmao.  Notice how you refer to the Rockets as James Harden and refer to the Warriors as the 73-9 team. It's the same formula every time with the Steph haters. Why not refer to the Rockets as the 41-41 Rockets who had Trevor Ariza as their second leading scorer?
"&gt;No he \[Klay\] didn’t \[outplay Harden\] Not an ounce of help for harden  23.4 PPG on 45/44/86 splits and 2 turnovers/game + lockdown defense + winning the series in 5&gt;&gt;26.6 PPG on 41/31/84 splits and 5 turnovers per game.  &gt;My ass lmao. Harden was suppose to beat 4 allstars by himself without Cp3 lol?  Firstly, ""by himself"" is very disingenous here. Harden had 2 great defenders/good role players in PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza + Eric Gordon playing the best playoff series of his life and Clint Capela.  And I mean yeah you guys would have won if not for the massive B2B meltdowns in games 6 and 7. Ya'll were up 17 after the first quarter and up 10 at halftime of game 6 then ended up losing by 29. You were only down 7 going into the 4th quarter of game 6 then Harden had 0 points on 0/2 shooting with 2 turnovers in the 4th quarter, which you got outscored by 22 in.  Game 7 obviously was the 27 straight missed 3s with 10 by Harden game, which you also blew a double digit halftime lead in. And again, there's no way to say that having CP3 guarantees you would have won. Maybe you don't get off to such a fast start in either game if he plays."
"&gt;Why are you bringing up that Dirk played without all-stars? Josh Howard was an all-star  Not to demean Josh Howard but he was an ""all-star"". That one year he made it he averaged 19/7/2 and only got in because of injuries to Nash, AI, Yao and Boozer (and a few other guys like Pau Gasol, David West or CP3). That's why Mehmet Okur made his sole all-star appearance that year as well.  Josh Howard was a solid defensive specialist that could also score a guy like Jae Crowder or Trevor Ariza today but arguing he was an all-star teammate because he made it that one year due to a lot of injuries is a stretch imo."
"No Jae crowder this year. Giving old ass Trevor Ariza, Djelica, and Dwayne Dedmon huge minutes."
&gt; Draft picks are the only thing tossed around more than ~~Trevor Ariza and Robert Covington~~   your mom*
Draft picks are the only thing tossed around more than Trevor Ariza and Robert Covington
"Wouldn’t Jae Crowder also be the definition of such a player? I just don’t think that Connaughton is on as high a level of vintage PJ Tucker, but then again, he’s kind of building out the best part of his resume right now, so I admit I could very well be wrong. My own team has the  corpse of Trevor Ariza, who in his own day was a starter level 3 and D guy, so I catch your point.  I guess I never thought of Pat as a 3 and D wing as he is a little smaller than a prototypical wing, but I think that kind of categorization highlights his value."
That team was basically a super team. Bynum pau artest kobe fisher starting line up. Lamar odom 6th man and other good bench players like trevor ariza. That team was loaded af.
Few more:  Eric Gordon/Cam Payne   Trevor Ariza/Torrey Craig  Gerald Green/Cam Johnson (kinda)  Ryan Anderson/Dario Saric
Mikal is the Trevor ariza in this comparison
"Again that is such a moot fucking point. Do you think the warriors didn’t give Harden all their defensive attention? Do you think the warriors were fucking sweating over Dwight Howard or Pat fucking Bev? Trevor Ariza??? Like holy shit man, blame every other series loss on him, but this one? That’s just fucking ridiculous. All you have said is “Klay outperformed him” ok??? Klay also had a 10x better team? It’s not fucking 1 on 1 out there."
"Yeah that’s true. I just remember after we played the Warriors in the 2015 WCF, the team regressed so much the next year. Ty Lawson was supposed to put us over the top, but he just flamed out. Harden got off to a slow start and didn’t make an All-NBA team. Dwight Howard regressed. And our key role players that played well the previous year just either regressed or fell off a cliff, like Corey Brewer, Josh Smith, Terrence Jones, Etc.  And in terms of the 2018-19 team being a disappointment. Losing guys like Mbah A Moute and Trevor Ariza Hurt us and then you have Carmelo being waived after like 10 games and CP3 being banged up and looking washed most of that year too"
He always had random head injuries he could never heal from. He was always a beast offensively but his off ball defense was so abysmal he'd give up just as much as he scored. Once we got rid of PJ Tucker we were in a tough pickle on replacing his wing defense production and tried to draft Josh Jackson and sign Trevor Ariza and trade for Kelly Oubre to plug that hole and nothing really worked until we gave Mikal Bridges the minutes he deserved.
"2018-2019, we won 19 games, book was injured for a lot of it, tj warren was injured for a lot of it, we still had trevor ariza on the team, we didn't have a plan for a point guard, the only bright spot was trading ariza for oubre and randomly winning 4 games in a row, and the emergence of Deandre Ayton's offense (when his defense was absolute dogshit)."
"That's true, I forgot that you guys got Ariza from OKC for him. Still, I'd like to think they had bigger plans than Trevor Ariza - but it worked out okay in the end."
"Yea. I miss Kelly. Was hoping he'd stick around to develop with us. A solid athlete. Not sure how his defensive stats stack up now, but always thought he could turn into a great defender if he wanted to. Could remind me of Trevor Ariza with his length."
"That article kind of says the opposite. It talks about how role players would generally jump at the chance to play with Lebron because they are used to being role players with limited offensive involvement, but All Stars/All-NBA guys wouldn’t because they don’t want to be marginalized.   Sorry for the length, but I pulled a few quotes from the article.   Tyson Chandler: *”If you’ve got LeBron, you’ve got to make it all about LeBron. You’ve got to be able to [coexist] with that and fit with that.”*  Kevin Durant: *”It depends on what kind of player you are. If you’re Kyle Korver, then it makes sense. Because Kyle Korver in Atlanta was the bulk of the offense, and he’s not a No. 1 option at all, not even close. So his talents benefit more from a guy who can pass and penetrate and get him open.”*  Trevor Ariza: *“Guys similar to [LeBron], why would they want to play with somebody who does all the same things? I can see why they would want to play elsewhere.”*  Rudy Gay: *“A lot of people are going back to thinking, ‘I can possibly be as good as him,’ and sometimes when people think of playing with someone like that, they feel it hinders them, maybe, from getting to that point because he takes up so much of [the] opportunities.”*  Durant again:*“LeBron is a player that needs to play with guys that already know how they play the game—and shooters. Like, young players that are still developing, it’s always going to be hard because he demands the ball so much, he demands control of the offense and he creates for everybody.”*  *“None of the players approached for this story, both stars and supporting cast types, resented that James’ stardom “sucks up all the oxygen in the room,” as one Eastern Conference vice president put it. But there is little doubt they would have to transform themselves and accept lesser roles than they enjoy now if they joined the Lakers.”*  *“What comes with that is the knowledge that if the team wins, it will be credited mostly to James; and if the team loses, it will be blamed on everyone around him.”*  *“Bosh and Love were established All-Stars before they hooked up with LeBron, but the perception of them shifted from franchise cornerstones to, at times, weak links in James’ quests for another ring…It earned them championships, but the perception remains they were the beneficiaries of being James’ teammates.”*"
James Harden  Trevor Ariza  Jae Crowder  DeAndre Jordan
Trevor Ariza being a starter hurts me
Old one but Lakers traded Brian Cook for Trevor Ariza who started in 08 and 09 finals and obviously went on to have a very good career.
"Nah he’s gonna pay, he wanted us to draft ayton and he literally forced them to draft Mikal, those are literally his guys, he’s gonna pay them. He also hasn’t been cheap in years now, he’s just spent the money on the wrong players like Tyson chandler/Trevor ariza/Brandon knight etc. he already paid Booker and both DA and Mikal are his guys who he wanted even making them do the trade for Mikal, he is absolutely gonna pay them. Guy has finally learned from his mistakes and even admitted it and said I’ve finally got it right, also said money won’t be a problem and he’s willing to pay and do whatever James Jones wants to do to try and improve the team, also built us the glorious new practice facility and put money into the stadium Reno which looks amazing. The Dude was a shitty ass owner for a long time but he finally learned his from his mistakes and I think he’s also realized being good brings in a lot more money so paying players so your team is good is worth it."
"I didn’t “ignore” so much as it didn’t really add anything except a few opinions in the moment that still didn’t answer any questions. And you had already showed me that silly video, so why did I care about a handful of tweets? There were two obvious hard foul misses on the Warriors in that video, so it makes sense people overreact to them. But looking at that whole video, it’s obvious in hindsight the bad reffing wasn’t super one sided. Your dumb little “gotcha” actually showed how pathetic your whining is, which is classic.  The cold streak wasn’t because of the fouls, or else that team was as super fucking soft as you. It was the Rockets choking. But blame the refs if you need to, it’s kinda hilarious. 25 straight missed shots and it’s the refs. Trevor Ariza goes 0-12, but it’s the refs. Harden put up 32 but couldn’t hit shots when it mattered once the refs stopped pandering to him, but it’s the refs.  Why are so intent on thinking I hate the Rockets? They weren’t a super team, I much rather they won than the Warriors. Is that how you have to handle the fact that somebody isn’t crying with you about OMG THE REFSSS and is actually taking an unbiased view of a game that had obviously bad officiating, but doesn’t seem to have been wildly one sided based on your dumb little video?  You really are pathetic. But I’m not doing this beyond this comment, so go cry to somebody like a pathetic little bitch."
“Contract year Trevor ariza” 😂😂
Lol Trevor Ariza was the savior of the rockets
"Kinda makes me wonder how an All-Old team would look. Only taking folks from the oldest 20 players in the league, I’ve got:   PG: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic  SG: JJ Redick, Andre Iguadola   SF: LeBron James, Trevor Ariza   PF: Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap  C: Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol  Honestly, that’s not a bad team. I’d call it a second round exit, maybe conference finals."
"Rick Fox, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry, Trevor Ariza... these were dudes that did a lot of dirty work and could really defend. I'm biased as hell.  Outside those guys, my favorite role guy to watch was Andre Roberson. Matthew Dellavedova in the 2015 finals was great too."
"Kurt Rambis, Robert Horry, Rick Fox, Lamar Odom, Trevor Ariza"
No he would not lol.  He never paid the luxury tax.  Most owners aren’t going into Lux tax over Trevor Ariza.
trevor ariza gotta be somewhere in there. hes pretty old and has been on the most teams
Trevor Ariza
About a joe harris 1-11 and 2-11 or a trevor ariza 0-12
/r/nba changes opinions as often as Trevor Ariza changes teams.
You listed Trevor Ariza who has been completely washed for about 3 years now. You’re just a clown tbh.  Please learn to troll better.
"Bro I know you think I'm fucking stupid but let's not act like Conley's been pouting on the bench about being stuck in Utah. I would have totally agreed with Windhorst if it was someone like Trevor Ariza or Andre Igouadala, but Mike Conley has never said anything publicly bad about Utah and he denied the statement by Windhorst directly."
"You only have 26.8 million on the books officially for next season. The cap is somewhere around 115-120m. Even if I were to take into account Kemba salary, It's somewhere around 40-50m on the books. I'm not even taking into account the trade exceptions that you have which is something along the lines of 50-60m total.

"Yeah looks like 7 trades in his case. I'd love to see Trevor Ariza (11 trades apparently(!)), Jim Jackson, and Keith Van Horn on NBA bills. Also Ish Smith on the penny or quarter (since he was sent to the G-League and signed back by other teams endlessly, no disrespect haha)."
The Trevor Ariza special
the Trevor Ariza effect
https://www.nba.com/news/fallout-bizarre-trevor-ariza-dillon-marshon-brooks-trade
I thought the most traded player was Trevor Ariza.
Do you mean game 7 where Trevor Ariza went 0-12 from 3?
Explain what? Was he suppose to defer to Trevor ariza?
"true but the Knicks have always been good drafters. Even during the shit show Isaiah Thomas years he drafted Channing Frye, Trevor Ariza, Nate Robinson, David Lee, and Wilson Chandler. Frye was the only lottery pick of all those.    The Knicks know how to identify talent. It's everything else that's been the issue."
Trevor Ariza was supposed to box out Steven Adams idk wtf the other guy talking about
I’m surprised recency bias didn’t cause Trevor Ariza to get a shout out for the Suns. We hate that bum. He was supposed to provide veteran leadership but the only thing he did was teach our young guys how to commit gran larceny.
Devin does seem like he'd be super into Trevor Ariza.
"Agree or disagree, Kemba is a negative asset that took the #16 to get rid of. You are totally disrespecting the value of Ben Simmons. If you can get CJ McCollum+ for Simmons, why the hell would you take Kemba instead, who is more injured and less skilled.   Rockets basically got the same haul for Robert Covington, and they didn't have to take on an awful max contract, they got an expiring Trevor Ariza"
Fuck Trevor ariza
"Robert Covington, Trevor Ariza, or Danny Green?"
"Every year when the NBA schedule is released, Trevor Ariza eagerly looks through and begins planning how he will torment the Dallas Mavericks.   A 15+ point quarter? Mmm tantalizing   Buzzer beating 3s?  Positively scrumptious  Shades of Steph Curry? Maybe a little scoring explosion reminiscent of TMAC? I think I'll do both.  I think he switches teams mid-season at this point so he can play us even more."
Trevor Ariza
"&gt;Blazers never had... Ariza  The absolute DISRESPECT for Trailblazers legend Trevor Ariza.   His defensive contributions involved trying hard and then getting traded for Robert Covington, which is more than you can say for most guys we ask to play defense."
brooklyn especially. Dinwiddie bruce brown melo claxton and someone like trevor ariza or andre iguodala is a winning bench unit
"No lmao still both terrible performances  However, Jimmy does get too much hate. He was legitimately being guarded by a DPOY and arguably the best perimeter defender in the league. Also the rest of the roster aside from like Dragic and Duncan Robinson in game 1 were not all that great  Trevor Ariza could not guard Giannis like Jae could and also they seriously lost the Oladipo trade as he wasn't around and neither was Kelly to spread the floor and make things easier for Jimmy"
"Miami didnt really improve their roster compared to other teams like the Bucks and the Nets. We actually lost players like Crowder and Olynyk who were very important offensive sparks. Seeing how Miami completely lacked offense all year i think that played as big a part as anything. Compare that to the Bucks gaining PJ Tucker and Holiday our tiny addition of Dedmon (who played amazing for a backup center) and old Trevor Ariza, who was mediocre, it makes sense that Miami got bounced like they did."
"If they get Butler to commit, they can just run Miami’s offense for stretches of the game. I would guess it works a lot better when you replace Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, and Trevor Ariza with Steph Curry, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant."
"Hey, that's 2011 NBA Champ Corey Brewer. Along with 2011 NBA Champ Jason Terry, and 2009 NBA Champ Trevor Ariza."
Trevor ariza is employed........
Yep this is the problem.  This is games against one another lol. This doesn’t mean PJ Tucker was guarding him bro.   Check nba.com matchups for that data &amp; stats.   Like I said for all we know he could’ve scored all his points on Trevor Ariza.  It’s pretty obvious Tucker gives him a lot of trouble especially if he was shooting &lt;40% when guarded by him.  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/200782/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/200782/head-to-head/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1
Lol so his ceiling is Trevor Ariza with no 3pt shot
"Yeah, Trevor fucking ariza still has a job"
"I mean there was nothing else HOU could do. Warriors were playing physical defense in the paint and HOU was getting 0 calls so they switched to perimeter shooting and their shots just didn’t fall. There’s no gameplan that can prepare James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Clint Capela to beat Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green... especially in a shootout"
bro he went 1-11 and 2-11 in two different games. that’s trevor ariza game 7 bad
"For the Jazz, this reminds me of 2014-15 LAC since the Clippers went up like 20 when Blake hit the circus shot layup. Then the Rockets without Harden came back because of Josh Smith and Trevor Ariza and won the game and the series in 7. Tonight, it's LAC without Kawhi coming back down 25 after Mitchell hit the deep 3 and win the series down 2-0"
"If I’m a GM and given the option to start my franchise with either Trevor Ariza or Ben Simmons, I’m choosing Trevor Ariza."
"Vince Carter: 261 teammates. Played with eight teams through 22 seasons.   Juwan Howard: 236 teammates.   Tyson Chandler: 230 teammates.   Trevor Ariza: 227 teammates.   Kevin Willis: 226 teammates.  Data from 1 year ago, but VC so far ahead of everyone it's gotta still be him."
Trevor Ariza prob
"If we want to play this old game we can, but players weren't coming to Cleveland during the end of his first run because LeBron wasn't committed to Cleveland. We couldn't get fucking Trevor ariza to come because no one wanted to be left in Cleveland if LeBron left. If LeBron signs a max deal around that time I guarantee you things would have been different."
"Rockets were also missing Trevor ariza that year when he left in free agency who was one of there best defenders and starting small forward, even though he sucked in game 7 the year prior."
"&gt;The 2010 finals were decided by literally 4 points.   And both Bynum and Kobe were not anywhere close to healthy in 2010 and they still won anyway. Both [Kobe](https://www.ocregister.com/2010/07/23/kobe-has-knee-surgery/amp/) and [Bynum](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jul-28-la-sp-lakers-andrew-bynum-20100729-story.html?_amp=true) had their knees drained during the 2010 postseason and both had knee surgery after the Finals. Bynum was severely limited during the Finals, having to have his knee drained before Games 1 &amp; 5 because he was playing with torn cartilage he suffered from hyperextending it in Game 6 of the WCF.   And going back to the 2008 Finals, in addition to missing Bynum the Lakers were also missing Trevor Ariza, and instead had to play Vlad Radmanovic in his place. The Lakers got absolutely shafted in Game 2 of that series, shooting only 10 free throws to 38 by Boston in a game that was decided by 6 points. The Lakers win that series for sure if they were at full strength."
And the Lakers were missing Trevor Ariza in 2008 as well. That would have been a Lakers 3-peat if both teams were full strength all three years.
"I agree with this, and I think it's because fixing team culture is the ownership/FO's priority more than X's and O's. George Karl and Dave Joerger were excellent X's and O's coaches and the players hated them. They've been trying to sign legit vets for the same reason, Trevor Ariza, Zach Randolph, Vince Carter, George Hill. Iggy said they tried to sign him to fix their locker room.  Also explains the Davion Mitchell pick. They need high character guys to turn the franchise culture around. Luke Walton is beloved by the players, and so I don't think he's going anywhere soon. Also why they are signing guys like Doug Christie to the assistant coaching spots."
"Throwing shit at the wall   East  1. Milwaukee: Despite winning a championship, Giannis, Middleton and Jrue go full all gas, no breaks next year and gun for 65ish wins and the 1 seed in the East. Love the Portis re-sign.   2. Brooklyn: Battle injuries like they did last year, but still prevail as the most dangerous team in the league.   3. Boston: Ime Udoka brings much needed cohesion to a C’s team with a lot of firepower. Jay’s + Rob Will stay healthy. Schroeder guns for 6moy.   4. Atlanta: After a rocky first 10 games and everyone questioning how legit the young Hawks are, they explode back. One of Reddish or Huerter gets dealt at the deadline.   5. Miami: Pretty significant drop off in win column from top 4 to here. Heat play hard, but it’s not pretty. Robinson underperforms.   6. Philadelphia: Simmons situation leaks into season. A lot of turmoil. Embiid’s health is a big question. Maxey takes a big step.   7. Indiana: Have a sturdy season led by Carlisle. Warren and LeVert play 65+ games each.   8. Washington: The Wiz outlast New York and Chicago in the play-in. Washington has multiple 6moy candidates.   Other East  Chicago barely misses out. Derozan contract quickly becomes bad, fit turns out to be atrocious.   Cleveland (for no other reason that I plan on hammering the Over for their season win total) takes a step forward.   Charlotte is everyone’s favorite bad team.   West (In general has a pretty down year)  1. LAL: Hate this team with a passion (not Russ &amp; Me7o) so it’s only right. Spacing is a legit issue but the defense is still top notch. Kent Bazemore tries to fight Trevor Ariza at some point.   2. Phoenix: CP3 slows down, but the rest of the team comes to play after slipping in the Finals. Ayton MIP finalist.   3. Utah: Same ole Utah, nothing too crazy. One of Ingles/Bogdonavic gets dealt at the deadline.   4. Denver: Jokic keeps everyone in awe. Porter Jr. never takes that step everyone expects him to with Murray out. Nuggets make a move for Dame.   5. New Orleans: FUCK YOU DONT CARE. Na but Zion and BI take over, Zion comes back and shocks everyone on defense. New back court + defensive depth is a huge strength. Willie Green for COY. Nickeil finishes top 5 MIP.   6. Dallas: Solid year, Luka wins scoring title. Jury is out on Kidd, he and Luka fight a lot. Porzingis bounces back and plays 60ish games. Team defense gets really bad though. Lot of shootouts.   7. LAC: Interesting year for the Clips. They meddle around .500 but are that random team every year that wins all its close games but gets shredded by lottery teams. Terrence Mann has the greenest of lights. Kawhi returns.  8. Minnesota: Now we’re in the ugly. T-Wolves and their fans don’t give a shit though, playoffs baby. Edwards and KAT become unstoppable. DLo doesn’t get in the way. Defense is close to non-existent, but enough energy from Pat Bev keeps the young team engaged enough to go .500.   Golden State: I’m gonna get ripped apart for this but I don’t see the hype. Curry is fuckin amazing, but I think we see a really broken down Klay. Draymond replicates last two years. Youth isn’t what it needs to be. They come up short as KAT gives Draymond and Wiseman absolute hell in the battle for the 8th spot in the play in. Pat Bev gets a clutch block on Curry and the internet folds inwards.   Other West   Portland is horrible after Dame literally sits out (I 25% believe this) and gets traded East (plz). CJ gets dealt. Powell gets the green light to shoot 25 times a game.   Kings finish as the 9th seed but Walton fucks it up and gets knocked out by Curry and the Warriors.   Memphis = Charlotte West  Houston starts 5-0 and finishes with another top 5 pick."

"Nah, Trevor Ariza thought he was better than Lebron in high school. It was a thing"
"But we'd be looking at KD, Harden, Kyrie, DeAndre, Blake vs Lebron, Russ, AD, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Trevor Ariza, Melo.  Outside of russ and melo that is a defensive juggernaut of a team with some of the best defenders at their positions ever in their primes."
"Don’t know what the stat was this year but in 2020 he averaged an offensive foul a game. For some guys (notably Blake Griffin and Trevor Ariza) half their defensive plan against him is “flop hard and get the charge”, plus a bunch of other guys who don’t flop for it but still go for the charge every time he looks like driving.  Honestly if you’re brave enough to take a charge from a full speed Giannis you’ve earned the call anyway."
"Trevor Ariza  -  defending the inbound pass.    I remember watching the lakers years ago, and ariza woulda constantly tip or deflect inbound passes to the point where i thought ""2k is gonna have to add a stat for this"""
Because their roster is filled with a bunch of washed up vets. When you're relying on Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington to produce you're not getting very fat. The Lakers have zero shooting and their defense is half assed
"The 2018-19 Phoenix Suns if you removed DBook, Mikal, and Ayton.   Trevor Ariza  Tyler Johnson  Isaiah Canaan  Josh Jackson  Jamal Crawford  Ryan Anderson  Elie Okobo  Dragan Bender   with sharpshooters Troy Daniels and Jimmer Fredette"
"That team was built around that skillset, they couldn't simply ""adapt"" to a different style in the middle of a game just because they were missing. Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker are three point specialists, all they CAN do in a basketball court is defend and shoot threes.  Ariza and Gordon straight up choked, they had many open shots during this run and couldn't hit a single one of them, Harden's misses were either heavily contested or he didn't get the call he always got."
Trevor Ariza doesn't get nearly as much shit as he should for that game. One of the all time worst performances I've ever seen.
"We had one shot creator on our team in James Harden. The rest of the guys are spot-up shooters with little to no shot creation ability. What exactly do you want the Rockets to do at that point? Sure, we could try and run a Trevor Ariza high PnR or go to a Clint Capela post-up, but that's obviously not going to end well. Our team was specifically built to play one way, and that was through Chris Paul/James Harden isolations that led to baskets for those two or kick-outs for open 3s. If you have an issue with the roster construction not providing room to adapt, then that's fair, but you can't make a trade for another shot creator during the middle of a game 7. We didn't have the ability to revamp our offense on the fly so sticking to our guns was the best option we had at winning that game.  We also shot 44 3s which was in-line with our season and playoff averages. It's not like we chucked up 60+ threes and completely ignored attacking the basket. We ran our normal offense and just didn't hit the 3s we took. At the end of the day, we lost by 9. If we only have a horrific percentage from 3 (4/27) instead of a completely catastrophic percentage (0/27) then we win that game."
"It wasn't the same team. We lost Trevor Ariza and replaced hime with no one. Lost additional wing depth. And by far most importantly, Chris Paul was a shell of the player he was the year before. Our record that year reflected this. We were 65-17 in 2018 and only 53-29 in 2019.  In 2019, Chris Paul had career lows in PPG, VORP, BPM, WS/48, PER, and TOV%. It was also the worst TS% he had since his second year in the league. He was making uncharacteristically poor turnovers and he couldn't beat anybody off-the-dribble in isolation to save his life. It looked like he had fallen off a cliff due to age. There was a reason people said he had the worst contract in the league at that time."
Trevor Ariza?
God and Trevor Ariza
I truly hope this is the summer where he's traded a million times in a month like Trevor Ariza or Luke Ridnour.
"Tim Cranjis did an insanely deep analysis [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/p6exl3/film_review_letter_grades_for_las_new_perimeter/) on evaluating the defense of the new Lakers signing  the tl;dr is that I Russ/Monk/THT starting together is likely going to result in some pretty poor back end rotations on P&amp;R switches, and despite being arguably the best ""rotater,"" it's a big question of whether or not a 36 year old Trevor Ariza will even be able to play 30+ minutes/game. However, Ken Nunn seems to be competent enough to fill that role and it seems like THT is still the best off-ball chaser and best guy at getting over PNRs at the point of the screen, so I think he might be necessary to play with Russ.  Kendrick Nunn might be needed to start to be a ""fill in the gap guy"" between Russ/THT.  My thought process is its going to Russ/Nunn/THT/Lebron/AD with Monk/Ellington/Baze/Ariza/Gasol off the bench"
"I agree that it shouldn’t be their primes but when he coached them, and therefore think your Jackson list is better than OP’s.   I also might get blasphemous and say Ewing over Kareem. Riley took over in ‘82. Kareem was still great and would win fMVP 3 years later, but I think 82-89 level Kareem vs peak Ewing is a real argument. And putting Ewing in there would be represent of Pat’s career better (I mean how you gonna do a Pat Riley greatest hits and not have a single Knick).   But to actually answer the question, I vote Pat. Simply because, as he bounced around more and coached way more players, his bench is stacked. After you’ve taken Bron out of OP’s lineup, you’ve got a three center rotation of peak Ewing, Miami Shaq and 80s Kareem. Play either of those two together and it’s terrifying. Rotate John Starks, Byron Scott, Michael Cooper, Doc Rivers, Gary Payton, Jason Williams at guards. Phil’s basically got the Jordanaires plus the Laker threepeat bench plus Lamar Odom, Trevor Ariza and Ron Artest. Great squad of rotation players but not the All Star caliber that Pat’s bench is."
"Ok I didn’t ask if the signings were successful so I don’t see the point in that comment.   But let’s break it down. LeBron and Shaq are our 2 biggest feee agent signings. Malone and Payton were big so that gives us 4 even tho 2 of those signings were past their prime. Ron Artest should not count as a superstar/great player signing. He wasn’t close to being an all star so you’re reaching. Dwight Howard was traded to us and he left. We got him back after he was bought out. He wasn’t a great signing, it was a smart signing because few teams wanted him. Steve Nash was past his prime and was 38 when we got him. Kind of reaching by including a 48 year old wouldn’t you? Melo is no longer an elite player. There’s no way you can count him as one of our great signings. He’s the definition of a role player and has been for the last couple of years. Mid tier role players aren’t great players. I asked you to  make me a list of all our great player free agent signings. Danny Green was a great signing but he wasn’t a great Laker, Trevor Ariza is washed, Fisher scammed the Jazz and signed with us but he isn’t a great player. He is a Laker legend tho for his contributions. Rondo was viewed as a bad signing. People said he wouldn’t fit with the Lakers because he’s ball dominant and can’t shoot. Funny how the narrative changed.   Perfect let’s talk about those players, PG didn’t give us a meeting after bitching that he wanted to go to the Lakers, Kawhi didn’t sign with us after rumors came out that his preferred destination was the Lakers before he got traded to the Raptors, DeRozan didn’t sign with us, AD was traded to us, iguadala didn’t sign with us.   No team is getting free agents on discounts in the last decade? I guess the Heatles didn’t exist, i guess the warriors didn’t get a ton of great feee agents, i guess the Nets didn’t just get every free agent last year? Lmao come on man.  So out of all those players you were only able to give me 2 Laker great signings (Shaq + LeBron), 2 great players in Payton and Malone and then a bunch of role players. Nash wasn’t great even when we signed him, he came off a season averaging 12/10. And the. You named a bunch of role players.   So go ahead and name all the GREAT PLAYERS  that we signed because so far you were only able to name 4 and I’m giving you 2 of those"
"I wont qualify whether they were sucessfull or not, cuz that was not your inital statement. but look at the names the lakers pull in free agency.   Lebron, shaq, malone, payton, ron artest, steve nash(snt), dwight howard. melo. mid tier role players as well, danny green, trevor ariza, fisher, rondo, schoeder(was sought after prior to last year). Numerous other recentish players who wanted to or rumored to go to want to sign  or force their way to the lakers, Kawhi, Paul george, DeRozan, AD(obv), Igoudala etc etc.   not gonna accept the ""but nash was garbage and payton and malone were old"" arguements cuz they arnt relevant here. No other team is consistently over the last few decades getting free agent veteran players that want to play for their team at a discount.   gtfo"
"Bobby Portis, Joe Harris, Jordan Poole, Trevor Ariza. The NBA is really spoiling us with this star power /s"
So basically you're paying 20M a year to have trevor ariza on offense.
Trevor Ariza will be in Staples Center though
Don’t sleep on Trevor Ariza.
[Trevor Ariza is the most traded player in the NBA](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-trade-deadline-trevor-ariza-11616684600)
Where is Trevor Ariza in this?
"I feel like this could have different brackets.  Self destruction: OJ mayo, Lamar Odom. Injuries. D-Rose, Jabari Parker, Andrew Bynum Good player but still kind of qualifies: John Wall, Cousins, Porzingis Guys who were legit top 5 but got old. Melo, Dwight, Marc Gasol Guys who plateaued early: Trevor Ariza, Al Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Malcolm Brogdan."
"Yeah I referenced the Boozer situation. Jackson was a bad pick. Looking back at that draft Al Jefferson would have been nice, but again there were busts drafted all over the place. Toronto picked at 8 and the guy lasted 3 years in the NBA even worse than Jackson. Utah had 2 first round picks and they lasted a combined 6 years in the league. Then there is Trevor Ariza a mid 2nd that is still playing today. Drafting is difficult for every team."
Trevor Ariza
"he went 2/13 from 3 point in that game, including 10 straight missed 3s during the 0-27 stretch  in fact apart from trevor ariza who went 0-9, nobody on the rockets shot a worse % from 3 point than harden in that game"
"Better than Trevor Ariza, no?  Dude has been around."
"They were more injury prone that season than usual though.  CP3 missed the most games since 2010  Harden missed the most games in his career at the time  Trevor Ariza missed 15 games that season, while in the 3 seasons prior he missed 3 games total.  They weren’t inherently injury-prone, just really unlucky.  The main point is, that team was historically good. The only reason their stats arent THAT good is because of the 25-30 games where they fielded an injured roster.  In the playoffs, with the exception of LMAM, they were fully healthy up until the very end. They went 8-2 in the first 2 rounds and crushed their competition. They were also up 3-2 against the so-called greatest team of all time, and then CP3’s hammy got fucked.  So yeah, the 2018 Rockets were a top 10 team of all time. They were just incredibly unlucky with the timing of their injuries."
"Semi-Unpopular Opinion: The Rockets missing 27 straight 3s and losing Game 7 was a byproduct of being gassed out. Their smaller defenders like Eric Gordon were too busy trying to run Curry off the 3-point line while wing defenders like Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker were unbelievably physical guarding KD. I don’t think it’s necessarily a coincidence that they also blew 2 straight double-digit first half leads in Games 6 and 7 as well, their legs couldn’t keep up."
Trevor Ariza
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"3&amp;D is like... Robert Covington, Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Wes Matthews, etc...  KD isn't fucking 3&amp;D"
Trevor Ariza or Mario Chalmers IMO
He should watch Trevor Ariza every spare moment cause that's his place in the league
"&gt; Melo and Dwight are also both sure fire 1st ballot HOF players who were massive stars in the league who had to transition to being role players to keep playing.   I get what you're saying but Westbrook now is in the ""Ayyy P they want me to come of the bench"" stage of his career... Except it's even worse because unlike Melo who had people telling him he needed to be a role player, no one (at this time) is telling Russ he's no longer a superstar.   Those guys are way over the hump, Russ still thinks of himself as an MVP-caliber player who maybe needs to adjust his game. Not ""I'm way way inferior to AD and Lebron so I should be their bitch and do as they say and be grateful"" - which is literally what you need from him.  &gt; Marc Gasol and Trevor Ariza there to call him on his shit  Players getting DNPs or 10 minutes off the bench are NOT calling out Westbrook, not happening.  &gt; And on the court, this will be the first time in Westbrook's career where he is very clearly not one of the team's two best players.   Again, not in his mind. He doesn't think he's worse than AD, that's for sure.   I don't know if he'll listen to Lebron. Usually the players coming to Lebron come as either free agents or as a part of a master plan when they originally agreed to be Lebron's servants in return for a championship. This ""He's on the market right now, let's get him in the last minute"" thing is not Lebron's normal MO"
"&gt; Why would it be different this year?  It very well might not be and could be a disaster, but I thought I did a good job of explaining why above. To recap, the Lakers have pretty much the perfect group of players around him to convince him he needs to change. Melo and Dwight are also both sure fire 1st ballot HOF players who were massive stars in the league who had to transition to being role players to keep playing. Those are two great guys to mentor him in this inevitable transition in his career. It'll also be a blessing to have so many older players, like Marc Gasol and Trevor Ariza there to call him on his shit, along with LeBron, of course. And on the court, this will be the first time in Westbrook's career where he is very clearly not one of the team's two best players.   There's a lot of reasons for why this year could be different. Now we just need to wait and see if it actually will be."
"I think the Lakers have surrounded Westbrook with the absolutely perfect cast to try to convince him he needs to accept his limitations and settle into more of a role than just being the star. Who better than Dwight and Melo to know what that transition is like and to talk to him? People think it might be this battle of wills between Westbrook and LeBron, but the Lakers have a whole bunch of guys to help talk to him. In addition to Dwight and Melo, the Lakers also have Marc Gasol and Trevor Ariza, who are both older than Russ and who have championship experience. As a Laker fan I'm really hoping these guys can all talk to Westbrook and get him to play smarter this year and maximize his strengths while minimizing his weaknesses."
"Jamal Crawford, Peja Stojakovic, Andre Kirilenko, Kyle Korver, Lamar Odom, Ron Artest, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, JJ Barea, Shane Battier, Mike Miller, Big Baby Davis, Nick Van Exel, Quentin Richardson, Ty Lawson, Raymond Felton, Mark Jackson, Steve Kerr and many many more"
"No offense, but I think people who feel like whatever happens with the Lakers is a foregone conclusion, either good or bad, are talking out their ass. We really have no clue. We can say Westbrook won't be a good shooter, but that's probably about all we can say with any certainty. Westbrook has never not been the clear 1st or 2nd best player on a team, and he's also never been on a team with this many vets.   The position Westbrook is in is going to be wholly unique for him. Now maybe that doesn't change who he is and what he does one iota, or maybe this changes everything. We don't yet know if his career will go the route of Allen Iverson, where he refuses to adapt or change and is out of the league in a year or two; or if he chooses the path of guys like Vince Carter, Melo and Dwight, and accepts his new limitations due to his age and transitions into a role player.   If Westbrook is shooting a million shots out there you can bet that he's going to encounter far more pushback from players with the clout to yell at him than he's ever had in his life. LeBron, Melo and Dwight are three 1st ballot hall of famers who are going to be ideally positioned to talk to him on his level. And aside from them there also will be Marc Gasol, Trevor Ariza and possibly Jared Dudley as guys older than him with championship experience who will probably feel comfortable enough to talk to him as well.   There absolutely are drawbacks to putting together an older team like the Lakers have done, but if you were looking to build a squad specifically to deal with trying to mold Westbrook into what you need him to be, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this. And with the spectre of possibly having to face Kevin Durant, James Harden and the Nets in the Finals for Westbrook's first championship, that could prove to be a hell of a great motivator for him. We'll have to wait and see how this plays out."
Here you go. Enough said   * Dwight Howard played 41 games  * Trevor Ariza  * Jason Terry was like 37 years old  * Kostas Papanikolaou  * Corey Brewer played 56 games  * Josh Smith  * Pablo Prigioni played 24 games and like 37 yo  * Terrence Jones played 33 games  * Donatas Motiejūnas  * Clint Capela played 12 games  * Joey Dorsey  * Patrick Beverley played 56 games   * K. J. McDaniels played 10 games
"&gt;	 but he knew what he was in for when he signed this contract last year.  i’m so confused on what you mean by this. he re-signed with the team he had made the finals with, after a playoff run in which he had played really well before getting hurt in game 1 of the finals  he didn’t pull a 2018 Trevor Ariza or 2017 George Hill and sign a big deal with a shit team or something."
"Dude was so early to the facility, that he was even with the PR team, welcoming the other lakers free agent signees like Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, and Kendrick Nunn  Reminded me of the kid who showed up so early to class, that he started helping the teacher out with things 😂😂"
 No cp3 and no Trevor ariza . Let that sink in !
"At times he was the 3rd best player on a team with Lebron and AD on it.   He had his ups and downs but when came time to win a championship, he delivered. Reminds me a lot of Trevor Ariza when he won with us in 2009.    Appreciate it, KCP!"
lmao i’ve never seen a Trevor Ariza fan boy before
Thunder Legend Trevor Ariza
Ah yes OKC GOAT Trevor Ariza
"I don't think it's that deep, where they got together and strategized who is gonna call Trevor Ariza."
You can say that about Trevor Ariza and almost any player
"Which big signing this year are you suspicious of? On the first day of free agency, all the Lakers did was annouce the signings of Dwight Howard, Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza. Did something get your hackles up about one or all of those?"
"Ah yes, the Lakers, with their blockbuster signings on day one of Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. Serious chicanery going on there."
They’re going after the lakers because Russ was calling Trevor Ariza before the moratorium
Thunder legend Trevor Ariza
"Trevor ""Young Socialite"" Ariza"
Lol trevor “fuck them other places” ariza i guess
"I have such mixed feelings about trevor ariza. He did a lot of the dirty work during his rockets years, but his exit and quotes like these make me like him a lot less."
Genuinely curious about this. What are the characteristics of players like george hill and trevor ariza that enable them to get contracts but get passed around like a hoe?
"I was sitting courtside at a Wiz @ Raps game. As Trevor Ariza walked by I yelled out “Hey Ariza, I’ve got you on my fantasy team!”. He then turned and asked who said that and I lost my shit for even being acknowledged by him.   Pretty simple exchange but it was really cool to me"
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
Basically Trevor Ariza
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
It's fine no one will even notice that Trevor Ariza is even on the court.
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  “ The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.”"
"I’m obviously biased, but I really do think it’s Bam. Outside of Jimmy last year (and Oladipo in the handful of games he actually saw the court for us), our best defenders were like Andre Iguodala and Trevor Ariza, and the year before it was probably Iggy and Crowder. Bam’s ability to switch and guard 1-5 did a lot to help cover up our guards’ defensive ineptitude, even though he was expending a lot of energy on the offensive end as well. Ben has Bam on height, but Bam has the longer wingspan and about 15 more pounds packed on, so the physical attributes pretty much cancel out, if not give the edge to Bam. Simmons is a great defender, and they’re definitely both in the same tier, but I’m taking Bam."
"You think that’s better than Carmelo Anthony, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard where have you been dude"
"As opposed to getting the corpse of Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Trevor ariza...."
"I wanted to see what I could get with the 2011-12 season: 7-59 Bobcats, 20-46 Wizards, 21-45 Hornets  PG = John Wall, Jarret Jack  SG = Eric Gordon, Jordan Crawford, Gerald Henderson  SF = Trevor Ariza, Al-Farouq Aminu, Corey Maggette  PF = Rashard Lewis, Boris Diaw  C = Javale McGee, Nene, Emeka Okafor  Is that team any good? No not really."
"I think stacked is a little too strong a word for their role players. THT is a good role player, and so is Nunn (despite struggling in the playoffs), both of them and Monk (who is pretty bad right now) also have margin of improvement. But none were actually better than Caruso last year. And the veterans are a good fit, but their best vet right now is Trevor Ariza, who is well past his prime. The 3 super stars can take them to the championship, no doubt, but their roleplayers were better 2 years ago."
"Trevor Ariza was literally the starting SF on a Championship team, who made probably the single clutchest play that series."
"Trevor Ariza has made over $116 million in his career. 100,000 Arizas would be worth $11.6 trillion, more than the GDP of any country besides the US and China.   100,000 Arizas &gt; 1 LeBron"
https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/trevor-ariza-has-officially-been-traded-more-times-than-any-player-in-nba-history/ar-BB1eIU0t
" Trevor Ariza is a pretty talented player, but u cannot trashtalk the king....."
"Trevor Ariza hates anyone who makes him look silly on the court.   At this point, he's one of those people that probably has an ""enemies"" list somewhere. He tried to fight Trae when he got nutmegged which is still hilarious to me."
Back when Ariza's  uncle hyped up Trevor Ariza
I think trevor ariza

"- Trevor Ariza - 36  - Dwight Howard - 36  - Wayne Ellington - 34  - Carmelo Anthony - 37  Clearly age of the player isn't a big consideration for the Lakers, and Caruso is only 27."

I'd put my life on the line that the Lakers don't win this year. Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza as starters is woof. Also Westbrook hasn't had a good playoff series in 5 years.
"So far we signed; Russel Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemoore, Trevor Ariza, and Carmelo.    Is Ariza still that sharpshooter from the old laker days?  We getting that chip bois?"
Los Angeles Expendables:  Sylvester Stallone as Lebron James  Jason Statham as Russell Westbrook  Wesley Snipes as Kent Bazemore  Arnold Schwarzenegger as Anthony Davis  Dolph Lungren as Dwight Howard  Jet Li as Trevor Ariza  Chuck Norris as Marc Gasol  Terry Crews as Ken Bazemore  Randy Couture as Jared Dudley  Jean Claude Van Damme as Wesley Matthews  Bruce Willis as Carmelo Anthony
"Trevor Ariza, apparently."
"I mean, how does he compare to Trevor Ariza these days?"
Jeff Green literally won a game for Brooklyn against us. Trevor Ariza on the other hand was a joke lol
"If the Lakers don't want the corpse of Trevor Ariza by the time the playoffs roll around, it would be wise to sign someone like a Melo to take some of his regular season minutes."
Rodney hood might suck but he's talented enough that he can swing a series. He's the homeless man's version of Jeff Green who's the poor man's version of Trevor Ariza
Has anyone looked at the Lakers roster? They have an tax payer MLE and veteran minimum contracts and the 4th best player on this team right now is whatever is left of Trevor Ariza. Bazemore is arguably like the 4th or 5th best player on this team right now.
Ok ur right 36 year old Trevor ariza and wayne fucking Ellington will lead lakers to the promise land. Westbrook will fold in playoffs and Lebron is 37 and looked 50% in the playoffs this year. But whatever makes lakers fell better
What team do you think does that? Even the worst teams have clear hierarchies and their coaches and best players aren't gonna let that shit fly. Nor should they.  Trevor Ariza isn't getting post ups just because he had Lillard or Kemba on him.
Trevor Ariza the village bicycle  Everyone's had a ride.
Trevor Ariza is really the girl from the Bubble Suns
Is Trevor ariza being ran a train on?????
Trevor Ariza is the currency of the NBA
"&gt; he just got lucky that thibs could coach his 08 team up to a historic defense   And that the Lakers were missing Bynum and Ariza with injuries, of course. Much harder to guard the Celtics when you have to put Vlad Radmanovic on Pierce instead of Trevor Ariza and your bench is weakened by having to start Lamar Odom in place of Bynum."
"Let's not act like that's the only reason he's getting assists though. The last time Harden wasn't sharing the floor with an All-NBA point guard (CP3/Westbrook) was in 2017 where he led the league in assists at 11.2 apg. His best teammates that year were Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Ryan Anderson."
Who cares what JJ thinks. He’s not a good player and they got a return for him. The Pistons would’ve done the same shit for Blake but no one wanted that contract.   JJ was just being a baby and expected washed up star buyout treatment. Imagine if Trevor Ariza bitched on a podcast every time he got traded.
"Harden dragged the Rockets to 55 wins in 2016-17 with, like, Trevor Ariza as their second-best player, what the *fuck* are you talking about"
Wish I was trevor Ariza
"Haha Trevor Ariza hates being made a fool of, he’s gotta be mad af"
"I agree with you that it is a silly way to look at it to a point. But there are many parameters to look at. Skills aside, what has KAT done? Not much. Yeah. Wiggins hasn't done much either but because of the scarcity of talent at the Center position, ALL teams would value KAT much higher than Wiggins. But I would argue it's not the skillset. It's because Wiggins could be easily replaced with an above average small forward like Tobias Harris or Trevor Ariza. You can't do that at Center. There's only a handful of Centers better than KAT. So I would argue it's less about talent and more about scarcity. IOW - I think KAT is just an above average NBA player who happens to be big at a position that is short on skill. And yes, that is a talent in itself."
Yeah trading Ben Simmons for Trevor Ariza (at best) and Malik Beasley is 100% a fair trade for both sides /s
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
"Everyone here saying Lakers and Heat don’t want him bc he’s “quitter” and sat out the bubble, but they don’t realize Trevor Ariza also freakin sat out and the Lakers picked him up lol"
"Wrong side of 30? He turns 31 in November. That's old, but still very serviceable. Can't speak to his injury history though and that's probably what's got teams hesitant. Washed-ass Trevor Ariza also opted out of the bubble and he's on the Lakers now."
"He had a down season in Houston but I'm surprised he's not on a team like Miami or LAL; he's a solid guard defender who does well next to a point forward. I wonder if he's getting blackballed still from opting out of the bubble a while back (I say that, but Trevor Ariza did that and he's on the Lakers now)."
"A competent front office wouldn't have ditched Boozer or blown it on every draft pick and most trades.   Hell, in 04 they had a top 10 pick in a loaded draft and chose one of the few players in the top 30 to not pan out.  How different would that team have looked with young LeBron, Boozer and someone like Josh Smith, Al Jefferson, Tony Allen, Kevin Martin or Trevor Ariza instead of Luke fucking Jackson.   Add a good coach and that team looks totally different.   Plus, a good GM and coach can make unattractive teams more attractive, particularly when it becomes obvious that they have an all time talent on the come up."
"Or 2013 when talking about the Lakers. He was on The Jump saying the Lakers could get 65+ wins because of all their superstar talent, and then listed Trevor Ariza."
McGrady wore 3 that year. That’s Trevor Ariza.
"That's not T-Mac... That's Trevor Ariza. I can see the confusion though, McGrady changed his number from his usual 1 to 3 for that season.  The commentators also mention it saying ""Curry can take Trevor Ariza off the dribble""."
the shotmaking of devin booker and the luggage packing of trevor ariza
"""2 guys who almost beat the Warriors"" You're talking about James Harden and Trevor Ariza right? Because Kawhi ended Curry's dynasty in 6 lol"
"Trevor Ariza isn’t a player, he’s a form of currency"
"Trevor Ariza, no team wants to keep Trevor Ariza but every team wants to trade for Ariza"
Keep that same energy.  All this Lakers trash talk is going to be funny. Don't start complaining when we waxing the league with Oldheadz.  *How you a Trevor Ariza fan hating on the team he plays for?
"AD is great. The linchpin  Bron is great but is going to pick his spots and might laze on some plays.  [Bazemore](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/8/6/22613809/lakers-officially-sign-kent-bazemore-free-agency-contract-took-less-money-win) is good on defense.  Dwight is situational.  [Trevor Ariza](https://allucanheat.com/2021/03/17/miami-heat-rumors-trevor-ariza-great/2/) might still be good at defense, despite a decline.  Nunn has [potential](https://allucanheat.com/2021/01/26/miami-heat-3-reasons-keep-kendrick-nunn/2/) on defense  Monk has his pluses and minuses  THT is weak on defense, DeAndre weak on rim protection, Westbrook inattentive, Mello has typically not been great, Rondo old and weak on defense  However, Vogel has been a defensive focused coach, and everyone right now seems to be team focused, rather than self-focused, so the Lakers have a chance to be good on defense. There's likely going o be a lot of ""next man up"" as Vogel has a tendency to try different looks in the regular season and a lot of these guys are not 30 mpg players"
"Honestly there's a lot of unique reasons this is happening now and likely not too happen often. First there's a lot of older players who are still surprisingly good for their age who have already made their money so are willing to either join on minimums or they're on their final year of contract so they figure it's worth it to get bought out for a portion of their contract in order to get a chance to win. Once all these talented young guys start getting paid big, they won't be able to for teams like this because nobody is willing to take a paycut to make it fit. It's just a strange situation with great timing and maneuvering on 2 teams parts that's not gonna happen to this extent for a while. And who knows maybe this isn't even a big deal. A lot of these guys are gonna flop because we don't know if they're that great anymore. LMA is coming back from a sketchy retirement so who knows how he'll be plus Blake isn't that great. Trevor Ariza, DJ, and  a few other old guys on our team are pretty washed so it's not like they're a game changer. So I know I ranted a bit but I just wanted to explain why I don't think this is a big deal"
"We were the number 3 offense in the nba starting Hassan whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and Trevor Ariza. Tell me dame isn’t a good playmaker. We are a top 3 offense every year"
"That's *really* disrespectful to the Rockets.  They were a fantastic team that would have won it all at least once if the Warriors didn't exist. That's not because they were all scrubs except for Harden... I've seen LeBron come close to that level of carry job, and Harden did not play at that level. Players like PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza were both important cogs of championship rosters, Dwight Howard and CP3 are still very good players years later, and so on."
"??????? Bonzi Wells??? Trevor Ariza? There's a reason why ""contract year"" is a thing. A ton of players go 100% during their contract year to get a big extension then coast."
"Woah TREVOR ARIZA HAS EARNED ~1/3 of LeBrons career earnings LOL. That means he should be Worth 1/3 of LeBrons approximate value. It's crazy how much more the top tier of the NBA should be paid when you consider that guys like Ariza ( no disrespect to Ariza) are worth 1/3, you'd think they are worth 1/4."
Trevor Ariza. Dude hasn’t been good since we let him go
"hmm you're right, it was reported that he signed a $15 million/1 year deal with phoenix but for whatever reason, [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/trevor-ariza-2513/cash-earnings/) has his earnings at $5.08m.  he only played 26 games that year so maybe it wasn't fully guaranteed"
The fact that Trevor Ariza has earned more in his career than Rondo seems so weird to me
"And the thing everyone seems to forget about that 2008 championship was that it came against a Laker team that was missing Andrew Bynum and Trevor Ariza due to injuries, both of whom were starters and key players on their 2009 championship team."
"Expanding to two years would do wonders for Washington, since we’d get to add Michael Jordan and Moses Malone.   With just one year we’ve got:  - Russell Westbrook  - Mike Miller  - Paul Pierce  - Charles Oakley  - Dwight Howard  Bench: Isaiah Thomas, Mike Bibby, Trevor Ariza  Prime Westbrook+Pierce+Howard is nice, but yeah this team could really use Jordan and Malone to be contenders."
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
Team is old lol. Trevor Ariza joins if you make it top 100 and Rondo just barely misses
Trevor Ariza
I fg about Anderson lol. I thought them not keeping Trevor Ariza was huge.
Shout out Trevor Ariza
"Respectfully, it took a freak occurrence of 27 missed threes on top of CP3’s major injury for them to be put away by Golden State. The Cavaliers were nowhere close to the level of either team, and as much as I respect Lebron as a player I don’t think he’s going to fare better than he did against the Warriors that year. The wing defense and rim protection was amazing, and it was the last we saw of both Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza as high level role players."
"Harden was the best player on the 2015 team sure, but he didn't carry scrubs to the playoffs lmao, dwight hoard, trevor ariza, pat bev, a young capela. It was a solid team, yeah kd was probably better than steph in the 2019 houston series, but steph then swept the conference finals without KD. Kd vs steph is a hard one but ahrden is obviously the worse of the three"
"Well, there is the famous story about how Lebron's team played Trevor Ariza's in high school, and at the time Ariza was like the top high school player in the west. Ariza came in looking to put Lebron in his place, but Lebron put up 52 in that game to Trevor's 12 in a blow out. I seem to remember Ariza saying afterward that it was really demoralizing or something like that."
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
Trevor Ariza? Where have I been lol
"They are not the best  choices I would choose but reality most like these guys will guard them   &amp;#x200B;  Trevor Ariza, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, BRON , RUSS"
"For me, the only excuse for us would be injuries to Lebron or AD, maybe Westbrook.   Im not gonna be making excuses if we have an injured Carmelo or Dwight or Trevor Ariza"
"I only think it’s cockiness if he can’t back it up. Otherwise I’d say it’s confidence. People hate anyways, might as well embrace it.   He’s gotten a lot of hate but he’s a baller. Even when he nutmegged Trevor Ariza in that Portland game, I thought it was hilarious.   I like fundamental basketball as much as the next guy, but damn young is a spectacle"
Damn Trevor Ariza was such a solid role player back then.
"Look, we can admit Bam had a horrible playoff series against the Bucks and his jump shot failing him and him losing confidence in it was one of the major factors as to why we lost that series. But that’s just one series. Bam’s jump shot has gotten better every season. His shooting percentage since his rookie year has increased roughly ~15% in ever shot distance bucket on basketball reference. And he’s also taking more and more of them from further out each season. And his scoring is has increased each season as well (up to 18.7, up 10 from just 2 years ago). So would I have liked to have seen Bam do better against the Bucks? Sure. But I’m not gonna overreact to him having a tough series against the best defense in the league and the eventual Champions, when also considering we’re running Trevor Ariza and Iggy out there next to him at PF. Especially when him and Dragic were the primary cogs in our playoff run to get to the Finals a year ago (Jimmy balled ooooouuut in the Finals, but Bam and Dragic were better in the first 3 rounds). Ben on the other hand? Bro, his coach, his organization, and his fan base have all given up on him because he has shown nearly zero growth in his shooting abilities or willingness to shoot, and he has never proven himself in the playoffs. The 76’ers are desperate to trade him for a more proven player so they don’t waste Embiid’s prime. Meanwhile the Heat are building around Bam as a franchise cornerstone, finally adding a good point guard to complement him, who can get him even more shots. Also, Simmons out here spending the off-season out here alienating himself from both the 76ers and Team Australia, while still probably not adding a jumper. I thought that was pretty pathetic that he didn’t play in the Olympics tbh, Australia was a medalist even without him and he’s supposed to be their best player. Bam is out there starting for team USA. Bam is by far the more valuable player, with a better trajectory so far, and he’s also just way more humble and like-able"
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Westbrook (if you count him wanting to get traded here), Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, PJ tucker   Plenty of good NBA players choose to play here and enjoy the city. Tucker had his bucks championship party in Houston."
I honestly only see Trevor Ariza and Marc Gasol retiring after the season.   Guys like Melo and Dwight seem to still love the game to hang it up but I’ll give both of them like 2-3 years left.
"Pels  PG: CP3, Lonzo  SG: Jrue, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield  SF: Trevor Ariza,  Solo Hill....  PF: Anthony Davis, Aminu  C: Demarcus Cousins, Christian Wood  &amp;#x200B;  So probably Thunder."
"No one calling the Lakers old is saying they're old cause of their big 3 average age, lol.  It's the fact they signed...  Melo who is 37.  Trevor Ariza who is 36.  Marc Gasol who is 35.  Dwight who is 35.  Wayne Ellington who is 33.   Kent Bazemore who is 32.   LeBron who is 36.   Westbrook who is 32."
"I mean, Harden lead a team with either Eric Gordon or Trevor Ariza, however you'd like to slice it, to the 3rd seed in a ridiculous Western Conference. I think people overestimate how much better Houston was compared to OKC. Houston still had the better roster, but OKC was also just geared more towards defensive basketball than Houston."
Pelicans:  Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday   Trevor Ariza  Anthony Davis  Demarcus Cousins
If it’s Ray Allen team 1 if it’s Trevor Ariza team 2
Team 2 in 4. In this scenario Shane Battier and Trevor Ariza is like bringing a spork and a butchers knife to a gun fight
Trevor Ariza is unfair to give to team one. I'm taking team 2.
Well we know where Trevor Ariza is going to line up this year😂 crazy he made the list
"Ahh yes, a list with NBA legends such as Dirk, LeBron, and Trevor Ariza"
Every time I forget about Trevor Ariza he manages to show up somewhere. He's like a bad penny
"Harden was still far more efficient when he was playing with Josh smith, Corey Brewer, the corpse of Jason Terry, half a season of dwight, trevor ariza, Terrence Jones, and Joey dorsey and harden still took his team to WCF and 2nd seed and won players vote for MVP. In 2019 Paul went down and harden averaged 40 for the rest of the season with g leaguersHarden is the better player no matter what the situation"
They were close because of *him*. Even with the shit officiating he was putting up big games and Trevor ariza went 0-12 in game 7. You just won’t beat a team of 4 allstars when your star PG is on the bench and ariza goes 0-12.  Harden is far and away better then iverson. You’re literally the only one in this thread who disagrees
"Only Lakers fans are delusional enough to think Trevor Ariza and and Andrew Bynum were elite players and that scraping by by 4 in a game 7 is a convincing ass kicking like you seem to think. The Lakers gave up in 08, were gifted a Finals vs the soft af Magic in 09, and then came out on top in a series about as equal as could be.  Yet in your head that makes them head and shoulders above the Celtics when that’s just false."
PJ Tucker and Markieff Morris are considerably better at boxing out than Andre Igoudala and Trevor Ariza.
[Reminded me of Trevor Ariza](https://youtu.be/8U77N7FjhdU)
"They also sold their own first rounder to us, (Rudy Fernandez) who was absolutely awesome before Trevor Ariza bush leagued him, fucking up his back, derailing his career and motivating him to return to Spain.   Rudy was awesome for the first two seasons with us."
We calling Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington important now?
And they beat a Lakers team that was missing Andrew Bynum and Trevor Ariza.
Trevor ariza
Trevor Ariza
I think if reddish become a solid Trevor ariza type player the hawks win both
"Bradley beal and John wall. Randy wittman was bad enough, then they made it even worse by bringing in Scott brooks thinking that it would somehow attract Durant, when in reality Durant already knew how bad of a coach brooks was and knew he wasn’t a guy he could win with, so you wasted five years of these guys on a stupid coaching hire that did the complete opposite of what you thought it would do, not to mention all the stupid ass personnel moves by grunfeld during his tenure like giving Ian mahinmi 4/64 trading Kelly Oubre for the corpse of Trevor ariza and plenty of other terrible decisions I’ve blocked out of my memory. Grunfeld and wittman/brooks did everything they could to thwart this team and wall and beal still drug them to the playoffs every year. Scott got so thoroughly outcoached by Brad Stevens in the Celtics series when John hit that game winner in game 6 to extend the series that it makes me puke every time I think about it. John played through wear and tear injuries for years and now he’s too broken down to be a consistently effective player, and I’m praying the new management has enough sense to make good on what we have left from beal, returns are positive so far but guh what a waste of mainly John walls tremendous potential"
Are y’all really relying on Trevor ariza???
Oh im sure Talen Horton Tucker and Trevor Ariza will save your season  /s
"Losing Caruso (and KCP) and replacing them with the corpse of Trevor Ariza + Kendrick Nunn was uh... not a good move, to say the least. Nunn has never been close to the defender KCP or Caruso are. Ariza was literally unplayable in the playoffs (but the Heat had to play him because he was the only other wing they had). Ariza *is not a good player anymore.* This idea that the Lakers are favorites in the West just because they got Russ and a bunch of poor fitting pieces is lunacy to me. They might win a lot of games, if healthy. But I dont think I'd pick them over the Jazz, Suns, and certainly not over a healthy Nuggets team (with Jamal Murray at at least 85% operational ability)."
no trevor ariza is out doesn't count LOL
Trevor Ariza would like a word…
"Trevor Ariza is the reason why the Lakers beat Denver in '09 which led to LA beating Orlando. So in summary, Ariza's Lakers &gt; Dwight's Magic"
True. But it is a different story to force the switch and find PJ Tucker there instead of Trevor Ariza.
Can you imagine if Trevor Ariza is healthy and the Lakers win and Kobe 3 peats again giving hkm 6 rings... damn
"Pierce wasn't the best player on that 2008 Celtics team, he just got lucky with his matchup. KG was going against Pau and Odom, Ray Allen was going against Kobe, and because Trevor Ariza was out with a broken foot Pierce went against Vlad Radmanovic. Is that really enough to put Pierce ahead of AD?"
"Yep. Pierce was definitely not the best player on the 2008 Celtics, he just won that FMVP because he was fortunate in his matchup. KG had to go against Pau and Odom, and Ray Allen was matched up with Kobe. Pierce, meanwhile, was matched up against snowboarding aficionado Vlad Radmanovic because Trevor Ariza was out with a broken foot."
Russell Westbrook on the Wizards  Maybe soon: Kyle Kuzma on the Wiz  Can't forget Trevor Ariza on the Blazers.  (basically anyone who's ever been a Laker for a long time is despised)
Fournier is a baller. I don't get the point of this post.  Who cares if he outscored a bunch of washes and bums.  Trevor Ariza wasn't even suited btw.
W but I scored the same amount as trevor ariza lol
"&gt; Avery and Ariza are lockdown D.  Trevor Ariza is not a lockdown defensive player at almost 36.5 years of age.  Is he better than his peers at that age?  Yeah, probably, but zero people should say he's a lockdown defender.  He's not."
"simmons isnt in the club of old NBA stars that get way highly rated by other players even when the stats show they arent that good anymore  carmelo is in this club though  even dwight howard maybe in this club  trevor ariza is not quite a star, but he fits the mold"
"Ah yes I forgot how elite Trevor Ariza, THT, and Nunn are. Meanwhile the Warriors were missing Wiseman, Klay, and Kuminga"
"Melo is a perfectly fine winning player if you just need a bench sparkplug to get you points. Offense flagging, team’s stalled out, opposition on a 9-0 run, star locked up, you put Melo in to get you a bucket. It’s the role he played on the Blazers, and the same role LouWill, Clarkson, and Jamal Crawford play, just a bit taller. But Melo isn’t a spot-up shooter, and he’s not good enough on defense or efficient enough to be a starting role player- players like Jae Crowder, Danny Green, Marcus Morris, or prime Trevor Ariza are much better in this niche."
or trevor ariza

"Over the last 20 seasons, just 8 players have averaged at least 14 points, 5 rebounds and 2 steals while shooting 40+% from 3 through their first 16 games.  They are: Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Paul George, Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and… OG Anunoby"
"Trevor Ariza has been both a former Laker on the Wizards and a former Wizard on the Lakers, same with Dwight"
"Definitely - ESPECIALLY IF HE PLAYS IN YOUR FUCKING ARENA!!!! And it's not like he was some obvious Hansbrough type that dominated the kinds of guys he'd never face at the next level. Bridges had incredibly projectible skills that made it almost a guarantee he'd be a solid role player on a good team. This good, this quick was a surprise and credit to Mikal, but it was pretty goddamn clear that he'd at least be a slightly smaller Trevor Ariza."
"What was his supporting cast like that season?  - He had Dwight Howard who averaged less than 14 PPG   - Trevor Ariza was solid, but still averaged only 12.7 PPG   Everyone else averaged less than 10 PPG   Patrick Beverly, sophomore Clint Capela, and Donatas Motiejūnas who was out of the league half way into next season.   In terms of a season drop off, Kawhi Leonard took a big jump and the Spurs were great. OKC who was injured in 2015 was healthy"
"I’m sorry our 4th best player was either Carmelo Anthony or Trevor Ariza and youre laughing at Oubre? Ooookayy bud, whatever you say   Not to mention our 3rd best was Hassan whiteside compared to Andrew Wiggins."
"I think this is what OP is looking for, but gonna point out in case they missed it that this is leading scorers *not* most efficient. Trevor Ariza is *not* one of the three most efficient corner 3 shooters in league history."
"LMAO the offball shit, yeah defenders are cheating off Harden leaving him open and helping to guard Trevor Ariza (the 2nd best scorer of the Rockets) that series  Stop it, they literally won games without Curry in the playoffs when he was injured"
"“Much better team” my ass lmfao he had Trevor ariza and Ryan anderson. He had more offense OKC had more defense. The difference was harden being the better individual player by a size able amount.   Also, the rockets were predicted to finish behind you before that season started. The westbrook MVP narrative with no KD had formed and carried on to give him the award even though harden was clearly more deserving"
Their closest analogue to those two is Trevor Ariza lol
Damn I’m late af but hopefully mine still makes it.  I met the late great Kobe Bryant. I was at his camp in 07-08. After one of the practices my dad comes by and is like “wanna meet Kobe?” Of course I’m like “fuck yeah father!” Then he walks me over to Kobe and I’m literally starstruck because he was my idol. I honestly couldn’t believe I was standing next to him and I could barely manage to get anything out. I only remember saying “youll win next year.”  Lakers proceeded to 2peat. I also met Trevor Ariza and Ronnie Turiaf but my dad didn’t have his camera. Trevor was dope af and shook my hand.  [Pics or it didn’t happen](https://imgur.com/a/hZdeLW9)  I met a few other players and coaches too. I have some embarrassing stories about meeting them. I met Drummond in Vegas. I met Nikola and Marcus Morris. I also met Rick Carlisle in Dallas.
"Most shocking part of that statement is that it's not the old guys getting hurt, except for Trevor Ariza"
"i was wondering how this work out, but the basketball gods might be leaning towards a warriors victory, with trevor ariza and THT out for sure (malik monk is also injured but aiming to return for the opener).  but who knows what could happen in 8 days. &gt;.&gt;"
"Guys like Ariza are an injury waiting to happen. If you're signing a Trevor Ariza at this point in his career, it's understanding that he's going to miss 20-30 games in the regular season. If it's only 15, you can be thankful. If it's 40, eh, it was slightly bad luck. It does suck for them about THT though, although even there injuries to younger players happen as well and when you're riding in with a team full of guys whom you know are going to miss time, well, them's the breaks when the guys whom you don't expect do so as well."
Their young players like up and comer Trevor Ariza
"Does many ginobilli count? Probably not but for sure the best 6th man of all time.   JJ Redick comes to mind. He’s had a crazy successful career and carved a great niche for himself.   Lastly Trevor Ariza has to be up there. Good wing defender, solid shooting, decent enough passing."
"Gotta be this.   Would also like to add James Posey, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Jackson, Kyle Korver and Mike Miller."
"The warriors won 67 games in 2015 not just Curry. The rockets won 56 games and got the 2 seed with Harden putting up better numbers then Steph. Dwight missed half the season, Pat bev missed 26 games. Harden’s best teammate for most of the year was Trevor Ariza averaging 12 PPG yet they still were only 1 seed behind those warriors. If the takeaway was the warriors won more games so Steph deserved MVP, then Harden should have won in 2017. But the takeaway in 2017 was carrying with less talent is truly “most valuable” so Russ won. But that logic would mean Harden should have won in 2015. No matter which way it goes there’s no subjective way Harden should have walked away with 0 MVPS for 2015 and 2017."
"Trevor Ariza is a special case. Dude has been a 30+ min starter on multiple championship-level teams in LA and Houston. He has played over 1000 games (already top 100 all-time in games played) and started in over 750 of them.   He's not a star but for a solid decade plus every team knew that he contributed to winning basketball games. He is the prototypical 3 and D guy.  I admit he's a journeyman (probably the greatest journeyman ever), but he's not a fringe player at all."
well that ain't true at all. Trevor Ariza a fringe player and been on 6 different teams in the past 3 years but someone always wants his services
Yea because fucking Trevor ariza getting hurt is what that means 😭
"If last season taught me anything, it’s to not put your season’s hopes on a washed Trevor Ariza."
"It's such a weak argument to start it off with saying ""did you watch him play?"" To answer your question, yes I did watch him play. Furthermore I watched him lose to the Kings in the first round in 01. Did you know AK-47 was overall -2 while on the floor in the series? Did you also know his primary defensive assignment was Peja? Did you also know that Peja averaged 14 ppg during the regular season and during the playoffs with the defensive master AK-47 on him he ended up averaging 22pg? How about the following year when they met the Kings again in the playoffs AK-47 was overall a -4 while on the floor. Did you also know that AK-47 once again guarded Peja throughout the series? Did you know that Peja averaged 19ppg during the regular season, and during the playoffs he averaged 20ppg once again with the defensive master AK-47 guarding him? AK-47 averaged over 30 minutes a game during both series losses against the Kings. I can continue if you'd like....During the 2007 playoffs the Jazz lost to the Spurs. AK-47 primarily guarded the offensive minded Bruce Bowen. During the regular season Bruce Bowen averaged 6ppg, During the playoffs against the Jazz he averaged 8ppg. Also AK-47 was overall a -7 during that playoff series.  During 08 the jazz lost to the Lakers, AK-47 was overall a -7 again and he primarily guarded Lamar Odom. In 09 the Jazz lost to the lakers again. This time AK-47 guards Trevor Ariza, was an overall a-9 in that series. To keep it simple, the defensive master              AK-47 during playoff series his team lost was overall a negative asset. The person he guarded averaged more points against him then their regular season averages. So I guess I am confused how he is considered a defensive master? I will wait patiently for your response."
"Not at all. That's why you saw Heat fans last season ranting and raving about Trevor Ariza being a ""great shooter"" because he was shooting 37% from 3.   They can't extrapolate that 37% on 3 attempts is 1 on average per game.   The problem people don't understand with basketball maths is that it is EXTREMELY contextual and why people like Deandre Jordan are shit players despite having good stats."
Rather die than start the Corpse of Trevor Ariza.
Rajon Rondo/Mac McClung/Wes Matthews/Trevor Ariza/DeAndre Jordan  That’s the Lakers garbage time lineup in this years game 6 finals clinching win.
Trevor Ariza in a list with LeBron and Carmelo is lol.
Trevor Ariza
"You don't lose those from the vaccine...  Wear a dental dam when you date a Kardashian, my man. That thing's been in more NBA locker rooms than Trevor Ariza."
"Manu played every game in that series and averaged his normal mpg for those 5 games. The Lakers were entirely without Andrew Bynum for the whole series, Trevor Ariza was only able to play 10 total minutes in that series due to a broken foot, and [Kobe was playing with a finger on his shooting hand which had been fractured and suffered a torn ligament.](http://20secondtimeout.blogspot.com/2008/09/kobe-bryant-and-most-famous-pinkie.html?m=1) But you want to act like the Lakers were at full strength while the Spurs were not?"
"If he had a couple more inches, he would have been a premier 3&amp;D guy who hangs around on rosters forever (see: Trevor Ariza is still in the league). Instead, he's sorta been in NBA purgatory for what feels like a couple years now and is probably done playing meaningful minutes"
"Aaron Mintz (agent) and the Lakers don't have a good working relationship historically.   &gt;Traded away: D'Angelo Russell, Josh Hart  &gt;Left in FA: Julius Randle, Trevor Ariza  He also represents Paul George who blue balled the Lakers in the past by saying 'do not trade for me' then saying he was disappointed that the Lakers didn't trade for him.   &gt;https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1013910550974222337?s=21  &gt;Eric Pincus: The Lakers' relationship with Aaron Mintz of CAA was not a fruitful one - poor mutual experience with D'Angelo Russell, Lakers' prioritized cap room over an extension for Randle, benched him, etc. - George didn't give Lakers a meeting. It's all connected and apparently over  &gt;"
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
Trevor Ariza.         I was thrilled every time he came to the Rockets because he was the one I feared when he was a Laker.
"I mean yeah for star players, sure. LeBron, AD, Westbrook individually have an incentive to play for it. How the hell are you going to convince Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza to play hard so that another younger guy gets a shot at replacing them?"
"- LeBrOptimus 6th Prime James,  - Carmelo Anthony,  - Wayne Ellington,  - Kent Bazemore, - Trevor Ariza,  - Malik Monk,  - Talen Horton-Tucker,   Lakers wing depth those wondering."
It's pretty amazing if Trevor Ariza is really still a starting-on-a-championship-contender level player.
"Cam Reddish’s realistic upside is PG.  He has that theoretical upside in terms of a fluid 3 and D player but his realistic absolute upside at this moment is Trevor ariza with some sauce off the bounce a little, which is still really good and extremely valuable."
CP3- Isaiah Thomas/Tony Parker  Booker- Klay/ Danny Green  Bridges- Otto Porter/Trevor Ariza/Middleton   Jae Crowder- PJ Tucker  Ayton- Demarcus Cousins/ David Robinson  I’d like this team
thats like your opinion man  but trevor ariza does suck
Can you not objectively say lebron James is a better player than Trevor ariza?
"Yes. Go on Youtube and look up the trevor ariza game. He played Trevor in hs and Trevor talked shit and it was over.  The craziest thing about lebron in hs is how much he just looks like lebron. At the time he was smaller so people compared him to a kobe or mj body type. They didn't know tank lebron would happen.  And the mental game! His team was not ranked #1 in the nation, his teammates were not like Sierra canyon with a bunch of NBA dudes. He made all of his teammates better. He could have scored 70 points a game but he didn't. He wanted to create a team and a winning environment.  He was sooooo fast. Just impossibly fast."
"Ryan had awful takes, but he didn't actually believe any of them.  Perk actually thinks the Lakers can win 65+ games this season because of the depth added by Trevor Ariza."
how did the Lakers do that one year Lebron missed 20 games? Lebron will still be eating up 35% of their salary cap so the alternative would be more Trevor Ariza
"Home and numbers bias aside, most posters seem super low on Westbrook despite how good he really is. He seems to start off slowly every season and then ramp it up after several games.       I think it's underestimated just how tough it is to even have the ability to play one minute of NBA basketball, let alone 34 per game. I mean, Trevor Ariza(barring injury) seems to get the most minutes on every team he's on and I'm sure most would choose Westbrook over him.      I totally agree that you can't just plug him in and expect success, but every team *should* want him. Even if he were just half as good as he is, he has to be at least as good as the fifth best player on every team, right?"
Lakers fans really out here expecting 36 year old Trevor Ariza to save them. Dude has been washed for years.
"Dwight Howard, Clint Capella, Josh Smith, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza is by himself?"
"What the Lakers need is to tell Anthony Davis that they need him to be that center.   They need to look at the Heat with Bam, Butler and Lowry and be like AD, James and Westbrook should be a better version of that.   I think that was the game plan but Trevor Ariza injury had stopped that lineup as I think he was going to play a PJ Tucker/Jae Crowder type of role."
"Look, it's dumb to have expectations for a washed Trevor Ariza, but I guess you can make an argument that the Lakers still start big because they have very little forward depth (Lebron who was hurt half the season and Melo). Then again, doesn't explain why Deandre, a terrible player in the last 3/4 years, starts over Dwight who is a decent center still"
Trevor Ariza is not saving the Lakers.
Not when you rely on 36 year old Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn to fix that defense lmao.
"I'm guessing by the username: LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Carmelo, THT, Austin Reaves, Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn (when they come back), Wayne Ellington, and LeBron again."
Harden used to do this to trevor ariza repeatedly
"I don't think you realize you are still doing this.  Bucks performed about as expected dealing with the injuries they've had. It sucked losing but at the same time, our starters have combined for 54 games missed (Donte 20, BroLo 19, Khris 8, True 6, Giannis 1) but with just our top 3 we're 8-0 winning by an average of 15 per game., Lakers should be like .750 given their expectations and creampuff schedule despite injuries. You guys were missing Trevor Ariza and got served by the Kings. Injuries aren't the Lakers' biggest problem, and the issues with the Lakers aren't the same as other 'underperforming' contenders."
Oh boy! I can’t wait till 80 year old Trevor Ariza and Kendrick “black hole” Nunn come to save the day. Lol
"Imagine someone told you a team with Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rondo, Trevor Ariza and Avery Bradley lost to the Kings"
"To be fair, We are indeed the Lakers. Also, Trevor Ariza is gonna magically save our season once he returns from injury"
"Alright, I give in already. You mf'ers are really gonna make me look up the age of Trevor Ariza"
And they’re counting on Trevor Ariza and nunn and THT to save them lol THT!?
"Trevor Ariza was an amazing glue guy for the Showtime Lakers, amazing thats he's still a very important cog on the team at the ripe age of 59"
“I think I’m good now actually” - Trevor Ariza
dont worry when Trevor Ariza comes back you guys will be the 96 Bulls
First it was a Laker flair then a Spurs flair.  Waiting on someone with either Robert Horry or Trevor Ariza in their name to copy pasta this at this point.
Rajon Rondo  Derek Fisher   Trevor Ariza  LeBron James  Mutumbo
"Yeah you can scrap together a contender if 10 ppg or less with Prime Lebron. You got the lineups already included on the thread but other players can be prime Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Harkless, Larry Nance Jr., PJ Tucker, Marcus Smart is towing the line, Reggie Bullock and the like and scrounge up a decent core of prime 3 and d core around prime Lebron to contend. You can also look at old players that declined and had a couple bad season that dragged their career below 10ppg but they are actually better then that."
"Man I still go back to check on the Kings to see how they are run hopeful that they turn the corner and what meets me? Failure. Cousins looks like an all star? Fire the coach he likes and precede to piss of Cousins. They jump all the way to the second pick with Luka, my number 1 prospect in that draft guess they better take Bagley. Oh they look somewhat decent with Joerger and Fox? Turns out Joerger is an a-hole and gets fired and replaced with Walton. The Kings win 39 games and look to grow? They sign Barnes to a market value contract and overpay Cory Joseph, Dewayne Dedmon, and Trevor Ariza to make a playoff push. I want the Kings to be good in fact I want them to be great but all I see is a trail of memes and the KANGZ all steps of the way. Now Simmons is available and they won’t consider trading like the 15th best point guard in Fox and a decent if unspectacular prospect like Haliburton. Haliburton is unlikely to be even top 10 pint guard in his prime with the amount of PG talent that flows through the draft."
Trevor ariza refused to play for okc but nobody gave a shit lol
"High school game on prime time national TV (ESPN) vs #1 Westchester. 1st points of game, Trevor Ariza blows by him and dunks. ""Lebron's over rated"". Lebron scores 52 points in rout doing everything. 3s, dunks, assists, boards. Everything. ""OMG. this is the best high school player since Kareem, they ain't lying"""
Frank loves defense over Offense it's why he plays Bradley over Monk a lot.   Trevor last year was solid for the Heat before the playoffs on both sides. I expect Ariza to get more minutes at 3/4 than Melo unless Melo is scoring really nicely
"Yeah man, 28th ranked defense gonna be helped by Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Lakers are a borderline play-in team at this point."
"Tillman was going to go into the tax, just not for Trevor Ariza. Ariza’s contract with the Suns was a huge overpay  If we landed Butler in that trade that almost went through, we would’ve been paying luxury tax.  I do not blame him for not going into the tax for guys like Ariza, Garrett Temple and JaMyChal Green.  The window closed the moment CP3 looked washed in 2019 because Ariza, Green and Temple were not gonna save us  Tillman’s start as an owner was bad but I don’t blame him for this.   Everyone wanted Silas and it looked like a great hire at the time. He was heralded as the genius behind the Mavs historic offense  Also IIRC Stone wanted Silas not Tillman (he wanted JVG while Harden wanted Lue)"
Trevor Ariza was washed 4 years ago when the Wizards traded for him. His return isn't going to do shit.
"“Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.”"
"I know it was probably before you were born, but Trevor Ariza played for the Lakers from 2007-2009."
honestly is trevor ariza in the year 2021 and nunn gonna impact this team THAT much? they seem so off
Complete list of players who can play power forward on the Lakers roster:  Trevor Ariza (injured)  LeBron James (suspended)  Carmelo Anthony (doesn't play defense)  Anthony Davis  ---  I'd keep him at the 4 for the time being.
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
"I didn’t say the whole offense would be designed around him, I just said that he would be the leading scorer, which he probably would be if he was starting alongside CP3, Gobert, and let’s say Danny Green and Trevor Ariza since 2017-2018 was the year I was looking at."
It reminded me of the Clippers vs Rockets fight back in January 2018. The next match up was supposed to be so interesting but then Blake Griffin got traded and Austin Rivers ended up apologizing to Trevor Ariza over the phone Lmao
Oh boy I can’t wait until *checks notes*  Old ass Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn bring the Lakers a Championship lol
"Don't worry guys, the Lakers are missing substantial pieces like Trevor Ariza. They just need some more time to gell."
just wait 35 year old lakers legend trevor ariza is gonna come off IR and fix the lakers defense
"Guys dont worry, 36 year old Trevor Ariza coming back from injury will be the X Factor"
Giannis 3-4 inches shorter without the strength and no offense is Trevor Ariza lite. I think he was drafted right where he belonged for that.
"Too bad he couldn't stay healthy, Trevor Ariza is still playing at age 49 and Parsons probably could have had a similar career arc"
That’s not the point. Trevor Ariza has 70k and he’s played on 11 teams including the Lakers multiple times and being an nba champion. Kanter has over 500k as a career bench warmer.
I am very here for Lakers fans convincing themselves that Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza are the answer
"Feels Bey is going to have a Trevor Ariza type career, just good enough of a player that makes just enough to be part of salary matching for an All Star."
I heard Kendrick Nunn and 90-year-old Trevor Ariza are the keys that will turn this into a championship squad.
But the Lakers were missing 36 yr old trevor ariza who couldve slowed down Tatum tonight!  /s
Wait for 2009 Trevor Ariza. hahaha
lmao at thinking Trevor Ariza will save your season
"ah yes, 36 year old Trevor Ariza was the X-factor all along!"
You can't really judge the Lakers until we get Trevor Ariza back and one month of gel time.
Trevor Ariza
"Nah Morey was regularly taking extreme advantage of tiny loopholes in the CBA to get you new players/get under the tax without hurting the team. Hell he basically magically got Chris Paul on the team for like two rotation players, a pick, and some tax cheat codes.  He also picked a phenomenal coach, and worked with him to create a entirely new offensive system that everyone on the sub complained “solved the game”.  He also accomplished, you know, the best trade in Basketball history.  During the Warriors era, he was regularly finding players that were severely underrated that he stitched together into a team that was of near equivalent quality as the best team in history. (PJ Tucker, Capela, Gordon, Trevor Ariza, Austin Rivers, etc).  He’s easily a top three GM in the game right now"
It’s painfully obvious the Lakers are really missing Trevor Ariza rn
"Role players tend to make great coaches better than star players, so as total speculation, I could see someone like Trevor Ariza - a guy with good connections and relationship skills given how many teams he's played for, and someone who's defensive-minded - working out really well as a coach if he ever gave it a go."
Trevor Ariza or Mario Chalmers would be a floor raiser for them.
"&gt; I feel like him nearly flunking out of college was a red flag before he even got into the nba. Wasn’t he disqualified from the Wooden award because of his low GPA?  Eh, Derrick Rose cheated on the ACTs and he was fine in the NBA, work ethic-wise. Trevor Ariza left UCLA because he was flunking out, and there's been no issues with his NBA work ethic either.   It's more of a Simmons-specific thing than an ""Anyone who gets bad grades in freshman year must be a lazy slacker"" thing.   Not everyone wants to go to college, and anytime you're basically forced to do something it takes all the fun out of it. Every week on reddit there's a post about ""I had to read (insert book) in school and I hated it, but now that I re-read it on my own, I love it."""
Cmon man we haven’t even seen Trevor Ariza play yet .
Putting hope on the corpse of Trevor Ariza. Bold move.
nah they were too busy with Wussel Eastbrick and Trevor Ariza
Andrew Bynum and Trevor Ariza don’t save you from getting your ass beat in game 6
"What does this have to do with being a homer? I'm just saying that he deserves to be in the league and shouldn't be benched for worse players like Avery Bradley. I agree that building a roster where the only perimeter defenders are Kent Bazemore and 36-year old Trevor Ariza coming off ankle surgery is asinine. Having to do that because you traded for 33-year old Russell Westbrook and cheaped out on luxury tax as the Lakers is even more asinine.  I'm always ready to shit on Rob Pelinka who I've considered a bottom 5 GM basically since he was hired or the Lakers ownership who tried to make Caruso feel bad for wanting what he's worth.   What I have an issue with is people underrating players who have memeable lowlights. Baze is a solid rotation player and a good defender despite a high foul rate for a perimeter player.   As far as Buddy is concerned, I don't really think that would've been a panacea. He's a high volume average efficiency scorer who is awful defensively. Not sure he'd be able to close games in the conference finals. Trading Kuzma+Harrell+pick for him would've been solid and kept KCP and Caruso but I would've liked to target someone with more two-way ability."
I just knew the Lakers weren’t shit without their star small forward: Trevor Ariza
"Rockets-  CP3, Harden, Russ, Melo, Kyle Lowry, Dragic, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, Clint Capela, Marcus Morris, Trevor Ariza, Oladipo, Boogie Cousins.  I think that should suffice."
Contact Year Trevor Ariza
"No because THT and nunn will be back to save them…..oh and old ass Trevor ariza.   Seriously tho, if you’re waiting on these guys to come save you…..you’re in trouble. Better get shit figured out with Westbrook."
fuck all of you when Trevor Ariza gets back healthy we are dominating.
I never assumed you didn’t watch games.   Your idea of good and my idea of good.   Him being the 5th best Laker or a starter is good in my opinion. Not sure what else you want Trevor Ariza to do.
Trevor Ariza is also 36 and hasn’t played well in over a year and a half… I’d be hesitant to write him in there as an upgrade over baze/Wayne/Bradley tbh
"I can’t believe I’ve seen some Lakers fans trying to excuse the move by saying they couldn’t afford him, or that the corpse of Trevor Ariza or THT are better than him. Most of the time I see Lakers fans being sad that they let him go tho"
"I love how other fans are butthurt thinking that it’s just about “buying other players.”   It’s so much more than that.   The Lakers’ most beloved superstar of the last three decades was a drafted player. Sure, they didn’t directly drafted them. But they targeted him as “their guy” and arranged for his acquisition through a draft swap.   Any team can just buy superstars. And doing that isn’t always the answer. Simply buying Kyrie or Westbrook leads you nowhere. Still, if you have cap space, you can approach any available player and say, “Here’s fuck loads of money.” Does being in a big market help? Sure. But New York and Chicago are big markets. They’ve sucked mostly my entire life. Boston is a big market. They have 1 championship in I think the post-Reagan era. The Bay Area is a big market, and the Warriors sucked until 6-7 years ago. Plenty of other big markets stink or have dry spells. Point is, a team has to sell more than just location and market. You have to be a well run organization, have good ownership, a good coach, a good bench, good role players. That’s how you really attract players. Being in LA or NY is just the icing on the cake if all things are equal.   If it’s as easy as just buying players, then why did the Lakers suck for 5 years with prime Kobe, and suck again for another 6 years between Kobe and LeBron? Failing to attract any superstars despite just being able to buy superstars? It’s because the team was poorly managed. And couldn’t just “buy superstars.” They tried. But their players were awful. And nobody wanted to play for them.   Also, the Lakers’ other best stars recently have been acquired through trades. Shaq and Gasol. You can’t make big trades if you don’t have assets. Which means that you need to draft desirable talent and develop them so that other teams will want them. Accrue draft picks that other teams want. Still have to be a well run organization to pull off a trade to give you the chance to sign the big superstar.   Lastly, the Lakers recent championship teams, besides being led largely by a guy drafted by the organization, and obviously stars like Shaq and Gasol, that’s still not enough to win. Players like Derrick Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Trevor Ariza, old Rondo, Alex Caruso, etc. were all critical to those championship teams. Literally would not have been won without them. And they are the products of good drafting and good scouting and good management who targets these guys on the market and in the draft.   The Lakers aren’t good because they’re in LA or rich. They’re good because they’ve largely been an extremely well run organization.   Like the Warriors are now. And like the Bucks are now. You don’t have to be a flashy team with big money in a big city to win. You can be San Antonio, or Milwaukee, and run a damn good team that players want to play for. The Milwaukee team is stacked. And that’s because they drafted well, developed well, and put together a team that other players wanted to play for.   Do you really think that New Orleans and Charlotte and Minnesota have been bad just because they’re smaller markets? Never mind that they also have money to “just buy stars”, they also completely squander the stars that they do get gifted through the draft. They hinder their teams with bad coaching hires. They blow opportunities by reaching for guys in the draft or overpaying average players. What has happened in Milwaukee and Golden State could be done by Minnesota. Or New Orleans. Or Charlotte. They’re not capped by geography or money. They’re capped by bad or cheap ownership.   The idea isn’t that you **have** to be LA to get stars. The idea is to **not** be New Orleans and botch literally every move you make after having Davis and Zion fall in your lap. The team is run like shit. It’s not a money or stars or location problem. It’s an organization problem. And there are awful organizations all over the league. In all sports. The Pittsburgh Steelers play in a pretty damn small market, with shit weather, in a random city. And yet they win year after year. Same goes for the St Louis Cardinals. Same goes for San Antonio for 20 years. You can find examples in any sport.   If New Orleans had built a good team around Davis and the team went on to win 60 games per year and attracted neutral fans with a fun brand and competed for titles every year, they’d attract quality players. Just like Milwaukee has.   And you could say the same for any scrub franchise around the league.   Nine times out of ten, a team is shit because they have bad ownership, a bad GM, and bad scouting. Not because they’re in a small market. That’s just an excuse to overlook the fact that an organization is run by clowns who use the small market teardrops to try to excuse their awful draft picks, their crippling free agent contracts, their rubbish coaching hires, and their subpar scouting.   Yeah, the Lakers have money to buy superstars. But they need to be well managed to begin with to attract them. When that’s not the case, the Lakers spent 6 years whiffing on literally every free agent that walked through their doors. If they were lucky to get a meeting at all. It doesn’t matter what market you’re in, how big your TV deals are, how large your fan base is…if you’re not a well run organization to begin with, you have no chance.   So it’s a lot more than just “buying superstars.” It’s only a truth that fans of shit teams hate hearing."
"Guy literally never shit talks anyone yet he is soft for looking at a ref sideways when bum ass trash cans like Trevor Ariza and Paul Reed talk to him and cheap shot him.  As always he gets his revenge by winning, like when he swept the garbage ass Heat last year."
Watch Trevor Ariza in the background starting around 40 seconds. It’s hilarious.
Why does Trevor Ariza look like he drives a Altima?
Trevor Ariza looks like he's part of a scooby doo episode.
Apparently Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza will save this team
"The Lakers look like this because they have so many people out right now. I feel like most people forget that Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza are actually part of this team, because they all got hurt in training camp and haven't yet played, but those three will all be major parts of the rotation once they're healthy. They'll be replacing many of the guys who were playing tonight. When you then add AD and LeBron to those guys on the sidelines, the Lakers roster tonight was Westbrook and everyone else is on a vet minimum. Guys who normally won't play at all were getting a lot of minutes tonight.   While all those guys are out injured, people should expect the Lakers to be this bad. They will still be bad even if AD comes back next game. I don't think there's any team in the league who can handle both their best player being out *and* a significant portion of their regular rotation being out. They either need THT and Nunn to come back or LeBron to come back, and until one of those things happens, I fully expect the Lakers to just be really bad. Those three all should be back in a couple weeks though, but the Lakers just need to try to weather the storm as best they can till that happens."
"It's not just LeBron and AD who are out though. The Lakers are also missing their other non-minimum players in Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn, along with Trevor Ariza. People might think those guys aren't great, but without them Melo was the only forward available tonight and Rondo was the only non-Westbrook ball handler for the Lakers. The Lakers desperately need their depth to get healthy along with their stars. With all the guys that are out right now, it really shouldn't be surprising that they're this bad."
"You need to look at who else is out hurt right now, as this is not even close to the Lakers full roster that's playing. Tonight other than Westbrook, every other player who played is on a vet min (except for the 7 minutes AD played with stomach flu). Out of the guys who played, two were two-way players, one is an undrafted rookie, two have non-guaranteed deals, and two were signed to the minimum after being bought out.   The Lakers are scraping the bottom of the barrel right now looking for anyone who can play because 5 of their 7-8 best players are out. So it's not just that the Lakers are missing LeBron and AD, they're also missing Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. There's not many teams that can survive without their best player or two *and* a big chunk of their core rotation. It shouldn't be surprising at all that the Lakers are this bad right now, given all their absences."
"I honestly don't know how anyone can say that for sure yet considering how much of it hasn't even played yet this year. The guys that were playing tonight, sure, that roster is bad, but most of those guys won't be getting minutes once the Lakers are healthy again.   There are 240 available minutes in an NBA game for each team, and right now the Lakers are missing 35 from LeBron, 35 from AD, 25 from Talen Horton-Tucker, 25 from Kendrick Nunn and 20 from Trevor Ariza. That's 140 of 240 total minutes which are out right now (or rather, they got 7 total from those guys tonight because that's all AD played). That's a lot of minutes going to two-way players, undrafted rookies, guys on non-guaranteed contracts, and people on the vet min instead.   So yeah, this lineup we saw tonight that was surrounding Westbrook was definitely bad. No doubt about it. But this isn't the roster the Lakers put in place this summer. This is just all that's left because everyone else is hurt."
"The Lakers definitely don't look good right now, but they have a ton of their core rotation out and have for the entire season. They need to get LeBron and AD back, of course, but they also need Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza to get healthy and finally suit up (none of them have played yet). As a Laker fan I can tell you that the losses or even the way they're playing doesn't bother me, it's the fact that we haven't seen even a close facsimile of what the team will look like once those guys are finally healthy. It's just sucked that they've missed 4-5 core rotation players for literally every game this season."
"Bradley was only picked up because Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker got injured in training camp (along with Trevor Ariza), and because his minimum contract is not guaranteed, so they can release him once the other guys are healthy (if they want to). And I imagine that Jordan will probably fall out of the rotation once the Lakers have Ariza and THT to play forward minutes (in addition to LeBron and Melo, of course), so the Lakers can slide AD back over to center most of the time.   The Lakers are just playing a ton of 9th-15th men on the roster right now because so much of the top 8 are all hurt. That team tonight was Westbrook and all guys on vet minimums. Nobody should expect a roster like that to be any good."
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
"What ? Donovan literally dropped 37 today haha, and man tried to sneak Trevor ariza in there lmao"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrgd5v184Xs  looking at the clip made me realize how lucky derozan got. if that connected he might have gotten a concussion.  also fuck trevor ariza
Trevor Ariza?
"You were better off without him.  Trevor Ariza is a much better defender on KD than LRMAM has ever been and either way Iggy is 3x the player LRMAM is.  If you wanted another person to miss 3's, sure.  That isn't a comeback, it's an irrelevant detail.  Again, you lost, your excuses don't matter.  You've shifted the argument so far from ""Harden doesn't get the calls he deserves"" because you have found out that it's an argument you can't support.  Just take the L."
Really? Somehow I missed Trevor Ariza being in that lineup.  Easy to miss him in 2018 when he was 0-9 from 3 in game 7...  But you'll have to find some evidence of what he was doing in 2019 for me to believe that he was on the team.
"The thing most people are missing is that much of what they replaced those guys with has yet to play a minute this season. The Lakers have yet to see even one second of play from Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn or Trevor Ariza this season, and two of those guys are likely starters with the third being the 6th or 7th man. They replaced KCP, Kuzma and Caruso largely with those guys and Melo and Westbrook, and since most of them haven't yet played, it's not surprising it looks like the Lakers are missing out."
Trevor Ariza isn’t saving you
Why is Trevor Ariza dressed like a bum
"Almost forgot - the year we desperately needed a starting PG, he signs Trevor Ariza (SF) to $15M/year contract."
"Kendrick Nunn, Trevor Ariza, and Wayne Ellington."
Out for tonight:  Wayne Ellington (knee)  Trevor Ariza (knee)  Lebron James (old)
Trevor Ariza and he's still going. Saw a clip of him the other day and thought he retired years ago.   I still remember his dunk on Jermaine O'Neal like it was yesterday.
"Hopefully trevor ariza will help the lakers, they desperately need wing defense"
"&gt;I mean, do you really want Trevor Ariza back though?   Yes, absolutely. With Ariza and THT out the Lakers are extremely thin on wings. I don't expect him to be 2009 Ariza, but even if he only plays 20 mpg, that would still be a big help. It's better than having to go big with DAJ just cause the Lakers literally don't have any wings."
"I mean, do you really want Trevor Ariza back though? That dude is washed af. He was literally useless in the playoffs for the Heat last year, and y'all were planning on starting him, IIRC.   It definitely is not a wrap though and they are so talented they'll find ways to win a ton of games. But we must be realistic too though that at the same time, the fit issues are real."
He’d start over Kent bazemore or Trevor Ariza and they were a top west team and probably will be. He’d start over will Barton too if you don’t wanna accept the warriors.
"I also have a poster of the Wizards schedule of December 2013, that my Dad got at a game. It has a photo of Trevor Ariza on it. Damn. I forgot I even had this lmao"
"Idk about that lol, we were still the third best offense in the nba starting Hassan whiteside Carmelo and Trevor Ariza. Were the second best offense in the league last year missing both CJ and Nurk for 30 straight games.  Pretty sure you could walk dame out there with just anyone and it would be a top 10 offense"
Trevor Ariza running it back in yellow
"Yeah, not gonna lie I was pretty relieved when I saw the personnel they had out there on that play once Dragic was running the inbound. With it having to be a catch and shoot play, you had Butler (not a good shooter the past couple seasons), Adebayo (not a shooter), Duncan Robinson (so help me this man better start missing next game), and Trevor Ariza (ok shooter but not spectacular this season) out as potential shooters. That's two guys I'm perfectly ok giving the last shot to, and another that isn't a ""defend him on the catch and shoot no matter what"" level guy. I think it makes way more sense to have one of either Bam or Butler running the inbound and moving Dragic to one of the potential inbound targets."
Great game. Miami played better I thought. Trevor Ariza is booty and should not be put on Giannis.
That's NBA Champion Trevor Ariza to you
"Trevor Ariza is an nba champ, he ain’t new to this."
It’ll always be funny Trevor Ariza was employed by OKC to get in shape to play for another team
Why is Trevor Ariza playing key playoff minutes in 2021
First very good coaching move by Bud in this series to hide Bryn Forbes on Trevor Ariza.
"Trevor Ariza is a bum, yikes"
"Spo, I love you man, but Duncan Robinson cannot guard Middleton, and Giannis might eat Trevor Ariza"
Oh Shit Trevor Ariza is still going?
"I think it'd be unfair to say something like ""The 2015/16 Rockets were worse, Harden deserves so much more credit"", this Warriors team is horrendous. Can you imagine how much Warriors fans would kill to ""only"" have Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard or Eric Gordon as the second best player? This team straight up can't score without Steph.   (Also because I got into basketball that playoffs, I hard disagree for 2015, Dwight played 41, sure, but come playoffs he mashed the Mavericks, and _with Harden on the bench_, he was the center axis of that insane comeback against the Clippers. He was, to a certain, real extent, the 2nd star. Its his last real Dwight season. To compare the first Rockets era to this Warriors team is revisionist)"
2016 his number 2 was Trevor Ariza.   2015 Dwight had back injuries   2019 everyone was hurt yet Rockets didn’t miss a beat cuz he averaged 40 ppg at a time.
"Austin's been kicked around the league a lot ever since Doc got stripped of GM duties in LA. Considering he's still young, an average shooter and working for the minimum, it kind of makes me think all the stuff some of his former teammates have said about him is true. He's had a handful of guys publicly call him out for being cocky and entitled, and one of the former Clippers broadcasters put out a statement that put a lot of blame on Austin for alienating everyone. Remember that time a couple years ago when he was in street clothes and pissed of Trevor Ariza so bad that Ariza got ejected and then tried to get to him in the locker room after the game? Players don't like being disrespected, especially by someone on his level.   He was unemployed for almost a month before the Nuggets signed him. Wouldn't be surprised if he's overseas somewhere next year. You only get so many chances in the league, and he's had more than most players his caliber."
Seven Degrees of Trevor Ariza
I feel like Trevor ariza gets traded almost once a year.
"Trevor Ariza connects Lebron, Darko, Carmelo and D-wade."
San Bowie&gt;Kenny Anderson&gt;Paul Pierce&gt;Blake Griffin&gt;Kevin Durant&gt;Steph Curry&gt;Andre Igoudala&gt;Trevor Ariza&gt;Kobe Bryant&gt;Shaquille O’Neal&gt;Steve Kerr&gt;Michael Jordan.
"You could say the exact same for the Blazers last year.   Nurk out until the bubble, Hood and Collins out the whole season basically. And all three were starters.   Had whiteside as our starting center and this season he was the backup for the Kings and only played 36 games.   Meaningful rotation minutes to Hezonja, Tolliver, Labisierre, Swanigan and all three are out of the league.   Hoard and Gabriel started games and the two of them played a combined 40 games this season.   We had 20 games of Trevor Ariza. Half of a season of Bazemore who’s on the warriors now and half a season of Melo who was out of the league for a year.   GTJ didn’t break out until the bubble. Nassir Little was a rookie and extremely raw. And Anfernee Simons was statistically a bottom 5 player in the league.   We don’t have Dame we would’ve struggled to break 10 wins. CJ is better than anyone Steph has offensively but you could argue Dray, Wiggins, Oubre are all better than anyone we had defensively last season. Not to mention covid fucked our schedule. When the season got postponed we had around 20 games left and the easiest sos. But in the bubble we ended up having the second hardest."
trevor fucking ariza   we re-signed the guy just so we could trade him again
Or Jeff Green or Trevor Ariza.  Ariza has played for like 12 teams I think.
I'm guessing Trevor Ariza plays a prominent role here?  I wonder how many current guys in the league have been on one of his teams?
"He’s been getting hated when he had Trevor Ariza as his number 2 and still won 55 games.   If he’s gonna get hated so much anyways, might as well get rings out of it too"
"And that his high school rival Trevor Ariza has had all the fame, glory and success :/"
Surprised this didn't get a real answer with the exception of u/scottishere's comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nfrd7j/terry_rozier_went_09_behind_the_arc_tonight/gynvu4p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Here the list of most missed 3s in a game 7:  11 - James Harden 2018 WCF (2-13 from 3)  11 - John Starks 1994 Finals (0-11)  10 - Eric Gordon 2018 WCF (2-12)  10 - Terry Rozier 2018 ECF (0-10)  10 - Steph Curry 2016 Finals (4-14)  10 - Craig Hodges 1990 ECF (2-12)  9 - Trevor Ariza 2018 WCF (0-9)  9 - Jaylen Brown 2018 ECF (3-12)  8 - James Harden 2020 First Round (1-9)  8 - Marcus Smart ECSF (2-10)  8 - Klay Thompson Finals (2-10)  8 - Joe Johnson 2013 First Round (1-9)
"he's already a very good defender and looks like he's finally turned the corner on the wrist injury that has been affecting his shooting since his senior year of high school, his biggest weakness has been his inability to stay healthy  he's not going to be a star but he's going to have a long career and make a lot of money as a high end role player à la Danny Green or Trevor Ariza if the injuries are behind him"
OKC have been homies at the end of the day   We got to get rid of a bigot in Meyers Leonard for only a late and worthless 2nd round pick AND it got us Trevor Ariza who’s been pretty good for us   And to only ask for 1 FRP and 1 SRP for horford while throwing in a great piece Philly actually needed is amazing   Okc has a load of picks and IOUs they can probably pounce on with a good amount of teams in the league. Really incredible.
"“Trevor Ariza”, does he prefer to go by something else?"
"I'm curious, what would you call Trevor Ariza?"
"Gonna have a long career, trevor ariza type."
Somewhere in the world Trevor Ariza fumes with anger
"lmao bro It's even more clear than ever before that you didn't watch this season. Andrew Bynum played 35 games, Trevor Ariza played 24 games and averaged 6pts lol, Fisher was decent but at the end of the day just a roleplayer. Odom was the only good player Kobe had all season. Before Bynum's injury and before the Gasol trade they were the 1st seed in the western conference, most people would call that an elite team. Kobe was definitely the main reason for it."
"Lmao bro they were on pace to win like 52 games (decent but they were not an elite team, we often see seeding changes through the trading deadline) before the Pau trade and had Andrew Bynum whom had become a decent contributor by that point, Fisher who was a championship veteran, Lamar Odam, and Trevor Ariza lol. A supporting cast good enough to contribute to two titles. The thought that a player of Kobe’s caliber needed an act of god to work with that supporting cast and get them in the playoffs is ridiculous and the team outlook significantly improved when they got Pau. It wasn’t just Kobe heroics. Frankly I’m starting to wonder if you watched that season. Lebrons supporting cast was absolutely fucking atrocious in comparison and it’s not even close lmao."
"2016 Rockets weren't young, but they were pretty bad. Harden's best teammates were a 30-year-old Dwight and Trevor Ariza. You could argue that they had more talent, I guess, and they were certainly deeper, but at least this Warriors team is good defensively. Those Rockets *very* much weren't."
Absolute disrespect to Thunder legend Trevor Ariza
"Man, I saw Trevor Ariza play for Miami last season and I thought then he looked like he should have retired 2 years before."
Trevor Ariza sold for us  Not Rockets legend
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
LeBron and Dwight were #1 and #4 in MVP voting in 2009 as well as #1 and #2 in DPOY voting.  Westbrook was #4 in ROY voting.  Trevor Ariza got one 3rd place vote for 6th man.  Honestly they probably would’ve been a super team in 2009.
"Dude, yes. The problem for me is actually seeing the other 2 starters. Kent bazemore, Rudy gay, Trevor ariza.. None of those guys are starting caliber players anymore. Bazemore may be younger but I've never ever been impressed with his game."
"Seriously lol, this is how superteams work. 90% of your cap goes to three guys and then you fill out the rest with veteran role players willing to play for cheap to win a ring. People are really trotting out dumbass takes like “LeBron is recruiting on nostalgia” like he has a bunch of nostalgia for Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington"
Lakers going to be playing 36 year old Trevor Ariza 30 minutes.
"This is the exactly correct analysis. Oh btw, KCP’s role has already been replaced by Kent Bazemore and Trevor Ariza. They could still sign a patty mills or Rudy gay."
"Rob, Russ, AD, and Bron are all sitting at a circular table with their phones sandwiched between their head and their shoulder (you know the position), each has an identical list of names and the corresponding phone number beside it.  Bron: Ayo Trev, we got limited spots but I got some pull I can hook you up, got a vet min sitting right here in front of me. *Everybody looks up and exchanges glances*   Trevor Ariza: Ay, say less, I already got a pen I'm omw!  Bron: *gives the nod* everyone marks their sheet with a checkmark next to Trevor ariza's name  Rob: Bron thanks for showing everyone the GM ropes, alright who's got....  AD: I got Dwight on speed dial  Bron: AD?  Rob: Bet  Russ: I bet you do"
Trevor Ariza did it with Houston technically I think.
"48 consecutive days with no rain in Seattle, means bad year for Trevor Ariza"
Damn swore to God Trevor ariza was doing a podcast then realized it was matt Barnes -_-
Dwight Howard and Trevor ariza
Mac McClung and Trevor Ariza
Those are some sweet ass rose tinted glasses you're wearing.   Wayne Ellington? Trevor Ariza? They're career mid 30% shooters on the backside of their careers. Unless you mean Dwight. But I don't think you mean Dwight.
Young upstart Trevor Ariza
Trevor Ariza
Trevor Ariza
Trevor Ariza for Houston and LA
Trevor Ariza still in the league huh.   I remember watching him in the NBA finals 10 years ago
Trevor Ariza right? I feel like he has been on the Lakers about 4-5 times lol
"His teammate Trevor Ariza, lol."
Trevor Ariza for the Rockets I think
I'm pretty sure Trevor Ariza has played for every team at least three times.
If Trevor Ariza is your second best shooter...you don't have shooters
**Rumored vet min signings:** Every UFA former All Star over 30 years old on a non-playoff team  **Real vet min signings:** Trevor Ariza
Rumored vet min signings: Every UFA former All Star over 30 years old on a non-playoff team  Real vet min signings: Trevor Ariza
TREVOR ARIZA STILL AROUND?!
Can’t wait until the Boo’s are doubled in Phoenix just because he’s Trevor Ariza and he’s wearing a Lakers jersey
"damn, can't see trevor ariza on the lakers. anybody with photoshop experience got a picture for me?"
Trevor Ariza to Lakers 1yr Deal
Why do people keep paying Trevor Ariza money?
"The current record holder, Trevor Ariza, also broke the record with Miami."
Here is my prediction for the Sixers  * Beal and Dame stay so Morey keeps Simmons * Green and Dwight leave * Sixers big free agent signing is Trevor Ariza on the MLE
"Reminds me of Trevor Ariza last year:  * Traded November 22, 2020 from Portland to Houston * Traded November 24, 2020 from Houston to Detroit * Traded November 27, 2020 from Detroit to Oklahoma City  Four teams in 5 days. Even outside of that dude is up there as one of the single most-traded players in NBA history:  * Drafted Jun 2004 by NYK * **Traded Feb 2006 from NYK to ORL** * **Traded Nov 2007 from ORL to LAL** * Signed Jul 2009 with HOU * **Traded Aug 2010 from HOU to NOH** * **Traded Jun 2012 from NOH to WAS** * **Traded Jun 2014 from WAS to HOU** * Signed Jul 2018 with PHX * **Traded Dec 2018 from PHX to WAS** * Signed Jul 2019 with SAC * **Traded Jan 2020 from SAC to POR** * **Traded Nov 2020 from POR to HOU** * **Traded Nov 2020 from HOU to DET** * **Traded Nov 2020 from DET to OKC** * **Traded Mar 2021 from OKC to MIA**"
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"this is how I feel. vets come to our team and just stop trying. what's up Trevor Ariza, the worst King of all time (next to Dewayne Dedmon)"
How tf is Trevor Ariza still playing. He was winning chips with the Lakers in 2009
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
This is definitely most relevant to Lakers. Best they can do is Redick. Maybe Trevor Ariza
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
Austin rivers maybe? Trevor Ariza?
trevor ariza 2.0
"Eddie Jones, Bruce Bowen, Shane battier, Rick fox, trevor ariza, throw in raja bell. Honestly feels like I just watched these players in those tough battles with/against the lakers last year. I’m so fucking old, shit."
Trevor Ariza just about killed him and McMillan didn’t like him/utilize him correctly
Trevor Ariza*
"""to add Kyle Lowry as their Chris Paul.""  LOL. That's funny. Maybe they can sign Trevor Ariza to be their LeBron James too."
What options he had? Telling Ryan Anderson and Trevor Ariza to go iso against the Warriors?  And you're making it sound like they ran the same play 27 possessions without scoring.
"&gt; Ariza  Hol up, Trevor Ariza played for Spain?"
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
Trevor Ariza
"As an honest Miami smelly meat fan I think we need to blow this team up. Fire Pat Riley, Trade Bam and butler to a real team like the Erie Bayhawks, and sign Trevor Ariza to a 5 year deal"
What Curry did this season is insane but I mean Harden had carry a team to the second seed while the second best player is Trevor Ariza that is more impressive for me personally. But if we are only talking about who is best player I would definitely put Curry in top3.
"I think they gotta go with 3 and D players like a Avery Bradley, Trevor Ariza and maybe bring back Wes Matthews. They also have to keep PJ.  They should go for a backup point guard. Maybe a guy like TJ McConnell if they can somehow get him 94 Rose. Both not the most realistic but possible if they wanna chase a ring like Bobby did."
Trevor Ariza too he needs his annual trip to Houston
"Miami or Philly. I feel like him and Bam complement each other’s game so well, and they Miami would have enough cap to get some good depth and S5 power around those two if they let go of guys like Jimmy Butler, Gordon Dragic, and Trevor Ariza they could even get a lot more. A starting 5 I think would push the heat up top would be this  PG-Malcom Brogdan SG-Bradley Beal SF-Davis Bertans PF-Bam Adebeyo C-Brook Lopez"
I remember Trevor Ariza overvaluing himself after a Lakers championship and it didn’t go too good for his career.
Nobody talks about Trevor Ariza being hurt too. That was also big.
"They need a another forward (like PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, etc) so that they can play Dray at the 5. That’s how you maximize Steph and Klay.  They went through an entire dynasty with basically bargain bin centers."
And Trevor Ariza. If the Cs are gonna claim Perkins. Then the 08 Lakers could mention Ariza and Bynum.
"IMO, Trevor Ariza was the bigger loss. Bynum was good, but the Celtics absolutely abused the lakers wing defense. Ariza was an excellent defender against both Ray Allen and Paul Pierce.  The Lakers best lineup that year was Pau, LO, Ariza, Kobe and Fish."
"There's a video on YouTube about Trevor Ariza's beef with Lebron back in their high school days and how it spilled over into the NBA.   Ariza had a chip on his shoulder cause Lebron way overshadowed Ariza. I think Ariza was a top 5 high school prospect in the nation but no one, other than pundits or scouters, heard of him cause we were all talking about Lebron. Lol  So Ariza... Took it personally"
Robert Covington ----&gt; Trevor Ariza ------&gt; Klay Thompson (all in their primes)
"Rudy was such a fun player to watch, especially when him and Sergio hooked up. Not sure if Rudy was ever the same after being murdered by Trevor Ariza sadly"
"I think they have to sign Bobby back, retain Forbes and PJ too. They need to add a 3 and D player with their MLE, someone who can impact their team right away.   A player like Avery Bradley, Trevor Ariza, or bring back Wes Matthews would do them well I feel like."
"&gt;Despite the fact that having Harden and Westbrook on a team starting together obviously doesn't work (see Houston),   Well if they had KD instead of Trevor Ariza don't you think it would have worked out a little better? 😂"
You’re obviously a big fan of his and I won’t disagree that he will probably have more winning seasons then not moving forward. Chris Oaul had Trevor Ariza and he battled with Kobe. Almost everyone you listed did better than Booker though.    Jrue Holliday and Andre Iguodala won more games than Books early Suns. Hell Josh Smith and the Pistons did. It’s not an indictment on him to recognize that. He didn’t have to win them all but he wasn’t even flirting with five hundred.
Can't believe Trevor fucking Ariza is still in the league
"Yes, he beat trevor ariza to a ring"
Trevor Ariza taking Giannis out and him laughing it off = Bobby laughing off CP3
Okay here's my take:  Mikal Bridges is more like a Khris Middleton and the Suns are fucking up using him like he's Trevor Ariza
Only trade I remember Houston doing before Harden asked out was getting rid of Robert Covington for old ass trevor ariza and draft picks. Thats not a win now move
yeah but if you need kendrick nunn and trevor ariza to come save your team that doesn't seem optimal
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."

"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
