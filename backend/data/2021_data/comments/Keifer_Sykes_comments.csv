"Can someone please explain to me how Keifer Sykes, Pacers Summer League bench player, is +22 is 20 minutes, with a stat line of 3/0/0/0/0 on 1/3 shooting? WTF?"
That's Boehiem's Army Legend Keifer Sykes to you
South East Melbourne Phoenix legend Keifer Sykes
"Holy shit, Keifer Sykes isn't a name I've heard in a while.  Dude got screwed outta showing up in the NCAA Tourney for ages and I was sad cause I knew he'd make a splash.  This is an odd but wonderful thing to hear."
"Its interesting to me but I would also argue that you can be a star in the NBL (Bryce Cotton, Keifer Sykes, Scott Machado) but also be unplayable in the NBA. Those guys are all like Kemba sized but are really bottom of the barrell for NBA standard combo gaurds.   They play extremely physically, but their bigs are often not very (guard) skilled. Its like NBA 2002 style post bruising with stars like Jock Landale barely able to scrape backup big minutes on a Spurs team of young guys not really trying for anything"
