Yeah his [g league stats](https://gleague.nba.com/player/mamadi-diakite/) are pretty impressive. Heâ€™s way better than he was in college
"That makes me ecstatic.  I thought we were going to have to offer Mamadi Diakite a full roster spot the way he's killing the G League.  Now we can keep him for the whole season and wait until next year when the apron doesn't affect us, then sign a buyout guy."
Yaâ€™ll ainâ€™t ready for Mamadi Diakite
Chu say? Mamadi Diakite rolls off the tongue.
"Oh I did, and don't get me wrong I recognise that the Knicks team are missing Randle and a starting piece and no team can be expected to perform at their usual level under the circumstances.  What I am trying to emphasise is that our line-up was unrecognisable. We played with &lt;18% of our salary cap. Most Bucks fans watching didn't even know who Axel Toupane was. The minutes Mamadi Diakite played tonight make up more than 60% of his total minutes this far in the season. Five players set career records for minutes played. Four players set career records for points. Like, these are not comparable situations."
"He was hitting stepback 3's in a defender's face tonight. Jordan Nwora was hitting 30 foot bombs. Mamadi Diakite was dribbing around like some point forward. Like goddamn, are the Bucks just flush with talent or was this a lucky game for them?"
Mamadi Diakite is a real NBA player  With the proper development he could become a star
unleash giannis 2.0 aka mamadi diakite
You forgot Mamadi '2013 Giannis' Diakite
"Bryn Forbes (killed us last game *badly*), Thanasis Antetokounmpo (former Knick), Brook Lopez (former crosstown rival when he was w/ the Nets), Sam Merill,  Jordan Nwora, Axel Toupane, Mamadi Diakite, and someone else I might not know"
"My guess:   Sam Merrill-Bryn Forbes-Pat Connaughton-Thanasis-Brook Lopez as the starters  Axel Toupane - Jordan Nwora -Mamadi Diakite as the bench.  Eight man rotation, Bucks have two open roster spots in addition to all these players being out, so lots of minutes for everyone there."
Give Mamadi Diakite minutes you coward.
Mamadi Diakite would like to have a word
MAMADI DIAKITE
good guess! its actually mamadi diakite! :)
&gt;2-way players are literally at end of the bench.  And then starters in the G league...  &gt;Guys that were All-G-League donâ€™t even have rosters spots.  Uhhh what?  Moses Brown plays for OKC often   KPJ is a stud on Houston   Paul Reed plays for Philly   Malachi Flynn literally just won rookie of the week/month I forget   Mamadi Diakite has played 12 games for Milwaukee  Jordan Poole plays for golden state
I think itâ€™s Mamadi Diakite so heâ€™s probably still salty about Auburnâ€™s final four loss to Virginia
"That's our guy Mamadi Diakite, he's a lil Giannis"
Unfortunately he is unskilled and has no bag so we might not be able to unload his contract unless we package an FRP or two + a young talent like mamadi diakite in exchange for another bad contract like wall or porzingis
Friendship ended with Giannis now Mamadi Diakite is my best friend
"yeah, we already ahve mamadi diakite"
"Trade Giannis, build around proven Champion Mamadi Diakite"
Mamadi Diakite would have fit right in with the Bad Boy Pistons.
TIL the Bucks have a hidden gem in MAMADI DIAKITE
You almost got murdered by MAMADI DIAKITE
I feel you. We went through a phase of people wanting to trade Brook and replace him with Bobby Portis/Mamadi Diakite in January...
Mamadi Diakite szn in the second half
"Mamadi Diakite, rook"
"I liked Joe a lot before the draft, he definitely looks like he can at least be a shooter. All about staying on the court and Reedâ€™s g league stint was really impressive.  I think him and Mamadi Diakite mightâ€™ve been the only 2 guys to make every bubble team.  Philly had a pretty solid draft."
"Let's unless our secret weapon, the Mamadi Diakite and Toupane 2 man game"
"Did it really come down to Craig vs. Tucker for that roster spot? I don't know if there was any roster CBA shenanigans going on but Torrey Craig is easily better than Mamadi Diakite, Jordan Nwora, and Sam Merrill who were all on the roster at the time. Maybe the salaries were important though to facilitate the Tucker trade though."
You think we'll get a Mamadi Diakite sighting tonight?
Mamadi Diakite
That's Mamadi Diakite!
Mamadi Diakite (Bucks) won the natty with UVA as well
The nba is in for a surprise with Jordan Nwora and Mamadi Diakite. The Bucks still have a chance.

Mamadi diakite
"Bud, for the love of God, please sub in Mamadi Diakite already......"
"Literally ignoring the ""unwarranted"" part. Giannis is absolutely better than Mamadi Diakite, so pretentious is the wrong word. Arrogant is a much better one."
"characterized byÂ pretension: such as  * a:Â making usually unjustified or excessive claims (as of value or standing)theÂ pretentiousÂ fraud who assumes a love of culture that is alien to himâ€” Richard Watts  * b:Â expressive ofÂ affected, unwarranted, or exaggerated importance, worth, or staturepretentiousÂ languagepretentiousÂ houses  Expressing unwarranted importance like he is more important than Mamadi Diakite because he can get away with such an act using status as leverage."
You think Mamadi Diakite is getting away with doing this?
"Mamadi Diakite got ejected from the Bucks/Nets game tonight for what I assume was called a Flagrant 2, so we might find out soon!"
"Bucks' Big Three; Jordan Nwora, Sandro Mamukelashvili and Mamadi Diakite."
"In this case I would guess one of last year's second round picks or the undrafted Mamadi Diakite are getting a raise. Signing picks doesn't count against the cap regardless, I believe, so there'd be no reason to use an exception on an unsigned pick."
"Yeah, Mamadi Diakite is absolutely easy."
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Mamadi Diakite  Donte Divincenzo  Sandro Mamukrlashvili  And Georgios Kalaitzakis  ðŸ˜‚
"The Bucks can now run a lineup with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Mamadi Diakite, and Sandro Mamukrlashvili. ðŸ˜‚"
"Best buck can do is giving away their superstar rookie Jordan nwora and Dennis Rodman lite, Mamadi diakite"
Yes. We have blonde mamadi diakite we control the decade
"That's NCAA, G League and NBA Champion Mamadi Diakite to you"
Backup forward Mamadi Diakite dyed his hair blonde for his championship run with Virginia in 2019. Giannis tells Mamadi he will score 50 if he goes blonde. Mamadi dyed his hair blonde shortly before the playoffs and Giannis dropped 50 to clinch the Bucks first title since 1971.

"I can now say I saw a NBA Champion play during College. Granted, itâ€™s Mamadi Diakite"
Youâ€™d think Mamadi Diakite had a 50+ point game with how heâ€™s in all the big media shots
"The Bucks one is strange as well. Mamadi Diakite apparently the back-up C even though he played 14 games last season, got signed out of the G-League, and we don't even know if he's on the team next season."
Best retired: Hakeem. Pretty nice.  Best active: Mamadi Diakite. Less nice.
"Mamadi Diakite looking down on today's game going ""You should have kept me"".  Wait no he's injured as well. Damn, even the bigs we released a month ago are doing down. Someone check on JOB."
"Yeah, he wasn't bad. Hopefully another team picks him up off waivers like Mamadi Diakite."
world champion mamadi diakite
What's the worst rings team you could build with current players?  PG: Jeremy Lin  SG: Patrick McCaw  SF: Mamadi Diakite  PF: Udonis Haslem  C: JaVale McGee  We're looking at 11 rings with playoff time experience that would probably struggle to win even 1 game
