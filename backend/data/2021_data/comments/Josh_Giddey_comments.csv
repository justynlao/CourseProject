"There’s no fucking way you just compared Josh Giddey to Lamelo Ball. Goddamn this dumbass sub talking out their asses  Giddey has average passing, no athleticism, no defence, no jumper. Nowhere near Ball or Rubio."
"I don’t like how much Josh Giddey is flying up the draft boards. Not because I don’t like him as a prospect, I was more hoping he could fall to us but I doubt that happens anymore"
I can see raps taking josh giddey
Never pass on 6'8 PGs and steal of the draft will be Josh Giddey.
"This is pretty wild. I like Barnes, but the top 5 is pretty set. I’d go:  1. Cade  2. Mobley  3. Suggs  4. Green  5. Kuminga   6. Keon Johnson  7. Josh Giddey  8. Scottie Barnes  9. Franz Wagner  10. Kai Jones  I do like BJ Boston though."

"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
"&gt; I hope They draft a player who turns into a complete stud.  Like maybe  they draft josh giddey or ziaire Williams and one of them turns into a  BALLER   I hope they draft a player, trade him for scraps, only for him to become a superstar in another team. I also hope he wins multiple championships with his other team preferably the Lakers. I hope Celtics continue to be mediocre for the rest of their existence."
You should be going to watch Josh Giddey before he gets picked up by an NBA team
Likely first-round overseas prospects are:   * Alperen Sengun (Besiktas) * Usman Garuba (Real Madrid) * Josh Giddey (Adelaide)  * Filip Petrusev (Mega Bemax)
Josh Giddey out of Australia I assume has generated enough hype that teams want to evaluate him. Diet Luka and can fit the mould we are seeing of taller PGs

Josh Giddey will be a steal
Josh Giddey. 6'8 point guard with a jumper.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuJj4p0SaOU
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."

"I have, that's why I said they would field a good team and might have a shot at a bronze if things go their way.   But dellavedova and baynes are reaching the end of their careers and broekhoff is a fringe NBA guy at best. But it seems like they have talent in the pipeline with Josh giddey too.   It's certainly possible they make some noise, but I would be surprised if it was meaningfully impactful as the difference between whether Simmons makes the hall or not."

"I think they will probably trade it.  If not, Franz Wagner, Josh Giddey, and Scottie Barnes are probably good fits in their offensive system, although Barnes may be redundant with Draymond - I'm not big on drafting for fit, but non-shooters genuinely have problems fitting together."

Who will the Warriors draft? What would you do if you were Bob Myers?  Here are my picks ...... Moses Moody with Minnesota’s pick and Josh Giddey with ours.
Josh Giddey
"Jalen Green is gonna be a star. Moreso if the Raptors got him. If Rockets got him tho, idk.   Josh Giddey will be the one picked at 10 or later who will take a run at that ROTY. He might be picked earlier tho, I won't be surprised if any team took him at top 5.   Cade Cunningham will be targeted by NBA's elite perimeter defenders. I think it will be like the Lonzo trajectory with awful early season but decent to great later on.   Mobley will get eaten inside."
Josh Giddey is that guy
No 1 Detroit Pistons - Cade Cunningham  No 2 Houston Rockets - Jalen Green  No 3 Cleveland Cavaliers - Evan Mobley  No 4 Toronto Raptors - Jalen Suggs  No 5 Orlando Magic - Jonathan Kuminga  No 6 Oklahoma City Thunder - Scottie Barnes  No 7 Golden States Warriors -  Moses Moody  No 8 Orlando Magic - James Bouknight  No 9 Sacramento Kings - Franz Wagner  No 10 New Orlean Pelicans - Cory Kispert  No 11 Charlotte Hornets - Usman Garuba  No 12 San Antonio Spurs - Alperen Sengun  No 13 Indiana Pacers - Josh Giddey  No 14 Golden States Warriors - Jalen Johnson  No 15 Washington Wizards - Ziaire Williams  No 16 Oklahoma Thunder - Kai Jones  No 17 Memphis Grizzlies - Keon Johnson  No 18 Oklahoma Thunder - Jaden Springer  No 19 New York Knicks - Davion Mitchell  No 20 Atlanta Hawks - Jared Butler  No 21 New York Knicks - Chris Duarte  No 22 Los Angeles Lakers - Tre Mann  No 23 Houston Rockets - Trey Murphy III  No 24 Houston Rockets - JT Thor  No 25 Los Angeles Clippers - Sharife Cooper  No 26 Denver Nuggets - Ayo Dosumno  No 27 Brooklyn Nets - Isaiah Jackson  No 28 Philadelphia 76ers - Cam Thomas  No 29 Phoenix Suns - Josh Christopher  No 30 Utah Jazz - Quentin Grimes  Thoughts?
"Part of me thinks they need to go with a high upside forward - so any of Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson or Josh Giddey.  Kai Jones also makes sense if they think they're going to be out a big with Richaun Holmes potentially leaving. Also Kai Jones is supposed to be a half-decent 3-point shooter which would be nice against Bagley."
I think they should really pick Josh Giddey in the top 3 range
booming? Australian Boomers? Klay hinting to the Warriors taking Josh Giddey?
"Not the highest on sengun either, for me I don’t question his bust potential I think he’ll be an NBA player I question how much of his stuff is really going to translate and how impactful it’ll be. I think him being a roll man will work, being a passer out the short roll will work, posting up mismatches and backups will work. Other than that I’m not sure. On defense he’s not big enough to defend 5’s and is bad at defending the PnR, he’s better as a help defender 4 but he’s not athletic enough to play there. I don’t buy the shot, don’t trust the ball handling stuff and I don’t think the post ups will generate enough PPP to go to it unless he’s a bench scoring option.   I’ve said it before I see a Montrezl Harrell type where he’s going to be getting buckets off the bench where his defensive ?’s and size won’t hurt a team as bad.  With Giddey I just think he’s a bad fit for us and we’re a bad fit for him in terms of roster construction and the way he plays. If we move Derrick or Dejounte then pick up Giddey to be our offensive engine I’d be on board but his play style is just so boom or bust like.   Josh Giddey is one of the 3 best passers in this draft, can make any pass imaginable, and is amazing out the pick and roll, but he  only knows 2 offensive sets those being the high pick and roll, or attack in transition. He’s only effective will the ball in his hands. He relies on his gravity as a jumbo playmaker and finisher to score and generate points which is fine but the man isn’t explosive, a real shooting threat, and can’t score off the dribble or in isolation to warrant him being a teams offensive engine. Without a shot teams will go under him, and off ball he’ll  essentially be useless since he’s also not a cutter. (A little similar to how teams just realized they could simply shrink the floor against us) His North/South change of pace needs to improve, he also needs to improve his handle. Without a dribbling package he’ll never be able to score off the dribble, or attack 1 on 1 matchups against guards 4-5 inches shorter than him due to the deficiencies as a quick twitch athlete . (This is a given for every team except us apparently) You have to get floor spacers around him and a big that can put pressure on defenses whether it be by finishing or floor spacing to open up the floor and give him room to work and operate because the man is great at getting the ball to guys who have a clear chance to score.  To me the simplicity of his game despite him being a High IQ player is his biggest weakness. I think his swing skills, primarily shooting, scoring out the Pick and Roll and ball handling will be the difference between him being Tomas Satoransky and an allstar level lead guard."

Josh Giddey is a future Sacramento King pick if I have ever seen one
"Awww, that Josh Giddey interview got sad quick, but at least he gets to have little moment playing for his country in the exhibitions."
JOSH GIDDEY LETS GO
Its a basketball revolution. Not a big man revolution. Skill rises to the top now prioritizing unique in game functional skill over world class athleticism (look at Josh Giddey vs Keon Johnson... One's moving up ones moving down but why)... figuring out how to defend without touching anybody too is another tall task.  Its not about being big... Its about being useless if all you are is big.  Its always been a guy is more effective with size to go with skill.  Now the game is cutting unskilled players out.
"Australia's core is now very old. Delly adds very little, Ingles isn't the player he was in 2019, really only leaving Patty to drive the offense. This Aussie team is worse than last time we beat the US in Melbourne and last Olympics. Mattise is fantastic and we are getting good contributions from role players (Kay, Landale, Goulding in particular).   Plenty of talent coming through though (Josh Giddey and Dyson Daniels are both potential lottery picks in 2021 and 2022), Josh Green is handy and Ben would definitely help out if he ever plays for Australia again"
Yo any chance they put in Josh Giddey 👀
Put Josh Giddey in
Australia should bring Josh Giddey in
should be an easy win without ben right?  i wanna see josh giddey

"Thybulle is so freakin' good. While it's reasonable he only played 20 min a game last season, I wish he got a full 30-35 minutes so we could see him make plays all over the place all the time. Heck, elite on-ball defenders with worse offensive skillsets than Thybulle's got that level of playing time (e.g. Roberson) so there's plenty of room for him to get more.  Whenever he does that block from behind, oof. ""Nothing personal, kid,"" followed by a swat.  Note: Also, Josh Giddey shows up in the box score. Is he on the team and will he be playing? Or is he sitting out to ensure his health for the draft?"

"Amazing, can't wait to see Thybulle, Mills, and of course, Jingles on the international floor! A little disappointed that we won't see Josh Giddey, though I assume he wants to make sure he stays healthy for the draft. Delly, Exum, and Baynes should bring a lot of experience, and Goulding/Landale/Kay are mainstays. Never heard of newcomers Reath and Sobey, but I assume they must be decent and/or fill some positional need if they're on the team."
No Josh Giddey :(  But I think we can still medal.
"The Warriors have two choices:  1. Pick Josh Giddey 2. Don't Pick Josh Giddey, and regret it forever.  The choice is theirs"
Josh Giddey will end up being the best player of this draft class. Also Davion Mitchell will get one dpoy and multiple all defensive first teams

I'm really hyped on Davion Mitchell and Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey a 6'8 Australian PG is right in their draft range. Interesting....
Depends on who's available at 9. Someone like Josh Giddey or Davion Mitchell might be tempting since the 76ers would need a PG if they trade Simmons.
"I’m going to stick to hyping up the guy that my friend is a cousin of. With that in mind, Josh Giddey is going to rise to be top 10 pick, mark my words!"

Australia has Josh Giddey who has nominated at 18 years old.  Is in our Olympic squad.
I have to watch scottie barnes and josh giddey now I hate this

Josh Giddey will be a 2021 lotto pick and has a taller frame with a better jumper than Dyson. Dyson is hella athletic tho
"We keep producing insanely tall PGs with issues shooting. I’m beginning to think it’s actually just a product of our development system.  Ben Simmons, Josh Giddey and Dyson all are tall point guards who struggle from beyond the arc. Giddey and Dyson aren’t afraid to let it fly though."
"The rest of team includes Jingles (as mentioned below), Thybulle, Baynes, Exum, Josh Giddey (draft), Josh Green (G-league), and ex-NBA players Mitch Creek and Ryan Broekhoff."
JOSH GIDDEY SZN
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
Big hole with josh giddey leaving. Simmons will be a perfect replacement
"Not evry wing player is automatic 3nD prospect wtf  You don’t understand shit about the draft  There are still shooter, defensive wing, play making wing in the draft and different mold to follow.   Example: Josh Giddey in this upcoming draft is a wing and his best attribute is playmaking, absolutely not a 3nD, he’s projected to be top 10-15"
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
Josh Giddey - He’s happy
I’m gonna make a prediction for 2020 and 2021 busts. I think it’s gonna Obi Toppin and Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey will be signing with the Lagoon Kicks
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
"Carlisle traditionally has not played rookies and Duarte is about the highest floor prospect in the draft. He'll be able to slide in and contribute immediately.  When you're as ""win-now"" as the Pacers are it doesn't really bode well for player development so getting a plug-and-play like Duarte makes a lot of sense for us.   I was high on either Franz Wagner or Josh Giddey but both of those guys were off the board by then. A couple of guys in a similar vein to Duarte that were available were Corey Kispert and Moses Moody.   Apparently GSW really wanted Duarte since they're trying to make the most of the rest of their core's prime."
Masai wouldn't have drafted Josh Giddey lol
"OKC - SGA, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Theo, Giddey, Mann, JRE protected  Unprotected - Ty Jerome, Kenrich, Deck, Muscala, Favors, Roby, Vit Krejci, Charlie Brown Jr, Josh Hall  Would expect to lose Kenrich and Ty Jerome in an expansion draft, assuming each expansion franchise can only take one apiece from a team. Maybe Vit but I don’t think he’s signed a deal officially and don’t know if a player’s rights can be taken in an expansion draft or if they have to have an NBA contract."
"Josh Giddey. Just disappeared after that first dunk, never saw him make a play in the rest of the Summer League games."
"Cool cool, now pls do a Josh Giddey one"
I'm really pulling for it. Especially since it has Josh Giddey in it.
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey
Has Josh Giddey played in summer league. I thought he had an ankle injury?
I'm contractually obligated to say Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey (considering we only saw 5 minutes)
"I would go:  1) Cade Cunningham  2) Jalen Green  3) Jalen Suggs  4) Evan Mobley  5) Jonathan Kuminga   6) Scottie Barnes  7) Josh Giddey (don’t think it’s fair to drop him since he pretty much hasn’t played)  Also, Scottie Barnes being two spots lower than where he was drafted isn’t meant to be a diss or anything. I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Scottie Barnes 5. Jalen Suggs 6. Josh Giddey 7. Johnathan Kuminga 8. Franz Wagner
Josh Giddey?
Josh Giddey
Josh giddey will be a star player
"Marielle Fultz, KZ Okpala, Josh Giddey"
Josh giddey will be the 3rd best player in this draft class after Jalen green(1st) and Jon kuminga(2nd) with Cade Cunningham being an honorable mention (4th)
"“Show y’all mutherfuckers, Josh Giddey my ass”"
I've been saying this kid is the real deal for a while but it was unpopular to be high on him. The consensus was that he would be Josh Jackson 2.0 for a while. I still think Giddey will be solid though
Nope. That belongs to the Shariff Cooper and Josh Giddey comparison.
I actually like Josh Giddey
One of the worst? Best? New posts I read was why was Shariff Cooper drafted so far behind Josh Giddey since the only thing different between the two is Giddey is 6’8 and Cooper is 6’1.
6’1 Josh Giddey in the house.
and Josh Giddey is pretty exciting too.
"Kuminga was rated as a top 3 prospect before the draft analysis began. Then, he fell to 5th on peoples boards. It stayed that way for about a year. A week or two before the draft, he fell to 7 behind Josh Giddey???? Steal to me tbh.  Dunno why I got downvoted. Congrats on ur draft tho, Rockets had the best draft in the league."
Ay man Josh Giddey is legit don’t sleep on him
"Someone on the Thunder subreddit is already claiming Josh Giddey a bust after 5 minutes of play time, touching the ball 3 times, and rolling his ankle."
Josh Giddey
Nice non argument. People always gotta resort to lazy insult like that when they have no point.    You think a dude is gonna drastically change his style of play and gain a whole new skill set to magically fit your ideal version of his potential and you are calling me the moron.    Hilarious    You might as well say Kai Jones has Nikola Jokic potential and Josh Giddey has Larry bird potential
"Lol. It summer league he ain't proved much. His handle ain't tight. His shooting ain't great. Toronto already has a similar guy with similar skills, in OG. Why draft another guy at the same position that you just paid to stay long term. I didn't understand that from Toronto. I think Toronto should have taken a chance and taken Josh Giddey."
Josh Giddey shocks the world
"We will have Josh Giddey, Dyson Daniels, Green and Thybulle in Paris. Simmons can get the fuck outta here, he’s a goddam yank"
I might take a flyer on Josh Giddey. He will get enough minutes on the thunder to produce and I'm expecting that OKC wouldn't be tanking this season.
"Had Josh Giddey fallen to us, maybe if Patty hadn't left us, and give or take whether or not Jock Landale signed with us, I was going to petition a green and gold statement jersey for the Spurs lol"
"We're in good hands with Tisse, Josh Green, Josh Giddey and guys like Dyson Daniels coming through. All learning from guys like Gazey and Patty who know exactly what it means and what is needed to represent your country on the world stage."
Never heard of Bryce (but I don't watch the NBL at all really)  but wouldn't Josh Giddey be more likely to be in that sort of role?
"Josh Green, Giddey and Thybulle leading the next generation. I'm sure they will be fine."
Josh Giddey will be a bust  Pascal Siakam has an overall regression in productivity  Jazz make the playoffs but are a lower half seed 5-8
Josh Giddey
The thunder. We just drafted Josh Giddey and have a promising future along with future superstar Shai gilgeous Alexander. And if you like draft picks you’re in the right place
"It's Ziaire Williams easily. How many times have we seen the highly-touted HS prospect who disappoints in college but still gets drafted too high based on his ""potential"". That's what Ziaire looks like to me. No disrespect intended, I won't be rooting against the kid obviously, but it just feels like we've been here before.  Honourable mention to Josh Giddey, who's only NBA-level skills are court vision and passing."
I can’t believe no one has said Josh Giddey yet. A 6’9 PG that CAN shoot and one of if not the best playmaker in the draft that’s who I’m most excited to see.
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
Josh Giddey
From what I've read on here... josh giddey is steve nash but substitute the shooting and handles for height. And scottie barnes is a hybrid of kawhi and draymond.
Josh Giddey tho 👀
Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt; Josh Poopey  All seriousness though I think Barnes has a higher floor just due to his defence. Giddey has great passing abilities but what else can he do at an elite level right away that warrants him being on the floor? Btw I’m only doing rookie years because it all depends on how they develop
"Can't rule out next Olympics if Mills plays, peak Ben Simmons and Thybulle could be scary. Also got Josh Giddey coming up"
"I still love this Aussie squad, add josh giddey and Simmons next time around and we could make it a closer game. Let's get this bronze fellas."
&gt;best ever shot at a gold medal and we threw aw  Next Olympics could be good with a peak Ben Simmons and Thybulle. Should have Josh Giddey playing too
Josh Giddey szn?
Brisbane 2032.  future 3x MVP Josh Giddey will bring home the gold
it’s okay they’ll be getting carried by Josh Giddey in 2024
I'd much rather have Josh Giddey than Nathan Sobey
"Ingles, Delly, Thybulle, Mills, Baynes, Josh Green and Giddey just got drafted  Delly is going to play in Aus unless he's offered a deal in the NBA and a lot of people are ~~hoping Jock Landale gets some looks for a go at the league after playing really well these games.~~  Correction - Jock has landed a shot with the Spurs"
The absolute disrespect to Australian phenom/Chalamet stunt double Josh Giddey.
"Many Thunder fans (actually more of Presti worshippers) view busts like Cole Aldrich and Josh Huestis as stars because they were drafted (or traded for) by Presti. Giddey is now being viewed as a stud and someone who will surpass expectations ala-Westbrook (when most of OKC's picks recently disappointed) and those protected FRPs are being over-valued (instead of being seen as 2nd round picks by 2026/2027).   To be fair, there would have been a higher (albeit still remotely unlikely) chance OKC could get some picks had Kemba played, like Horford and CP3. Maybe Kemba really does want to get out."
"As a fellow Australian I would recommend not following the 76ers, at least not because of Simmons who’ll probably be gone, you can still just follow Australian players like Simmons when he’s traded or Patty Mills and Joe Ingles pursuing championships, also Jock Landale just signed with the Spurs which will be fun although I doubt he’ll play much. I’d recommended picking a team with a young star so your passion for the nba grows with that player, I think the Thunder would be a great choice for you personally, they have a great young star in Shai, just drafted an Australian (Josh Giddey) with the 6th pick, will likely suck for the next couple of years but will likely be pretty good for a while after that."
"Those 2 australians will be 1 soon. Maybe none.  Im a fellow aussie and picked the 6ers during the process era and that was really fun and a great way into b-ball cos it had a heavy focus on what drafting was about so I get familiar with a lot of people.  I would highly recommend checking OKC cos they are going through a similar process right now (except its on steroids) and they also just drafted Josh Giddey, our next prospect."
If Josh Giddey does really well in his first year I think you’ll find a lot more top prospects deciding to play in the NBL over college.  Get to play in a more competitive league which is closer to NBA in skill and physicality. You also get paid which will be a big bonus.
"Josh Giddey, Dyson Daniels, Josh Green and Matisse Thybulle are going to be leading the team in 3 years time."
They wanted to draft Josh Giddey.  This makes perfect sense.
"The Thunder just drafted an Australian in Josh Giddey if that interests you. Hornets have LaMelo Ball who played over there, and they're an exciting going team."
"His recognition and awareness stood out to me. Giddey reads the game and creates shooting opportunities out of nothing. For Adelaide, Josh was very good at switching the ball to the weak-side corner whenever he saw the defender at the rim squeezing the strong-side of the floor.   I think the concerns about his passes getting picked off are overblown. He has the height to pass over the top of the defence and that overhead pass whips the ball to his teammate before the defence can respond. His passing windows will get smaller in the half-court in the NBA but he should still be very strong in transition.   LaMelo's not the right comp neither is Lonzo or Kyle Anderson. There are no real comparisons that make sense for Giddey"
Josh “Muad’dib” Giddey
I'm positive about Josh and think he'll do well in the Thunder's offence. I expect a three guard lineup with Giddey at the 3 with Shai and Dort in the backcourt. I also kinda like the idea of Poku at the 4 as well. Having four guys on the floor who know how to make the smart pass should give Giddey time to settle in
"Perfect, just need to tank for one more season to get Chet:   Josh Giddey  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Lu Dort   Aleksej Pokusevski  Chet Holmgren"
"Idk much ab Josh Giddey but I saw a funny draft profile picture ab Josh Giddey saying that his weaknesses were Ball Handling, Shot Creation, Aggression, Shooting, On Ball Defense, and Athleticism   Like apparently his weakness is playing basketball?"
"I’m callin it now, Kay is going to the nba soon, Josh Giddey going from like 14 to 6 in draft pick makes him living breathing evidence that playing for the boomers makes you a much more illustrious product to nba teams"
"And this right here, this is Josh Giddey, and he's 6 foot 9 inches tall, and you can't teach that!"
"&gt; Josh Giddey is actually 6'9"" as he confirmed on Twitter through his Bio  LOL"
"&gt;18 Year Old Josh Giddey Is A 6'9"" Point Guard  ...who can't shoot"
Literally every thread. It could be a thread of Josh Giddey highlights and someone will still find a way to mention Lebron. Some of y’all will truly be lost after he retires.
Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey 🤣
looks even more like a guy named Josh Giddey
The two people im high on: Josh giddey and scottie barnes  Guess we're thinking the same haha
yeah i figure thats why he flew under the radar but even just highlights of his are mind blowing. I'm just starstruck bro i dont even know what to say.   I went down the youtube rabbit hole of josh giddey game highlights and hes stunning. I'd recommend watching when you have time. It's some of the most beautiful basketball I've seen
Josh giddey is a v good player
He looked like Josh Giddey to me but what do I know
The Josh Giddey pick looks a lot like i want a Lamelo ball on my team pick
"Presti: Here in my stadium, just drafted this new Josh Giddey, fun to play up here in the OKC. But you know what I like a lot more than actual players? Draft picks."
Josh giddey is a perfect pairing next to Sga and had to be taken 6th or else would have been taken 7-10
"'Entirely off of wingspan' is an exaggeration made to better suit your POV.   He has huge hands.   They are a foot long. The base of his wrist where his hand starts to his middle finger is the size of a full 12"" Subway sandwich.   Suggs is a better leaper, but Barnes is a good athlete too. He has an ABSURD wingspan. 7'3"" wingspan is insane. Length is SO important in a league where people are playing and guarding 1 thru 5 in this day and age of NBA hoops. Suggs is a score-first 6'4"" guard in a league where point guards of his generation are 6'6"", 6'9"", 6'8"" 6'10""   Look at the comparable talent in this draft class. Cade is 6'8"", Barnes is 6'9"", Kuminga is 6'9"" and could easily see point forward minutes like Draymond, Franz Wagner is 6'8"", Josh Giddey is around there as a 2, etc..."
Y’all don’t need another tall guy that can’t shoot but took Josh Giddey with the 6th pick?
facts. Josh Giddey... may as well have traded back or traded it away entirely.
Josh Giddey trash ass
Josh giddey
we got Rexdale Josh Giddey and Champagnie Papi
Pick 7+14 to move to 6 to take Josh Giddey who is a better version of Ben Simmons
Ah yeah my bad. Haha. How y'all feeling about the Josh Giddey pick? I was shocked
"I'd be pretty mad if I went into this draft basically capable of doing anything and came away with Josh Giddey, Tre Mann and two protection black hole picks in drafts likely less deep than this one."
Who the fuck is Josh Giddey and why did we use our lottery pick on him
Josh Giddey your welcome to go to Australia
"This just in, josh giddey has been drafted #6th by the okc thunder"
Josh Giddey on a plane right this second
Josh Giddey leads rookies in APG
MVP: Tatum   DPOY: Thybulle   ROY: Josh Giddey (I’m from Australia so this one might be a little obvious)
"Josh Giddey  OKC hasn’t drafted a good player since 2013 so I have 0 confidence that they made the right pick, Kuminga gonna bite them in the ass"
Predicting Wiseman would struggles  last year without a training camp? Nah you didn’t need a time machine for that.   Predicting Ball would win ROY and look like a superstar after shooting 10% better from 3? Yeah you did. Just because someone played in an international league doesn’t make them a superstar. Especially when they shoot so poorly. You most likely will see that with Josh Giddey for this season.
Josh Giddey is going to be a bust   As an Aussie this is a very unpopular opinion
THT &gt; Josh Giddey
"OKC is full of young talent. I like Poku and their Aussie rookie, Josh Giddey."
He's basically lost Australia.  We're all about Matisse Thybulle now after that Olympic performance.  Plus we got Josh Giddey and Jock Landale coming into the league next season too.
OKC just picked Josh Giddey if you want an Aussie connection
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
I’ll agree to disagree lol  I’ll take Watching my team have fun and winning games V.S. Losing all season and having josh giddey to show for it lol but hey whatever rocks your boat 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Jerseys with the laser print are always so amazing.   My team, Adelaide 36ers (Josh Giddey played with us this year) had a jersey a few years back where our roadmap was laserwd into the back of the jersey and it was fireeeee"
Josh Giddey
"You are right, they are watching Josh Giddey on TikTok now.. *sad boomer noises*"
"JA Morant, Jalen Green, and Josh Giddey"
Josh “the Supersonics God” Giddey.
"It helps greatly that the Thunder have begun their rebuild with one piece reasonably in place, with SGA.  And Lu Dort seems like he's been a positive contributor.  So it seems like there is actual progress being made with the Thunder. And the early returns on Josh Giddey have been positive too.  On the other hand, the Sixers top pick in 2013 didn't play that year.  Then in 2014, the Sixers two lottery picks didn't play, and the Sixers traded away their other 2013 lottery pick-who actually won rookie of the year- for a future draft pick (that wouldn't be realized until 2018).  So two years after The Process began and 4 lottery picks later, there was one year of Nerlens Noel and that was it.  And then the year after that, they went 10-72!  And on top of that, they drafted another center who got into a physical altercation with fans of an opposing team during the year.  What really saved the Process was after sitting for two years, Embiid was even better than advertised.  But if Embiid would have come back and just been iffy or not been able to come back at all, the Process would be the most ridiculed strategy since the Cavs of the Stepien era of the 80s  I was a supporter of the Process then and still am reasonably for it now.  But the two situations are not the same in the least."
Josh Giddey is going to be very good imo

I wonder what Steve Nash Larry bird and josh giddey have in common🤔
Oh boy. I guess ESPN is salivating right now.  The Lakers got beat by a guy who looks like a character of Pretty Little Liars.   JOSH GIDDEY BABY
Josh “Timothee Chalamet” Giddey was balling today
"&gt;One player who didn't make the final twelve was Josh Giddey, who was later selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the sixth pick in the NBA Draft. Goorjian recalled agonising over the decision to leave Giddey on the outer for Tokyo.  &gt;""The toughest part is always selection. He had a lot on his plate at the time. It's such a fine line, there was a lot on his plate during the camp,"" he said.  &gt;""People talk about Nathan Sobey, it wasn't that. It came down to Josh Green or Josh Giddey. They're both young, they both have a huge future moving forward. When we played those four days leading up, Josh Green had a better camp, it's as simple as that.

I thought Josh Giddey would just be a Deni Avdija. Oops. Could be a legit star
AD should give up his spot on the NBA 75 to josh giddey

Josh Giddey is handsome as fuck.

All Makes sense with Josh Giddey being from Australia. No need to Shit on a whole organization because your man took a hard foul.
Josh Giddey  Patty Mills  Matisse Thybulle   Josh Green  Jock Landale

"&gt;	Josh Giddey isn't super quick either  Eh,he kinda…*sneaky* with it."
Giddey is well above NBA average for quickness. Quickness isn’t how fast you can run a 100 meter… that’s speed.   Quickness is changing directions and movements on a dime like a rabbit. If you cant see that Josh Giddey is special with that then you are tripping.  https://blog.nasm.org/sports-performance/speed-agility-quickness-saq
Josh Giddey definitely is super quick.   You’re only saying he’s not because he’s White lol
"Josh giddey tho, he’s gonna be a good player in this league"
Sixers because they couldn’t care less about the health of opposing teams players and were rude and biased towards Josh Giddey on the thunder and only cared about Embiid and his reckless foul
Josh “couldnt-care-less” Giddey
Josh Giddey my ROTY
Yo I care about Josh Giddey.
"Josh Giddey is looking pretty damn good though, only a few games in."
Joel Embiid looks like he ate two Josh Giddey's. Giddey is so skinny compared to him.
Virgin Lebron james vs Chad Josh Giddey youngest guy in the league handles a dangerous play better than one of the oldest
"Josh Giddey isn't super quick either and when he handles the ball, on tv it looks like it's gonna get stolen due to his height (but weirdly it doesn't). I think Cade will be fine especially if he shoots like he did in college"
Dude is a walking bucket.  Also not to mention Josh Giddey and Chris Duarte from this class as well. You love to see it.

"People need to stop underrating foreign players who play in their national leagues at the highest level...anyone who saw Josh Giddey playing against former NBA players and Australias best talent knows he should have been lottery and people were shitting on him with the ""WHO"" and ""HIS BIGGEST WEAKNESS IS BASKETBALL"" like cmon dude"
Josh Giddey is going to have his breakout game against the Lakers.
Replace Josh Giddey for Lebron. Makes sense for the Lakers. He's basically a younger version
It may suck but this is the kind of stuff Josh Giddey needs to go for before he wins
"Aged like milk. Read and weap.   ""There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. Golden State had made contact and said they were keen to take Josh at pick seven if he was still on the board at that stage.  ""Going into the draft that night, we were reasonably confident that if he got through to seven Golden State would take him, but we were absolutely thrilled when Oklahoma decided to take him.  https://wwos.nine.com.au/basketball/josh-giddey-nba-draft-workout-oklahoma-city-thunder-golden-state-warriors-debut-preview/9ba12e0f-804a-43c8-a089-fe3e2a4cc1a0"
"Luka alone probably has more equity than the entirety of a team like the Magic or Thunder's ""young core"". Do you think any front office would trade Luka for all of SGA, Poku, Dort, Tre Mann, Josh Giddey, and Darius Bazley combined?"

"I don’t have a favorite team, so….   Im looking forward to:   See how renewed teams will perform, in particular the Bulls, the Wizards and the Cavs.    See how this new rookies perform, in particular the top 5 picks, Josh Giddey and Sengun.    See how players on new team such as Derozan and Kuzma performs.    See how Durant/Harden and PG do without Kyrie and Kawhi.    And lastly I hope to see the Kings improve, eventually reaching the playoffs."
Josh Giddey is Melbourne's last hope for a likable fucking basketball player I swear to God.
GOING TO FEEL A LOT BETTER WATCHING JOSH GIDDEY OUTPERFORM JALEN GREEN ALL SEASON LMAO
Josh giddey is a top 5 passer in the league already as a rookie.
"Oh yeah, if you ignore everything in between Steven Adams and the hope for Josh Giddey, they did FANTASTIC at letting the Pacers develop Sabonis.   You just decided to take a stand and are just saying whatever sounds good after that no matter how little sense it makes when actually thought about for a second. But tell me about facts you totally have as I guess you’re Presti’s burner or something. Don’t worry, saying “take the L” first totally scores points with other people as smart ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\s as you."
Even Josh Giddey can't make these look good
JOSH GIDDEY IS THE GOAT TALL AUSTRALIAN POINT GUARD
That’s Josh Giddey in 12 years
"Honestly probably, but I already hit my budget through a couple of other bets lol, my favorite is probably Josh Giddey for ROTY at +3000"
Josh Giddey: Makes me feel Giddey
"Overall, “whatever Sam Presti says.”  From 2009-2016, it was “whatever KD and Russell say.”  After that, it was “whatever Russell says.”  Then it was the CP3 show for a year.  Now, everyone talks about “the timeline,” and how everyone is young so everyone is still improving and figuring out who they are as NBA players. SGA’s fan nickname is literally “the Timeline” now and Presti/Daigneault talk all the time about how SGA is on board for the process. Also everyone stans Josh Giddey and Poku. And also “Dort.” Really says it all for him."
"Josh Giddey will win ROTY  Cade is gonna have a good but not great rookie year and Jalen green is gonna have bad efficiency numbers. No one else in the class will particularly standout in their rookie year. But Giddey has played awesome in preseason and in OKC, he’ll have all the opportunity and trust that he needs to be successful in this first year. I can see a 14 7 and 7 type of season from him. Similar to Ben Simmons rookie year"

"he's missed half the season and even then I can think of half a dozen plays that one might categorize as unnecessarily reckless  like slamming josh giddey into the stanchion so hard its surprising he didn't break his back or fouling harden with a slap to the face and then immediately clobbering lamarcus aldridge half a second later.   and he's always had a habit of falling down maybe-semi-accidentally onto people and rolling their ankles  I can't really talk though mitch robinson on my team is kind of the same way, he's really throwing his weight around this year and if he's slow to rotate you might get clobbered"

Whats with Josh Giddey and reddit awards
Josh Giddey really is the best player on the court
"Seriously how the hell is Cade higher in the rookie ladder than Giddey? they're basically the same type of player right now but Giddey is more efficient (although still poor), more assists (despite holding the ball a lot less and teammates bricking off him just like cade gets), more rebounds, very close stocks numbers, better assist turnover, less turnovers per 36, way better finishing percentage. Josh also has the edge in BBIQ and hustle as he is amazing in both, although cade is also good in these areas  Cade is better at taking shots to get his PPG up, free throws, perimeter defense. I don't doubt there's a great chance of him being the better player than Giddey in 5 years. But now? He's close but it's clearly Josh  His teammates are bad too, Giddey helps make them look a lot better.   And Giddey isn't even given the keys to run the offense (he was yesterday and put up 15/7/8 with 2 blocks in only 30 minutes with 17 potential assists or something crazy like that."
"Our second-round rookie this season, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, just screams ""beloved bench role player.""  He's a 6'9"" 230+lb forward/center who is comfortable on the switch (there's a viral video of him defending James Harden which ends in Harden taking a tightly contested stepback three with a hand in his face and then falling to the floor trying to bait a foul call), actively sets screens on-and-off ball, has great positioning, and is ninth among rookies in 3PT made while shooting 37% from three. (1.1 3PM to 3.1 3PA per game)  He's also, by all accounts, a stand-up dude and super mature for a 21 year old and has the best chemistry with Josh Giddey on the team. Giddey's finding him for open layups every game.  His weakness is that he's not a super athlete, so he's not a lob finisher or rim protector, which probably sets his ceiling as a role player that defends intelligently, spaces the floor, and positions himself for easy looks."

Not surprised. That same dude said he didn’t care if Josh Giddey got injured as long as Embiid wasn’t.

When I was still high off the #1 pick I made a post in /r/DetroitPistons saying that the lottery was the difference between Cade and Josh Giddey (who I only picked because he was picked #6 and wasn’t seen as being at the talent level of the top 5). The Thunder subreddit brigaded the post and were sending me a lot of inappropriate messages lol

"Can’t wait till he plays on the Australian team at the next Olympics.  Giddey, Thybulle and Josh Green will all be going into their prime. Patty will probably have one last run before he retires.  Still have Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Jock Landale and Aron Baynes.  X-Factor is if Ben Simmons finally joins. Figure he has a shot at it if he wants to redeem his image."
In terms of pure passing I would go: Chris Paul Trae Young Ricky Rubio Nikola Jokic Josh Giddey - I know heaps biased but in terms of pure passing I genuinely reckon the man is very much up there. Watch some thunder games if U disagree.
This is Josh Giddey and a Thunder big man every game.   Still worth watching because that is a sick pass.
Westbrook - Brodie  Mike Muscala - Moose  Steven Adams - Funaki  Josh Giddey - The Wizard of Aus  Dort - Dort Knox  Kenrich Williams - Kenny Hustle  Gabriel Deck - Tortuga  Kevin Durant - Snek  Andre Roberson - Robes  Alex Abrines - Senor  Deonte Burton - Blockhead  Raymont Felton - Uncle Ray  Nick Collison - Mr. Thunder  Kyle Singler - The GOAT  Semaj Christon - Backwards James
Josh Giddey is the next Steve Nash

"When you think about this new generation of fans, scoring used to be top priority, but Lamelo does both scoring and passing... and with style. This is just something that a lot of people are excited to see. You can even hear Josh Giddey talk about how inspired they. Lamelo is good for the league no doubt."

"The reports directly after the draft were basically that the Grizzlies had made the trade with the intent of grabbing one of Josh Giddey or Franz Wagner. A lot of mocks had one or both falling to/past them so I guess it wasn't totally misguided, just didn't work out and Ziaire was their backup backup.  For Franz specifically, our POBO mentioned that they got several offers for Franz right after he was drafted, which he noted was uncommon. I'm guessing Sacramento and Memphis were at the top of that list."
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
Patty Mills saw Josh Giddey on the Thunder and thought it was the Olympics.
Why did we want to draft Josh Giddey then? Stop making things up to fit ur narrative
"I’ve seen that a lot with the rookies. Josh Giddey too. I guess people are super hopeful right now? Before they realize the players stopped developing and while everything is on the up-and-up? If I had rookie KAT, I’d be stoked. If I had KAT now, I’d be like, “not for Bam.” I would have thought KAT would be undoubtedly top 10 or so by now."
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23.

Wow did you guys watch josh giddey dribble and pass the ball?
"The Sixers, they had that awful call on Josh Giddey and Embiid, they are huge homers and just hard to listen to."
Josh Giddey with the near triple double!
Josh Giddey is white Magic Johnson
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
Tiktok star Josh Giddey turned NBA player
Bro are you a bot? I made a stupid shitpost comment about josh Giddey falling in love with steph or PG.
Josh Giddey will be first ballot HOF
Giannis and Josh Giddey  Not the same lol  One is a FMVP the other is a young and rising tik tok star/ball player
"I personally wouldn't,  but for one Giannis is a 1st ballot HOF. Who the hell cares who Josh Giddey idolized growing up?"
Lmaooo so no theories on who josh giddey idolizes?
Josh Giddey
This is so funny to me because Morris actions are clearly a cheap shot masked as a hard foul which  means it’s intent isn’t a injury however Jokics retaliation isn’t just an attempt to injure him but an attempt to cause bodily harm LOL. If this was Josh Giddey and Jokic y’all would have completely different takes
I stopped reading once I realised Josh Giddey wasn't on that list.
"its a common opinion that Mike Breen and Clyde Frazier are one of the best announcing duos in the league. And I'm a Knicks fan, why would I be praising the Nets crew if I was biased.  The Philly announcers are massive homers lol, they were complaining about Sixers fans getting outnumbered.  And remember these comments about [Josh Giddey](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qf65qw/highlight_76ers_commentator_with_an_interesting/)?"
What about josh giddey? He can pass and stuff too.
Facts. Then plus josh giddey.
Josh Giddey. Was told his weakness is basketball. Huge improvement.
"Lmao if KD said something like ""Barnes plays like the superstar Josh Giddey."" shit would break some award record"
Josh Giddey leads all Rookies in  1st Drives  1st Passes  1st Assists  1st Rebounds for all guards (3rd overall)  1st Potential Assists  1st Assists Points Created  1st Loose Balls Recovered
"Davion Mitchell deserves to be top 3. He’s putting up 16+ off the bench each night and probably the best on ball defender in the league. Josh Giddey isn’t even close to Mitchell, like at all"
"In theory, intent shouldn't matter when someone does something this negligent, especially when it's Joel Embiid, who has consistently just thrown his body around nearly injuring people. Just look at the video of him almost breaking Josh Giddey a couple of weeks ago. I'd love for him to be suspended because maybe it teaches him a lesson, but again, my comment about intent was in response to comment talking about the rule regarding punches. Should the rule be expanded to more explicitly cover something like this? Sure, but even if it did, you can't suspend someone by applying a rule that didn't exist at the time the incident occured retroactively."
"Josh Giddey and John Collins over here wondering what the fuck the Chicago announcers are talking about. Yeah, he wasn't trying to drop Ball in this particular instance but he has absolutely been dirty in the past..."
"OKC if you want to get hyped on Josh Giddey and see if Shai will take the next step...they will lose a ton though.  Memphis for Ja  Nuggets bc Jokic but they are not a whole team this year  If Memphis is west enough for you, Chicago is a great dark horse candidate. Lavine and DeMar not to mention Lonzo and Caruso. And Vuc. Demar and Zo are from LA, Zo and Lavine went to UCLA. Zo and Caruso obviously spent time together on the Lakers.  Warriors because we only get so many more years of Steph before he's gone."
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
Josh Giddey is on the Thunder! Greatest Australian NBA player of all time.
"Cut for Josh Green. Clearly the Thunder should trade Giddey and a pick for him. Come on, Presti, do it, do it!"
Is this your first Josh Giddey post on r/nba?
When Josh Giddey gains muscle and fills out his frame he’s gonna be like a Doncic-lite. Such good feel for the game and change of pace already. Knows how to create passing lanes and dribble until his teammates are open

SO who the heck is Josh Giddey?
OKC tanked for fucking Josh Giddey holy shit LMAO

I have no idea about Josh Giddey except he plays basketball.
they really tanked so blatant for Josh Giddey....
bruh FUCKING COREY IS ON THE TABLE TAKE HIM OKC YOU COWARDS who the fuck is josh giddey
lol Josh Giddey? bust for sure.
"Lmao, ""OKC loves Josh Giddey here."" Woj, can't help himself."
Josh Giddey
I think Josh Giddey could be one of the most fun players to watch in the league.
"Josh Giddey, because, I’m not sure why"
Taking josh giddey at 6
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
"Josh giddey? He can’t shoot, ball handlers that can shoot are useless unless you’re a generational slasher"
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Jalen Suggs  3. Evan Mobley  4. Franz Wagner  5. Josh Giddey  6. Jalen Green  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Jaden Springer  9. Moses Moody  10. Jalen Johnson  I biased my list towards high lotto picks that will get the most playing time and chances to succeed.
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Evan Mobley 3. Jalen Suggs 4. Jalen Green 5. Scottie Barnes 6. Jonathan Kuminga 7. James Bouknight 8. Franz Wagner 9. Josh Giddey 10. Ziaire Williams
"Star: boring take but Cade seems like the real deal  Bust: Josh Giddey. Flashy passer but a poor shooter without enough pros to outweigh my concerns  Steal: depends how high he goes but I have faith in Jalem Johnson being worth a late lottery pick. I've seen him mocked as high as 10 and as low as the 40s though, so hard to say how much of a steal he'd be. While we're on underrated Duke guys i think Matthew Hurt is also worthy of a first round pick but will likely fall to the mid second"
"Ben Simmons end’s up on the Kings for 9, Hield, Bagley, and 2 future picks and 2 pick swaps.   76ers then take Josh Giddey or Davion Mitchell at 9."
Yeah Josh Giddey is pretty good
God I don’t want Josh Giddey anywhere near this team
"Moses moody, josh giddey at 7."
"May be drafted higher than expected: Usman Garuba, Josh Giddey, Joshua Primo  May fall: Davion Mitchell, Kai Jones"
I could see Josh Giddey dropping 3-4 spots. I mean he shot less than 30% from 3
"It's probably more picks and someone like Bazley going the other way. I still think that the pressure is on Cleveland to win relatively soon and they could do with a guy like Jerome or Kenny Hustle off the bench. Nothing spectacular but just solid, productive role players. If Barnes is not there at 6 which is unlikely, moving up to get Mobley is the right move. For the Cavs, getting off Love and removing the obligation to pay Sexton provides greater flexibility. Garland, Allen and Okoro are all interesting young players. Adding a strong pick at 6 say Moses Moody or Franz Wagner or even Josh Giddey would fit nicely into their core"
Josh Giddey will be one of the best players in the draft.
"That still happens now.  Just scouring nbadraft.net , the first white guys i come across:  Franz Wagner - Nemanja Bjelica  Josh Giddey - Joe Ingles"
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11. Alperen Sengun (Charlotte Hornets) 12. Keon Johnson (San Antonio Spurs)  13. Davion Mitchell (Indiana Pacers)  14. Chris Duarte (Golden State Warriors)  15. Corey Kispert (Washington Wizards) 16. Trey Murphy (Oklahoma City Thunder)  17. Cameron Thomas (New Orleans Pelicans) 18. Jalen Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder)  19. Kai Jones (New York Knicks)  20. Jaden Springer (Atlanta Hawks) 21. Ziaire Williams (New York Knicks) 22. Jared Butler (Los Angeles Lakers) 23. Isaiah Jackson (Houston Rockets) 24. Sharife Cooper (Houston Rockets) 25. Tre Mann (Los Angeles Clippers) 26. Joshua Primo (Denver Nuggets) 27. Miles McBride (Brooklyn Nets) 28. Quentin Grimes (Philadelphia 76ers) 29. Day'Ron Sharpe (Phoenix Suns) 30. Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
I'm partial to Jonathan Kuminga due to his tools despite his shooting.   For the Warriors I think there's growing talk of drafting Josh Giddey out of Australia.
Gaining a lot of traction down in Australia due to the Josh Giddey talk but thats probably nothing compared to the other players
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
"Poku, Bol Bol, and Josh giddey on the perimeter please"
"Josh Giddey: How about shooting, mate?  Ben ""Nate Diaz"" Simmons: Oh so youre a wrestler now?"
"Josh Giddey, NBA rookie who is yet to play a game in the league and was barely a consensus top 10 pick, refuses to play second fiddle to former Rookie of the Year and borderline All Star Ja Morant."
"Idk much about their needs but maybe Moses Moody, Franz Wagner or Kai Jones would be a good fit and they’re all slotted around that area in the draft. Maybe Josh Giddey? Guess we’ll see"
You could say they are giddey for Josh
Watch 5 minutes of Josh Giddey and tell me he's a worst prospect than Kuminga
Josh Giddey. Learn his name.
Apparently they really want Josh Giddey who could go as high as 6  so the question is...is it up for Presti to get his fix?
Josh giddey the white lebron
I guarantee Josh Giddey wins ROY if he starts.
"Josh Giddey is white Ben Simmons, not Kyle Anderson"
You already have Josh Giddey in Anderson though
I think Josh Giddey wins ROY if he gets to start.
"If Kuminga is still there at 7 I don’t necessarily think the warriors would take him. He just doesn’t seem like a warriors kind of player. His feel for the game and bbiq isn’t there, and I don’t think the warriors are dying for another developmental pick after Wiseman (who’s arguably way further along then Kuminga). Imo the warriors would consider Moody or Josh Giddey even at 7."
Josh Giddey
We're on a pretty good streak right now.   One reporter asked if JaVale McGee's mom was alive.  Another asked Josh Giddey if he pooped.   And just a few days ago a third asked Devin Booker how frustrated he was about losing... on behalf of Chris Paul.   Can't wait to see what's next.
Josh giddey was asked if he pooped today
ESPN: Josh Giddey admits to having irregular bowel movements. How does this affect his draft stock?
2 Lotto picks makes it sound better than the reality of what they’re getting which would be like Alpren Sengun and Josh Giddey
"but at 10 the pelicans can probably get josh ""the next luka"" giddey"
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."

Josh Giddey is an underrated pick and will go 10-14.
The NBL is a great place for players to develop and Josh Giddey will be a steal of a player
"If Josh Giddey is given the keys to a team at pg, he will be an all star, if not, he will be lucky to be a good bench player"
I want Josh Giddey
"10 . New Orleans Pelicans Josh Giddey | 6-8 wing | 18 years old | Adelaide The player: Giddey had a terrific season in Australia, averaging 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, leading the league in helpers and finishing sixth in rebounding as an 18-year-old. He needs to tighten up his handle a bit and keep improving as a shooter, but the skill set here is perfect for that of a secondary playmaker at the next level due to how quickly he processes the game. Giddey should be a very high-level role player who starts, with some upside for more if the jumper gets figured out.  The fit: I have less of a feel for the Pelicans than any other team in the top 10. They have a tendency to draft younger (Kira Lewis, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes were all teenagers when they were picked, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker was 20 years old) under this regime. Plus, their backcourt of the future could use a bit more size. I’ve gone Giddey here, who would be a pretty great replacement for Lonzo Ball, given that Ball is a free agent and no guarantee to re-sign in New Orleans. One other note on Giddey: he has a lot of fans in ranges of the draft that aren’t his projected range, including Toronto — one of the few teams to send personnel to see him live this year in Australia. Don’t be surprised to see a team target him in a trade situation."
I can’t be mad with our draft haul but damnit I wanted josh giddey on the warriors bad. This kid is gonna be a valuable player for any contending team
Josh Giddey ends up better than Cade and #6 was a blessing in disguise.
Josh Giddey is up rn

Who wins in a hair-off between Josh Giddey and Ricky Rubio?
Probably: Jalen Green   Underrated pick: Josh Giddey
I'm here to simp Josh Giddey.
Josh Giddey = Ben Simmons without the diva attitude or refusal to shoot.
Opposite of Josh Giddey is JR Smith
Josh Giddey is putting up 30 &amp; 15 &amp; 15 per game which seals it as a sweep sadly.
"It seems as if   - ('Emoni Bates', 'Matt Bewley', 'Josh Giddey', 'Jalen Lewis', 'Kanaan Carlyle') ~ 549 (and counting)  have blown all of them out of the water then"
I don't know...5th worst team still has a 42% chance of falling in the top 4 (which the pick was protected up to). And the pick could fall all the way to 9.  I think OKC was in as good of a spot as they could have hoped: a 48% chance of getting pick #5. It just didn't work out. Really smart protection by Houston.  What's even more disappointing for OKC is their own pick falling to #6 (although Josh Giddey looked great in their one pre-season game).
"Got to meet Josh Giddey at SL, nice dude, super shy. It seemed as if he was meeting me and my friends more than us meeting him.  Hope the best for the thunder in a few years as well."
Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey is a giant Steve Nash who shoots like Pau Gasol.
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
"Josh Giddey also has a negative wingspan and he went 6th this year. But Bates' other measurements are terrible too, so I don't know. Certainly not what I expected from someone who is touted as a generation talent and the ""next KD"""
He’s like a more aggressive Josh Giddey
Where is daddy josh giddey
Kylie Jenner want Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey looked like a vet. Kid is going to be nice.
As a hornets fan who watched the game… Josh Giddey looks good y’all grabbed a great one OKC fans!
"Luka cut his teeth in Europe.  I think you had Ball go through Australia's next star program, come out then have a stand out ROTY season. That got people's attention on that league, now Josh Giddey probably gets drafted higher than expected because of it. So interestingly Lamelo may have built Giddeys brand up a little   A lot of fringe European and Asian talent have now jumped on it. If Giddey has a good rookie campaign and a few of those fringe players can raise their draft prospects then you may see a flood gate break on young players going overseas."
I’m not overreacting or anything but Josh Giddey is the greatest player of all time

It also doesn't make sense to intentionally lose games anymore - see the Thunder last season.  They did all that for Josh Giddey
Josh Giddey should be here considering he has a Tiktok and posts like 5 times a day
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
You can root for Josh Giddey!
"I was really debating whether to put Maledon or Giddey in the Westbrook spot, ultimately decided to go for the more established player, though maybe Josh would have fit better"
"You're looking at one situation where someone should have gotten drafted higher and acting like they don't scout overseas at all. Obviously they do, back to back years you've got guys out of your Australia going early and Josh Giddey before this season wasn't even projected to go first round. Sounds like scouting."
"Trae will have more career success than Luka early on, then Luka will go to the Hawks in free agency 2025 to team up with him. They’ll make the finals but lose to a tough Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic, who gets his first ring and has an alltime great playoff performance where he knocks off a solid Blazers team, the prior year champion Lakers, and an on the rise OKC team led by young studs Emoni Bates, Josh Giddey, and Amari George. Luka and Trae then proceed to win the next two finals, but fail to threepeat due to the poetic basketball of the Warriors which serves as the last hurrah for Steph, Klay, and Draymond but is a coming out party for young stud Jordan Walsh. Luka then returns to the Mavs, forming an intense rivalry with the Celtics who have added walking mismatch and former MVP Zion Williamson to their already all-NBA core of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bob Williams. The Mavs somehow triumph against the Celtics in Luka’s second year back, making him a Dallas legend. After a few years, he goes to the Lakers where he wins another chip and cements himself as a potential GOAT. By this point, Trae has retired largely due to recurring ankle injuries but is considered a top 10 PG of all time."
Josh Giddey is good
"Josh Giddey. No seriously. In just under 30 MPG he's averaging 1.6 and 0.8 as a rookie. If he just plays 36mpg that's starting to get close to 2 and 1, which is darn close. And the kid is a rookie. Maybe it's a small sample, but I see no reason that won't translate long term and increase as he gets used to the tempo of the game defensively."
