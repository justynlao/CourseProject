You should wait until you have been able to take the time to watch each team play a few times before making this big of a list for the season. Having James Johnson above Maxi Kleber and Willie Cauley-Stein above Trey Burke is unfathomable as a Mavs fan.
"Westbrook has shot 46 for 164 (28%) in the final 5 minutes of playoff games that were within 5 points, including 8 for 52 on threes.

"Let's put this way: to win the MVP you have to be dominant and lead your team to a great record. Impossible to win a RS MVP being just a good player.  Finals MVP is huge too but certain situations can lead to having a good player or anyway not MVP level winning the FMVP.  Iguodala, Billups, Dumars.  Kawhi won his first in 2014 he was a role player.  Tony Parker won it in 2007 but he wasn't an MVP caliber player.  Same for James Worthy, Cedric Maxwell and Dennis Johnson."
James Johnson (expiring) + Powell (11m/yr till 2023) + 2 2nd? Powell is great culture guy though :D
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
"They actively tried to stay mediocre though. Before the heat actually became good, we all were criticizing them for not allowing them to be worse and giving out largeish contracts to James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Olynk, Dion Waiters, Whiteside   And they got lucky to fall into Whiteside who was good for them for a couple years  Spo has done a good job definitely but the Heat’s focus was definitely different than Dallas’"
"What would the package be?  James Johnson, WCS/Dwight Powell and a pick for Andre Drummond? I have no clue, just spitballin here"
James Johnson dude is a black belt
Id fight James Johnson before any NBA player cause he'd knock me out in one punch so I'd feel minimal pain and I'm not even joking  Getting KO's by a monster who can land a shot is a better alternative then getting beaten up by some 6'7 freak athlete
"Always thought it was weird anytime a confrontation happened w/ him on court, ppl immediately start talkin bout ""he don't want smoke w/ james johnson tho"""
James Johnson has actual MMA fighting experience. He would probably mess up any NBA player.
James Johnson and it’s not even close
inb4 James Johnson
Pleasant: Jalen Brunson being back with 50/40/90 shooting splits  Unpleasant: James Johnson and Trey Burke playing 3rd and 4th most minutes because all of our starters got covid.
We love powell he is the only energy guy we have. If they wanted james Johnson we would agree in an heartbeat. No way we trade kleber.
Teams he wants to go to ain’t offering shit. If he wants to play for a winner he needs to go to Dallas. I heard James Johnson was the trade. I like it.   If he refuses we can send him to Minnesota. If he wanted to go to a good team then he shouldn’t have played like shit all year. Sorry HE did that.

"&gt;Never, we've also never seen a team quite like this with three all-world offensive players.  Yes, we have.  The Showtime Lakers with Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and JW ( Jamaal Wilkes or James Worthy, take your pick and they actually both for a few years ).  Throw in 3-time scoring champ Bob McAdoo off the bench, too.  Firepower like that has never been seen, and probably never will be.  The difference is, those Lakers could lock people down, too."
"Without all the freebies he gets from the refs, Jimmy B would just be a James Johnson type of player"
Conditioning can't be the only reason for James Johnson being allowed to run 4 straight possessions into the ground at the beginning of the fourth.
"THJ, James Johnson, Burke, Jalen Brunson. All have played that role this season or last; when you have that depth, you don't have to overplay your best player in the regular season (that doesn't help either)"
james johnson plays so out of control
"Look at Ben Simmons, Magic Johnson or to an ever reaching extent, James Wiseman (if he ever goes the finesse center route and not the rim racking explosive route) When you tall, your court vision is exceptional and when you can make the right pass, you can exploit a lot of crevices the normal point guard may not see."
was that james johnson or jamal mashburn
The Ty Jerome pick/trade was highly praised whilst the Cam Johnson pick was lambasted and not just by Suns fans. Was Mikal Bridges James Jones as well or Mcdonaugh's last hurrah? James Jones and Memphis have cornered the market on older prospects.
"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player *at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
It’s incredible that James Johnson is still an nba player. Like he has no idea what’s happening on the court.
"Josh Richardson and James Johnson are a combined 8/41 on 3’s off of passes from Luka  Analysis: that’s bad  THJ, Burke, and DFS shooting pretty well in fairness  https://go.nba.com/lh57"
We just don’t have other facilitators apart from luka. Burke and Brunson arent great at facilitating and James Johnson is a tuen over machine
In the few Mavs games I've watched it's been a LOT of James Johnson
James “Bloodsport” Johnson
Why is James Johnson getting minutes. What I’ve seen in the couple games I’ve watched is someone who doesn’t know what he is and keeps turning it over.
They also paid tf out of leonard and james johnson and someone else that were seen as awful contracts although they have gotten out of some of them admirably
"The season before his MVP run he also cooled off from an early start of 28-30 point games to like 19 point ones.  It's not a ESPN narrative if he does it every year for the last 5 seasons.  The ECF run gets overblown and he's had major injuries since then. Sometimes very good players can have hot streaks where they out play better players. James Worthy had a Finals run where he was out playing Magic Johnson and Kareem, but I wouldn't count on him doing that over the course of a season or for it to be something I should sit and count on.  And James Worthy's baseline is about two tiers above that of Paul Georges."
"Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Aldul Jabbar, Kevin McHale, James Worthy..."
they've had a stretch where they had to start garbage time players like wes iwundu and josh green and had james johnson run the 2nd unit  don't think it's reasonable to judge them right now
"Given that they WERE able to get out of the contracts of Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, and James Johnson, I think that it is safe to assume that was sarcasm.  Ah shoot. You knew it was sarcastic, didn't you....."
"&gt; Yeah, this post is ridiculous.  Nah u/mikeydale007 is right. This is too big of a hole to dig out of. The Heat are SO screwed.   Heat never should've traded this pick for Goran Dragic, who clearly hasn't contributed to the Heat at all. Yeah I know what you are gonna say...he's a leader of the Heat and he was arguably the Heat's best player for Rounds 1, 2, and 3 in the 2020 playoffs. But what happened in the Finals? He got injured and couldn't even play!  The Heat's 2021 first round draft pick, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be the next superstar.  Heat also won't be able to get out of the contracts of Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, and James Johnson. Those are untradeable contracts. Also, Winslow can't make it on the court at all. That's their youth movement? Get real.   And don't give me none of this ""Yeah but their best players have all missed tons of games due to covid protocols."" Just don't give me none of that because I don't have a good response to it."
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porziņģis missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porziņģis is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
"Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of:   &amp;#x200B;  C: Willie Caulie Stein  PF: Wes Iwundu  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Green  PG: Luka Dončić  with a bench of Boban, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, James Johnson  &amp;#x200B;  Porziņģis came back a few games ago but is still rusty and until last night we had been missing 3-4 starters. We were 6-4 before COVID hit, keep in mind that was also without Porziņģis. We have not played a single game with our projected starting lineup.   If you watch our games you will see that Luka is the only reason we are near 0.500. We've been garbage without him on the court. This is also coming from a huge Luka critic. I can't deny the impact he's had on our team. His 3PT shooting has been bad, but he's also had no spacing, and defenders are not respecting our shooters, so the lanes are clogged and teams are able to triple team Luka and leave Iwundu, Green and WCS wide open. Iwundu and Green are shooting 14.3 and 9.1% respectively from 3 and they've been two of our starters the past month.   If Dallas is still treading water when the COVID guys are back and get their conditioning back, and Porziņģis is in his groove, then sure, there are some valid concerns, but as it stands now, Luka has kept us in the playoff race despite being down our 2nd-6th best players for over half the season."
Drummond is one of the only dudes in the league where James Johnson may have some trouble with in a fight.
"I was against the Heat re-signing Whiteside.  I was against the Heat re-signing Waiters.  I was against the Heat re-signing Tyler Johnson.  I wasn't a big fan of re-signing James Johnson (though he did deserve his money).   &amp;#x200B;  I am fully onboard with paying Robinson. I'd rather pay him 15 instead of 20, but the spacing he's creating is invaluable. He's not just a good 3p shooter, he's great. He's elite."
"This is somehow already the 3rd or 4th Mavs game this year I've caught myself thinking ""who's that guy? oh! it's James Johnson; I forgot he's with the Mavs"". You'd think I'd remember at this point."
Wow James Johnson sucks. Stepping into the 3pt line while receiving a wide open pass?
"Team fans are really indignant to any ideas about trading their own players for someone else. We saw that with all the fans unwilling to trade Herro, Simmons or their other young pieces  But you have to weigh your options. Powell, WCS and James Johnson could be traded for Drummond and some draft compensation and it would be a win-win for both sides, for sure.   Hell, if you still feel stretched thin on depth, couldn't you also ask them for McGee because clearly he's the next big man to leave Cleveland?"
James Johnson is making $16m as an expiring
"I would think its Lowry in a three 3 trade. Example,  Toronto gets Beal  Dallas gets Lowry  Washington gets James Johnson (expiring), Powell (center with 2 addition years on the contract), 2 frps from Toronto (2023 and beyond), 2 srp from Toronto, 1 frp from Dallas (2022)."
"Yeah not really sure what Phoenix was thinking, haliburton getting groomed by a HOF Point God could’ve been a great situation for him.   I’ll give James Jones the benefit of the doubt because of Cam Johnson and Bridges, but yeah seems like a missed opportunity, kings fans know that feeling all too well."
He's no Lebron James Johnson but he'll do
James Johnson playing 25 minutes definitely isn’t ideal
"It's a testament to his greatness that it isn't lower. He was playing with James Johnson, Josh Green, and Willie Caulie Stein a lot of the time - do what you will with that information."
"I like James Johnson though, his ball handling and passing is nice when he doesn't overdo it. Caulley Stein on the other hand"
Meanwhile James Johnson is trying to fight someone for some reason.
James Johnson is a liability yet again
Stop sleeping on James Johnson
ESPN: Is James Johnson the best defender in the NBA?
James Johnson DPOY confirmed
We sucked.  Then we were really good.   Then we got COVID.   Who knows how we are.    The only things I know are:  Wes Iwundu sucks on offense  James Johnson tries to do too much.  Half the time it is awesome and half the time it is terrible.  Timmy should be recovering right now not playing but too short handed.
James Johnson is a better fighter for sure
"It’s part of the chess game of basketball unfortunately, i hate seeing games with high amount of free throws I wanna see points on the board from mfs putting up buckets but everyone’s looking for some edge any edge like how do I stop you how do I contain you how can I throw you off your game and that’s where the foul baiting comes in...if there’s a great defender or even a regular ass defender in the game James harden prolly looking at that like yeah I can cook this dude but if I can get him in foul trouble imagine how much easier it will be to cook up the next man in the lineup...for example remember how absolutely filthy disgusting the play where harden dropped Wesley Johnson licked his lips and hit the 3 I’m pretty sure wes was not the initial defender that was guarding James from the start of the game soon as the second man comes into the game u got a potential highlight in the making which can become a commercial or a social media trend so from a player perspective it makes my life easier to score even if your the best scorer in the game and from a coaching strategy standpoint it’s like if both teams are riding bikes and I happen to shove a stick in your spoke it’s gonna bring you to a halt and you fall flat on your face if your player gotta sit on the bench cuz of foul trouble it’s like wtf we healthy but can’t use our full strength and now dude is gonna get cold sitting on the bench....foul baiting is shoving a stick in the spoke of your opponent’s bike"
"James Johnson has actually been a good playmaker for the second unit, they've been running him as point forward a lot."
"they are down 3 starters, including their main secondary playmaker (JRich). James Johnson is bringing the ball up the floor ffs"
"Udonis Haslem , Rudy gobert, Thad young , Jrue holiday, Rajon rondo , James Johnson"
"I played against James Johnson in high school. It, uh, didn't go well. His nickname was Baby Melo back then."
Zeke’s teammates  - Joe Dumars  - Mark Aguirre - Bill Lambieer - Vinnie Johnson  - Best offense: +3.0  Mark Price’s Teammates  - Bead Daughtery - Larry Nance - Craig Ehlo  - Best Offense: +5.7  Kevin Johnson’s Best Teammates Pre-Barkley  - Tom Chambers - Jeff Hornacek - Armen Gilliam (?)  Best Offense: +5.3  Magic’s Teammates in 1989  - James Worthy - Byron Scott - A.C Green  Offense: +6.0  The offensive numbers I’m providing are how much better their ORTG was compared to league average btw (on bball ref)
"Folks looking for a good time should check out the Pistons' three-guard rotation's production that entire finals series. Isiah, Joe, and Vinnie were already all killers; then you take away Byron Scott from that Lakers lineup and man... those dudes were a problem. They combined for 85 points on 29-46 shooting (63%) in Game 1 when Magic was still healthy and it only got worse from there.   I'd be curious to see what other three-guard lineups have ever decimated a Finals series the way those three did in 1989.   Joe Dumars: 27.3 points (57.6 percent shooting) 6.0 assists  Isiah Thomas: 21.3 points (24 ppg through most of the series) 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals   Vinnie Johnson: 17 points per game off the bench (60 percent shooting)  And you want to know someone else who never gets the love he deserves?   James Edwards."
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"
Trey Burke and James Johnson had the lowest +/- yesterday and today....the two games we needed them to step up in bigger roles. Says a lot.
Yo THJ scored 0 points and James Johnson still has the team low -23 +/-....wtf
Let's see Norman Powell fight James Johnson then Rick vs Nick
i don't think so   starting jalen fucks up the second unit and forces guys like james johnson  to do things they shouldn't be doing
James Johnson should never make a pass on a fast break
James Johnson
"James Johnson, I love you, but pls don't do this to us"
"Heroball was yesterday and may well return later this game, but this was one of the most passive Luka  quarters of the year so I have no idea what would prompt the comment in this one.  He took 3 shots and wasn't really even handling the ball as much as usual as Brunson was playing with the starters and we had some irrational James Johnson possessions.  The one random turnover I guess?"
James Johnson lost weight damn! I think he got fat last year so he could get out of Miami. That's the only reason I can think of. Like why TF would you get fat.
Is that my boy James Johnson?
"Full Text for people who can't access the article:  &gt;**Houston, Seattle Feels Your Loss**  &gt;*With whipsawing trades and other player movement routine in the N.B.A. these days, it’s hard to be loyal to teams and players.*  &gt;SEATTLE — If you’re a fan of the Seattle SuperSonics, jilted long ago despite decades of loyal love, you’re seriously happy for the last great talent from your team.  &gt;That would be Kevin Durant.  &gt;After a year spent rehabilitating a torn Achilles’ tendon, Durant now seems to be living his best life in Brooklyn as the leader of the Nets. His odds of winning a third N.B.A. title received a significant boost when a blockbuster trade reunited him this week with James Harden, his close friend and former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.  &gt;Durant, Harden and Kyrie Irving on the same team? Scintillating, so long as they end up on the same page.  &gt;But if you’re a die-hard Sonics fan — and yes, count me in that group — the happiness felt for one of basketball’s transcendent superstars comes with a flip side.  &gt;We see Durant and are forced to reckon with all the unfulfilled possibilities.  &gt;Recall that the slim, do-everything forward spent his rookie season in Seattle. He was only 19, but he led the team through a dreary and uncertain 2007-08 season. He wasn’t just good, he was prodigiously good; so full of talent and joy that watching him made the doomsday talk of the Sonics’ possible relocation drift away.  &gt;Then reality hit. April 13, 2008. The last game played at the old KeyArena: a win sealed by a Durant jump shot.  &gt;Soon the team moved to Oklahoma City, where it began anew as the Thunder. (Pardon the crankiness, but they’ll always be the Tumbleweeds to me.)  &gt;It’s been 12 years, but the stinging questions remain.  &gt;What would have happened to Durant and our team if the Sonics had never left?  &gt;And how much should fans expect their devotion to be mirrored by professional sports leagues, team ownership and the players we most admire?  &gt;I’m typical of many in Seattle. The Sonics will always be in my blood. I’m comfortably middle-aged, but I can close my eyes and remember my first N.B.A. game: the bright colors and sharp sounds and even the smells of buttered popcorn and roasted peanuts in the old coliseum nestled near the Space Needle.  &gt;I was 6, and the Sonics were playing Jerry Sloan and the Chicago Bulls. I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  &gt;A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  &gt;We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  &gt;In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  &gt;Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  &gt;One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  &gt;That’s love.  &gt;I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  &gt;Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  &gt;We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  &gt;Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  &gt;The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  &gt;Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  &gt;The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  &gt;We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  &gt;It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  &gt;Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  &gt;Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  &gt;Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team.

"These stats on their own don’t say much without [watching the shots so here we go](https://go.nba.com/4ynm)  3 7:18 off the offensive board LaVine does a solid job staying in Lukas hip space. Luka also kind of looks gased already and settles here a little   3 4:18 LaVine is fine but the help defense here really makes the play that combined with it being a tough angle for the skip pass in the corner to James Johnson who isn’t exactly Karl Anthony towns from 3 is part of why there is no pass   3 3:38: stays in his hip probably the best defensive clip yet although again Luka kinda pre determined 7 left on the clock he was taking the step back. Still this is solid work   4 5:00 open spot up off a give and go not much to see here   4 2:22 this is pretty uninspired defense but it’s also near the end of a 17 point game so not really gonna care too much   He did his job billy talked about limiting his hip space in that video, LaVine has always been better on ball than off ball he was guarding Kawhi Leonard last week that didn’t go as well did better here. I do think Luka being just exhausted played a big part of all this"

James Johnson stop passing

"james johnson has like 5 turnovers as a role player, that's just not excusable"
James Johnson should not be doing anything else than spotting up for 3s.

"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."
"LeBron, Wade and Bosh agreed to team up together years before they actually did.  From [April 2010](https://www.wbur.org/news/2010/04/28/heat-celtics-4):  &gt; Ray Allen scored 24 points to help Boston beat Miami 96-86 on Tuesday night and eliminate the Heat in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series. It could be the last game in Miami for Wade, or it could be the beginning of a new era there if he returns and recruits LeBron James to join him. &gt;  &gt; ""This will be my last first-round exit for a while, I can tell you that,"" Wade said. ""I'm looking forward to continuing to build, and being with some great players next year, continuing to beef up our roster.  From [May 2010](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5224873):  &gt; Dwyane Wade has a big decision to make on where he'll sign this offseason. And before he makes his choice, he said he'll talk it over with fellow big-ticket free agents LeBron James and Joe Johnson. &gt;  &gt; Wade told the Chicago Tribune that he's not sure when the three players will talk, but they've been discussing their futures informally for a while now. &gt;  &gt; ""[Free agency] has been three years coming,"" the Miami Heat superstar told the Tribune. ""We've discussed it prematurely, at different times. [But] you don't know what guys are thinking and where they're going. I think we'll all sit down, and before one of us makes a decision, all of us will have spoken to each other and [listened to the] thinking. &gt;  &gt; ""A lot of decisions [will be based on] what other players are willing to do and what other guys want to do. So it's not just a 'me' situation here. We all have to look and see what each other is thinking."" &gt;  &gt; A source told ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard that the Toronto Raptors' Chris Bosh also will join Wade, James and Johnson when they discuss free agency. &gt;  &gt; ""Bosh will definitely be there,"" a source said."
Looking at your flair reminded me of James Johnson. Guessing no buy out for him too?
"The Suns are still a playoff team with Rubio instead of CP3. James Jones contracted a deep and balanced team by getting Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne and Torrey Craig. Plus James Jones traded for CP3. CP3 is the difference between being around the 6/7 seed and being the 1/2 seed, but James Jones built this roster and hired Monty Williams. He deserves credit for what he's done, saying CP3 is the only reason for the Suns improvement is ignorant"

"Yup. Of course adding CP3 was huge, but James Jones hiring Monty Williams, acquiring Cam Johnson and Dario Saric, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig etc. Has given this team amazing depth and experience. This team can make a playoff run because of that"
James Jones got CP3 for Ricky Rubio and Kelly pines. Goat move.  He also got cam Johnson and saric for Jarrett culver.

"79 points and up by 20 at the half without James Harden and with KD playing only 8 minutes.  Shamet and Johnson are out too. Obviously not great players, but both being out means that G League Chris Chiozza is the only other ball handler aside from Kyrie."
James Johnson is a good passer
"you must be a complete moron, stan, for allowing james johnson to touch the ball so much. what the fuck are you doing."
This. You don’t want KD getting his first minutes against a tough opponent like James Johnson
Didnt know James Johnson plays like a GOAT still

James Johnson has never did anything on the court that makes me think he can fight. All this black belt shit is internet gossip.  Show me some footage?
"&gt; Previous big 3’s also had one player who was past his prime. Kareem was in his late 30s.   I am going to call the flair police and have yours confiscated.  Abdul-Jabbar was 32 when they drafted Magic Johnson -- and won MVP that season -- and Jamaal Wilkes was 26.  Two years later, they added James Worthy with the first overall pick."
Somebody call James Johnson to deliver the head kick to Dwight.

"&gt;the Pelicans oRTG this year is 115. The Mavs last year wasn 115.9.  The Mavs' relative oRTG was still much better. And this is a bit of a weird season because of the lack of fans. Average TS% is something like 57% which is pretty ridiculous; so many guys are shooting the lights out.   &gt;only problem with personnel now is Bledsoe is cheeks  This is a bigger problem than you make it seem. A 31 year old declining two way net negative playing 30+ minutes a night is a horrendous decision, especially since the Pels have a ton of young guards (NAW, Kira, Hart) who could eat those minutes. Plus, even though Adams has been *just alright* and the Pels are a top rebounding team, they haven't been good enough on defense to warrant extending him for 35 mil. James Johnson has looked productive so far, I hope he can help out.   &gt;the coach is fine  I'm amazed a Pelicans fan is saying this. I gotta keep an eye on my young core so I've watched a lot of the Pels and SVG hasn't shown me anything to think he's better than a bottom tier coach. It took him half the season to realize that he can go to Zion in the clutch. I lost count of the number of clutch games y'all lost because Ingram had the green light to hero ball and iso into a turnover or low percentage shot. Overall the Pelicans have looked like a sloppy, poorly coached team in a lot of their clutch games (remember that Pacers game?). And his defensive game plan is horrible. The Pels routinely get burned by giving up open threes. Y'all don't have the roster to be that bad. I get that he has a bigger offensive load but Ingram's defense has regressed HARD since his LA days.   Even when the Pelicans are healthy there's a lot to be desired. Injures are far from their only problem, but they do have the talent to compete above the 8 seed."
"Well the coach is fine and quite honestly the only problem with personnel now is Bledsoe is cheeks. We got a depth wing finally in James Johnson who has done shockingly well.   Right now the main issue is we got a ton of injuries all at one time. The team as a whole has been good with some young guy issues plaguing them, which is why the record is the way it is. 12 blown double digit leads will do that  Edit: just to let you know btw, the Pelicans oRTG this year is 115. The Mavs last year wasn 115.9. Not too much difference there."
"Rodman is insane, dirty, and assaulted a camera man  Garnett is my all time least favorite player other than Pedo Malone. He was a dick to everyone, even mocking Tim Duncan's dead mother on mothers day  Lamar Odom was a criminal that would do anything to make money  Metta World Peace is insane and tried to murder James Harden   Iggy is a really good guy, no problems with him  Rondo is an arrogant bitch and a stain on the Celtics history  Jimmy Butler is fine  Magic Johnson is one of my favorite players, but also one of my team's biggest rivals   If he replaced Butler and Iggy with Karl Malone and Blake Griffin this would be my all time least favorite players list"
James Johnson?John wall? I’d probably add demar and dame in there too
"The perimeter defense is designed to give up 3's rather than allow inside scoring. This results in teams lighting the pelicans up from 3, which in this era especially is tough.  The team collapses regularly in the 2nd half. This may be the result of their youth but they certainly don't seem like they want to win games. They have a hard time staying hungry and focused.  SVG has made some very questionable decisions around rotations and holding off on timeouts.  Eric Bledsoe is an incredibly frustrating player to watch. He makes some really sub-NBA level decisions every game and his defensive focus/effort is often truly awful.  A lot of the pieces don't complement one another.  The team hasn't really had a solid back-up 3 or 4 until the trade to get James Johnson.  The offense can grow very stagnant with Ingram getting tunnel vision and dribbling out the clock before putting up a contested midrange jumper. He's made a lot but missed a lot too.  Overall the team is just very young and poorly constructed."
"My point is fmvp doesn’t make you the best player on the team, nor does it make you a superstar, nor would it just make you better than actual superstars. If you told someone in 1988 that James worthy even after he balled out in the finals was better than magic Johnson or even someone like Hakeem who didn’t win a title till the mid 90s they’d laugh in your face. There are actual role players who have won fmvp doesn’t make them better than Chris Paul"
Omg if you think James worthy was better than Magic Johnson the year he won finals mvp than your out of your mind. And if you think Danny green has any kind of argument to be a better player than Chris Paul in 2013 I just don’t know what say
"who was Karl Malone competing against for first-team All-NBA honors in the 90s?  Barkley?  Shawn Kemp?  Larry Johnson?  Barkley is an all-timer but after that it gets pretty thin, whereas Dirk was competing against KG, Duncan, LeBron James, Chris Webber, Jermaine O'Neal and more.  And again, even if you think Malone is ahead of Dirk (we disagree on this, obviously), there's zero argument for Karl Malone over Moses, Jerry West or Oscar."
"For me, it’s hard to balance what is good coaching/system and what is good development. It seems pretty safe to say that the continued development of guys like Bam, DRob, Herro has to be partially credited to the organization. But, the Heat have also had quite a few players that seemed developed here and perform worse on other teams (JRich, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Norris Cole, Chalmers). So, I do think that the Heat are one of the better developmental teams, but I also think they develop players to specifically fit their system and they may not seem as developed elsewhere. Also shout out to the Nuggets, Grizz, Spurs and Raptors, they know how to max out the potential of their players"
"I honestly cannot believe that the trade value wasn’t that high. Like, the Mavs could’ve traded a first round pick and Jalen Brunson, James Johnson and Dwight Powell,"
"1. Washington - Cade Cunningham, PG, OKlahoma St.   2. Magic - Jalen Green, G, G League  3. Raptors - Jalen Suggs, G, Gonzaga  4. Sacramento - Evan Mobley, C, USC  5. Warriors - Jonathan Kuminga, F, G League  6. OKC - Moses Moody, G/F, Arkansas  7. Detroit - Keon Johnson, SG, Tenn  8. Cleveland - Jalen Johnson, F, Duke  9. OKC - Scottie Barnes, F, FSU  10. Magic - James Bouknight, SG, UConn"
I could see a veteran wing like james Johnson helping out the mavs defense.
James Johnson so fake he made up an undefeated MMA record.
"There would definitely be guys scared of playing LeBron, Harden, KD because of how hard they can embarrass them. There aren't many enforcers anymore for players to fear physically though. Probably just James Johnson but it's not like he's ever actually socked anyone"
"Now that James Johnson is gone, we wouldn’t stand a chance."
He's also not that big. James Johnson looked bigger.
"That's just patently false. You can say we tried to offload him because we're skeptical about paying him but not because we can't afford to. We have 30 mil coming off the books just from Adams extension and James Johnson expiring. Another 18 mil available by trading Bledsoe, if we needed to, which becomes easier next season as that is the last fully guaranteed year on his contract. Are we interested in maxing Lonzo? Doubtful but the ball is in our court (no pun) and if he continues to play like he has been then I think we'll hold on to him.  Obviously we see him as an asset, otherwise we would have taken anything for him like we did JJ, so I can't see us letting him walk for nothing."

the rare win win. meant james johnson about the attitude above but i guess that could also mean JJR too lol. excited to see what he can do with Luka once he’s healthy.
It’s fine they have a somehow revived James Johnson now. Smh he was never like this for us but Melli has been amazing here too. Win win trade.
"I felt like James Johnson fell off a cliff after we traded him. All those dudes (Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson) kinda did - good to hear he's having a renaissance with you guys!"
That’s how you we are trash. When James fucking Johnson is running circles around your defense and hitting iso threes your team is in trouble
was James Johnson this good on the Mavs? How did we get him lol
Want to see Steph play with Lebron? You just saw Steph with a 40 inch vert play with Lebron James Johnson
James Johnson!
They’re weathering the loss of James Johnson surprisingly well
Starting two centers and James Johnson at the 3? Stan really trying to form a fucking wall
Not necessarily. I would argue Magic Johnson and James Worthy are a tougher opponent than Dirk and Jason Kidd (And that Lebron had the better team)
"He wasn't even ""cancelled"". He never got PT because he's a low IQ player that makes too many mistakes and Nurse didn't trust him on the defensive end. You only get PT if you can earn Nurse's trust defensively. We thought he would be further along but he still makes the same dumb mistakes that he did in his rookie season. If the Raps front office felt he could play and contribute, we wouldn't have traded him. People are turning it into an ethical issue when it wasn't even that. James Johnson had similar offseason troubles and we still signed him."
"I hope he succeeds, but that’s probably not the best benchmark for where he’s at. Just as a reference, some of the other players that were playing really well for the USA were James Nunnally, and 39 year old Joe Johnson. I don’t think they played a single team with a guy that’s even been on an NBA summer league team."

I cocked the joint back and banged on em - James Johnson  https://youtu.be/lsIiB5OPy7U
James Johnson has been solid his first 2 games  Wes shooting isn’t great but his defense is good  I expect JJ to be in the rotation once everyone is back and for Wes to maybe sneak in the rotation every 3 games or so
The last player to win 3 MVPs in a row was Larry Bird. 1984-86. Magic Johnson didn’t do it. Jordan didn’t do it. Tim Duncan no. Lebron James no. Steph Curry no.   Giannis isn’t going to be rewarded with something even the GOATs didn’t accomplish when this season his team is performing worse (3rd seed) than in the prior 2 seasons where he won MVP.
"Missed this before lock, my b.   I Ran Bledsoe, NAW, James Johnson , Siakam, Towns, Kira Lewis, Giannis, and Goodwin"

"Hawks probably have the edge  Lou, Bogi, Snell, Okongwu, Capela, Hill, Huerter, Goodwin, Knight &gt; Bled, NAW, Iwundu, James Johnson, Adams, Lewis, Hayes, Marshall"
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"I went to high school in milwaukee, my school played his many times. He ok. 100% the best player on the court but i was never blown away like i was watching jalen johnson or james graham.   He doesn’t play like jordan, he plays like Giannis if Giannis took more threes. He’s definitely gonna make the league. Alex definitely needs to get better but he’ll be scary once pro teams have him in the gym 4 hours a day and he gets stronger. His defense is mega questionable though. Lots of dumb fouls and using his size and athleticism to defend rather than technique. But that’s something he can fix. I can’t speak to his mentality but he did attack a ref after his final game senior year. Take that as you will."
"If he approached the team and offered to forego his entire remaining salary in return for his release in order to sign closer to home, the Pels probably would done it. The $6M or so in savings is worth more than James Johnson and a 2nd-round pick.   He wanted to have his cake and eat it, too. He wanted to keep his whole salary but also dictate his exact destination."
"Perk doesn't belong there. Ron Artest, Bill Laimbeer, Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason, Robert Parrish, Karl Malone, James Johnson, Matt Barnes, Zach Randolph, David West, Robin Lopez, Udonis Haslem, Steven Adams above Kendrick Perkins. Perk is just mean mug dude. Steven Adams is more of an enforcer than Perk will ever be even if he doesn't do the ugly mean mug like Perk did."
Just because he mugs and scowls doesn’t mean he’s an enforcer. I’d rather put James Johnson on here.
"Michael Jordan   LeBron James  Larry Bird  Magic Johnson  Shaq  Scrubs, trash players the lot of them."
"Of course I don't know the details, but what is NO supposed to do? Only being able to form a trade with Boston, Knicks, Brooklyn, Philly, or Washington (not even sure if Washington is considered northeast) is quite a constraint.  But at the same time, a 2nd round pick, James Johnson and Wesley Iwundu really isn't much. Hard to believe NO couldn't have got a similar package. But maybe those five teams simply weren't interested in Redick. So maybe just don't make promises to players, no matter how experienced or nice that player is."
"Sure, but it costs more than trading him. James Johnson and Inwundu came back to match contracts so they essentially broke even, as opposed to losing money by coming to a buyout with Redick."
"IMO you’re getting more value out of doing right by them, goodwill will get around and even if players don’t necessarily love the city, they‘ll like the organization. If they hate both the city and organization, won’t they try and go anywhere but New Orleans? Besides, not like it was some amazing offer, it was a second rounder and James Johnson, that’s basically no value."
"You got a second round pick and James Johnson, it's not like you guys got an insane deal for him that you couldn't possibly turn down."
"&gt;chose"" to pay James Johnson  chose to pay him more"
He's 36 with two kids.  Is the second round pick and James Johnson really worth having a dude nearing retirement with a huge podcast saying your whole front office is full of snakes?
JJ. Barea -&gt; Justin Jackson -&gt; James Johnson -&gt; JJ. Reddick.
"He ""chose"" this before covid hit and now he can't see his family because his kid would have to quarantine for a week anytime he would fly down. The Pelicans also ""chose"" to pay James Johnson the same money for a draft pick in the 50s."
"Choosing starters for all time Lakers ain't easy, here's my picks with bench in parentesis:    PG: Magic Johnson (Jerry West)  SG: Kobe Bryant (Gail Goodrich)  SF: LeBron James (James Worthy)  PF: Anthony Davis (Pau Gasol)  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Shaquille O'Neal)"

"&gt;Divac was young and it would take a few more years for him to develop. Not really enough to take out the Bulls. I already mentioned James Worthy. He started to breakdown in 1991-92, same year Magic retired. Sam Perkings and AC Green are good players, but I'm not convinced they can beat a superior Bulls team.   Horace Grant, BJ Armstrong, and Bill Cartwright constitute some unbeatable juggernaut?  No, and not even close. Very questionable that those 3 are even better than their Lakers' counterparts.  &gt;Also, can't really mention draft picks because that is directly related to the Lakers poor performance after Magic's retirement.  First of all, we're talking about Jerry West, well before he got bored with winning titles.  So that really doesn't matter.  He drafted excellent players all over board, and when he needed to, he flipped veterans to move up and get better players.  West picked Divac at 26, 15-year vet Eldon Campbell at 27, 17-year vet Derek Fisher at 24, etc.  Second, Van Exel was a second round pick, so that's just completely wrong. Peeler was #15, and Jones #10, and it's relatively easy to trade up to those spots, if need be, and they wouldn't need both.  &gt;At that point, you have Magic around 35 years old and All-Star level Divac going up against a prime Hakeem.  Olajuwon and company won 47 games in 1995. The Lakers won 48, without Magic.   Those Rockets also struggled against all 3 of their Western Conference playoff opponents, so it's very easy to imagine the Lakers with Johnson taking them out.  You have your opinion, but you lack a grounding in facts to make it meaningful."
"THT is overyhyped by Lakers fans but he ***absolutely*** has more trade value than Rubio. Rubio is pretty close to neutral value at this point, probably even negative value.  Last offseason Minnesota sent out James Johnson (salary filler at this point in his career), pick #17, pick #50, and two 2nd rounders and they got in Ricky Rubio, pick #23, and pick #28.  So basically Ricky Rubio is the difference between pick #17 and picks #23 + #28. He's just a body at this stage of his career."
"&gt;Prime Pippen hard locked Magic in 91   ""Locked"" him to 19/12/8.  &gt;but he retired at the beginning of the end of his career.  He won MVP only the preceding season, and was a close second to Michael Jordan in his final year.  &gt;They only really had Byron Scott to build around  You haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about.  In 1991, the Lakers had a 22 year-old future Hall of Fame center,  29 year-old James Worthy, 29 year-old Sam Perkins, and 27 year-old AC Green.  The following seasons saw them draft Anthony Peeler,  Nick van Exel, and Eddie Jones.  With Magic Johnson, the early nineties Lakers would have been one of, if not the, best teams in the league."
"You're really out here trying to say that a team who had:  Dwight howard force his way there via trade  signed Steve Nash and Lebron James in free agency  and had even more players try to force their way there like Chris Paul ""haven't had interest from stars? lol  Ok, you say that's too recent, let's go back farther and look at a few free agent signings:  - Rajon Rondo  - KCP  - Derek Fisher  - Ron Artest  - Horace Grant  - Karl Malone  - Gary Payton  - Mitch Richmond   - Ron Harper  - Rick Fox  - Shaq  - Magic Johnson  is 30 years enough or should we go farther?"
"The Nets have the NBA’s second-best record and second-best offense since landing James Harden. They’ve managed this despite Kevin Durant missing 24 games in that span, Kyrie Irving missing nine, and Steve Nash’s coaching staff having to cobble together a back half of the rotation reliant on up-and-down performers like Landry Shamet, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Tyler Johnson. Harden has still managed to thrive despite the roster instability, leading the league in minutes and assists while also averaging 26 points and nine rebounds per game to keep Brooklyn surging. -Dan Devine"

"exactly.  that's considered the golden era of the nba.  writers and fans have waxed nostalgic about those teams for 40 years.  the celtics had former mvp bill walton coming off their bench to back up their front line of 3 hall of famers.  the lakers had #1 overall pick magic johnson passing to #1 overall pick kareem and #1 overall pick worthy.  i mean to some degree, i don't like any of the superteams because you kind of think ""what's the point?"" if you just win by stacking your team.  what are you really proving to anyone (at least if you are the players)?  but if we're going to criticize durant for wanting harden because it's not honorable and goes against the spirit of competition, then shouldn't we expect kareem and magic to have gone to the lakers front office and say ""i know we screwed some team out of the #1 overall pick and we can add james worthy, but it really doesn't seem to be very competitive to add him to our already stacked team, maybe just trade the pick for nothing.""  obviously it sounds ridiculous, but why is it OK to end up on a dynasty that rolls over the league for a decade because your GM made it happen but not OK if a player makes it happen?  aren't the player and GM both pulling in the same direction for the team?  it's still the exact same thing from the perspective of all the other teams."
"Zion  BI  James Johnson  Hayes  Adams  Would probably be the answer for the Pels, though there would be zero shooting outside of BI and maybe Johnson"
"What impresses me about James Jones is how much I doubted his moves. Like obviously I'm a dumbass but the way that everything I've doubted has just turned out to be very savvy is incredible to me.  6th for Dario and 11th (became Cam Johnson). Very good move that I didn't trust at the time.  Signing Cam Payne before the bubble - huge move that I didn't trust at the time.  Trading Oubre and Rubio for CP3 + Nader - made me very nervous, wasn't confident in this one, obvious home run in hindsight.  I have not been able to say ""I don't like this move but I trust the FO"" before (I was a kid in the Nash days and didn't know that a GM was even a thing). Even the weirdo shit like the Warren trade, while suboptimal in terms of return, gave the space to sign Rubio which led to CP3. And then more obvious good moves like hiring Monty Williams. I don't know about the Nets' moves well enough to know how Jones' resume stacks up against Marks, but I can say if James Jones wins it, he's shown that he would be a worthy winner."
I think Zion is more like Larry Johnson &amp; Lebron James because of how athletic he is &amp; the fact that he has the ability to stretch the floor which Shaq never did.

"I think the only realistic suitor for Drummond was Dallas - who could've offered James Johnson, Dwight Powell and a second or something.  The issue is that Dwight Powell has become a negative contract since his ACL tear. Trading an expiring Drummond to take on a couple of years of bad, 10M annual salary in Dwight isn't worth the second round picks Dallas would throw at Cleveland to try to compensate."
James Johnson if he'd reached his full potential
Steph Curry? LeBron James? Kobe Bryant? Magic Johnson?
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."

"Now that all 13 are out I'll bite the bullet and rank my personal peaks based on these videos alone.  1. Lebron James, simply put that version of Lebron is quite literally unstoppable on both sides of the court.   2. Shaquille O'Neal, I would have him #1 but in terms of offensive dominance only Steph really rivals him but in other avenues.  3. David Robinson, yes really, criminally underrated stretch for him that gets overshadowed by Hakeem. In those years he was either scoring leader, blocks leader, DPOY, or all of those.  4. Steph Curry, really wanted to have him higher and don't get me wrong Steph is an underrated defensive player but the 3 ahead of him brought it both ways at a high level but Currys offense alone catapults him over a bunch of 2 way guys in this list.  5. Kevin Garnett, another one that's probably a head scratcher but hear me out. At his peak he was an MVP, first team all defense, first team all nba, and was able to drag a lifeless team to the WCF as a supposed not #1 option. We can have the debate about Duncan being better all time which is not debatable imo but I've always said I'd take peak Garnett over Peak Duncan.  6. Michael Jordan, this isn't to say Jordan isn't better than these ppl, just that the stretch Ben chose (although valid) I personally would have gone back a year on each to account for 1988 when he was DPOY, MVP, but to each their own.  7. Tim Duncan, again like Garnett you had someone who was MVP, First team all nba and defense, and was winning finals MVPs. I guess I underestimated his defensive value because I only watched him 2010 and on when (to me) it seemed like he was just a post defender.  8. Hakeem Olajuwon, really Hakeem should be higher but like Jordan, his PEAK wasn't much better than his career (which is a compliment) so he falls to the wayside.  9. Larry Bird, now this is tough because Larry was god tier on both sides of the ball but not quite dominant in the sense that ppl like Shaq or Hakeem were.   10. Kobe Bryant, this is tough again because the game was different and Kobe's game was heavily ""mid 2000s"" with tons of mid range jumpers and contested fadeways. The fact that he was first team all defense while averaging 35 a game says something though.  11. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tremendous peak but really he was good for his entire career even until his 40s which hurts him IMO. 6 MVPs with his first being in 1971 and the last being in 1980 means his career was basically a peak, much like lebron.  12. Magic Johnson, wasn't too impressed with his video and this is me being young and not understanding his impact. Very good offensive player but very poor defensive player on anyone who was laterally quick and didn't play in the post.  13. Bill Walton, least impressive peak by far but not someone I even expected on this list. Never knew how good of a passer and shot blocker he was.  He didn't post these but here are some good honorable mentions:  - 08/09 Dwyane Wade - 17-19 James Harden - 15-17 Russell Westbrook - 90-93 Charles Barkley - 16-18 Lebron - 07-09 Lebron - 75-78 Julius Erving"

"Well.. I was around at the time, and I don't recall anybody thinking any differently of Jordan ascending to the throne than they did when Thomas and the Pistons finally beat the Celtics. Or when they then went onto beat the Lakers.   Even though Bird and Magic both had their respective careers cut short by health issues, like Isiah.   I don't think people define any player's entire career by a single rivalry. I think their view it on the basis of what that person accomplished.   I mean, do people say that Magic lost to Thomas in the end and then retired? Sure, he had another finals appearance after, but he got decimated.   Do people look at Bird and think ""Damn... he got beat by the Pistons so bad, he couldn't even be bothered to shake hands with him."" And then ended up retiring rather than trying to come back from a back injury?  Of course not.   And Bird only got one more title  than Zeke.   Isiah Thomas won't be remembered in the same way that MJ, Bird, or Magic will be in part because he was an asshole, but in larger part because he played for Detroit and not LA, Chicago, or Boston.   I mean, could you imagine how people would view Thomas if he had played in New York and won two titles with Ewing? And was 3-1 against the Bulls in the playoffs?   At the end of the day, the Pistons and Thomas can hold their heads high. They were 3-1 against the Bulls, and didn't lose until their core started aging, and earned 2 titles, three straight finals appearances, and five straight conferences finals. I don't think any reasonable person thought all those accomplishments got flushed down the toilet because they lost to the Bulls one year.   In fact, I'd imagine the only people who think that way are those whose only understanding of the the rivalry came from watching the documentary that Jordan had final say over.       The truth of the matter was that the Pistons were aging. They'd had five straight years of title contention, the year after their streak in the conference finals ended, most of their core were on the wrong side of 30 (Zeke was 30, Laimbeer was 34, Vinnie Johnson was 35, James Edwards was 36, Aguirre was 32).   The only two players who were still playing at peak level were Dumars and Rodman.   And moreover, Zeke's skills had been considerably diminished due to injury. In fact, the year they lost to the Bulls, he'd missed half the season due to injury had hadn't returned to form for the playoffs.  People who watch the documentary look at that series and say ""The Bulls totally dominated them!"" The Bull totally dominated at team that would have given them a competitive series but still lost had their best player been at 100%. Anybody who was actually watching basketball that year and knew the situation understood that.   &amp;#x200B;  So, yeah, Jordan clearly, without question, had a better career, but Zeke had an amazing career that most players would trade their own careers for (think Melo, Barkely, Malone, McGrady, Carter, Payton, etc.). Hell... he's got more rings than either Garnett or Dirk. And he earned them playing against Bird, Jordan, and Maigc.   Who else can say that?"
"We have no info on their fighting background afaik, so it’s safe to assume that the one with a weight, strength, and reach advantage would be favoured  This isn’t a James Johnson situation where Haslem is trained is it?"

Lol you think James Johnson is coaching him or something?
No but maybe being around James Johnson would

&gt;Buss seems to be talking about on court play/resume   Jeanie's list  * Kobe Bryant * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * LeBron James * Magic Johnson * Phil Jackson  Jerry West led the Lakers to 9 Finals appearances and a Championship as a player.  He should have made the list just for his playing days alone.  Jeanie's list wasn't exclusive to players though.  She put Phil Jackson on her list.
I actually think James Johnson still has a good relationship with KAT and D Lo and at this point in his career he could just be chasing paychecks. Porter could get more than we can offer. Barton is interesting tho.
I would say James Johnson but I highly doubt he want to comeback to Minnesota. Maybe guys like Otto Porter or Will Barton?
"You're absolutely right. I've always liked JJ and I'm happy to have him on the team, but he chose the money over the convenience and then thought he could get both on the back-end. Nobody's got the world's smallest violin out for James Johnson who gets passed around like a hot potato because he's overpaid."
"“He’s vet that anyone would find valuable”  No one offered anything for him, best was James johnson and a late 2nd."
"I mean does it? The team is mostly young and didn't have any vets that provide the toughness and grit James Johnson does. Also, the Pels are for sure bad, it isn't all that surprising even a vet like James Johnson could help."
"People who don't watch Pels games keep talking about the 2nd round pick, but fail to mention that James Johnson has been 100 times better than JJ. What James Johnson brought since he has been here is worth the JJ hate alone."
"Lmao, James Johnson is the real JJ?"
You mean James Johnson or Magic Harden?
James Johnson did more in his first 2 games than Redick had for NOLA literally all season lmao.
"Let's not forget the Nets trade away Caris Levert, Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for Harden, then Kyrie switch to the SG role while Harden switch to PG role.  This all happen when Dinwiddie, the only good PG they have left was injured.  After that trade, Nets sign Andre Roberson (defensive SG), Iman Shumpert (another SG), Alize Johnson (wing player) Blake and Lamarcus (big men). None of them are PG. Until the Harden injury which the Nets sign Mike James as a stopgap measure until Harden return.   So yes, it was clear that Nets intend for Harden to be the playmaker."

James Johnson revenge game?
Kawhi had an impressive series with a remarkable 27.0 game score.

James Johnson would eat those skinny white boys alive
Shamet with 4 points/rebounds/assists/steals/blocks combined in 27 minutes lol  Hopefully he's not reverting back to being terrible.  Also why has Mike James replaced Tyler Johnson? Did I miss something?
"Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley.  Davion Mitchell, Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, Isaiah Jackson.  Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, Kai Jones."

james johnson nearly decapitates ref
Yeah. James Johnson was way worse with us. JJ has moments and has been fine for how long we play him. Mellis been better than expected too.
Dallas fans - was it worth trading James Johnson?
Alright. James harden at 22 vs Steve Nash at 22... Larry Bird at 22 vs Kevin Durant at 22.   Magic Johnson as a rookie vs Kobe Bryant as a rookie.   It’s fucking ridiculous to say a player can’t do this or can’t do that because of his circumstance right now. How do you know what he’ll do in the future? I don’t. I’m just saying if you watch this dude play it’s clear that his potential is super high and he can be all time great scorer.

Lebron james johnson
"Probably James Johnson and Dwight Powell, at least that who the fans that wanted him wanted. I doubt Cleveland wanted to take extra years of Powell's contract. Also Powell has finally returned to his pre ruptured Achillies form and is playing a lot better than Drummond right now. That would have been a huge mistake."
"There were legitimately people who wanted KP traded for Drummond. Others included packaging Powell, James Johnson, and a 2nd."
"If we are going by GameScore, here are the top 10 in NBA history. Note obviously gamescore gives higher points to volume scorers with decent efficiency but it’s a decent metric.

I wouldn’t be surprised Marshall is a better defender than either of them and he’s starting for BI and James Johnson is about the same level as them if not better
I want to like Eric Collins but he’s soooo biased lmao. When James Johnson hit the three he said “Oh maaan” and it sounded like he was an 8 year old who was just told by his mom that he couldn’t have a play date with his best friends
"Bar Kobe who forced his way to the Lakers, they haven't drafted and developed anybody in like 40 years.  And I don't think you can really attribute Magic Johnson and James Worthy, 2 consensus #1 picks to the Lakers great eye for talent and development."
"He dominated the league until he got ""sick"". Even after ball, he's a freaking billionaire now. He's not only won, but dominated in every aspect of life. Even as a dad, his kid is a lil different, but is also a huge success. Dude people hated him cuz he was black and Bird was white Jesus; they hated him cuz he got hiv; they hated on him when he did the MJ video ""Remember the Time""; they've hated on Magic since he was here at State. But he's done nothing but make every one of his haters eat their words. The guy rebuilt the Lakers back to relevance. Do you think any other GM could have got Bron AND AD to LA? Granted he traded away his team but it paid off in spades. He made the craziest trade in my life time. I've seen crazy trades like the Cowboys and Herschel Walker trade, bit I've never seen a team trade not only leverage their starting line up but their future in all their draft picks as well. There was like 8 or 9 assets going to New Orleans for 1 player. Who coulda been a 1 year rental. He did whatever it took. And after he secured the greatest player of this generation from his hometown. Bron coulda went anywhere, especially the Knicks, and had more commercial success. But magic sold him on L.A. and Showtime. I truly believe Magic resigned the way he did cuz the Lakers were gona get shit dir how he did it, tampering and all that. So instead of having the Lakers take the hit, he took it cuz he could afford it. And it legit rolled off his back like water off feathers.   The Lakers got their guy and they won a ring. Regardless what batteries in the next 5 years they're ahead. I'll bet every team, not named Brooklyn, would give up their next 5 years for a ring this year. Like spend 5 years at or around .500 of you gave them a ring this year. They'd all take it.   So Magic is a winner there in my book. Had Palinka got the trade done giving up less than Magic offered originally, id say he jus planted the seed, but the trade was exactly what Magic said. Ya he did it with no regard for people's feelings, especially the young guys, but you gotta remember the NBA he came from, which was brutal. I mean if you watched the Jordan documentary, the Bulls  had Michael Jordan and they were like you're opinion don't matter were trading Scottie. If they did that to the biggest asset in the league, not jus the team but league, as they didn't care,  they absolutely won't care bout people like Lonzo Ball or Kyle Kuzma.   I can say with absolute certainty that Erving Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard to ever play the game. And that's from a Bad Boys Pistons fan. I know its blasphemous, but i think even Zeke would concede that.   If you're too young or jus never seen it, do yourself a favor and YouTube the Bird v Magic rivalry, cuz that will, ever be duplicated. Never! Im not trying to exaggerate, its seriously the best basketball you will ever watch. Period. Nothing comes close. The closest we ever came to since then was the Shaq and Kobe Lakers vs The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili San Antonio Spurs. But that still doesn't even come close, cuz Bird and Magic met in the finals in college and the NBA. Whenever they met or was all on the line. And both dominated their conferences with great teams. Even with freaking Kareem and James worthy and them boys on that team, Magic was Showtime! You watched cuz of Magic and what crazy shit you were gona see..."
"Celtics still had Bird, McHale, Parrish, Dennis Johnson, and Danny Ainge in 88. LA still had KAJ, James Worthy, AC Green and Michael Cooper to go with Magic.  But sure, lets pretend Magic and Bird were on their own."
"There's only a few tbh. The Morris twins, Mike Scott, James Johnson and that's about it. Everyone else fake fights"
"If it was that easy who does Wade clearly push out of this top 20 list I hastily assembled in two minutes?Nash, Chris Paul, Harden, Barkley, Robinson and others didn't even make the cut...   * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaq * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Kawhi Leonard * Karl Malone"
"DJJ from the Suns, Wayne Ellington, James Johnson. Honestly most of our roster from 2016-2019"
"Always fun to take an quantifiable, objective approach to this based on statistics, advanced statistics, individisl accolades, team achievements, etc.   I did a similar excercise about a year ago as well. Came up with  **231.4** - Michael Jordan  **224.5** - Lebron James  **213.3** - Wilt Chamberlain  **213.1** - Magic Johnson  **212.1** - Tim Duncan  **211.9** - Bill Russell  **208.9** - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  **206.7** - Kobe Bryant  **206.2** - Larry Bird  **206.2** - Shaquille O'Neal"
"And in an unusual move, the NBA has announced that the refereeing crew for the play-in games will be Magic Johnson, Gloria James, and Jack Nicholson."
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"Maybe if he traded for players who could hit jump shots, zion could go to work down there? Instead, this moron traded for Steven Adams ($29 m, and a $19 m extension coming, signed off again by this same moron), Eric Bledsoe ($16 m), and James Johnson ($16 m).   This guy also drafted a lane clogging center in Jaxson Hayes at 8 over Tyler Herro.   Whose idea of a lineup combinations of the following is a good idea:  Zion.  Adams.   Ingram  .       .   Hayes.    Johnson . Bledsoe.   Ball Lewis.   .   Hart?  What possible lineup is going to give proper spacing?   They could have gotten into the Turner for Hayward SnT and send picks to Boston, or they could have just sent #4 for him to Indy after the AD trade. But, this idiot thinks he has the magic touch with drafting.   Yes, zion is getting hacked. But it's partially your fault because of incompetence. Maybe he'll stfu and hire someone who doesn't eat glue and then let that person make personnel decisions for him."
"A lot of the 16-17 is also without at least one of Kyrie/KD and also coincides with key role players being out. Claxton plus three guy who'd normally fill in for Harden (Shamet, Johnson, Chiozza) meant Mike James who wasn't even in the NBA a couple of weeks ago is playing 15-20 minutes that would normally be Harden's. So it's both Harden being gone and poor substitutes exacerbating his absence."
Tyler Johnson should be playing over Mike James
"I remember when Tyreke Evans was a rookie &amp; averaged 20/5/5 for the whole season, ESPN slaps up a graphic and is like ""the only other players to average 20/5/5 as a rookie: Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson &amp; LeBron James.""  I almost did a spit-take after seeing that."
"Here’s their likely playoff rotation:   1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Joe Harris  5. Jeff Green  6. Blake Griffin  7. Claxton  8. DJ  Reserves: Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Chiozza  That’s an all time great rotation."
I'm backtracking? But you claiming that Mike James and Tyler Johnson are shooting off the dribble 3's we just gonna ignore that lmao?  &gt;Why’d you put Blake over Shamet?  Forgot about him and honestly with how streaky he is I don't rely on him. Besides come playoff time he's gonna be stuck on the bench watching Harden and Kyrie.
"&gt; Mike James  Has literally shot 14 3's in his Brooklyn Nets career lmao  And 95.6% of Tyler Johnson 3's have been assisted this year. Blud nobody but Kyrie,KD and Harden is shooting off the dribble 3's here...    I mean its fine to not watch the Nets but don't act like you know anything about them."
Not when you consider that Johnson and James are shooting way more contested off the dribble 3s than Blake...
36.7% from Blake is better than Tyler Johnson and Mike James lol
Shamet: 38.8% from 3  Tyler Johnson: 36.2% from 3  Mike James: 35.7% from 3  Are you serious rn?
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
James Johnson
"Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, The Celtics big 3 trade albeit they were old. Deron Williams, Dr J, Buck Williams, Rick Barry, Drazen Petrovic, Kenyon Martin, Joe Johnson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden. I know plenty about the nets they’ve always been a team I’ve followed.   They had a few bad seasons in the late 2000s early 2010s but as far as talent, the Nets have had a good chunk of the top 50 come through there lol.  Edit: forgot to mention Darryl Dawkins"
Been a good game to watch other than Bled flopping everywhere and James Johnson and Baze ruining like 4 possessions each for their team
The JJ Redick that wanted out the Bledsoe that doesn’t want to be there and the James Johnson that was traded there and only been there for a few weeks
"Yeah. Maybe a JJ Reddick, or a Steve Adams, or a Eric Bledsoe. Maybe a James Johnson"
"The Lakers have simply had the best personnel, on and off the court.  They had the greatest GM the game has ever seen for two decades.  Then they had one of the other best GMs for two decades.  They had three of the top five coaches ever for close to a decade each.  They have drafted more star players than any other franchise has even had, and more than some divisions have seen: Mikan, Mikkelson, Lovellette, Baylor, West, ( Sam and KC Jones who both declined to play for them ), Goodrich, Winters, Knight, Price, Washington, Nixon, Cooper, Johnson, Worthy, Green, Divac, Jones, Van Exel, Bynum, Gasol, Randle, Ingram and some I forgot.  Due to that outstanding draft record, they had the necessary assets to trade for players like: Chamberlain, Abdul-Jabbar, Bryant, Gasol, Davis, and many others.  The cherry on top is signing two, and really only two, major unrestricted free agents -- O'Neal and James.  The third-best Laker free agent signing in terms of winning championships, is Kurt Rambis -- who was not even in the league at the time.  &amp;#x200B;  So to sum up, they are just the best basketball organization in the world, for the past seventy-odd years."
Draymond receiving his just desserts. James Johnson did it for him instead because Adams was out for the game. What a bro.
James Johnson with the Captain Falcon impression
James Johnson is an OG lol
"That kick has to have hurt, James Johnson is a blackbelt. He knows what he's doing."
"* James Johnson missed layup. * Ball missed layup. * Ball bricked a 3. * Zion missed layup.  Rough, rough offense."
James Johnson should not have the second most shot attempts on this team.

Luka is the first guy since LeBron came in as a kid where you almost can’t even fully predict his true limits/potential cause we’ve just never seen someone quite like him before.

"I'm not trying to be an asshole, but you're wrong.   Other people besides Jerry West thought Kobe Bryant was going to be an incredible player.   ""I was with him for one of his Nets workouts, and the look on Calipari's face the whole time was like, ""holy s---."" Calipari says, ""Let me see you shoot the 3,"" and Kobe just starts stroking it effortlessly. So Cal says, ""Take a few steps back."" Boom. Swish. ""Take a few more steps back."" Boom. Swish. Cal says, ""That's it, I'm done,"" and then, kinda to himself, he goes, ""This guy's the next Jordan, I gotta get him""   Jerry West: He just had that ""It"" factor. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, people like that, they just have it. Kobe had it. You could see it. You could feel it  Jerry West: After we got Shaq, one of the first things I told him was, ""We have one of the best young players in the league already and he's going to be a huge star.""  Kupchak: The ease with which at 17 he was able to compete with one of the all-time great defenders in the game, that's what really stood out. (This is referring to Kobe playing Michael Cooper)  Ryan West: Larry Drew was a Lakers assistant at the time. Someone asked him what he thought that day and his line always stuck with me. He said, ""That man is the truth.""  Jerry West: Regardless of who Kobe worked out against, he was going to be the best player on the floor.  Kupchak: He was just obsessed with competition to a level you don't see in young players very often. You don't get that maniacal competitiveness very often, and here we were seeing it with someone who was 17.  Cooper: When I finished that workout, and my part in it was probably only 20-30 minutes, it felt like I had played a seven-game series with the Celtics again. Like I had just finished facing Larry Bird and Dennis Johnson. My body was aching something bad.  ""In his Boston workout and especially in his interview with team execs, Kobe wowed the entire Celtics organization, all the way up to team president Red Auerbach himself""  Jerry West: You watch a workout like that -- there isn't much of a choice to think of anything else. I remember saying to Jerry Buss, our owner, I said, ""Jerry, he's the best player in the draft."" I meant it. I would have taken Kobe as the first player in the draft. It was a no-brainer. He had this -- forget desire -- he just didn't want to stop playing. Ever.  Ryan West: The second workout(against Dontae' Jones) was even much more impressive than the first(against Cooper) and, with my dad, it started a borderline obsession with Kobe.  Mark Heisler: Every team that brought in Kobe -- the Clippers, the Suns and others -- they all said it was the greatest workout they had ever seen and immediately started trying to make moves to get him.   Jerry West, after selecting Kobe: ""The first thing I said to Jerry Buss was, ""We just got the best player in the draft.""  Heisler: The Suns were sitting at 15, ready. Danny Ainge was the Suns' [assistant] coach at the time. He tried to make a deal with Golden State at 11 to move up to take Kobe. Years later he was still incredulous that they turned him down to draft some white guy [Todd Fuller] from the ACC. After the Hornets took Kobe at 13 and the deal with the Lakers was announced, Ainge was the first one to put it all together. He turned to everyone inside the Suns' war room and said, ""Oh my God, they've got Kobe and Shaq.""  It's pretty clear that Jerry thought Kobe was going to be an all-time great based on things he said at the time and how hell-bent he was on getting him. And he wasn't the only one! The quotes I've used are from a recent ESPN article about Kobe's pre-draft workouts, and they show that a ton of other people were baffled at how good he was.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30957423/kobe-bryant-jerry-west-draft-workout-changed-nba-history%3fplatform=amp"
"Sean Marks took Brooklyn from the worst team in the league to title favourites in less than 5 years.  This season in particular he somehow acquired Brown and Shamet for almost nothing, traded for Harden, added Griffin and Aldridge in the buy out market, took a huge risk in Claxton, added Johnson and James as free agents who have been amazing, Assembled an insane coaching group, extended Harris, and added Green who's been solid.  Jones has done an equally amazing job, but I'd give it to Marks because our roster is ridiculous compared to Phoenix."
"i’ve been shit on even by Mavs fans for suggesting it   a playmaker who can score from time to time, shoot, play some solid defense still, plus a positive champion veteran presence in the locker room would be huge for this team   you can tell their lack of experience and veteran leadership gets to them sometimes... you know it’s bad when fucking James Johnson is supposed to solve that issue for you"
"Shout out to James Jones!  I remember NBA draft analysts (and even posters in this very subreddit) who criticized just about every decision the man had made (Cam Johnson at 11?!  TJ Warren traded?). But look at the team he’s built - and tonight they play for a chance at the league’s best record.  He’s done a masterful job, couldn’t ask for a better GM for my team."
that´s James Johnson
"It’s crazy how James Jones made all these unorthodox moves and it worked out. Warren for cash (prob his worst move still), moving back to reach on Cam Johnson, signing CP3.   It makes sense though. To do the same shit over and over, aka gamble on high upside draft picks, just wasn’t working. At a certain point, you need to bring actual adults into the room and veterans into the locker room, even if they don’t fit your “timeline”. Super young teams just don’t win a lot of games, even if you have a generational talent like Zion or Luka."
"It’s not similar at all, it’s such a lazy take just cuz it’s the Nets. They gave up their whole future to trade for washed up stars to add to a core of Lopez, declining Joe Johnson and a washed Deron Williams. James harden alone is worth twice what they got from Boston back then. They didn’t have a single top 15 player on the team even after the trade.   This time around they arguably have 3 top 15 players and 2 of them in the top 5.   Another difference is contracts. That nets team was capped out for 3-4 years in the future and stuck with all those players. In the worst case scenario all of the big 3 opt out, what do you think the nets will do with like $100M cap space? Sit on their hands and tank for the rockets? No they can overpay for vets that will keep them competitive as they’ll have 0 incentive to tank. Even if they keep 1 of the big 3 they’ll still be a playoff team in the East. Most realistic scenario is they’ll keep 2 if not all 3.   If that’s not enough of a difference, lottery odds are entirely different. Even if the nets became the worst team in the league in 2 years (which they won’t as highlighted in the above paragraph), their picks only give the Rockets a 35% chance of getting top 3 picks. I don’t remember the exact lottery odds but i think all of those old nets picks had like a 70-80% chance of being top 3 which led to Brown and Tatum.  Regardless of what happens to their stars in the next few years they aren’t locked into any long term harmful contracts and can go on a rampant spending free should any of them decline or walk, entirely different from their contracts structured last time."
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now.

Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"When you consider that Durant missed over half the year, harden is going to miss about half the year, and kyrie will probably end up missing around 20 games I think we did absolutely surpass expectations. I mean I’m guessing you don’t watch us much. Guys like Tyler Johnson, claxton, Bruce brown, shamet, now Alize Johnson, blake, also now mike James have been huge rotation players for us the entire season and he got all of those guys for virtually nothing.   Like we’ve literally been playing backups and random g/league guys for most of the year and they’ve been playing heavy minutes. We’re currently like 11-5 when only one of our stars play. We’ve had 34 different starting lineups.  This teams been making due with random guys all year"

"A young up and coming team already with established (if still rising) talent in Booker, projects like Ayton. They pick Mikal Bridges and trade for Cam Johnson in the 19 draft (a widely panned trade, too), hire Monty Williams as offense guru, go on an inspired 8-0 run in the bubble, then flip basically Rubio, Oubre (who now can't shoot) and a pick for Chris Goddamn Paul. Get Crowder as wing help and boom: kickass 6 man rotation, plus guys like Saric who's a great small 5, and Cam Payne staying good. That's exactly how you parley being young and up and coming, and getting better right now without losing any of that long term hope. Monty's added a real offense, snd credit to James Jones, the Bridges and Johnson picks basically got them here"
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson.

Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
"NGL, JVG is spitting facts about James Jones and Suns’ recent draft success   Idk about people underrating Bridges, but I definitely questioned them drafting Jalen Smith and Cameron Johnson"
Bill Russell  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  Michael Jordan  LeBron James
No James Johnson or Serge Ibaka???
1. James Johnson - Black Belt 2. DJ Mbenga - Judo 3 Roy Hibbett - MMA ( worked with a trainer in 2009 and continued after wards ) 4. Ron Arrest ( dad was a boxer ) 5. Al Harrington ( he did some MMA during the lockout season )
Mike Scott  James Johnson  Patrick Beverley  Kawhi Leonard Rajon Rondo
I’d take James Johnson over Crowder and Ibaka over Trez. The rest def got elite hands tho lol
"Not having James Johnson is a major oversight, the man fights MMA at a high level"
"Raps defense was absolutely suffocating. Kyrie looked off, and KD was getting doubled every possession. Lucky the bench guys kept us in this one. Blake, Tyler Johnson and Mike James all gave us some great energy tonight."
Magic Johnson  Michael Jordan   Larry Bird  Lebron James  Kareem
"Going by GGFFC format, I'll give my two cents:  First Team:  G Magic Johnson  G Michael Jordan  F LeBron James  F Larry Bird  C Shaquille O'Neal   &amp;#x200B;  Second Team  G Jason Kidd (I'll get heat for this)  G Kobe Bryant  F Charles Barkley  F Tim Duncan  C Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"
"Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kevin McHale, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, James Worthy: these guys were drafted by which teams?"
"If both Harden and Kyrie are out, the Nets really aren’t that scary  I’d take the Hawks over them. KD is fucking amazing but there’s no way he could have 4 games of the type he had yesterday in a single series. Plus they’d be playing Mike James and Tyler Johnson a bunch to their already weak rotation.   Now if Harden’s hamstring heals, shits over in 5"
1. Michael Air Jordan  2. Lebron King James  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  4. Magic Johnson/Kobe Bryant/Larry Bird
"The same JJ reddick that couldn’t get playing time for us or the Mavs but expected us to send him where he wanted? James Johnson, as average as he is, is better than anything we could’ve gotten from Brooklyn"
"Yes, I'll take a 5% Harden over Mike James and Tyler Johnson."
James Harden on one leg is better than like TLC or Tyler Johnson even Mike James
"&gt; Clearly because of his injury so it doesn't say anything about him as a player but he was a disaster out there which makes KD's performance all the more impressive (and the Bucks choke more embarassing).  I do agree that he was bad, but I think if Tyler Johnson or Mike James are in the game instead of Harden, Bud doesn't have Jrue guarding those guys and potentially starts trapping Durant.  Bud was respecting Harden to a fault, that opened up for a lot considering Jrue was a nonfactor defensively all night. That sort of impact from a guy with a barely functioning hamstring is unreal"
"Harden wasn't close to 100% tonight, but the alternatives are Mike James and Tyler Johnson lol."
James Jones turned:  Canaan/Okobo/Melton  Booker/Crawford/Troy Daniels  Warren/Bridges  Ariza/Ryan Anderson/Bender  Ayton/Chandler  Into:  CP3/Payne/Moore  Booker/Jevon Carter/Galloway  Bridges/Cam Johnson/Abdel Nader  Crowder/Craig/Jalen Smith  Ayton/Saric/Kaminsky
they also kept getting gifted 1st overall picks even when they are winning championships the previous year  they went to the semifinals the year before they drafted magic johnson first overall.  they won the championship the year before taking james worthy first overall
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"???  The point is that most of KD’s team right now is guys who are worth almost nothing in today’s NBA.  Giannis *may* be better, but he also has a way better supporting cast given that Harden and Kyrie are injured and their being paid so much means players like Mike James and Tyler Johnson are going to see real minutes"
Bruh even if he plays terrible on defense he’d be better than Mike James or Tyler Johnson
"Just once I want to hear Kawhi have a James Johnson type reply like ""That was nasty right? Cocked that joint back and banged on 'em"""
"Box and one is more about having few shooters than few playmakers.  The Nets still have shooters in Harris, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Mike James, even Jeff Green was hot from behind the arc this year.  I don't expect it."
"I can  Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green etc"
"Yeah the supporting cast is absolutely horrific. Nets also lose the ability now to stagger Kryie and KD so now when KD is off the floor the Bucks will just feast. The Nets are built so top heavy, and now they're going to have to hope for big performances from Blake Griffin and Jeff Green to win lol and then also hope that Tyler Johnson and Mike James can score so yeah it's a pretty bad recipe for winning when you have minimal depth"
"Oh, it'll go longer than just 2 years. Doc &amp; Co claim a healthy Kendrick Perkins means they'd have beaten the Lakers in 2010, for example.  ""If Jordan plays baseball, then the 94-95 Rockets have tricked us into thinking they're something they're not.""  ""If there's no Magic, no Byron Scott, then the 89 Pistons have tricked us into thinking they're something they're not.  ""If there's no phantom foul for Kareem, an injured Isiah, then the 88 Lakers have tricked us into thinking they're something they're not.""  ""If there's no James Worthy, then the 83 Sixers have tricked us into thinking they're something they're not.""  Webber 03, Yao 09, Joe Johnson 05, Rose 12, Westbrook 13, Garnett 09, Dirk 03, Walton 78, West 71, Baylor 65, Malone 04, Bird 88, Bam/Dragic 20,  Amar'e 06, Wilkes 84, etc."
"Two 2nd round picks for Delon Wright, Delon Wright + 2nd round picks for James Johnson, James Johnson + 1nd round pick for JJ Redick, a guy that was injured, washed and clearly stated where he wants to be and where he wants to go, aka wont stay after the season."
Yeah Mike James and Tyler Johnson as your point guard rotation ain't great lol
I think it’s also due to him being a average to below average playmaker for a primary offensive player. He’s one of the best off ball players in the league and he really benefits from playing off of a good playmaker. Mike James and Tyler Johnson are not that. So he can struggle as a primary creator without good outlet valves.

James Johnson is a black belt and has a 20-0 kickboxing record
James Johnson would fold Joker lol.
" The player right above him in salary this year is Caris LaVert. The player right below him is James Johnson. I wouldn’t say he’s overpaid, and if he is, it’s not by much."
I didn’t miss the question it said what all star would win a fight I said James Johnson idc if he’s not an all star he’s my pick
James Johnson would whoop all their ass
"&gt;Lol I like how you throw dinwiddie in there despite him not being on this team when they acquired harden and Blake.  How is that relevant at all? My point is that Spence is our best player outside of the big 3. He averaged 20/4/7 last season, and would've been a huge contributor off the bench this season. Spence being injured means we've had to give minutes to Mike James and Tyler Johnson in the playoffs. Don't try and downplay the impact that he would've had on this team."
Point guard Mike James an Tyler Johnson leading the way to beat the healthy bucks 🔥🔥🔥
"Harris, Shamet, Green, Griffin, Johnson, James, himself, all range from average to elite."
"Wtf their best point guards now are Mike James and Tyler Johnson. This team has glaring weaknesses without Kyrie and Harden, not sure how the few positive traits you listed somehow make this a solid team, it's clearly bad without two max players."
"It's life for a super team. Giannis still has Middleton and Jrue and we expect KD to be exceptional without his #2 and #3 guy. Ehen really, Tyler Johnson and Mike James is not enough"
"You know why Tyler Johnson &gt; Mike James?  Because he realizes he's not fucking prime DRose, and actually gets the ball to KD. James has been absolutely terrible."
Actually Showtime had 4 in 1987:  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar- 1969  Mychal Thompson- 1978  Magic Johnson- 1979  James Worthy- 1982
"I think they should draft Moses moody, a great 3&amp;D prospect, trade Bagley for picks, try and sign Jarrett Allen but if they can’t resign Holmes and go for Makeennen or Collins   If they could sign Allen I see them as a very formidable young core with improved defense   G Fox  G Halliburton  F Moody DRAFT F James Johnson FA  C Allen FA  6th Man: Buddy Heild  If u can’t sign Allen go for a John Collins or markennen or try and resign Richaun Holmes"
"Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF."
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
Lowry Derozan JV Ross Carroll Biyombo Joseph Powell Patterson Bebe Wright Bruno Thompson?  I feel like I’m forgetting some obvious ones  Edit: just checked I thought James Johnson was a year before and Luis scola was a year after. Turns out they played together
"… what?   If the logic is to dominate, then every failed superteam gets the exact amount of criticism from you? Does that work for GMs who attempt to dominate as well?   James Harden was not a MVP level player in OKC. That distinction did not help your point whatsoever. There hasn’t been any “bending” of the rules, a player left when he became a UFA and joined a different team.   So by your definition, since the 2018 Rockets were so dominate compared to every team but the Warriors, then CP3 bended the rules as well?   Those restrictions are in fact made to create balance. The issue is dominance comes regardless of those rules, if we wanted to strictly keep the league competitive, then we would forcefully remove drafted players from their drafted teams as well. The rules are there. Whatever happens because of those rules are free game, nobody has suggested a rule change because of the KD Warriors. They got lucky in the same way Danny ainge would have if he drafted 5 MVPs in one draft. The logic of the draft is to give bad teams good players to become good, correct? So a team with Kareem should not be able to scoop up a top pick in the form of Magic Johnson. Is that suddenly a “loophole?”   Blake Griffin is NOT a 15 million per year player in 2021. I’m not even going to acknowledge that, you are getting hyperbolic with the assessment to make these teams seem way more broken than they are. The buyout market is not a loophole at all either, and implying it’s KD who manipulated the system and not Sean Marks is again proving my point. You are putting criticisms that GMs should have on a player because of the emotional response. The logic does not fit what you are saying whatsoever.   So James Harden forcing a trade to create a superteam after signing a contract committing to the Houston Rockets isn’t exploiting the rules, but a guy leaving in free agency is? The salary cap argument doesn’t work, the 2017 Warriors happened because of LUCK. The 2021 Nets happened because Harden forced it. There’s a HUGE difference. Players forcing out is an actual issue the league is going to address. Not what KD did.   This all comes down to accolades. Having competent front offices should not earn criticisms to your accolades. Because teams did what they did, recruited correctly, made the right moves, and achieved what everybody wants to achieve (dominance), then your argument is not sensical. And the simple fact of the matter is that Kevin Durant receives criticism not even the players on his own super teams get , and that will NEVER make sense. Ever."
"That embarrassment of a playoff exit is exactly why they’re not matching whatever ridiculous contract they get. Riley already ran it back and that was the result he got. It’s obvious there needs to be change. Options are limited but he already learned his lesson about locking yourself into a team that isn’t doing it after those horrible dion and James Johnson contracts. Plus if you listened to his end of the year conference, he made all of this painfully obvious."
Cam Johnson = James Jones Mikal Bridges = Kawhi Lite
"You're putting all the emphasis on drafting.  McD had two great drafts.  The rest of everything else he did was fucking garbage.  We had fucking scores of assets with our 3 headed monster and he got nothing in return.  Sure, the Jalen Smith pick looks dubious, however, James Jones picked Cam Johnson (who has been great for us).  He brought in Monty, changed our culture, added all of the pieces around Booker and Ayton.  All of that success led to him trading for CP3.  So, sure, if your entire judgement of a GM is based purely on lottery hits, then you are correct."
"I think the fan base was in a more ""wait and see"" with cam Johnson. The talking heads on tv though...roasting James Jones. Same with Billy Simmons and all his podcasts"
I love cam Johnson and love that James Jones picked him. He’s literally his clone.
"Here's the list of MVP Share leaders for the preceding 10 years. I have data starting in 1960, so 60-69 is the first 10 seasons.

Tbh Cam Johnson seems like a solid pick but not a home run pick. He's a good bench shooter who can put up around 9-10ppg but that's probably all he'll ever really be since he's already 25 and hasn't improved much since last season. And James Jones obviously doesn't seem as a long term starter at the 4 if he drafted Jalen Smith to be that guy. PJ Washington would have probably been better. Good shooter like Cam and just has way more all around upside.
"had a very good core of young guys they drafted (booker, ayton, bridges). filled out the roster with solid complimentary pieces (crowder, cam johnson, saric, cam payne) traded for CP3 to bring it all together. james jones had a vision for the team that made a lot of sense and made it happen. monty williams is a great coach."
"Lol so MJ, Pippen and Rodman was not a super team? What about fucking Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and James Worthy? What about KG, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen? What about Moses Malone, Dr. J and two more Hall of Famers?   Absolutely ridiculous to pretend the Heat was the first ""super team""."
Honestly it’s hard to know since he hasn’t really played any meaningful minutes this year so it’s hard to gage how he is. At the time I hated the pick because haliburton was available but I thought James Jones knew what he was doing after I doubted his cam Johnson pick which turned out to be a home run at that slot
"What You missed:  Tyler Johnson Vs the Suns who cut him  Mike James vs the suns who cut him  CP3 vs former teammate Deandre Jordan  Amare is also on the nets coaching staff  Dantoni was the 7sol suns coach is now on the nets coaching staff  Sean Marks was a 7sol suns  Harden is an Arizona guy having gone to Arizona State  Potential first title for the whole suns team, Harden  Nash becoming the 2nd MVP ever to win a title as a coach  side note: putting CP3 as player coach to matchup with Nash is massively disrespectful to the best coach in the NBA monty Williams"
"Yeah, sometimes you get stuff like that where the guy who wasn't the best player for his team all year long is better in the Finals only. Cedric Maxwell over Larry Bird 1981, James Worthy over Magic Johnson 1988, Tony Parker over Tim Duncan 2007, maybe a couple of others. Since there is no award for ""Playoff MVP"" or ""Regular Season + Playoff MVP for the Team that Won the finals""."
"Kevin Durant is not and has never been a better basketball player than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Shaquille Oneal, Tim Duncan, or Hakeem Olajuwon. There are others but those 7 right there are completely unarguable."
"The funny thing is everyone besides Blake, Mike James and Alize Johnson were on the roster at the beginning of the season."
"Guys off the top of my head who I can think of who were/are better than him:  1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron James  3. Magic Johnson  4. Larry Bird  5. Wilt Chamberlain  6. Shaquille O'Neal  7.

Yes. We traded him later this year with James Johnson for Reddick and Melli
"True, you really can't judge these things as they go. In hindsight, though, it made some really shitty circumstances to the team. Nobody really thought KP would fall off the cliff like that. Everybody thought this team needed defense, grit. Obviously the trade pieces they got to alleviate that deficiency didn't work. James Johnson got traded mid-season, KP lost his blocking ability, Richardson is trash outside of that good season in Miami.   Nobody thought Luka would leap up and become a good defender. DFS became an Iguodala-type swiss army knife. Dwight Powell stopped being a turnstile.   But that trade definitely reduced their offense terribly. At the time when Dallas needed any offense, they couldn't buy a shot to save their lives. Surely a 45% 3 point shooting guard named Curry who just shot 21 and 30 his last two games would've helped that team. We know Tim Hardaway jr couldn't handle 2nd option night in and night out, why not just run it the same as last year and have them share wing duties?   In theory, that trade would've worked. A defensive minded play-making guard might've worked well with Luka. But, in my opinion, recreating those Lebron-led teams would've been the way to go. Give Luka 2 reliable shooting wings, a defensive minded power forward, a sturdy center that wouldn't have problems posting up the likes of Reggie Jackson, and this team would've gone farther than Game 7 of the first round.   But I digress.  I just hope management has something in line to help Luka get out of this first round hump. Mike needed a couple of years getting out of Detroit and Boston's shadows. Luka probably needs one more getting out of Clip's. It's a generational player's rite of passage."

"Reddick was good last year, then this year he just wasn't. Pels got more out of James Johnson than Reddick this year."
"2 second round picks for Delon Wright, 1 second round pick and Delon for James Johnson, 1 second round pick and Johnson for Redick and Melli.  That's 4 second round picks buddy. Obviously not worth a ton but it's still throwing away shit for nothing cause you keep fucking up every trade."
We would have cap space regardless with James Johnson staying lmao. His contract was expiring too. And people needs to stfu about cap space with the mavs because Donnie can't get anyone with the cap. He wasted dirks years and he will waste Lukas years too if he stays.
I mean let's just look at Donnie recent trades. JAMES Johnson and wiwundu for Reddick who is injured and doesn't wanna be in dallas and Melli who is basically a nobody. Both didn't see any minutes on the floor post season. We also lost 2 late round picks for Reddick who didn't even play post season and is leaving this year. James Johnson could have been used this post season. This fo just sucks ass.
oh yeah James Johnson was the missing piece for the Mavs in this series
"Suns nets really has all the best storylines. Cp3 played with Harden, Blake, and Deandre Jordan. Nash, Dantoni, Amare, and  Sean marks are all 7sol suns vs the current iteration of the team. Mike James had his awful stint with the suns and we quickly cut him. Tyler Johnson had a stint with the suns and we cut him, though he left on good terms. Harden is an Arizona guy having gone to ASU.   Then the general David vs Goliath story as most been sleeping on the suns (some still are) vs the clear front runners from the beginning of the year in the nets. Even if I personally believe the suns actually stack up well if healthy. there is just a lot going on there."
Don't forget the JJ Redick and Meily for James Johnson trade.
Mavs FO says that every year then they end up with Josh Richardson (For Seth Curry :( ) and James Johnson
"Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, LeBron James.  Those 10 players are the only ones to win Finals MVP and regular season MVP in the same year. Considering the limitations of Jokic's squad you'd have to think he would he in the top half of that company if he accomplished it this year, maybe even top 3 (just for his single season resume, not all time obviously)."
"“Magic Johnson and Larry Bird combined” He’s just James Harden 2.0, not hard to compare him to a player lol"
"Joe Harris is actually good. Blake Griffin is washed but still ok. Shamet is alright. Bruce Brown is decent. Claxton isn't bad. That they get to play with Kyrie, Durant, and Harden amplifies their abilities a bunch. Not to mention Jeff Green who's day-to-day.  Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Luwawu-Cabarrot can all give you minutes and not get picked on or have to force dumb shit to make an impact. Their depth is actually completely ridiculous. Dinwiddie being out doesn't even seem to matter.  Meanwhile Bryn Forbes is playing 20 plus minutes. Yikes."
"Magic Johnson on LeBron James: ""I don't think he's a Laker. I don't know if they're gonna sign him back or not, but I don't think he brings the winning mentality and attitude we need. He had a chance to show that but to me, he failed in this series."""

&gt;Where’s James Johnson playing?  &gt;The Celtics?  &gt;Oh wait thats not the celtics lemme read that name but its kinda hard to read  &gt;Dallas  &gt;oh.
"Not sure if you can find it, but James Johnson shoulder checked aytons head on a dirty play early this season. It’s been lingering since then. Shows up every now and again when  there is contact.   Edit:  [sorry it’s twitter](https://twitter.com/evxz17/status/1355762695299981318?s=21)"
Its even worse when you realise thats Aytons bad shoulder. Hes had trouble with it ever since he got hit on it by James Johnson. Fucking disgusting play
Ayton’s had issues with his shoulder even since James Johnson hit him with a dirty shot in the neck earlier this year
“That’s not a basketball play”  Ayton has struggled with that shoulder all season after a hit from James Johnson
"Tyler Johnson sucked before he left, Whiteside is just a stat padder, James Johnson is old, Richardson was always inconsistent, Winslow is always hurt, Jones Jr was fine this year"
"Not if you turned around and gave that money to James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Hassan Whiteside."
"Future that was spent paying James Johnson, Waiters, Hassan, Tyler Johnson? They were in a re-tooling phase anyways. He ended up retiring in 3 seasons anyways  How badly do you think a 3 yr wade contract would've fucked everything up? Who cares anyways when it's your franchise GOAT? the man won 3 rings there and brought bron."
Good thing he paid Hassan Whiteside and James Johnson instead.
"I don’t know if I’d praise him for going .500 against a team that was starting james Johnson, Tyler Johnson, and Hassan Whiteside but I mean the nets and the wizards are whatever"
"That would be true if the Harden trade was made last offseason vs during the season.   Nets lost Dinwiddie to injury and then gutted their depth for Harden.   Brooklyn had 3 open roster spots to fill with players that all 32 teams didn’t want to sign in Free Agency. Sure they got Blake but he’s nowhere near the player he was. Got lucky again with Aldridge and then he retires shortly after due to health reasons.   Nets had 3 open roster spots and they signed Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Alize Johnson. That’s not a plethora of riches once Aldridge retired.   Bucks had the advantage of putting their team together mostly in the offseason when the market still had quality talent in it to sign.   Nets this offseason have some options to build out their roster since they could have anywhere from 2-7 open roster spots.    Dinwiddie is most likely gone since he seems to want a larger role and his first real payday. Nets giving Dinwiddie around $18-20m per year (like he wants) would be like $35m a year when you add in the Luxury Tax.   Hopefully the Nets can work out a Sign and Trade so they can get a Trade Exception like the Celtics did with Hayward since Brooklyn is capped out.   Nets would also have the 2y/$7.4m Bi Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m Tax Mid Level Exception (which can be split I believe) to sign Free Agents this upcoming offseason.   Besides Dinwiddie the Nets also have Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC and Mike James as Free Agents.   I think Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are most likely to stay with Blake Griffin the next on the list. Mike James comes down to his Euro Team and if he’s released since I think Nets could re sign him because he’d be a cheaper backup PG option vs what Dinwiddie would want."

"&gt;Yes, it is.  &gt;Professional basketball was growing by leaps and bounds. In 1967 there were just 10 major professional franchises on the continent.

Because shortage of fans on the stadiums and low ratings are signs of things not improving.    &gt;As soon as Jordan retired ( each time ) ratings immediately fell back to previous levels or lower. The various finals involving Tim Duncan are some of the lowest rated of all time, as was last year's.

And yet the NBA became far more global which is because of those stars.   &gt;There is such a discussion, but you don't seem equipped to have it.  No, there's not. You just don't like reality."

That the TV contracts we have been accustomed to for a couple decades now simply did not exist in the 1970s.  In 1975, there were still untelevised NFL games -- no one saw them except those with tickets or helmets.  So using the fact that NBA Finals games were not broadcast live in the 1970s as evidence of unpopularity shows a poor grasp of the history.  &gt;  Because there's no discussion that NBA in the 70s was not very liked.

Levert, Allen both had positive things to say when they were traded. Role players like Mike James, Alize Johnson, etc. have never felt isolated.

"Hmm, this makes me wonder: Are there any instances where the league MVP won the Finals, but wasn't the best player in the playoffs?   Kareem is an obvious argument, but this post pretty much seals that one right here for me.   Willis Reed missed ONE game in 1970, but it wasn't the clincher and he did get the MVP (including Reg. Season AND the ASG). That's similar to Kareem's performance, but with the obvious MVP snub. A good comparison for sure  A cool list I found: https://www.allaboutbasketball.us/nba/nba-players-who-have-won-regular-season-mvp-finals-mvp-and-championship-in-the-same-year.html  **Kareem Abdul Jabbar**  Kareem Abdul Jabbar won six championships, two finals MVP and six regular season MVP awards but only once he has been able get these three honors together in the same year. It was the 1970- 71 season when he won all three with Milwaukee Bucks.  **Moses Malone**  Moses Malone picked up regular season MVP, Finals MVP and NBA title in 1983 as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers. He was the only player in NBA history who won back to back MVP awards with two different teams (previously with the Houston Rockets in 1982).  **Larry Bird**  Larry Bird, the former Celtics forward, achieved this ultimate feat twice in his career, in 1984 and after that in 1986, on both occasions with the Boston Celtics.  **Magic Johnson**  Magic Johnson won double MVPs and a championship in 1986-87 season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He also knocked the game- winning shot in the finals series against the Boston Celtics and led the team in winning a championship.  **Michael Jordan**  Winning both MVPs and championship once is special but what about doing it four times in the career. This has been done by perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time called Michael Jordan. He won league MVP, finals MVP and Championship four-times in 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1998.  **Hakeem Olajuwon**  Hakeem Olajuwon completely dominated the 1993-94 season. He won both the MVP awards, defensive player of the year award and championship and became the only player in NBA history to get all these honors together in the same year.  **Shaquille O’Neal**  For his all-round performance in 1999-00 season, Shaquille O’Neal earned both the regular season and finals MVP awards and an NBA title. That particular season, he also became an All-Star game MVP and a scoring champion too.  **Tim Duncan**  In 2002-03 NBA season, Tim Duncan walked away with the leagues MVP and the finals MVP awards. He also won a championship with Spurs that year. That made him only the ninth player to get these three honors together in the same year.  **LeBron James**  LeBron James is the latest to join this elite group by winning regular season MVP, finals MVP and a championship with Miami Heat in 2012.  TLDR: Nope, the MVP is always the team's best player in the playoffs on title teams."
PG: Dlo/Patty Mills/McLaughlin   SG: Ant/Bolmaro  SF: McDaniels/Okogie  PF: Simmons/vet backup maybe James Johnson   C: Kat/Naz Reid/Dieng
"PG: Sexton or Lonzo, Kira  SG: NAW, Korkmaz, Didi Louzada  SF: BI, Naji Marshall, Bullock in free agency or Prince in a trade with CLE  PF: Zion, James Johnson, Wenyen Gabriel  C: Adams, Jax   Spots 14 and 15: prob 2 of our 4 second round picks   1. I’ve really been digging the Sexton trade talk. A young guard who plays passionately and scores with great efficiency and actively gives a shit on defense; I’ll take that all day every day. I’d do Bledsoe, 10 and whatever else Cleveland wants that’s not the young core.   2. I’m ready for Nickeil as a full time starter. Between his 15-20 starts last year and where he looked legit great next to Zion and BI (better than ANY other guard on our roster) along with his play in the FIBA Qualifiers for Canada.   3. I’m looking forward to Willie Green turning Zion and BI into a dynamic duo together rather than a dynamic duo apart (if that makes sense; I think Pels fans can speak to that) + raising defensive intensity   4. Need James Johnson back, he was solid for us and gave us great minutes after the deadline  5. Adams and Jax will be a top 5 Center rotation in the league next season, bet on it.   6. If we re-sign Lonzo, I’m cool with it too. I truly don’t see him getting the contract everyone’s been talking him up for. I also think Lonzo and Sexton could play together, but that’s expensive for at least one season before Sexton hits RFA."

"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
Miami didn't draft Dragic or James Johnson
"Kenny was a bad in game coach, and the only reason the nets got bad press for firing him was people wanted to ridicule kyrie and kd. Also there was basically nothing else to do, it’s not like Tyler Johnson or mikes James would’ve done better. I do genuinely hope the kings get back to the playoffs, I’m just not sure how a kings fan can try to roast another team."

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

"I know Steph is the greatest 3 point shooter but I’m going long fast and strong to dominate the league.   PG: Magic Johnson (natural point guard, can run fastbreaks, and is 6’9)  SG: Michael Jordan (no need for explanation)  SF: Kevin Durant (not my favorite but best shooting option for position)  PF: Lebron James (can do it all)  C: Wilt Chamberlain (defense juggernaut, can score at will, fastest dude on court and would be unstoppable on fastbreaks)  While some teams would shoot better from the 3, I don’t think any teams are out-rebounding or outscoring this team. Magic, Bron, &amp; Wilt are making the extra pass for assists. Plus MJ, Bron, and Wilt are locking the defense down.   82-0 and it is what it is."

"Just received an update, we've settled on Jalen Johnson-James Porter Jr."
Close but it's actually Jalen Johnson-James Jr.
"Having Booker, Ayton, Bridges was a great core to build around. And the Suns have him 5 years, while the Lakers only offered 3. He's such a great coach and man, he'll go down as a legend in the Suns franchise, I'm so glad he chose our team. The thought of him coaching while James Jones makes moves to build around Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson....the future is sunny"
"So he'd do well individually on a team that isn't a contender.   Sure. I'd agree with that.   Now... who do you want to be. A guy like Dennis Johnson, Vinnie Johnson, Michael Cooper, or Derek Fisher?   Or a guy like Rudy Gay, Rex Champan, or Mike James.   Not saying all those guys are comparable, but you got guys who have score near or over 20 a game on teams that couldn't win, or guys who thrived with inconsistent roles on offense and still stepped up when called upon and have multiple rings to show for it.   People still remember guys like Cooper, VJ, DJ, and Fisher.   Nobody is going to be talking about some dude who dropped 18 ppg on a lotter team for a few years."
"Deion Waiters, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Kelly Olynyk all got $50 million. Hassan Whiteside got $100 million. And that’s *just* the Heat lol"
"True but I was thought of it like MJ, could be Michael Jordan or Michael Jackson depending on context. In this sub, if I type LBJ, I'd hope most people realize I'm talking about Lebron James and not Lyndon B. Johnson."
"In all seriousness though the Raptors easily could've won a couple games or even the series had Dwane Casey made simple adjustments. There was one lineup that outscored the opponents by a ton of points per 100 possessions but Casey didn't use that lineup for more than just a couple minutes in the playoffs.  He also refused to play James Johnson, even when fans at the Air Canada Centre were literally chanting ""we want James!""  And of course Paul Pierce happened"
"Over 3 years you could construct something. Put it this way, if James Jones inherits Luka and cap space, he can make something happen. A sample plausible lineup - SGA, Booker, Luka, crowder, capela, with Payne and cam Johnson off bench at least, and maybe another big like Howard also. That team might not win a title this year, but I'd feel pretty good about it too 😊"
"Oh, you mean Cam [""70.5 TS% in these playoffs""]( https://twitter.com/esidery/status/1412627295022370820?s=19) Johnson?  I will never doubt James Jones in my life on anything ever again lol."
"the biggest argument against Kareem is that he played in the weakest era of the modern nba (1970s) and won 1 finals in 2 appearances and then in the 80s had Magic Johnson, another top 5-6 all time player for the next 5 championships and 8 finals appearances. As well as having the number 1 pick and hall of famer in James Worthy for 3 of the championships. Kareem was  arguably only the best player for 3 championship teams while Jordan unquestionably was the best player for 6, all of which came in a much tougher era. Jordan also retired in his prime and played 5 less years than Kareem so of course he has more points but I mean Jordan was a 10x scoring champ while Kareem only won it twice. Kareem just played for an absurdly long time while still getting his 20 a game so of course he is the all time leading scorer and top 3 all time for a reason but Jordan is pretty much agreed to be better"
"Hasn’t really been miss since Ryan McDonut was in charge  James Jones has his guys and frankly has pretty much done nothing but hit home runs in the draft. The Bridges pick was him and Sarver (McDonut wanted SGA, which would have been good too), the Cam Johnson pick was him, Ty Jerome is looking like he’ll be a player in the league and it’s honestly wayyyy to earlier to say on Stix, he’s played less than 100 minutes"
"In a few cases names may not stand out because they're big names on stacked teams...  A few more...  Paul Pierce winning in 2008. Garnett was head n shoulders above him by pretty much all measures, and he even had a higher usage rate than Pierce by a hair - so Pierce's efficiency wasn't dragged down by a higher workload.  James Worthy winning in 1988. Magic throughout those playoffs was way better than Worthy on a consistent basis.  Maybe we call this new award the Magic Johnson Trophy, because in 1985 if it had been a whole-playoffs thing he would have definitely taken it over Kareem.  Though in 1980 I woulda given it to Kareem for the entire playoff run, so maybe not. :)"
"Imagine a world where the phoenix suns run out a lineup including zhaire smith and jarret culver instead of bridges, with cam johnson and saric off the bench.  Fuck vpoty, can we nominate james jones for sainthood or new jesus?"
"Kareem is one of five players who has a legitimate basketball GOAT argument, along with (chronologically) Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James.  Incidentally, Kareem is indirectly the reason why I rank Larry Bird slightly ahead of Magic Johnson.  Yes, Magic won more NBA championships than Bird.  But on Magic’s first three championships, he was playing with a still very high level Kareem, who was better than any teammate Bird ever had on the Celtics.  On the first two Magic titles (1980, 1982), Kareem was still the Lakers’ #1 star, and he has an argument for 1985 too.  The 1980s Lakers should have won more often than the 1980s Celtics because they had two top 10 all-time players rather than just one.  (The Lakers also played in the weaker Western Conference.)"
Points each player scored in their first finals game   Allen Iverson 48  Michael Jordan 36  Durant 36  Hakeem 33  Duncan 33  **Chris Paul 32**  Kareem 31  **Khris Middleton 29**  Wade 28  Curry 26  Shaq 26  Karl Malone 23  Oscar Robertson 22  Wilt 22  Larry Bird 18  Dirk 16  Magic Johnson 16  Kobe 14  LeBron James 14  Moses 13
Cam Johnson is gonna be the next James Jones
"&gt;I believe that it is between magic Johnson, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry.  Well if you're asking who the second most famous player ever is in general then it's Kobe, zero debate.  But if you're just asking specifically at the time, then yeah it was probably Magic."
"1991 - Worthy missed the last two games with an injured ankle and a Byron Scott shoulder injured kept him out the last two or three games of the series  1989 - Magic and Byron Scott tear hamstrings leaving the Lakers with a starting back court of Tony Campbell and Jeff Lamp  1988 - Isiah Thomas steps on Michael Cooper’s foot, proceeds to destroy the Lakers on one ankle anyway.   1987 - Kevin McHale breaks his foot, then re injuries it stepping on Michael Jordan’s foot. Plays through the injury, which is why he still limps 35 years later. Also despite being the best power forward defender of the 80s, is unable to guard James Worthy who torches the Celtics all series.  2003 - the Suns have the best record in the league but Joe Johnson breaks his face against Dallas.   2009 - the Rockets with a finally healthy TMac and Yao were rolling, until Yao re cracks a bone in his foot. Would they have won? Maybe - but Yao spent the first half of the season in the MVP race, and he and Mac were close to unguardable when cooking."
"Dwight Howard, Marcus Morris, Trez (tries to be), James Johnson, Udonis Hasslem still technically is an NBA player, Mike Scott, Boogie, I’m sure there’s mores. But yeah most of these guys can’t hold a candle to the guys you listed, and I also think the enforcer role dramatically lost its usefulness with rule changes punishing over the top physicality."
"Top lists are always super biased and where the argument for an earlier player is super highly valued usually it is ignored as a blight on later candidates due to their high stats in other areas. That being said my personal top 10 is Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Stephen Curry, Larry Bird. There's always a million nuances here and exceptions there when talking about so many great players entire legacies and careers. I just thought it was interesting you emphatically said steph wasn't making your cut."
"This is in no particular order, and I'm too lazy to research the season right now.  1- early Celtics teams with Russell, Cousy, KC Jones  2-'67 Sixers with Wilt and Billy Cunningham  3- Late 60's Lakers with Jerry West and Elgin Baylor  4- Early 70's Knicks with Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Dave DeBusschere, Willis Reed, Bill Bradley, Phil Jackson  5) Early 70's  Milwaukee Bucks with Lew Alcindor, Oscar Robertson, Bobby Dandridge, Lucious Allen  6) Early 70's Lakers with Weat, Gail Goodrich, Wilt, Hap Harriston  7) Late 70's Sixers with Dr.J, Geoege McGuiness, Doug Collins, Bobby Jones, Henry Bibby, Caldwell Jones, Darryl Dawkins  8) Early 80's Sixers with Moses Malone, Dr.J, Mo Cheeks, Steve Mix, Bobby Jones  9) Showtime Lakers with Magic, Kareem, James Worrhy, Michael Cooper  10) mid 80's Celtics with Larry Bird Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, Bill Walton   Well there's 10 waaaaayyy better teams with waaayyy better coaching than the 2018 Rockets and i haven't gotten out of the 80's yet. And those are just off the top of my head, and feel free to plug-in the Bad Boy Pistons, Jordon's Bulls, Duncan's Spurs, 2015-19 Warriors, late 90's -early 2000's Sacramento Kings, Shaq/Kobe Lakers...give it a break, man"

"From espn:  &gt;Watching him play 3-on-3, 4-on-4 and 5-on-5, Sengun handled the ball on the perimeter, splashed open 3s, threw no-look passes to open teammates and used ball fakes in the paint to create open shots. Sharing the floor for former collegiate standouts such as James Blackmon Jr (Indiana), Markell Johnson (NC State) and Joel Berry (UNC), Sengun was regularly the best player on the floor. Having also watched a full shooting workout on an off day, it became clear that Sengun, who is just 4-of-23 from 3 this season, will eventually make NBA 3s with relative ease, allowing him to play some as a power forward in two-big lineups, at least offensively. Sengun's 79% free throw clip is more indicative of the type of shooter he could become in time than his lack of 3s attempted this season. He doesn't lack confidence, either, as he splashed a step-back 3 in a senior national team game against Sweden.  Also, at lower level steals rate is a good indicator of functional athleticism, and he's really good at that."

"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
"Jordan went into a front office job for 5minutes and decided all these mfs trash Imma make a comeback  I noticed that many of those ex-players that go into coaching/front office and have major success are rarely former superstars. Many of the EOTY or COTY winners I see were role players (Steve Kerr, James Jones, Pat Riley, Sam Mitchell) or just pretty average starters (Don Nelson, Byron Scott, Avery Johnson) during their playing career  Obviously there were a few exceptions, Larry Bird had a Hall of Fame playing career with the Celtics then went on to win Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year after he retired, both with the Pacers."
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
"Karl Malone would guard David Robinson his entire career, nephew.   James worthy has played PF, look it up.   shawn kemp and larry johnson were no joke.   Larry Bird, ever hear of him?  Barkley, ever hear of him?  Plenty of other great bigs/forwards during Malones run."
did you just name karl malone as competition for karl malone?  david robinson was a center  james worthy was a small forward  shawn kemp and larry johnson are not ATGs LOL  you had a better argument with the PGs
"Karl Malone, Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp, David Robinson, James Worthy, even Larry Bird was still balling when Karl Malone was. Plenty great players were in the 80s and 90s era at the forward position lol what are you on."
Lesson: every gm is 100% negligent for not having a hired goon on the roster at all times. James “bloodsport” Johnson should be cashing checks into his 50s
"I've heard this before, but what player that doesn't have a ring would you put over a similar player with a ring?    Is John Stockton better than Magic Johnson?  Is Wilt the best center ever?  Is Barkley better than Dirk or KG?  How high would you rank James Harden if he retired today given all his accolades among the best SGs?  Better than Wade or West?  Close to Kobe and MJ?  I get the rings culture is often used to prematurely end discussion, but looking at the actual players, its hard for me to see how the lack of rings is a huge knock on some of these legends."
"Harden can’t shoot, Harris was ass and Mike James and Tyler Johnson should not be seeing the floor in a playoff game"
"Joe Harris, Harden, Mike James, Tyler Johnson. All these guys can hit open 3’s.   And it would only be 2 minutes a half. KD had enough energy for 48 minutes. If they rested him 2 minutes a half he still would have something left in OT. With your reasoning Lebron would never come out of the game or Luka."

"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"

"Absolutely. His ceiling is through the roof (Embiid without playmaking or spacing but with fewer injury concerns) and he's clearly made strides on both sides of the ball.  One future concern is that the Suns' cap sheet will get crowded in a couple years. Their young core may be considered to be Booker, Ayton, Bridges, and Cam Johnson. If you're James Jones, you have to at least give Booker/Ayton/Bridges the bag. (Also assuming Jalen Smith doesn't turn into a player worth keeping.) Note: the bag doesn't necessarily mean the max, but Bridges deserves just compensation as an elite prototypical 3&amp;D wing that every team needs.  Also, Cam Payne will absolutely get paid this offseason, Moore, Galloway, Nader, Craig, and Kaminsky are solid end of the rotation guys and I anticipate at least one of those guys (Craig?) getting like $3-5M/yr. Maybe they'd take a discount if they can run it back because they're all on mins, but I doubt the Suns will retain such great depth."
He did already lol https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-stands-with-lakers-execs-magic-johnson-rob-pelinka-in-thunder-game-prompting-legm-jokes-on-twitter/
"I feel like I’ve seen a player do this before  Edit: Oh yeah, it was lebron lol https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-stands-with-lakers-execs-magic-johnson-rob-pelinka-in-thunder-game-prompting-legm-jokes-on-twitter/"
James Johnson no doubt
"Yeah he probably won’t but it doesn’t hurt. The Nets should look to add and reacquire experienced players   Redick, James Johnson, Ariza, Blake, Dwight Howard"
Look back in NBA history. Injuries have been an issue in the playoffs. Magic Johnson went out in game 1 of a Finals with a hamstring. Isiah Thomas injured in Finals Game 6 and didn’t have it in Game 7. James Worthy was out in finals against Philly. A few more including Kyrie out against Warriors in the finals. People forget.
"Im not arguing he wasn't gifted. MJ is arguably the most gifted player ever. He's the GOAT for a reason. But there are a lot of NBA players with physical gifts like MJ or KD, but for a myriad of reasons (mental, work ethic, injuries, etc) they aren't nearly as good. Like if you watched MJ and Michael Beasley or even Wiggins in a casual shoot around at the local gym, they'd all look similar in ability. There's a lot of athletic freaks in the NBA.  I used to go to a lot of Drew League games and Stanley Johnson always looked like a more gifted athlete than James Harden"
"I mean - if you want to broaden this argument, if a players peak is in his 30s why is it that only 9 teams in NBA history have won a ring with an average weighted age of over 30 years old (weighted by minutes)? Where are all the teams of prime players in their early 30s?  So I'm curious, lets see how this goes... I'm gonna go team by team, and lets see who leads them in Win Shares by year and the age of that player...  While imperfect - the biggest weirdnesses balanced out (Kobe in his early 30s was clearly more important to the Lakers than Pau in 2009/2010 ... But Isiah in his late 20s was clearly more important to the Pistons than Laimbeer in 1989/1990).  If the prime of players extends well into their 30s... Why are only 12/40 teams led by guys in their 30s? 6 at Dirk-age-or-older (32+). Twice as many players are age 26-29 as are 30+ (24 to 12).  You start getting to Dirk's age at that 2011 championship, and title winning as a top player becomes clearly harder, only 1/4 as many dudes up at that age or older. You've got some great exceptions you can bring up... but the weighted ages of teams aren't in their 30s, and typically the top performer on a championship team isn't in his 30s. Top performer doesn't necessarily mean best player in the playoffs, but if the PRIME was as long as you say - it would make up a MUCH larger portion of this list.  2020 - Anthony Davis, age 26  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29  2017 - Steph Curry, 28  2016 - LeBron James, 31  2015 - Steph Curry, 26  2014 - Tim Duncan, 37  2013 - LeBron James, 28  2012 - LeBron James, 27  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32  2010 - Pau Gasol, 29  2009 - Pau Gasol, 28  2008 - Kevin Garnett, 31  2007 - Tim Duncan, 30  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27  1990 - Bill Laimbeer, 32  1989 - Bill Laimbeer, 31  1988 - Magic Johnson, 28  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27  1986 - Larry Bird, 29  1985 - Magic Johnson, 25  1984 - Larry Bird, 27  1983 - Moses Malone, 27  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22  1981 - Robert Parrish, 27"
Brings back James harden and Wesley Johnson memories
"It 100% does, we only turned it around when we got James Jones in and fucked off Mcdonough.  James Jones immediately brought in veterans and made win now moves, from Tyler Johnson, to Oubre, to hiring Monty, to getting Baynes, Saric and Rubio. We literally traded down from pick 6 to get Saric and Cam Johnson. Our previous regieme would have taken Culver and ran him as our starting PG and we would have had another dogshit year and Booker probably finally requesting a trade.  But we didn't and then we landed CP3 this offseason, which only happened because James Jones had enough of our shit roster construction to always try and lose and put us on the map which allowed us to bring a star to the team."
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"i think bringing Al back should be helpful with that. also last year we literally had to put all the young guys in their own locker room sine the main one wasnt big enough for covid protocol which definitely played a part in the chemistry issues, plus guys coming in and out of the lineup with covid and injuries. if we can bring in another vet presence off the bench (someone in the celtics sub mentioned James Johnson who i'd definetely be happy with) i think it should be good."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Of course Scottie Pippen would praise LeBron James - LeBron is the 2003-present version of a  Scottie Pippen/Magic Johnson mash-up.

"60s: Bill Russell and the Celtics dominants the decade winning 9/10. Wilt Chamberlain sets amazing records unbroken to this day.    Important players: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West  70s: Rough decade, several teams win championships. Kareem emerges as the best player.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Pete Maravich, John Havelick, Julius Erving and Oscar Robertson  80s: NBA starts to become more popular. Celtics and Lakers, led by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson respectively, win most of the titles in the decade finished off by the Detroit Pistons winning back to back. Michael Jordan, a young shooting guard from Chicago, is seen as a basketball phenom.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Isaiah Thomas  90s: The decade belongs to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. With his high flying moves, incredible defense and an unmatched determination, They win 6 championships, including three straight twice. Michael Jordan is regarded as the best basketball player to ever play. Hakeem Olajuwon wins a couple in the middle of the 90s, arguably best defensive player of all time.   important players: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Reggie Miller and Shaquille O’Neal  00s: Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal win 3 straight for the Lakers as an amazing duo. Shaq becomes one of the most physically dominant players to live. The San Antonio Spurs hang around all decade winning 3 championships behind spectacular power forward, Tim Duncan. Super Teams era begin with Kevin Garnett, Paul Piece and Ray Allen teaming up in the early 30s to win a championship for the Boston Celtics. In 2003, a 17 year old named Lebron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers begins dominating the NBA Important players: Shaq, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Manu Ginobli, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitski.   2010s: Lebron becomes best player since MJ winning 3 championships, two coming from a super team he formed with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. Not to be denied, the Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks beat Lebron’s Heat. In 2013, a point guard named Stephen Curry begins to change how basketball is played by shooting three point shots at an efficiency, difficulty level and volume that broke defenses. Armed with a lethal shot and an amazing team with Klay Thompson and Draymomd Green, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to 5 straight championships, winning 3. Kevin Durant joined the warriors in 2016, after losing to Currys Warriors, and to the dismay of many NBA fans, helped the warriors win the final two championships they won in decade.   Important players: Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis Antetekumpo."
"Incredible offensive players to me are Jordan, Lebron, Shaq, Curry, Kobe, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem and guys like that. Kevin Durant and James Harden. Duncan is not on that level of offense."
Don't forget to mention that the 08 Celtics had a very unimpressive playoff run despite how stacked they were.   Went to 7 games in the 1st round against the Al Horrors/Joe Johnson Hawks. Crushed them in game 7 but the fact that they even got there is weird   Went to 7 games to pretty much just LeBron James against the Cavs  Took care of business against what was left of the mid 2000s Pistons in 6 games   Beat the Lakers in 6.   That's a 16-10 record which is one of the worst in a championship run ever
Those are like James Johnson stat line my god
"Reposting what I posted a week ago about this topic:  &gt; Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  &gt; Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  &gt; James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  &gt; If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  &gt; 1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  &gt; But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF.  And now we're 3 wins away from the finals."
"We were happy to have James Jones last year after we hit with the Johnson pick, finessed for Kelly Oubre, actually signed a point guard in Rubio"
"The original statement makes no sense though. How can Brown take all of Harris' min when they were on the court together? If he said Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, etc or someone who didn't play then sure but not Brown. That's like saying Harden should have taken all of KD's min lmfao."
"You've got to giv3 credit to the Suns in 2006. They went to the WCF with a starting line-up of Nash, Raja Bell, James Jones, Marion and Boris Diaw with Tim Thomas and Barbosa coming off the bench.   Or, 04-05 with Nash, Q-Rich, Joe Johnson, Marion and Amare (who was 6'9"" 1/4). If JJ doesn't break his face in a freak accident, they give SA trouble.    On a side note: the '93 Suns Finals team played with the following line-up at times: KJ, Dan Majerle, Cedric Ceballos, Danny Ainge and Barkley!"
"""Never lived up to the billing, for whatever reason?"" This sounds like some revisionist history, let me refresh your memory.  2013-15: Rebuilding years, no expectations yet arguably exceeded them by making the playoffs in 2015 in a weak eastern conference.   2015-16: Lost to 4th seeded Atlanta hawks in the first round as the 5th seed. One of ONLY two teams to beat the Warriors at home this year. In fact, was the team to break their NBA record 54 game home winning streak. Both games with the NBA best warriors that year were highly competitive with the first being a double OT loss at home. Arguably no other team was as competitive with the warriors this season and Celtics would continue to be one of the most competitive teams with the warriors in the next couple seasons. (this is objectively the definition of not meeting but exceeding your billing)  2016-17: Lost in the conference finals as the one seed to the Lebron James led cavaliers, something James has a history of doing to top seeds. Went down to Chicago 0-2 AT HOME in the first round but after Brad Stevens made the decision to bench Amir Johnson in favor of Gerald Green the Celtics went on to win four straight. Three of which were in Chicago. Great coaching decision led to a series win.  2017-18: Acquired Gordon Hayward and Kyrie (via trade) and lost Hayward on DAY ONE of the season, and Kyrie later that season. Still took the cavs to seven games and eventually lost. Cavs would get swept by the dubs. Celtics split the season series with the Warriors and steph curry remarked ""It's looking very, very likely right now"" as to answer a question asking if they would see the Celtics in the finals. This was Jayson Tatum's first season and Brown's second, yet still made it very far without Kyrie at the end and Gordon for the entire year spare for a few minutes.  2018-19: Highly dysfunctional team with logjams at multiple positions. However, I do NOT pin this on Brad. As a Celtics fan I will never forgive Danny Ainge for being a giant pussy and not making a big trade this year. We had the assets and the NEED to given the crowded roster and he didn't do shit.   2019-20: Lost to Miami Heat in conference finals. Could not figure out Miami's zone. I'll give you this year. Kemba totally sucked all playoffs but still should have beaten the Heat.  2020-21: Celtics led the league in games missed due to Covid protocol. On top of that injuries to Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker (who never played back to backs and missed many other games), and eventually a season ending one to Jaylen Brown never allowed the team to gain any continuity. Celtics lost in the first round to arguably the most talented team ever assembled in the Brooklyn Nets.   Even if you blame Brad partially for this past season that's stil only 1.5 out of 8 seasons in which they didn't live up to the hype. To say his teams ""never"" lived up to the billing is just incorrect. I spent way more time on this than I should have"
"Trading Conley is a bad idea he’s too talented.  They need to squeeze some value out of a vet min guy like a lot of teams do.  A backup 4 who’s a lot more playable than niang would be very nice.  A random wing would help too.  Some guys on market include harkless, Ariza, James Johnson, markieff and Torrey Craig"
Somewhere below Miami Heat James Johnson.
James Johnson over Andre Drummond. Then the 'cocked that joint back and banged on him' quote
If you picked goats of each era  Bill Russell/ Wilt  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Magic Johnson/ Larry Bird  Michael Jordan  Shaquille/ Tim Duncan/ Kobe  Lebron James  And that gives you your top 10 as well. Avoid trying to rank them any further.
"&gt;For reference he is top 10 in 4 out of 5 of the major statistical category in the playoffs  Just wanted to point out that James is advantaged here by playing his entire career in the 4 x best-of-7 playoff era -- initiated the year before James was drafted.  Adbul-Jabbar, for example, played more than half his career playoff games after turning 35 due to changing playoff formats.  Milwaukee won the '71 title needing only 14 playoff games -- 9 fewer than the '21 Bucks.  Two years later, the Bucks lost in G7 of the Finals... but still only played 16 playoff games.  Even Magic Johnson was almost half-way through his abbreviated career before the NBA even changed the first round from best-of-3 to best-of-5."
"Team GOAT plus Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James"
"Thats just stupid man, it shows that you don't watch their games.  Mavericks tried to put ball in the hands of other players while Luka playing off-ball, but things quickly fell apart. Richardson and James Johnson were not good enough to be a real option of secondary ball handler on the team. While in Europe, Doncic played amazing with Dragic being the primary ball handler, and he was 18.  The reality of a situation is that Luka is by far the best ball handler on a team with the current roster, so this is naturally the best way to play if u want to win."
Trae Young   James Dolan  Bill Cohen  Woody Johnson  Hal Steinbrenner
"Mahomes also has a stake in Sporting KC.  Russell Wilson has a stake in the Sounders. So does Ken Griffey Jr.  Kevin Durant owns 5% of Philadelphia Union IIRC.  James Harden also has a stake with the Houston Dynamo.  Steve Nash is one of the owners of the Vancouver Whitecaps.  Magic Johnson is also apart of the LAFC ownership group (and the Dodgers ownership group as well).  Though he's not a ""hyperelite athlete"", Mark Ingram owns a 1% stake in DC United.  MLS franchises have been attracting athlete investors more than MLB has in the past few years."
As it stands Nets roster looks like this:  Harden - Mills - Carter Irving - Brown - Thomas Harris - Bembry Durant - James Johnson - Alize Johnson Griffin - Claxton - Jordan - Sharpe  That’s fifteen. Would need to move someone. A lot of fans keep pointing to Alize Johnson as the odd man out but if I were Marks I’d stick Sharpe on the Long Island Nets for the year. The two have a similar skill set (rebounding) but I trust Johnson’s ability to defend more than Sharpe’s.
Michael Jordan  Junior Bridgeman  Magic Johnson  Kobe Bryant  Lebron James
"I know, but I'd rather see him get minutes than James Johnson."
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"

"I mean sure, they allowed Tatum to drop fifty in their sole loss in that series.   The highest total they allowed the Bucks to score was 115, and that was the overtime game seven. Bucks led the league in pts/g last season.   They clearly were able to turn up their intensity on that end in the postseason, and now they’ve added a few defensive minded players in the off-season (Deandre Bembry, James Johnson, Jevon Carter). I’d like to see them add another big but ultimately I don’t think it’s going to be a big concern for them."
"If you struck the 2nd and 3rd players on every single team and then had them all compete, I don't think the Nets would rank particularly high because their roster past Joe Harris was old and/or devoid of defensive or playmaking talent.  ""But only the Nets lost their 2nd and 3rd best players it wasn't everyone"" yeah well that's just how injuries work in sports. It's next man up and the next men up for the Nets weren't good. Having better backup ball-handlers than Mike James, Tyler Johnson, and Chris Chiozza would have made a difference in the Bucks series but they instead opted for the ""put together a big 3"" route. It was a risk/reward proposition that they lost, and declaring that you're the rightful ""best team""  anyway is basically deciding the team should be absolved of that risk."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R.

Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
Yeah I’m confused by this too there’s no good athletic sf  A James Johnson type would be really good
Such a weird power trip. Wolves left with a gaping hole next to KAT with only Hernangomez and James Johnson in his way and he packed it in and quit.
He's one of those guys where people don't expect him to close out that well.  Surprisingly length/quickness/vertical means he surprises shooters. Similar to guys like Boucher or James Johnson except he has good instincts as well.
"Steph Curry / Michael Jordan / Larry Bird / Lebron James / Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Bench: Magic Johnson / Kobe Bryant / Kevin Durant / Tim Duncan / Bill Russell  I think Magic is a better player than Curry all time but Curry is a better 3rd option, hence the starting lineup"
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."

"Nets get an A- for bringing in Patty Mills(awesome addition) and James Johnson, while losing Jeff Green and not addressing any defensive concerns? I’d give them a C, then again, a lot of teams got a weird grade."
Say that to James Johnson
You say he needs to be ‘fixed’ but the last 2 years he has made the all star team and has been all defensive 1st teams. He is a solid player he just has of deficiency in that he can’t shoot. Quit putting the expectations of him being magic Johnson or Lebron James. He’s a solid starter to all Star player in the NBA
Who needs James Johnson when you got flying master Trill?
1. Manute Bol proportions  2. Isaiah Thomas height  3. John Wall speed  4. Shaq play style  5. DeMarcus Cousins attitude  6. PatBev defense  7. Ron Artest mental stability  8. James Johnson fighting ability
"Ummm per your link…  “Bonner said Jordan, James and possibly Russell and Wilt Chamberlain would be the only players he would take over Duncan. He added that he would take Duncan over Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bryant and Shaq.”   That’s pretty clear Bonner has Duncan over Kobe (Bryant). If I take the other names out the sentence clearly reads “he would take Duncan over Bryant”.   And Horry isn’t an NA. Even though he won championships with both he has said in the past he takes Duncan to win rings and Kobe to fill seats. That is a win for Duncan too.   So you have 2 out of the 10 in Kobe’s favor and 2 not in Kobe’s favor.   But unfortunately that is far from you guaranteeing a vast majority from my 10 players. But don’t give up I still have faith in you!!"
"I think having someone like James Johnson on such a young roster helped squeeze more from our injury depleted team, and hopefully added something to player development.   I hope zion didn't take it too personally because jj wasn't providing much and it's not the organisation's fault JJ dropped off a cliff and Brooklyn didn't want him."
"It honestly just wasn’t even worth it. All we got was James Johnson (who is now in Brooklyn ironically..) Wes Iwundu, and I believe a 2nd round pick? Having that vs having the possibility of JJ ,who is cool with Zion, tarnishing us instead of saying things like “They did right by me” just isn’t worth the risk whether that actually plays any factor in Zion or not"

John Salmons was starting and playing 33 MPG, Kirk Hinrich had been 3rd on the team in minutes while shooting under 41% from the field, our front court after Noah and Taj was basically just Brad Miller, and we gave rotation minutes to Jannero Pargo, Ronald Murray, James Johnson, and Tyrus Thomas.   We went from 0 depth to the bench mob, and our starting lineup went from Rose Hinrich/Salmons Deng Taj Noah/Miller to Rose Bogans/Korver/Brewer Deng Boozer Noah (Bogans got the starts but played the least of those 3).  Oh, and dumped VDN for Thibs lol."
yeah honestly everyone is terrified to pay anyone that isnt a complete first team all nba superstar but the heat a few years back even got value on completely terrible overpay contracts for meth curry and james johnson and whoever the third guy was when the contracts were in their final year.  If you arent landing free agents (i.e. need cap space open) i feel like it is better to pay guys who arent great instead of pay less money for guys who arent good. What is that money saved actually buying?

"KD is the evolutionary Iceman George Gervin  Luka to James Harden (if not just because they didn't give him some random European white guy like Pablo Prigioni)  Lebron is Magic Johnson + David Robinson (maybe not the best comp, but a pretty unique one that had me thinking)  Michael Jordan to Jesus Christ"
"Bridges, Ayton, Payne, Johnson, and Crowder too. James Jones put together a really, really solid roster that just makes so much sense on paper and in practice."
If luka was black he’d be seen as magic Johnson X Lebron James more than already
"&gt;and in college was better than MJ  Just for the record, a lot of guys were better in college than Jordan.  After James Worthy left Carolina, and Jordan had to carry the load, the Tar Heels won nothing.  Specifically, they won exactly 5 tournament games in 1983 and 1984 combined -- and I mean both the ACC and NCAA tournaments, so 5 wins in 4 tourneys.  And that despite those Carolina teams being stacked with future NBA talent -- in '84 Perkins, Daugherty, Smith, Wolf, and Popson were all Heels.  Had it not been for Big Game James' 28 against Georgetown in the '82 Championship Game, the Jordan era at UNC would've been an abject disaster.  And it would've been exactly because Jordan did things like shoot 6-14 for 13 points, with 1 rebound, and 1 assist, and 4 turnovers before fouling out of [his final college game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1984-03-22-indiana.html) \-- a loss to Steve Alford and Indiana.  Sam Perkins put up an efficient 26 in that game, and tried to take up Worthy's mantle, but he couldn't carry Jordan past the second round.  &gt;Did MJ luck out?  So to answer your question, yes.  He was very lucky that Worthy salvaged his college career, and again lucky that Worthy's knees were basically shot by '91.  And also obviously that Magic Johnson was forced into early retirement that same year.  Do Jordan and the Bulls still win some titles with Johnson in the league?  Probably yes.  Do they win a lot fewer?  Probably yes as well.  It's very plausible that Johnson retires with 6 or even 8 titles, if not for the prejudice of the time, and is probably regarded as the best player ever in that case."
"I always thought one of the best testaments to the Pistons' top-to-bottom greatness through that stretch is the fact that leaving a key member of their starting frontcourt (Rick Mahorn) unprotected in the expansion draft was their only sensible option. They legitimately ran at least nine deep and they were *all* players, so it was kind of like, ""Good luck protecting just eight dudes"".  To put it another way, their sixth man (Vinnie Johnson), is still the seventh highest scorer in franchise history, to say nothing of fellow super-subs Dennis Rodman, James Edwards, and John Salley (two of whom would eventually move into the starting lineup during the repeat in 1990)."
"Don’t forget who those players were. Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James"
"Many saw the signs, though...  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/30957423/kobe-bryant-jerry-west-draft-workout-changed-nba-history  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Joe Carbone, Bryant's strength coach, 1995-2004: I was with him for one of his Nets workouts, and the look on Calipari's face the whole time was like, ""holy s---."" Calipari says, ""Let me see you shoot the 3,"" and Kobe just starts stroking it effortlessly. So Cal says, ""Take a few steps back."" Boom. Swish. ""Take a few more steps back."" Boom. Swish. Cal says, ""That's it, I'm done,"" and then, kinda to himself, he goes, ""This guy's the next Jordan, I gotta get him.""   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Ryan West: At the beginning they were running him through drills, and Kobe would just go to the rim and dunk every ball. My dad stopped the workout and said, ""Kobe, we know you can dunk. Let's see what else you can do."" He wanted to see him do other things rather than just tear the rim down every time. My dad wanted to see players put in situations they would find themselves in during NBA games. That's when you saw the pull-up game, the jump hooks, the floaters. Kobe had every shot in his repertoire.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Black: Michael Cooper was 40 at the time, and he had been retired a few years but he was still a freak. Still wiry. Still in great shape. Cooper at 40 was like a normal person at 25. Larry Bird is on record saying Cooper was the most difficult guy he ever played against in his career, the toughest guy to ever defend him. And there's Jerry saying to him, ""Don't take it easy on this kid. Make him work as hard as you can.""      Michael Cooper, Lakers guard, 1978-1990: I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.      And boy was I brought back to reality quick. In a hurry I found out that 40 and 17 don't go together on the court. At the very beginning, I got right in there and got my hands right up in his face. Guys hate that, especially young guys. He just rose up over my hand like I wasn't even there. I was planning on him not being that strong and that he'd be intimidated.   &gt;   &gt;Black: Kobe never backed down from anyone, even at age 17. Kobe did not know how to be deferential. Michael \[Cooper\] was playing his best and Kobe just had his way with him. Kobe was just destroying him.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;*Growing up a Lakers fan, he knew exactly who Michael Cooper was and, more importantly, what people around the NBA would say if he strolled into L.A. and destroyed one of the game's greatest defenders. So Kobe never said a word. He knew the workout would speak volumes on its own. In fact, the only chatter heard that day came from former Laker Norm Nixon, who tried to encourage Cooper by yelling, ""Bang on him, Coop! Bang on him!"" from the bleachers. It didn't help. Afterward, Nixon walked up to his old friend and whispered, ""The kid just kicked your ass.""*   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Jerry West: He just had that ""It"" factor. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, people like that, they just have it. Kobe had it. You could see it. You could feel it.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Kupchak: The ease with which at 17 he was able to compete with one of the all-time great defenders in the game, that's what really stood out.      Cooper: When I did force him to take a bad shot, he'd just smile and shoot me that eye of the tiger.      Ridder: I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then Jerry stands up after what felt like only 20 minutes and, I'll never forget this, he says: ""Let's get out of here. I've seen enough. This kid's better than anybody we have on our team right now.""   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;*Coincidentally, a few weeks earlier, when Kobe worked out for Boston, he was matched up against Johnson, Cooper's nemesis, who was then an assistant coach with the Celtics. The results were very similar, and timeless: Age yields to youth. In his Boston workout and especially in his interview with team execs, Kobe wowed the entire Celtics organization, all the way up to team president Red Auerbach himself.*    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Jerry West: You watch a workout like that -- there isn't much of a choice to think of anything else. I remember saying to Jerry Buss, our owner, I said, ""Jerry, he's the best player in the draft."" I meant it. I would have taken Kobe as the first player in the draft. It was a no-brainer. He had this -- forget desire -- he just didn't want to stop playing. Ever."
Yeah he lost me at blowing the nets for grabbing patty mills james johnson and retaining kd. They are still the favorites but like Zach has a serious boner for em rn
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"One year the Lakers had Mychal Thompson, Magic Johnson, Kareem, and James Worthy who were all #1 picks, and Byron Scott, who was #4 overall."
Riley gave terrible contracts to Tyler Johnson and James Johnson
Precious is going to be good. He got shit on by our sub because he was very raw.  But he always did a few things that made you go “wow” and even when he messed up he would keep his composure and get right back to it. Y’all got a good one. I feel like he can be a bigger bodied rich mans James Johnson. Which sounds like a scary player.
"It is what it is that we basically lost Iggy, Crowder, &amp; Solomon Hill for nothing  and you guys lost Winslow, James Johnson, &amp; Dion Waiters for notihng, but all sides tried.  Mainly glad we don't have Iggy solely cause I know some of you all have beef with him (understandably), so happy that transfers now to the Clippers.  Glad our teams can go back to liking each other again!"
"Yeah maybe if Dragic was as good as steph curry he'd win a ring with Hassan Whiteside, Dion Waiters, James Johnson, and Luke Babbitt. Great point man"
"I would define a generation as being roughly 10 years. **There are never more than 5 generational players at once**  1947-57: George Mikan  1957-1970: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor  1970-82: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving(ABA)  1982-91: Magic Johnson, Larry Bird  1991-99: Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone   1999-2012: Shaq, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki  2012-2020: Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden  2020-?: Giannis, Jokic(prediction), Doncic(prediction), Zion(prediction)   Other than Giannis, I don’t think anyone has proven themselves as a generational talent.   Each of these players were the best in their generation. There may have been some overlap, but as a whole they were distinct eras for each generation.   What would you change?"
Post the one where he detonated on James Johnson
James Johnson does karate
Did you know James Johnson has a black belt?!?!?
"Heat got out of cap hell with james Johnson, dion, whiteside, Tyler johnson. We will be alright"
Nets are definitely top heavy though. But btw you forgot James Johnson
It’s a joke that Drummond is only allowed to make himself look dumb. Has nothing to do with the circlejerk of James Johnson amateur fight record. We know he hits his openers so hard they shit through screen doors
James Johnson undefeated.
We already got James Johnson for that
James Johnson was signed for that role though
🎤😐james johnson😐with the deposit😐over andre😐
"Disappointing offseason so far, in my opinion. We need a big and 6'7 James Johnson isn't cutting it for me."
"I'm not saying that. I like the signing, he's way overqualified to be a 11th guy IMO.  But not sure you can have all 3 of those guys in the rotation (especially because James Johnson also is on that category on offense)"
"He’s a very valuable player. He was fantastic last season. And very good 3 years ago in Indy. Can’t be blamed for having a bad season under Jim Boylen. Whoever does it is getting a top tier bench big.   I think he’d be a really good fit in Dallas, don’t know if they can make that work. But replace James Johnson/WCS minutes with Thad and they’re a better team, plus you can play/trust him in any playoff series."
James Johnson has never done anything to anyone in the nba yet everyone talks about him like he’s the biggest goon lol
Oh man. You really don’t know James Johnson. Be careful with that man.
ibaka took 1 swing and *instantly* realized he wanted *absolutely nothing* to do with james johnson
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
isn't james johnson the mma guy? wish they would've cleared out of the way and let them go at it. could've been fun to watch drummond get washed
"Hope James Johnson thought twice after that. No one makes Andre look stupid, only andre himself is allowed to make him look like a drumass"
I feel like james Johnson gets off purely on his rep.
A return for Iggy???  They got James Johnson and Justice Winslow.  They bought out JJ for like 30m immediately so they could pay Justice 25m for 2 years.  And they got like 26 games of G league play for their 55m+  That's not a return.  At all.  Should have just let him go the minute they got him.
"Regardless of the team he chooses I don't think he is going to contribute a lot and is not going to have a lot of minutes. Not a good shooter and he is old, the only way he can help is on defense and thinking about the teams he can sign with: - Warriors should focus on getting offense players for their bench and they already have Otto Porter Jr. Who is a 3 and D wing ( Iggy would technically be the same position). - Nets could definitely use a defensive wing coming of the bench. Right now they have Carter and Brown who are good defenders but are guards. They also have James Johnson and Blake who should get PF minutes or small Ball 5 minutes. - Lakers biggest problem is their defense, got a lot of shooters and scorers but lost their best defenders, Kent Bazemore and Ariza might be their best options coming of the bench and still are not as good as KCP and Caruso were. So maybe he could help with that 🤷."
It’s not crazy at all. People were trying to call Ben Simmons the next LeBron James or Magic Johnson. When the media is hyping him up like that saying he’s “only” Rajon Rondo makes sense.
"Waiters was never fined. He was told to lose 30 pounds or he’d be off the team. He lost the weight.    “A team spokesman said Johnson has not been fined nor suspended, but no longer is with the team at its Palm Beach hotel.”   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-miami-heat-james-johnson-20191001-xljt4fmtb5f5pcb42yqewv7us4-story.html%3foutputType=amp"
&gt; Has anyone really been fined?   James Johnson and Dion Waiters IIRC. I know Johnson specifically got suspended for it.
"I mean we also have Johnny Moore, James Silas, Bruce Bowen and Avery Johnson retired. Bowen obviously an amazing defender and an integral piece to 3 rings and deserving of the honor but also averaged like 6 points. Patty is a better player than Avery Johnson but Avery was a fan favorite and hit the clinching shot for our first title so i don’t mind the retirement. And I mean James Silas was great in the ABA and part of the early years but not exactly prolific like our HoFers either. Johnny Moore was an amazing passer who over a 5 year span averaged 11/10 and part of a few WCF runs with Gervin but injuries derailed him and ultimately isn’t remembered. Basically what i’m saying is the Spurs have plenty of players not of the same pedigree as being a first baller hall of faker but still contributed enough you the franchise to warrant a retired jersey. Sean Elliot is another person nobody outside of SA gives a shit about but he hit an amazing shot on path to our first ring and spent his career here while being a fan favorite so of course he got retired too. I’m not saying Patty for sure deserves a retirement but i’d bet he would probably get one if he wishes. He was part of our last ring during our 20 year run, where he had a memorable heat check night in the close out game and then became the locker room leader of the team as the rest of that championship team all retired or left. He was the unwavering leader of the Spurs after the departure of Kawhi and is a beloved figure in San Antonio I’d say he gets a retirement imo"
"Depth. Patty Mills is a 6th man who only plays around 20 minutes anyways and is about to turn 33 years old. Everything that happened to the Nets this year is why they need a serviceable backup PG  Irving missed 20 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  Harden missed 30 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  They thought they didnt need a back up PG and it ended up biting them in the ass severely. Then they had to sign Mike James and play PG by committee.  This signing can take the work load off of Kyrie who has missed significant time the last 2 years and now they have Harden who is battling a hamstring. That type of injury tends to stay with athletes.  They just got rid of Shamet. Bruce Brown and Tyler Johnson are FAs.  Plus even if push came to shove and you needed to play all 3, that can easily be done in a small ball line up. Shit there are lineups that get thrown out there where KD could play the 5 or even BG against other teams."
" &gt;Prime James Harden and Westbrook playing together on the Rockets must have been a figment of my imagination  Amare was a stud but he’s more comparable with &gt;Paul George, another All-Star teammate that Russ couldn’t win with  Ya listen Harden prime and KD are better than any of Nashs teammates.  But after KD/Harden the rest of roster was trash compared to Nashs. The drop off was hard.  Marion/Richardson/Joe Johnson etc. Can't even recall all of them. But it was far better than whatever Russ had.  How is that aspect being ignored lol?  Also Russ has played one season with proper spacing and an optimal set up. That was with Harden and they were black horses to win it. Until russ got injured and played like shit."
**Career Effective Field Goal Percentages**  * Kobe Bryant - eFG% .482 * Clyde Drexler - eFG% .495 * Michael Cooper - eFG% .502 * Eddie Jones - eFG% .505 * Michael Jordan - eFG% .509 * Magic Johnson - eFG% .550 * LeBron James - eFG% .560  lmao - casual
The current top 10:  1. Michael Jordan  2. Bill Russell  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  4. Tim Duncan  5. Magic Johnson  6. Larry Bird  7. LeBron James  8. Shaquille O'Neal  9. Wilt Chamberlain  10. Hakeem Olajuwon   Tell me who he would replace?
yeah but James Johnson has a black belt
Kuzma would be a better Green replacement than James Johnson
"With 3 rookies on roster and signing Patty Mills and James Johnson, the roster spot is probably more useful than anyone they could have gotten back"
"James Harden was a bench player when he played with Russ and KD, stop being disingenuous. Harden started a grand total of 7 games in his three years in OKC and while he did win sixth man of the year, he also averaged 12 ppg on 37/31/79 splits in that Finals against the Heat, he wasn't 10% of the James Harden we know now.  Amar'e Stoudemire also didn't make five All-NBA teams in seven years by accident, he was putting up 25 and 9 on 56% FG with ease. Stoudemire, Marion and Joe Johnson aren't Kevin Durant, but they offered Nash alot of help."
"The only good defender the Pels had was Lonzo. Steven Adams would constantly get burned, Bledsoe might of been one of the worst this whole year and tried in spurts I guess. BI and Zion are just not good and lack awareness on that side. You have a few guys like Hart, Naji Marshal and James Johnson that hustle on the defensive side but it's merely not enough to cover all the holes on that end."
Yeah who needs Kevin Durant and James Harden when you have Shawn Marion and Joe Johnson
"Magic Johnson, Lberon James, all his coaches and teammates in the NBA call him a great playmaker but u/iknowbetter has figured out what's a playmaker and what's not im regards to a 23 year old who is still developing."
Okay. I asked you this question earlier but you didnt respond to it so I will ask it again - Is James Johnson and a 2nd round pick worth pissing off the agency that represents Zion?
"&gt;But the point is, no one in JJs position has ever been treated like JJ thinks he should've been treated   Youre wrong. The Pistons let Blake walk with basically all of his money...same thing with the Spurs and LaMarcus. Taking care of a player who isnt a star is not a new concept...especially when that player is represented by the same agency as your young superstar franchise player. Is James Johnson and a 2nd round pick really worth pissing off the agency that respresents Zion?"
"&gt;If I hear “empty stats player” from a person who has not watched Hassan Whiteside play  How about from someone who did watch him play ?  How about from someone who was against the Heat giving him those 90M in the first place, when everyone else called me crazy ?  Someone who was also against paying: Tyler Johnson and Dion Waiters, and who was only ok with paying James Johnson for 2 reasons: reward him for the crazy season he had with the Heat and to have a large contract that you can throw in a trade for a star.  &gt;great at altering shots and grabbing rebounds.  By chasing blocks and rebounds, he's often out of position defensively, which opens up layups and dunks for the opposing team.  **But I guess it was Hassan's defensive prowess why the Blazers were \[checks notes\] 28th our of 30 in defensive rating.**  This take is so bad you're not even worth being called a nephew. You're like a Chris Broussard or something."
"&gt;That expansion team had Oscar Robinson a top twenty player ever.  Yeah, and he was many years past his prime.  And they had almost nothing else.  &gt;I will have to take your word for it was not there in 71, there are not many better defenders the Dwight Howard so who are you thinking there?  Chamberlain, Walton, Thurmond, Lanier, Malone, Gilmore... 20 years of guys tried.  The problem for Howard would be that he's just too small.  Prime Abdul-Jabbar is a match for him athletically, and around 4 or 5 inches taller, with longer arms.  &gt;I mean Gasol can hit threes so might not be the best option  Now, yeah, but he barely even attempted one until he was 32.  And that version is getting absolutely torched on the defensive end.  If I'm coaching in this game, I do not care in the slightest if Gasol makes 1.5 threes -- his career high -- because McAdoo is scoring 40 on him, or Abdul-Jabbar is hanging 50.  &gt;This ignores the AD of it all as well, which is another all time great defender to throw at them.  You could get Davis to cover McAdoo, and he's well-suited to that... but good luck trying to get Davis to guard Abdul-Jabbar.  He's too small, and worse, refuses to play that position.  &gt;Prime Lebron is 2013 and Cooper is 4 inches and 100 pounds away there’s nothing he can do there.  James did not weigh 270 pounds in 2013.  And what Cooper would do is stay in James' jersey on the perimeter -- like he used to do with Bird, driving him to distraction -- and weight doesn't matter there.  So James would have to post him up, but then he'd have to deal with getting his shots over or around a free-lancing Abdul-Jabbar, which is next to impossible.  Abdul-Jabbar held entire playoff teams to 40% shooting in his prime.  &gt;Norm Nixon and Byron Scott can’t stay in front of Russ they just can’t,  Sure they could, they'd give him 6 feet of space, and let him shoot jumpers if he wants.  &gt; Magic won’t be able to guard Anthony in the slightest.  Johnson led the league in steals, twice, and his defense is wildly underrated.  He's also one of the smartest basketball players ever, so he'd just slack off Anthony and invite him to launch from distance... at his career 48% effective rate or even his peak 51%.  For that matter, depending on the ruleset used, I would be inclined just to zone up your team of James, Westbrook, Anthony, Davis and Howard or Gasol.  I'm begging that team to shoot from outside, because they are all poor shooters except James, and even his career number is mediocre.  &gt;Shaq and Karl Malone are the match of McADoo and Kareem, Gary Payton can guard Magic and Cooper couldn’t do much agonist Kobe  Cooper is about as well-equipped as any human to guard Bryant.  No, he couldn't stop him from shooting, no one ever could, including O'Neal.  But he'd force him to take hard shots, which is exactly what you want to do with Bryant, because he'll take them all game long, and miss most of them.  Payton tried to guard a healthy Johnson a couple times -- and got torched for 33 points each time, with 9 and 11 assists.  Johnson shot 12 for 14, and 11 for 14 against him in those games."
"&gt;I mean most people have prime Lebron over him  Yeah, and most people are wrong.  Abdul-Jabbar won 6 MVPs in a decade, and has a very strong argument that he was robbed at least twice.  He also took an expansion team to a title, in dominating fashion.  &gt;Howard and Gasol are all time defenders  Neither managed anything similar to the defensive season Abdul-Jabbar posted in '71.  No one has -- not even Chamberlain or Russell.  &gt;offense their whole job would be too slow those two down and they might be able too.  Better players than those two couldn't.  And whoever is guarding Gasol can play free-safety, which is a luxury the modern squad will not have.  &gt;I’m not saying it’s clear just that it’s close  I was referring only to the frontcourt matchup that you described.  &gt;On the other side they have no one who could guard Lebron or Melo,   You would put Cooper on Russ  That depends on which version of James we are talking about.  The current one, at 250 pounds or whatever, would be tough for Cooper, but if say, 2007-ish James then I would put Cooper/Worthy on him, Johnson/Wilkes on Anthony, and Nixon/Scott on Westbrook."
Tre transformation from that roster to a Finals team in a few short years is as remarkable a front office achievement as I have ever seen.  They got Memphis to give them Iggy and Jae Crowder and in return got to buy out James Johnson for like 40m and pay Justice Winslow 26m for 2 years (and got 30 games of solid G league play from him over two years).  They just kept getting value from the craziest contracts.
"Never seen a team playing Claxton, James Johnson and Bruce Brown major minutes get overhyped this much."
Best chance of injuring him probably. Same reason the Nets got James Johnson to guard Giannis and Lebron.
"so the magic johnson finals? the 90s bulls best finals win.  the second best player on the lakers was a sophomore vlade divac (played 12 games his rookie year). bill cartwright, the 5th best player on the bulls, was more efficient and outrebounded and outplayed young vlade.   the bulls 5th best player was better than the lakers 2nd best player in the 91 finals. these stats are public knowledge. (note: james worthy was out due to injury in the WCF)  so no im sorry, but that is the 90s bulls best finals, and it was a joke. not to mention the benches and coaching staff, phil jackson v mike dunleavy.   the next year they played the team that lost to magic and vlade in the WCF. where was the challenge?  i just state what happened. after magic beat him 1 v 1 in game one they adjusted, phil, and the bulls dont win without horace grant and scottie pippen, much like they couldnt win until their rodman superteam.   after magic was forced to retire due to opportunists like karl malone, there was no challenge until hakeem took a bunch of role players to the finals.  jordan was retired one year (bulls were 55-27 instead of 57-25, with a retirement. not even a trade where they got something back, jordan was just gone), and when he came back the bulls lost in 95. so he never even had to face hakeem and role players. those bulls didnt even face a good team in the finals. and no the jazz sucked because karl pedophile malone sucked against rodman.  the 90s were weak as heck. I've only been posting here for about 2 months, but in a massively delusional thread like this one, where people are saying the sky is neon green and high fiving each other like idiots, i have to point out the obvious I'm sorry. in case somebody cares about context and truth.  i would try doing research or, God forbid, watching the games. it is all advertising otherwise."
"Given the reports about Zion, he's clearly not at a maturity level to lead a team. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were busts as veteran leaders. James Johnson did a lot for the team TBH if you watched their young guys down the stretch. More than JJ did all season. Iwundu, who they got in the deal, was part of the grizz-pels-graham deal that got them Jonas and Graham."

"Tried to post this Just my two cents in the discussion...      Going through the initial list from NBA 50th anniversary and Simmon's Pantheon (given that he is/was the basketball savant)... seems that there are 27 players in the Pantheon (not on the 50) AND have ended their career later than 96:         Rank Player	               Rank Player	Rank	Player	Rank	Player   7	  Tim Duncan	39	 Dirk	69	Dennis Rodman	85	Arvydas Sabonis   8	  Kobe Bryant	41	 Gary Payton	72	Chris Webber	88	Shawn Kemp   20	  Lebron James	43	 Jason Kidd	74	Joe Dumars	89	Vince Carter   22	  Kevin Garnett	47	 Paul Pierce	77	Tracy McGrady	90	Chris Paul   28	  Dwyane Wade	55	 Dominique Wilkins	78	Dwight Howard	93	Kevin Johnson   36	  Steve Nash	62	Ray Allen	82	Chris Mullin	96	Tom Chambers   37	  Allen Iverson	63	Reggie Miller	84	Robert Horry		   IMO, all the names up to Rodman should be included in the 75, as well as Tracy, Dwight and Chris Paul - total 18 players      Of course the Pantheon doesn't include current household names as KD, Steph, Harden, Leonard or Giannis (could also add Westbrook in that list for MVP and number of All-NBA teams consideration). - other 6 players, bringing the total to 24.      That leaves one extra player to add in the top 75. Perhaps Jokic due to his late MVP, dunno.      The tough question to answer is whether we are keeping the initial NBA 50 list intact or can we remove a few names and create space for more current players?  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||"

Maybe they're trying to catch some magic in a bottle with a former player like James Johnson in Phoenix? Only problem there is we've already seen what Elton Brand can do as a GM and there's a reason he's available...  This team is always in turmoil and I was really hoping to have some stability for one season.
Don't worry Butler fangirls are a joke. Butler is a lowlife scum and will never earn my respect since he is 95% a trash person. If Butler told a player to jump of a bridge and bully him these fans would defend him like a King. They are insufferable and think they can talk 100% about the time and be arrogant smug pricks. Real tough guys are way simple and corny than the tik toker Butler. Tired of him controlling the narrative. KAT will always be a better human and MAN than Butler. I hope someone like James Johnson fights him and walks all over him. Such a joke man.

"&gt;Did he also engage in a lot of the hard fouling stuff?  Generally not.   Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and Dennis Rodman were those most liable to deliver potentially dangerous fouls at given times (though it was never an every-play or even every-game occurrence).   The rest of the crew - Vinnie Johnson, John Salley, Joe Dumars, Mark Aguirre, Isiah Thomas, James Edwards, Adrian Dantley - were all variably capable of a variably tough foul from time to time (Dumars almost never, Thomas more likely to swing on a center, Edwards occasionally sending a message) but those guys generally fell closer to the baseline of how a lot of the league was operating back then.   Laimbeer, Mahorn, and 1991 Dennis Rodman though? Those guys earned their reps."

"John Salley, Joe Dumars, and Vinny 'The Microwave' Johnson were all likeable.  Laimbeer was dirty.  Thomas was the instigator, he'd throw a punch or push someone and then hide behind Laimbeer or Mahorn.  Rodman was borderline dirty, he made some dirty plays.  Mahorn and James Edwards weren't dirty, but they would definitely brutalize you if you came into the paint looking to score."
"The ball movement would be off the charts though. Imaging Kyrie with Magic's court vision. In my opinion, the three best players when it comes to being able to track mass data across the court (all the little details at the same time) were Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James. Getting two of them together would have been spectacular. Sorry, did you want more buckets? Is that the only way you kids know how to pay these days?"

if you just want career per game averages  Magic Johnson 5.5/6.5  Michael Jordan 6.8/8.2  James Harden 7.5/8.7 (ignoring OKC years gives a career of 8.8/10.2)  And 5 year peaks just because  Magic Johnson 6.6/7.5  Michael Jordan 8.3/9.8  James Harden 9.3/10.8
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
Just for a fun comparison:  Magic Johnson had a career FTr of .489  Michael Jordan had a career FTr of .358  James Harden has a career FTr of .522
I've seen James Johnson fly in a couple times lol  I feel like Steven Adams could be a big bro too just not enough highlights
"Sounds like copy pasta from the Heat after lebron left. And then again after the Waiters, Whiteside and James Johnson contracts."
I guess James worthy was better than Magic Johnson in 1988.
"Steph is definitely NOT a great passer. Calling a player like him a great passer, with his AST-TO ratio and his playoff history as a passer, is disrespectful to actually ""great passers"". Steph has had playoff SERIES with more turnovers than assists, calling him anything but a decent passer is massively overrating his passing capabilities.  Rajon Rondo is a great passer, LeBron James is a great passer, Magic Johnson was the greatest passer of all-time by far.  &gt; But to stay that the gap between shooting is smaller than the gap between passing is absurd.  No it isn't, Magic was actually a pretty good midrange shooter and in his last three years he shot either at league average from 3 or above it, if you ask me that's either better than Steph's ability as a passer or as good."
"Not my plan just saying even if he were to assault me it wouldn't be so bad KAT isn't a hard guy like Ron artest, the bad boy pistons, or James Johnson. You make him out to be big and tough"
"Yeah I’m assuming Blake is starter. I think Bembry is also a solid contributor, but James Johnson could definitely be benched for Millsap or Claxton."
Okay but Joe Johnson was an elite clutch shooter. Him saying this supports his practice and mindset but it may not be the case for Benjamin. It's like when all time greats become coach's or announcees and tell other players yeah just do this or just do that. Like yeah it's easier to say than do. Remember when Magic said Lonzo would be all time Laker great? James Worthy supported Jeff Green when an announcer said he was the next James Worthy? Like these dudes are supportive but it has no bearing on facts as much as you'd think.

James Harden confirmed better than Magic Johnson
"The thing is, they have great pieces and talent. Amazing. It's like a young thunder squad that made it to the finals if you ask me. It had Lonzo, BI, Zion, Steven Adam, Josh Hart, decent role players too like James Johnson, Kyra, etc. It just didn't work for some reason, as much as I would have liked it to"
"Stanley Johnson:  “Play against LeBron [James] — that means something,” Johnson said flatly. “He is the best player in the league and I want to be the best player in the league too, so I have a target on him. I will keep reaching for that goal. … He is a team player so I have to be a better team player to be on the same level as him. Did you see that Game 6 against Chicago where he had like 14 points and 14 assists and controlled everything? The best players win a lot of games, so it is not about your points or your rebounds.”  [Source](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/stanley-johnson-on-lebron-james-i-have-a-target-on-him/)"

Same with James Johnson. He didn't get hyped up exactly. But he was a fantastic 6 man like some sort of Walmart Iguodala. For just one year. Then Miami paid him
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There they go! There our championship dreams go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of unpleasant disappointment. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got [expletive] swept now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Magic Johnson hugged him and said, “Everybody get up, it's time to slam now.”"

"So a team with 9 guys that are legit players is bad depth now? And Paul Millsap and James Johnson are solid rotation pieces who are first off the bench guys for many other teams.  I don’t see what teams really have much better benches than that. Then we also have Cam Thomas, of which many believe he will be a great player, Jevon Carter who could probs be a second string PG on a different team, and some solid dudes 13-15. Sure we may lose a game if all three are out, but that happened like once all last year. We also fell into a bit of a hole early without a roster close to as good as it is now. The nets had one of the most crazily fluctuating rosters in the league last season and still were better than the bucks. I don’t see why their depth is so much better than ours."
"LeBron and Wade spoke about it but nothing was [in fruition.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834128-dwyane-wade-lebron-james-prioritized-bulls-looked-at-knicks-in-summer-of-2010)  That is Wade's own words, he did not think they would play together and I'd say every single media fan and analyst thought the same. I acknowledge I should go back to the gym but hey, words are just words.  Do you honestly think LeBron would have went to the Lakers had they did not clean up front office? Kobe told Jeanie Buss well in advanced prior to LeBron's free agency to fix front office.  &gt;“I’ll tell you, when Jeanie Buss came to me and said, ‘I really want to go after [LeBron],’ I said, ‘Jeanie, he’s not coming here until you clean up this s— here.' The last thing LeBron wants to do is come to an organization that has a lot of infighting, a lot of the stuff going on. Jeanie, it’s time for you to take ownership of this franchise. He’s not going to come if you don’t.”  Let's recap what that meant. Long time GM Mitch Kupchak of 17 years was fired and replaced by Kobe's former agent, Rob Pelinka. A person that has never worked the lines but given full trust and chance at a lifetime strictly by Kobe's association.   Jeanie had to fire her own brother Jim Buss from VP of operations for Magic Johnson. Oh did I mention it was a family [court battle?](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/jeanie-jim-buss-rivalry-lakers-family-siblings-jerry-death-ownership-lawsuit) That's not even the bulk of what actually happened, it was a [complete Kardashian episode](https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-jim-jeanie-buss-trust-20170326-story.html) amongst the entire family including filing for restraining orders.  So yeah maybe having Magic Johnson instead of Jim Buss had a huge indirect or even direct influence on LeBron. Magic Johnson already wanted to clear house, he was already wary on Luke Walton but Jeanie wanted him to stay. Johnson also got rid of their second overall pick D'Angelo Russell, remember that noise with Iggy and Swaggy P?  &gt;A miniscule paycut for a guy making the max and who was already on pace to be a potential billionaire is really not a key point  Man ignorance is bliss. I have so many things I could add. Michael Jordan wasn't even a billionaire that time and it was still unheard of any professional athlete could make that. Michael Jordan paid 275M for 97% ownership of the Charlotte Hornets. He only hit that three comma club status because all the teams shot up in value after the Donald Sterling incident. Yes it was that long ago, Steve Ballmer paid record 2 billion dollars which all franchise including the Hornets made Jordan a billionaire for the first time in his career. Fact check it.  So stop that bullshit right now. Mike Tyson squandered 300M, at that time everyone fought for max deals scared of anything sudden that could be career ending. No one GM people for ""future risk/assessment"" like they do now. You think Wiggins, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, or Drummond is anywhere worth the contracts they signed for at the time? People intentionally went out of their way during the last year of the contracts to boast in value. Anyone and everyone at the time fought for each and every penny.  I'm not sure if you're referring to LeBron's decision about Miami or Lakers at this point. I'm sure you think that one All-star break where Kyrie and KD spoke to each other is when they decided to team up right? You do realize shit happens all the time and deals fall apart. You can bullshit your way to anything but at the end of the day, you're still wrong, but hey whatever makes you happy."
Go traditional Brooklyn... Big 3. James Johnson. Nicolas Claxton. Save the bodies of Blake and LaMarcus for the playoffs. Bruce Brown starting is laughable. Save Joe Harris and the Big 3 for end of games.

"How’d he leave them in a mediocre position? They still had wade and bosh.   Even after Bosh’s blood clot, bron didn’t make them overpay for dion waiters, James Johnson and  Tyler Johnson. Or to invest in white side as a prospect."
Imagine a full team of potential DPOYs?  PG: LeBron James  SG: Dennis Johnson SF: Scott Pippen PF: Tim Duncan C: Bill Russell
He’s better than DeAndre Bembry and James Johnson.
"James Johnson, dude is like a blackbelt or something like that, dude just KNOWS how to drop anybody"
"I think the wings suck.   Looking at their playoff bench, it's probably   PG: Mills  SG: Bruce Brown or MAYBE Cam Thomas if he breaks out  SF: James Johnson  PF: Paul Millsap  C: Whichever big is appropriate for the matchup (either LMA or Claxton)  Losing Jeff Green was a big blow. I like Brown and Johnson but neither of those guys are shooters. But hopefully if you're running a bunch of other sharp shooters on the floor the gravity will be too much to ignore.  Overall, the bench is a bit deeper than I expected but if they have to cut down to an 8-man group it may be rough."
James Johnson!
"I remember hearing James Johnson had a black belt/ his family were martial artists, so even if he's not a ""tough guy"" he very likely can legitimately fight"
 Rookie - Magic Johnson (PG)  2nd year - Larry Bird (SF/PF)  3rd year -  Tim Duncan (PF/C)  4th year - Lebron James (SF)  5th Year - Michael Jordan (SG)
James Johnson.
James Johnson and Steven Adams
1. James Johnson
"It's significant improvement. Even with all the injuries and stuff, Nash didn’t have faith in his bench and went 7 deep against the Bucks for much of the series, playing KD insane minutes. the remaining 8 from that bench are no longer with the team. Alize, Perry, Chiozza, DeAndre, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Shamet replaced by Mills, Aldridge, Millsap, James Johnson. Just with their level of IQ, they'd see floor time imo."
"1) James Johnson, 2) Steven Adams, 3) Udonis Haslem"
James Johnson.
James Johnson can play his role. Plus millsap and Aldridge. Green has been replaced appropriately
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"[Bill Simmons' Grantland article from the video](https://grantland.com/features/nba-finals-game-6-retro-diary/)  &gt; Will we ever figure out what happened to this guy in the Finals? Allow me to offer two dopey theories for what happened, and only because I believe everything HAS to be explained and can’t accept a world in which things don’t have an answer …  &gt;THEORY A  &gt;Remember when Wade tore into LeBron with three-plus minutes remaining in Game 3? When he yelled at him for eight solid seconds? When there was genuine anger in his eyes? When he did it right on the court, right in front of the other players, right in front of 20,000 fans and 10 million TV viewers?  &gt;LeBron was never the same after that.  &gt;When was the last time anyone ever really yelled at LeBron James? You’d have to go back to high school, right? He just spent the past 10 years being coddled by everyone (teammates, coaches, agents, entourage members, yes-men, general managers, owners, media members, etc.). Imagine he was a little kid (which really, he might be to some degree), and imagine you were his father and didn’t believe in yelling at your kids. Now, imagine your kid screwed up in his second-grade play and, for whatever reason, you broke character, snapped, and berated him for eight seconds in front of everyone. How would he handle that? Poorly, right? He’d pretend it didn’t affect him, but the more he thought about it, it would gnaw away at him (especially once his buddies said, “I can’t believe your dad yelled at you like that”).  &gt;Could that have been what happened to LeBron? Did those eight seconds shake his confidence beyond repair? Did he resent Wade for embarrassing him? Did he think to himself, “Fine, you want to act like this is your team, then YOU win this title?” I believe every basketball champion needs a pecking order of sorts; that’s just what the history of the league told us. Miami tried to cheat this concept by putting two of the league’s best three players on the same team. It worked for 8½ months; LeBron and Wade ran the team together and deferred to one another depending on the moment. Then the Finals rolled around, Wade kicked it up another gear, LeBron didn’t do the same, Wade called him out … and the team was NEVER the same. These are the facts.  &gt;THEORY B  &gt;Passed along by a friend of mine in NBA circles: LeBron caved from the never-ending scrutiny (as brutal as any athlete has ever faced in the Internet era) and his shaky inner circle, which consists of one parent (his mother, who battled a ton of problems over the years), his high school friends (who assumed an inordinately crucial role in his life without any real experience), his agents (who never threw their bodies in front of “The Decision”), and Miami’s management (who walked him into another fiasco with the Heat’s Welcome Party). By all accounts, he’s a genuinely nice and happy guy who just wants to be liked — he was never meant to be a villain, and as much as he tried to feed off the heat (no pun intended), once it piled up past a certain point, he broke. Maybe he felt that happening against the 2010 Celtics as well; maybe that’s why he chose to play with Wade in the first place.  &gt;And maybe that’s why, right now, he’s in total denial. Even in the postgame presser, when he should have been devastated the same way Magic Johnson was distraught after coming up small in the 1984 Finals, LeBron was doing the Frank Drebin “Nothing to see here, please disperse” routine, bristling at the notion that he choked and taking shots at anyone who rooted against him. That’s what you do when you’re surrounded by enablers — you blame everyone else, and you never look within. He never understood that people only rooted against him because that’s what you do when someone boasts before they’ve ever actually done anything.  &gt;Let’s say you’re in college and one of your buddies says, “See that girl over there? I’m taking her home tonight. And I’m doing this because I’m the funniest and best-looking guy in this room.” And let’s say he’s COMPLETELY serious. Guess what you’re doing if it doesn’t happen? You’re making fun of him. Relentlessly. Really, that’s what 50 percent of the Miami-related vitriol was about; the other 50 percent was because LeBron tried to stack the deck by playing with his biggest rival (we didn’t respect it), and because he broke Cleveland’s hearts on national TV (we didn’t like it). To this day, LeBron hasn’t shown any real regret about last summer; that’s the main reason everyone rooted against him. He couldn’t handle it. He caved. And now we’re here.  &gt;So it’s Theory A or Theory B, or maybe both, or maybe neither. As I wrote last Wednesday, I don’t know why I care so much. Maybe it’s because I know LeBron might be the most talented player I will ever watch, the Wilt of this generation, and I’m going to end up being pissed off that he never reached his potential and took me to a higher place as a sports fan … which is only the entire reason we watch sports in the first place, right? Because we don’t know what’s going to happen next, and because once in a while, someone shows up who’s so good and so talented that he makes us say, “I know what’s going to happen next?” Like he’s giving us sports fan ESP? The best thing about Jordan’s final shot wasn’t that he made it, but that we knew he would make it. That’s why we revere him all these years later. Usually heroes come through only on command in movies; Jordan did it in real life. We loved him for it.  &gt;LeBron? We thought he was next. Then he fell apart against Boston. Then he chose to play with his buddy instead of beating him. Then he fell apart again. Forget about him losing; we’re losing, too. Nobody has ever fully explained that part to LeBron. We rooted against him this season because it’s fun to have villains in sports, and because it’s fun to see an overly confident person gets his or her comeuppance. Not because we hated his guts. There will be a day when we root for LeBron James again. You wait. Either way, thanks for indulging me. Back to the diary."
"Jerry West, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant are the 5.  LeBron has been a Laker for 3 years and has delivered one championship. He would have to do a lot more to catch one of those 5, who are far more accomplished as Lakers and more tenured.   Including him is ridiculous…he isn’t even a top 10 Laker, as you still have Wilt, Elgin Baylor, James Worthy, Gasol, and Mikan"
James Johnson
"2013-era Blake, Dwight, Paul Pierce, KD, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, LMA, Zeebo, Melo, Wade, Bosh, and Brook Lopez are all putting up big numbers in the 1980s. To suggest otherwise is a joke. Others like Garnett, Joe Johnson, and Steve Nash deserve on that list if you look at their entire body of work."
"I’ll just put it this way. In a vaccum, I’ll take Bird over Magic.   With that said, Magic definitely has had the better help. Magic had a pantheon player like KAJ as help. Not to mention a top 10 SF in James Worthy and great supporting cast like Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, Jamal Wilkes and such. By no means are Mchale and Parish scrubs. Dennis Johnson was past his prime and Danny Ainge was aight. They’re good in their own right. But compare that to having KAJ and Worthy? Yea Magic definitely had better help and it’s not even close."
"People often discuss if LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the greatest, but I'm not sure if LeBron has surpassed Magic Johnson or Kareem Abdul Jabbar yet."
Magic Johnson  Micheal Jordan  Lebron James  Kareem-Abdul Jabbar  Nikola Jokic
"Wait. I just realized we have enough Johnson in the league for a starting 5  Tyler Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Alize Johnson, James Johnson  At long last! We have 5!"
"Passing: Steve Nash, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, LeBron James  Shooting: Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Klay Thompson  Perimeter defense: Kawhi Leonard, Scottie Pippen  Post offense: Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Amare Stoudemire  Post Defense: Dwight Howard, Hakeem Olajuwon"
"Signed Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, James Johnson, got off Deandre Jordan’s contract and got a high potential player for him. Drafted Cam Thomas (summer league MVP) and Dayron Sharpe"
"""Jeff Green's contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap""  How tf do you even know that? The season hasn't started yet. You're only going off what you've seen, and I'm not even sure you saw it enough, because Green had his flaws too. Wasn't much of a defender and had plenty of super quiet games.  It's like anything the Nets did well, you're just tryna discredit because they're not the Lakers. Which... I mean, they signed washed players too. But washed doesn't always mean bad, depending on how the team uses them."
"&gt; I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol  Nets really couldn’t have. Unless they traded Joe Harris for like Myles Turner or something and ended the league. That’s what happens when you’re over the cap and can only offer minimum deals and a MLE.   &gt; I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  But again there are 4 other franchise corner stones who got extended. They aren’t anywhere near mentioned as a top offseason winner. An extension, (unless it’s like Giannis when people think he was a strong chance at leaving) isn’t a big win. It’s a good move but if that’s your best move you’re not a top offseason.  &gt; Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  For Mills It means they’re a top FA destination and didn’t get huge discounts, unlike the Lakers. It doesn’t make it a lesser value but it puts the Lakers offseason over theirs, LAARP or not. Millsap is washed and if he was a hot FA commodity he’d be signed the first week.   &gt; And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  You’re right but honestly Jeff Green’s contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap."
"&gt; Extending KD highly ups the chance Kyrie and Harden stay  Makes no sense to grade on what might happen. Why don’t we go ahead and give the Sixers an A+ since Simmons wanting out ups the chances the Sixers try to trade him for Dame? This team just does not have the additions to get the best offseason award. They only got a third of their big 3 extended chances or not and they lost Jeff Green. Even the Lakers got guys like Bazemore, Nunn and Monk to take discounts. Heck even the Warriors got two guys who had MLE offers for the minimum. Mills was getting that deal no matter where he went. Millsap was a late signing, James Johnson isn’t a huge addition, LMA shouldn’t even count as an addition imo. Did bring back Brown for cheap so that’s an extra point, but they lost Jeff Green. That’s not a top 3 offseason."
"Nets Big Man Depth:  KD  Griffin  Claxton  Aldridge  Millsap  Bruce Brown (he’s used as a PG/C)  James Johnson  Sekou Doumbouya  De’Andre Bembry  Jahlil Okafor  Day’Ron Sharpe  That’s arguably 6 starting caliber bigs and 8 overall rotational bigs on the roster (Sekou, Bembry, Sharpe, and Okafor combine to be 1 rotational big). Sounds pretty good to me."
Anthony Mason Steven Adams Ime Udoka James Johnson Charles Oakley
Nene  Marcin Gortat  Charles Oakley  Stephen Jackson  James Johnson
Jarvaris Crittendon   James Johnson  Marvin “Bad News” Barnes  Demi Avdija   David Robinson
Damn. They got james Johnson too? Yeah. The nets easily got the better bench.
"The team without an unproven rookie, Jevon Carter, Dendre Bembry and James Johnson"
"It's the Nets and it's not really close IMO.  Excluding the rookies, every guy on theri roster besides maybe James Johnson can contribute and fit with their 3 stars.  Meanwhile a lot of this Lakers depth can go bad, Rondo has been good 2 months in the last 3 seasons, same for Ariza, Howard was very good in 2020 but has sucked last year, DJ has been pretty bad since 2018"
"I used to hateeee James Harden, but when he dropped Wes Johnson and stared at him for like 5 seconds I immediately was like okay this mf is RAW"
"I'll give you Party BG and Harris, but LMA literally just came out of medical retirement, Millsap looks like he's about to enter medical retirement and idk who Bruce Brown even is. Claxton and Carter could be good pieces in a few years, and James Johnson has his moments for sure, but JAH is worse than DJ imo  I'm not saying their bench is all time bad or anything, but compared to Melo, Rondo, Dwight, Blazemore, Ellington, Ariza, Monk, Nunn, ect the Lakers easily win the bench comparison on paper."
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
* 1980-1982: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * 1982-1983: Moses Malone * 1983-1984: Larry Bird * 1984-1987: Magic Johnson * 1987-1993: Michael * 1980-1982: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * 1982-1983: Moses Malone * 1983-1984: Larry Bird * 1984-1987: Magic Johnson * 1987-1993: Michael Jordan * 1993-1995: Hakeem Olajuwon * 1995-1998: Michael Jordan * 1998-2003: Shaq * 2003-2007: Tim Duncan * 2007-2009: Kobe Bryant * 2009-2019: LeBron James * 2019-2020: Giannis Antekumpo * 2020-currently: Kevin Durant   Format like this
So many times James Johnson would’ve been extremely useful just for him to rot on the bench
James Johnson dunking on Kyrie
If both the new guys are gonna be kept they'd have to cut James Johnson and DeAndre Bembry
Would you rather have him or James Johnson on the roster? That's who he's likely competing with for a spot.
James Johnson
Ariza and James Johnson are shit so they are equal.  How come u have Aldridge compared with Jordan instead of gasol or Dwight lol.
"We filled a lot of holes this off-season. addressed the big man rotation(KD, Aldridge, BG, Millsap, Claxton Sharpe) addressed defense (Devon Carter, James Johnson, Millsap, DeAndre Bembry)…on paper this looks very nice"
Hum I'm not sure you've watched enough James Johnson recently (even tho Ariza is pretty cooked too).  And Melo was way better than Millsap in the playoffs series in which they faced off 4 months ago
Figured that was James Johnson
"Aldridge was still good last season, his shooting numbers on the volume he was taking was ridiculous. Can’t speak for Millsap didn’t watch too many Nuggets games. But either way Millsap and James Johnson give us forward depth and bodies throw out there."
"I would agree but mills is considerably better than mike James, or Tyler Johnson. He fills the need for the backup guard we needed. Can Thomas although I’m very excited about him I don’t know what he’s role will be yet. Jeff green is better than millsap but on this nets team that gap won’t be extremely noticeable. Other than that yeah pretty much the same although our end of the bench guys are better than last years."
Nets' playoff rotation last year:     Harden/James/   Kyrie/Shamet   Joe/Bruce   KD/Jeff   Blake/Clax     Nets' rotation now:     Harden/Mills/Jevon   Kyrie/Cam   Joe/Bruce/Bembry   KD/Millsap/Johnson   Blake/Clax/Sharpe
"Not really, we have Blake/Millsap/KD/James Johnson as guys that can play the 4, and basically all of them can play small ball 5 as well in short spurts"
"Haslem keep chipping away at the respect that come with a role like his. He has more quotes that minutes. It's wild that as a vet presence, he can't grasp that it's best to be seen and not heard  What kinda mess is this:  &gt; I’m still talking to these guys: Dion Waiters, James Johnson and Tyler Johnson, all these dudes. I still keep in touch and check they temperature. I still pull they card when I see them on TV actin’ a fool and they ain’t handlin’ they business right! I still do that! Because it matters. It matters."
"The Aldridge part is on Marks IMO, because like this is 2021, you DONT need to have Lamarcus, Millsap, Blake, Claxton, James Johnson on the same roster, especially because one of your best role players (Bruce Brown) is defacto a big on offense"
Udonis vs James Johnson would be a crazy fight
"Nash responded to the refs bullshit by putting our thug lineup in, just missing james johnson"
"Ted Stepien gifting the pick that would become James worthy to Los Angeles.   Not exactly a trade but Utah signing Gail Goodrich from LA, leading to them giving up the pick that became Magic Johnson in compensation.   That Lakers 80s dynasty had so much luck going for them."
Damn James Johnson was killin it in the 2000s
James Johnson
"What was that team:  Ish Smith,  James Johnson,  Al-Farouq Aminu,  Jeff Teague.  None of them have been stunners but all have had 10+ year basketball careers."
"Rudy Tomjanovich.  It was a coward punch.  This thread is more like legit tough guys eg. Ben Wallace, Ron Artest, James Johnson, ZBo, Larry Johnson, Charles Oakley."
James Johnson is highly trained and claps every other player. After that it might be Shaq and David Robinson. Shaq has had usbstantial training and Robinson probably learned a bit in the military
"The best giveaway ever was the Grizz having a James Johnson rub on neck tattoo giveaway when he first caught on with the Grizz and got in the rotation. I forgot what the tattoo said, but you had all these surburbanites walking around with fake neck tattoos in tribute to the dude."
Shaq Zion Lebron James Johnson Magic (good defense)
James Johnson
"Didn't James Johnson do MMA and shit? He's winning his position, maybe the whole thing tbh"
"Royce White, James Johnson"
What purpose does James Johnson have on the nets? lol
Some thoughts:  D'lo was horrific for 90% of the game but he showed big time in the 4th quarter (like he usually does tbf).  Ant was bad tonight. He argued with refs constantly over no calls and wasn't thinking through what he should do on offence.  KAT was a God on offence but his beef with JV surfaces again and he fouled out. He needs to learn to keep that shit under wraps or for the Wolves to have a James Johnson type of guy to go out and beat the shit of Jonas so KAT doesn't rack up fouls.  Last year this is a game the Wolves would have lost 100% though.
There are 7 players with a GOAT claim.  That's tier 1.  This nonsense that only MJ and Lebron have a claim is a reflection of how many casuals they attract to the discussion.  Each of those 7 has a claim but there are also reasons why they aren't a clear number 1.  There's no right answer but rather a pick your flavor element involved.  You can build your team around any one of them and find the highest level of basketball.     Alcindor  Bird  Duncan  James  Johnson  Jordan  Russell
"Kyrie, claxton, joe Harris, cam Thomas, James Johnson for Lebron"
"Leaving gymnasts out because that’s incomparable, I think of Michael Phelps, Calvin Johnson, LeBron James when I think of peak athletes"
"I’m sorry, but one game into the season isn’t enough to say this is a poor version of shooters around Luka. THJ was one of the best shooters in the NBA last year. DFS and maxi are experts at hitting corner 3’s, KP stretches the floor, and we replaced James Johnson and Josh richardson with Bullock and Brown who both shot better than 40% on 3 on more than 10 attempts a game combined.   Like, is this a championship roster? No. But Luka/THJ/bullock/DFS/KP  With Jalen/brown/green/maxi/Dwight off the bench, that’s a great shooting starting lineup. You can criticize interior defense and playmaking, but we have shooting."
James Johnson the only vet from last season I awknowledge. SMH.

"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would’ve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn’t have needed to trade up. This meant we didn’t have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It’s really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren’t worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."

"Paywall  Markieff Morris latest to learn difference between NBA condition and Heat standards  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Oct 21, 2021 at 3:07 PM  MIAMI — An 11-year veteran, Markieff Morris made sure he arrived to Miami Heat camp in NBA shape. He also knew, having worked out for years during offseasons in South Florida with Heat players, that it wouldn’t be good enough.  “I came in in somewhat good condition,” he told the Sun Sentinel ahead of Thursday night’s season opener against the Milwaukee Bucks at FTX Arena. “The condition I came in would have passed anywhere else, let’s put it like that. And then once I came in that condition, they’re like, ‘You’ve got another notch to get to.’ ""  With no room for compromise.  “He’s getting his legs,” coach Erik Spoelstra said “He’s getting in Miami Heat condition. He came into camp fit and in good condition, and then there’s our level.”  For Morris, 32, it was one of those things that you don’t know until you know.  “I come here a lot in the summer to play and also I went to Kansas, and they’re pretty crazy there when it comes to the same type of stuff,” he said. “I was kind of getting myself prepared for what could be next coming to camp.”  The buy in came throughout training camp.  “I believe I need that to be my best self,” he said.  For years, the Heat have been able to extend the careers of 30-somethings with Pat Riley’s insistence that as the age goes up the weight and the body fat have to go down. Having seen players such as Shaquille O’Neal, Alonzo Mourning and Gary Payton thrive later in their careers with the Heat, Morris said he wants to be on that side of history.  “For sure,” he said. “You look at their track record, they get a lot of guys that are older, Gary Payton, Shaq, Zo, James Posey. You can go down the line with the older players they had that were in great shape. They looked like they had their legs under ‘em.  “And that’s how I felt. I wouldn’t call me old, but I am in my 11th year. Them getting me feeling how I feel now is the way I need to feel throughout this season.”  The work, Morris said will remain ongoing. For some, such as James Johnson, the before-and-after that came from the Heat’s conditioning demands proved career sustaining. For others, such as Dion Waiters, it was fleeting.  “I think I got another level to get to shape-wise,” Morris said, hoping for yet another NBA payoff after taking a one-year deal with the Heat at the veteran minimum. “I’ve pretty much been at the lowest body fat I’ve been at my entire career, which is 8 1/2 now, but I will be down lower than that this season.”  Miami Heat Source Newsletter"
we traded him for 2019 cap space and trade exception  which we used to trade off our picks for delon wright and cauley-stein  we then traded delon wright and more draft picks for james johnson  then we traded johnson and more draft picks for jj redick and nico melli.  now both of those players are gone
"&gt; Magic Johnson indicated one change he would have made before resigning in 2019 would have been to let LeBron James know about it before it was announced.      His resignation really came out of nowhere, I think we were all blindsided"
James Johnson has got to be average at the least
We’ve got enough we only need a few to be useful. Aldridge can be useful against a team like the sixers. James Johnson is a decent Giannis defender over his career. My main gripe was Bruce brown not getting any chances. Millsap definitely looks washed I will say.   Joe Harris still needs to be covered as a threat he’s always useful even if he’s not hitting shots.
They didn’t look too good last night.  Milsap and Aldridge looked washed  Joe Harris is a clear liability when he isn’t hot from three  They had guys like Jevon Carter and James Johnson playing rotational minutes
You make it seem like teams haven't been doing these types of trades forever. The Heat traded Dragic and an unimpressive Precious to get back Lowry.   James Johnson got traded multiple times.   Teams just regularly move players around in order to get expiring contracts all the time
"This is a NOP problem. The organization should be clear about the physical expectations when reporting to training camp. There is a reason some teams require players to be in certain shape before they can even join training camp. James Johnson had to keep working out for a week or two before he was allowed to join training camp in Miami on year. If fat Shaq can do it, Zion can too, just needs to commit."

"Lemme take a crack at writing the opening, but it might sound pretty similar to their moment on kawaiis shot:  2019 was a big year for the NBA's eastern conference. LeBron had dominated the conference for almost a decade, having taken his team to the Finals from 2011-2018. However, in the summer of 2019, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference, making the title of Eastern Conference Champion suddenly available to teams that didnt have a LeBron James on the roster for the first time in eight years.   One of the teams with the best shot at that title, and a shot at the 2019 NBA championship? The Philidalphia 76ers.   Two of the men who led them in 2019 were home picked. Grabbed with the number 3 and 1 pick in 2014 and 2016 respectively by General Manager Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were a lethal, towering duo (slap player stickers on here). While the league was spared initially as Embiid sat out his first two years with a foot injury, his dominant, physical game brought back memories of transcedent big men of yore, and when Simmons debuted after his own year spent recovering from foot injury, it took him just four games to notch his first triple double. His dazzling passes and imposing drives drew comparissons to Magic Johnson and Lebron James, and Philidalphia fans everwhere salivated at the prospect of this duo leading their long suffering city to glory.   Then in 2018, with Lebron James and his Eastern Conference Champion hogging ways off in the West, 76ers management pulled the trigger. Recent #1 pick Markelle Fultz was swapped for Clippers star Tobias Harris, and a disgruntled Jimmy Butler was aquired from the Timberwolves after he politely and calmly asked for a trade, coach Brett Brown had perhaps the most lethal starting five in the East, winning 10 of their last 15 games to go into the playoffs determined to complete the Process and bring glory to the City of Brotherly Love.   Through the first round of the playoffs, it looked like they would do just that, finishing off the Brooklyn Nets in a gentlemans sweep 4-1, blowing them out in 3 of their 4 wins by double digits or more.   They went up 2-1 in the second round against the Raptors, before losing a tight game 4 where Philly had chances to take the lead down the stretch. They would get blown out in game 5, but showed life in game 6 where a balanced attack by all four of Phillys stars helped force a decisive game 7.  While game 7 was in Toronto, the 76ers definitely brought the spirit of Philidalphia with them north of the border, with all four stars once again scoring in the double digits, though Toronto's superstar acquisition in Kawhi Leonard went absolutely supernova to keep the game tied down the stetch, with Toronto having only 4.2 seconds on the likely last posession of the game.   Still, with the most dominant big man in the game in Embiid, a lethal closer in Jimmy, a steady distributing hand in Simmons, and a lethal terrtiary gunner in Harris, and a somewhat hobbled Toronto roster, the 76ers liked their chances in OT. All they had to do was get a stop and-   (Clip of kawhis shot)   Oh no. Who knew a basketball could bounce that many times and still go in?   And just like that, the fruit that was so carefully nurtured by Sam Hinkie from the manure of the early and mid 2010s Sixers rotted on the vine, then all the vermin in Philly descended and tore the fruit to pieces. And probably pooped on it some more.   Collapse music."
"I feel like Nets have to make a move for a rim protector, that front court is ancient besides Claxton. 36yo Aldridge, 36yo Millsap, 34yo James Johnson, and 33yo Blake Griffin isn't going to cut it."
Did James Johnson have the over? Nearly ruined my under bet for no reason that sob
Where the fuck was Bruce Brown tonight? Was he injured?  In no world should you be down 20+ points and playing James Johnson/Jevon Carter over Bruce Brown
James Johnson with the porkchops
James Johnson is gonna play for every team in the league by the time he retires
"This is a good Giannis stopper tryout game for the Nets. Blake, Claxton, Milsap, James Johnson...try one, try all."

"Yeah, I’m of the opinion that Bird peaked higher than Kobe, but I don’t place Bird over Bryant because you can be highly impactful and contribute to championship-caliber play (which is ultimately the goal) as a superstar outside of your peak. Kobe won 5 championships and 2 FMVPs outside of his peak. If peaks were the be-all, end-all argument regarding overall impact and efficiency, things would be a little different.   The only non-“bigs” in the Top 10 conversations (other than Kobe) I’ve seen online and in-person are Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and LeBron James are GOAT candidates to me and Kobe doesn’t compare to them.   Magic was much more efficient than Kobe was, but Kobe was a higher-volume scorer, far better defender, and had immensely impactful gravity. There might be a debate worth having but I personally don’t think Bryant was impactful enough to be greater/better than Magic.  The only non-“big” in the Top 10 that I have Bryant over is coincidentally Larry Bird, who I outlined in my post was slightly more efficient in the RS but slightly less efficient in the PS. Obviously you could make the case for Bird over Bryant (higher peak, much better rebounder, slightly better overall playmaker), but I prefer Bryant due to his longevity, scoring prowess, better playoff performances/overall playoff success, and defensive capabilities.  I am not using any of the statistics or points in my post to propel Bryant above Jordan, LeBron, or even Magic. I have him over Bird, but that is an opinion of mine that I think is quite defensible even if you, or others, disagree.   Hope that made sense! Thanks."
"It's entirely possible. James Jones is extremely smart and self-aware. Maxing Ayton means your title hopes are directly tied to him staying motivated, focused, and playing with intensity on a consistent basis. All of this has essentially been forced upon him by CP3, Booker, and Monty Williams. CP3 even said something along the lines of how hard he worked with Ayton and that Ayton was too comfortable with losing. And every Suns fan remembers Ayton's infamous quote about what success would be to him: ""getting to that second contract""    Also, the Suns are gonna want to pay Cam Johnson as well because he's an absolute stud of a player. Maxing Ayton will probably lead to issues signing Cam. There's a ton at play here, I wish it was as simple as ""pay him"""
Transition scorer: Lebron James  Transition playmaker: Magic Johnson
"Same, people clowning the rankings for having the Mavs above clippers and Nuggets but the Clips are missing their MVP caliber leading scorer and the Nuggets are missing an all star caliber wing, the clippers are potentially looking at the play in and the Nuggets may be just 48-50 wins.   When healthy the Mavs last year went 33-16 and Reggie bullock and sterling brown are better than Josh richardson and James Johnson"
"Yep!  Saw this as well:  6.4 apg 5.8 rpg 1.5 spg 2.2 3pt pg  ""Nobody, including Lebron James, Michael Jordan  Magic Johnson and Jason Kidd, have done that."""
James Johnson lol  What's that say about Magic Johnson?

"https://www.si.com/nba/2016/04/21/stanley-johnson-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-detroit-pistons-game-2  &gt; “I’m definitely in his head,’ Johnson said, according to ESPN's Nick Friedell. “That’s for sure.” Johnson, who has spent time guarding James the first two games of the series and received a shoulder bump from LeBron early in Wednesday’s game, went on to add more bold commentary about the No. 1-seeded Cavs, who lead the first-round series 2–0.  &gt; “I wish he would just talk when [the game] is 0–0, not when he’s up 16 [points],” Johnson said, according toFriedell.  “He jabbers. He moves his mouth sometimes. Their whole team does, kind of like they’re little cheerleaders on the bench.”   The comments are so ridiculous that I rooted for him just because of his (over)confidence."
"Umm Taj Gibson,  jimmy butler,  tony snell,  and James Johnson are some late round gems that disagree.  Just admit you’re  biased against him due to him having a bad stint in Minny.  But let’s be fucking fair,  your organization is ass and your stars were soft as shit.  The jimmy butler trade would have worked if KAT wasn’t a bitch and Wiggins a lazy fraud"
"Agreed, Blake is very strong, adding Millsap and James Johnson to help guard Giannis. Claxton adding weight as well. Really excited to see how this team gels. Lot more depth defensively this season"
Los Angeles Lakers      Magic Johnson - Steve Nash     Kobe Bryant - Jerry West   LeBron James - Elgin Baylor   Karl Malone - Pau Gasol   Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Shaq        Their bench is better than most teams' all time starting five
I remember James johnson calling out Sacramento because they didn't provide scouting reports before games lol
"People and media critics have been saying that for almost 4 years now. He's always had a build of Hedo Tukoglu, Magic Johnson and James Harden. As well as his game. He's just *HUSKY*"
"Wtf? That’s not even remotely close to what I’m saying.  My argument is that he didn’t have Michael Jordan AND Shaquille O’Neal AND Kobe Bryant. When Michael got old, he got Shaq. When Shaq left, he still had Kobe.  When Tim Duncan got old, Pop had who? In 2014, Pop coached a team with a 37 year old Tim Duncan and only 22 year old Kawhi Leonard to a chip. That team had NO PLAYER average 17 ppg or 30 min per game.  That team had less star power ANY of Phil’s championship teams. They won the championship against one of the best teams ever assembled, the prime Lebron James Heatles. And they won with a great system built by Gregg Popovich. They didn’t rely on a triangle offense with MJ or Kobe or Shaq. They won with a perfectly built motion offense, a selfless team culture, and as Magic Johnson described it “smart fundamental basketball.”  That’s my argument. Hope that was easier to understand"
But sterling brown and Reggie Bullock&gt;Josh richardson and James Johnson
"""Are you not entertained?""  - James Johnson, Patty Mills and Joe Harris, probably."
Maybe this is James Jones realizing he has Bridges Ayton and Johnson to pay.
"Watch out. This sub fawns over hEaT cUlTuRe. You’ll get banned if you say anything negative about them, like how since Lebron left, in 7 years they were only able to attract one star free agent (butler). This despite having no state tax and beautiful water. And hEaT cUltUre.   Or how they made terrible contracts with whiteside and tyler johnson, to have to trade them for peanuts to get out of them.   Or how they disrespected their most iconic player to the point he was willing to go to Chicago to get away.   Or how they continue to pay a man who hasn’t been able to contribute as a player in over 5 years to warm the bench instead of making him a coach. And this same man, who has barely started for the team, will have his jersey retired.   Or how they retired the number 23 for Jordan, you know, a player who’s never played for them.   Or how they refused to trade for JAMES HARDEN because the rockets wanted TYLER HERRO.   hEaT cUlTuRe tHo"
Maybe James Johnson for Barnes floor
"Lol. The heat are always so overrated in this shit. How many playoff series have the won since Lebron left (probably just the ones in the bubble?).   They’re just given a lot of love because they never really tanked after Lebron left and remained competitive but that doesn’t mean they’re the most poised to win a championship. Even the warriors tanked to get wiseman. Masai saw that they weren’t champion material and tanked for Barnes. The heat have also given out a bunch of bad contracts to guys like Whiteside, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, etc."
This is my top 10 if we're talking pure impact on winning.  LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem  Shaq/Hakeem tie  Curry  Durant  Kevin Garnett  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird
1.  Michael Jordan 2. Wilt Chamberlain 3. Lebron James 4. Hakeem Olajuwon 5. Magic Johnson  6. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 7. Larry Bird  8. Shaquille O’neal  9. Kobe Bryant 10. Tracy McGrady   May be somewhat unpopular
"Are you basically just asking who we think the 10 most skilled basketball players are? Or are you asking who we think had the 10 best peaks? I’m confused, but I am going to assume the former.   If so, this is my 10, in no particular order: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson, and Stephen Curry.  This is in no way representative of my Top 10 though."
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
Was the list changed because your top 10 and the top 10 in the link is different   LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Wilt Chamberlain  Magic Johnson  Bill Russell  Shaquille O'Neal  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Larry Bird
"They really said:   “there are 61 players better than dwade including paul arizin “ (a guy who played back when black people weren’t allowed to play in the same games and also most people could only dribble with one hand.)  They really said:  “Scottie pipen over Shaq, Kobe, KD, Robinson etc… but not Steph.”   They really said:  “Dirk was just aight”  They really said:   There are FIVE people better than lebron fuckin James. One is George Mikan, and the other is Magic Johnson, who himself said that lebron is better than him….   They really said that shit."

Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
Yeah Casey's rotations that series were Scott Brooks level bad. He didn't play James Johnson at all even when the crowd was literally chanting for his name.
"Years ago, I walked into a small elevator in my office building. When I walked in, there was someone there, and I just starting looking up and up. It was Andrea Bargnani, Mr Primo Pasta himself was in there taking up all of the vertical space. He was in there eating a Tim Horton's cruller. I just remember how small the cruller looked in his hand, like a tiny timbit.  I gave him a nod and said congrats on your contact extension (hah!), he nodded back at me like an annoying toddler and said thanks. I just remember being mesmerized at in the span of going down 2 floors, how he killed that cruller in like 2-3 bites.  Turns out the Raptors medical office was in the building there, so I remember seeing other players like James Johnson and Jarrett Jack at the Druxy's deli ordering food. I remember feeling underwhelmed at how tall Jarrett was."
Ok so James Johnson isn't gonna be Uncle Jeff. I accept it now.

I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
James Harden  James Worthy  James Jones  James Johnson  James Lebron
"This is why every team needs one James Johnson type on the roster.  When PJ Tucker is bearing down on you, you can't just be like ""thad young, protect us friend"""
"This team is way more proven than that Clippers team.  KD, Patty Mills, and Kyrie have been there and shown up.  Harden, Millsap, LMA, Blake, and James Johnson all know how to play in the playoffs.  Even the young guys like Bruce Brown, Claxton, and Harris have experience in the playoffs."
"I called it when they signed KD and Kyrie that they'd never win with those 2, mainly because of Kyrie. Signing Harden gave them a giant boost, as did signing all those veterans for small/min deals.   It's insane that they have Aldridge, Blake, Millsap, Patty Mills besides their big 3, plus a few other nice pieces in Joe Harris, Bruce Brown Jr, James Johnson (if he can still play ?)."
"Oh trust me, I became an nets fan in like 1998 and Jason Kidd turned me from a young kid who liked basketball to an obsessed die hard nets fan. Use to cut out his pictures in the news paper, along with Kmart and RJ, and hang them on my wall. When he announced he was resigning with the nets instead of the Spurs it was like one the happiest day of my childhood lol (looking back I wish he went to the Spurs, Duncan would have retired with  7 or 8 rings)  Vince was fun, and the whole Deron Williams to kg / Pierce era was… exciting? But nothing has ever come close to those early 2000 nets teams. The last 5 years has brought me back and it’s been an insane amount of fun. I used to get overly excited waiting patiently to see if we would sign Allen crabbed and Tyler Johnson or if their teams would match, and now we have Kevin fucking Durant on our team along with freaking James harden and Kyrie.   If we can just win 1 championship with this team I’d seriously be ok with another 5-10 years of complete mediocrity. If we win 2 or 3 championships then I could care less if the nets don’t make the playoffs for the next 20 years.   Can’t even imagine what it’s been like being a warriors fan over the past decade."
"Harden/Joe Harris/KD/Blake/LMA  Bench : Patty Mills/Cam Thomas/Bruce Brown/Millsap/Claxton  With James Johnson/Jevon Carter/ Bembry/ Day'Ron Sharpe as end of bench  This team can win a ring 100%, not like they're favorite and are gonna smash teams left and right but on a good run they can"
"Cash considerations, or throw in Bazemore so we can get a late 2nd round pick.   Then sign a wing from free agency like Glenn Robinson III or James Ennis. Heck I'd call up Stanley Johnson"

it was smart but Mitch swiped down and fouled him. I’d rather have James Johnson try to beat me than KD
"Bc they were double teaming him so he either passed out and got the assist or the play fizzled out and he was forced to shoot  Also it’s not like fouls on jumpers don’t exist. In fact one of his two shooting fouls was on a jumper. and that was in the first half. no shooting fouls at all in the 2nd half, including a hook shot where James Johnson just flat out pushed him off his path"
There's actually a clip of Aldrige pushing Mitch into James Johnson.
Or pre prime James Johnson for that matter
Neither is prime James Johnson
"""2 free throws for Johnson James"""
He’s right. They’ve got guys like Bembry and James Johnson taking up minutes lmao.   They need to trade Joe Harris ASAP
I had no hope when I saw James Johnson with it lol
"This guy is a Muhammad Ali, Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Barry Bonds hybrid 😩😩"
JAMES JOHNSON
Twas James Johnson
Probably should’ve let James Johnson shoot it. If he hits it then so be it
Charge? Just go straight up. It’s fucking Mitchell Robinson against a washed James Johnson. Robinson has an absurd standing reach and vertical. Johnson would’ve had to throw up a prayer.
And no way James Johnson is making that play over Robinson.  So dumb.
james johnson clutch
James Johnson attacking the basket for game winning play is an unnatural motion
Whoever fouled James Johnson on that last possession was foolish to not just have both arms up so no foul would be called
James Johnson  the hero. Just as we expected
Such a bad foul by Robinson. He is much taller and athletic than James Johnson. Reggie was 100% right on the broadcast.  Washed James Johnson isn’t going to get a good shot over you.
James Johnson FTs are how I expected that game to go
James Johnson our closer
"That was a great game, and James Johnson with the winning scores like we all expected"
"James Johnson making the winning play, yeah that's expected"
So funny to see legendary Bulls duo Derrick Rose and James Johnson on the floor
James Johnson in a closing lineup?
James Johnson literally fuckin tackles Burks on that stupid Mills layup what the fuck
Wow Millsap and James Johnson did something
"Is Blake Griffin hurt, or are these games ""DNP - sucks?""  Hard to believe he'd be worse than Millsap and James Johnson if healthy.  (And Johnson hits a 3 just as I hit enter)"
Why do we keep playing these lineups with both James Johnson and Millsap.. they both suck
"Griffin can stay. Millsap, James Johnson and Jevon Carter can go."
Locked in on defense. No Millsap or James Johnson (yet lol)
Signing Millsap and James Johnson was redundant when we were already going to re-sign Blake. They’re all washed PF’s that are trying to be small ball 5’s
"&gt; For example, if a team like Minnesota drafted Giannis instead of Shabazz, it is no longer the same team, same chemistry, same timeline as before, and therefore, you can’t guarantee that this same team would now end up last place in the west 2014-15 so that they could get the pick for KAT.  I agree, but in this situation its likely.  Giannas had all sorts of signs that he could be a stud one day, but was a non-factor for his first year or two in the league.  Milwaukee actually had a worse record after drafting him (not saying he was the reason for it, but its not like a LeBron James or Magic Johnson situation here where a player came in NBA ready)"
"just like Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson..."
"He’s been horrible offensively and pretty bad defensively, but he hustles and takes charges which can be very valuable. So I think he we will make it back in to the rotation, he just needs to be able to knock down some 3’s.  Our problem is that we have Blake, Millsap and James Johnson which is kind of redundant as they are all kind of the same player. Too slow to be 4s now, but also not big enough to be 5s. Imo we didn’t need to sign James Johnson or Millsap if we were going to re-sign Blake."
might have to run with james johnson
"different players can succeed in different situations and teams need different things. nets regularly run  a rotation of mills - bembry - brown - james johnson- millsap. We could swap mills out and put more of his time with harden and durant, and put kemba there to take a couple pull up mid rangers and try to do something in that time.   I am under no delusion that kemba is a good player. but our guard rotation is virtually non existent of ball handling right now. patty cant really do it, harden is our only point guard on the rsoter right now."
Right now it would likely come by reducing some of our forwards minutes. We’re playing big with forwards like James Johnson because we hve virtually no guards left.  Bruce brown or bembry would also see less minutes.
"lmaooo yeah, i'd love to see any point on the sub where Harris, Claxton, and James Johnson were every prominently displayed on the front page or top comments for any consistent period of time."
Harris and Claxton have been out of the lineup for like 8 games now lol. Claxton only played like 4 games this season. James Johnson? what? lmao
He has help. He’s playing next to harden. And joe Harris (who this sub was all about last season). And patty mills. And Aldridge. And Claxton (who this sub was all about last season). And James Johnson. Obviously Kyrie is an insanely massive loss though. Tens of millions out that could be filled by others. But the harden issues are a much larger detriment
I watched a bit of the first half and it was a real train wreck on offence for the nets. The Mills 3 followed up by Harden and James Johnson fighting over an open rebound resulting in a TO was sad.
We looked better with James Johnson running point. Maybe he didn’t deserve boos but idk how you could cheer for him tonight. This might’ve been the worst triple double of all time.
"Bro the Nets beside maybe Brown and Bembry have no fight in them, they spend to much time complaining and half the time seem disinterested. James Harden especially has been concerning, like it’s 20 games into the season and he still hasn’t gotten his shot together. James Johnson is straight up hacking out there. Mills is good but missed some big ones down the stretch. KD needs to play like a 7 footer on the boards man, he is allergic to boxing out. Millsap shouldn’t touch the floor and neither should Carter. Nash needs to learn to run some plays to get better looks because a lot of their stats have been padded by playing bad teams, the second they play a team on their level they completely fold. They need a center bad because right now this small ball isn’t working. Also the switch everything was getting exposed, all they needed was one switch to get Aldridge onto a guard and it was all over, Nash needs to be better."
"I saw James Johnson at a grocery store in Brooklyn yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
James Johnson has got to be in list of top 3 scariest motherfuckers to ever play in this league
Watching James Johnson eat shit never gets old ❤️
James Johnson thinks he's way better than he is
Fuck James Johnson
james johnson hasnt been good for like 5 years
James Johnson talking shit on the bench??? Why? Lmao
I’m more sour on James Johnson.

"On all D: I have my eyes? I watched a lot of his career. He dogged it on D a ton in the post Shaq years. He had the ability, and that's not in question, but not the inclination. He did turn it up in high profile games, and I think that helped him with a media already looking for more reasons to give an LA player accolades. D isn't as easy to quantify, so citing stats seems pointless. But do you really think he was a better defender than Tony Allen, Metta, Shawn Marion, AK-47, Bruce Bowen, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Dennis Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Tayshaun? He has more All D's than any of them, and that's absurd.   On Pau: I think he's massively underrated as a big man who could do almost anything on offense and was especially underrated on D (in general, I think good big defense is much more important than good wing defense, and I think Pau was better relative to his position than Kobe was to his, game in and game out). He could play in the mid range, kept the ball moving when that was called for, was a good shot blocker, could post up (this was both a strength, in that he was very good at it when he was on, and a weakness, in so far as he lacked the drive and clearly second guessed himself a lot), etc. That versatility was insanely valuable, but I think poorly understood, in an era when offenses were ripe for evolution but mentalities were stuck in the 90s. I don't think PPG tells the whole story, and the impact his addition to the Lakers had speaks volumes.   And with Shaq, I especially think PPG is misleading. You game planned for Shaq, and then dealt with Kobe. If you could play Shaq closer to straight up, you had a much better chance of beating the Lakers. If you couldn't, that opened up holes for Kobe to exploit, and also Shaq was still going to score a bunch. But the order of priority matters, and Shaq was the engine of that offensive scheme. He was option 1, and the post Shaq 1A/1b story always seemed to me to polishing the story of the guy who stayed. I think there is a big divide between Laker fans and those of who watched those games not as Laker fans on this point.  I think history has shown Nash probably didn't deserve that MVP (he was great, but that scheme was too far ahead of its time to chalk it up to just him), but Kobe was 4th in mvp voting for a reason. LeBron was far and away better than Kobe that year (that to me was the year that made it obvious he could be what he was hyped to be, a possible GOAT), I'd take Dirk that year over him as well, and I think Wade was comparable. The Lakers were a good but not great offense and a mediocre defense, and so was Kobe. His case was driven by relatively inefficient volume scoring at a time when versatility was more and more valuable. I don't think it was close for Kobe that year, in the same way it wasn't close for Wade.   Finally: I'm a sports fan who grew up in a series of failing Rust Belt cities and towns, of course I'm a hater. I was 11 when Kareem wasn't fouled and still got to steal our title on bullshit foul shots in 88. Fuck him and fuck Magic and fuck the Lakers. I loathe LeBron James and think he's a villain. Michael Jordan is an objectively evil force of nature, like entropy or gastrointestinal disease. Larry Bird can kiss my ass while the shit is releasing. But these are all great players, all top 10, no matter how much I hate them. You have to recognize greatness for the hate to matter. With Kobe I'm just sort of tired of the conversation? He's a great player, but not top 10, and nowhere near the player the guys named above are. He was never the clear cut best player in a given year, or in any given series of years. If he played for another team people would say top 15 and that would be fine. It's Laker fans that prop him up, largely as a matter of scoring, and it wasn't that long ago y'all were on a ""better than LeBron/up there with MJ"" kick, which strikes me wildly delusional. He was a great scorer, an inconsistent but skilled defender, an unwilling passer, had intangible issues like mad, and played well to his crowd."
"&gt; The 2018 Rockets are the greatest team to never win a title, I’ve gone back and watched some games from them and the Harden+CP backcourt is on the same level as Curry+Klay IMO  Hard disagree.  Prime Nash/Amare/Marion/Barbosa/Diaw/.  Throw in Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas, James Jones, Raja Bell.  Guy went to jail for fixing games against us vs the Spurs multiple times.  We were the best team in the league, everybody knew it.  Throw in Prime Barkley/KJ/Majerle/Danny Ainge losing the prime Jordan Bulls thanks to a last second three by Paxson.  Kevin Johnson probably the most under rated PG in history.  He had several 20/10 seasons.  Which at the time was unheard of.  Barkley won league MVP and the Suns had a better record than the Bulls that year."
"Even before jimmy, that sixers series during Simmons' rookie year was pretty tense. Dwyane Wade grabbing Justin Anderson by his arms and basically throwing him during game 3.

Nothing is as corny as the ‘he’s from the Balkans bro’ or the talk about James Johnson and his mma background.   It doesn’t change the fact that no one is gonna have a real fight in the NBA.
"Didn't Haslem within the past few years get checked in a game, dropped on the floor by Dwight, get ejected, and then people were praising him for being a dawg? Also top tier dawgness goes to James Johnson for convincing everyone that he's a golden glove olympic boxer, black belt in karate (which you can get as a 7 year old), and an undefeated mixed martial artist that you don't wanna mess with."
"Lopez, Morris, chriss off the top of my head, pretty sure he also took a punch from James Johnson which not a lot of people can say"
Two raw to tell. He can be anything between Stanley Johnson and lebron James
James Johnson is like 70% of Jeff Green while Patty Mills is 1000% of Mike James
"James Harden said fuck the new shooting rules, im gonna turn into Magic Johnson"
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
"It's rough.   That pick last season should be our last top-10 pick for years (barring weird, fluky injury-riddled season on our end) and we wasted it on a player we clearly don't have on our plans. Not taking Haliburton (though less concerned about a PG since I think it's been proven you can take a starting-caliber point guard almost anywhere in the draft if you know who to look for and target, Brunson the latest example), Vassell, Bey and taking Smith instead is looking like a disaster.  It's not a franchise-altering disaster mind you since I think Book, DA, Bridges, Cam Johnson, maybe Shamet, Cam Payne is a good group to have long-term but yeah imagine if we took Haliburton, Vassell or Bay...that's another great piece added and extends the contention window a bit.   Probably James Jones biggest miss in his tenure so far. He's been good (not great but good) IMO but that's a F-grade move there."
Stewart had a good 3 seconds face to face with Lebron and did nothing until he got held back. He's not that guy. Guys like Serge Ibaka and James Johnson would be swinging if they wanted to do something
I mean you look at James Johnson stat line and it was the right play  But then you look at LMA's stats and you realize his game plan needs a little tweaking haha

James Johnson for sure.  I don’t think there’s even a close second.  He’s trained in multiple disciplines and has actual fights.  Fuck a size advantage he’s big and long enough to take out anyone in the league.  People don’t understand the skill difference between regular “tough guys” and people with that much training.  He’d toy with these dudes

"Why would a contender not trade for him with his current contract? It’s an expiring.

Yes. JV would go like 4/4 in first quarters then play 6 min the rest of the way. Casey sucked balls as raps coach in almost all asepects. The team was talented in the weak east to be coach foolproof ro secure 50+ wins. But he fucked JV the hardest. Never played jv when he on fire or with mismatches. Did same with lesser guys like james Johnson as well when raps lacked sf body type
"There's some times where guys get absolutely dunked on that isn't ""was helping in the paint because option 1 failed"" and those can be fair times to poke at the defender.

"A generational player is the players you think of when you think of a certain era. Usually a span on 10 years. Players who *define* the era they played in not just exceed.   Previous generational talents:  Bill Russell  Wilt Chamberlain  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird   Michael Jordan   Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Lebron James   We don't know who's next yet   There are some other notable players like Oscar, Jerry West, Dr. J, Hakeem, Shaq, KG, Curry, and Durant but I chose to list first people I thought of whenever I think of an era."
James Johnson may not be good at basketball anymore but he is definitely famous (or infamous) for the other skills he possesses. I am sure he will come in handy when we face a goon squad again in playoffs.
"No, thats what james johnson is"
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"Lol I don't give a fuck about my experience relative to theirs, anybody who has Kobe Bryant as the greatest player ever is a nostalgic moron. It doesn't take much to see that. Michael Jordan alone was just straight up much better, and he alone automatically eliminates Kobe from the greatest ever title.  Players are not the ultimate authority on anything. Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley were both top 15 players ever and cry nonstop about how teams are shooting too many threes and about how guys like Kristaps fucking Porzingis should post up. Magic Johnson had LeBron James on his team and said ""fuck spacing"" in favor of constructing a meme team around him."
"James Johnson. dudes a blackbelt and legitimately already looks like an inmate.  Tyler Johnson also already looks like an inmate.  basically the 2017 Miami Heat. inmates  Shaq, KG, Lance, Stephenson, Joel Embiid, Kyrie, Jokic could all be good character roles. (for some reason i picture Jokic wearing a beanie that is entirely way to small for his head in the movie)  ugh im lost on the Adam Sandler role. i picked a lot of modern nba players.. so i guess i want to say Lillard(?) for that role. idk"
"Black: One day I was sitting in my office at the Forum, and Jerry just pops his head into my office and says, ""Hey, come on, let's go, we got a workout, you gotta see this kid!"" In the summers the court inside the Forum would not be down because there would be concerts, hockey, the rodeo or whatever. So we worked out guys at Inglewood High and the Inglewood YMCA -- they were both like a minute car ride from the Forum. To me it was just Jerry being social, wanting to include other people in something he was excited about. I knew the names being bandied about that we were looking at, and Kobe wasn't one of them. It was just a chance to get out of the office.  Ryan West, son of Jerry West, Lakers front office, 2009-2019: The Inglewood YMCA was not the nicest gym in the world. It was probably 30 years out of date. It was small, not a full-sized court even, and it had a real homey feel to it. I've read a lot about the workouts and there has been a lot of misinformation about it. As time has gone by people have gotten the details mixed up about the order and the location of the workouts. But I'm blessed with a great memory and I drove him to the workouts and I remember it like it was yesterday. The first place where the story gets misconstrued is with Michael Cooper. He was the first workout. The other error is about Inglewood High. I specifically remember walking through the door with Kobe that day at the Inglewood YMCA.  Kupchak: Today you walk into a workout and there's trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, sports scientists, measurements, charting, all kinds of stuff. Back then, it was all pretty informal. I'm not even sure we had someone there to rebound the ball for him.  Ryan West: At the beginning they were running him through drills, and Kobe would just go to the rim and dunk every ball. My dad stopped the workout and said, ""Kobe, we know you can dunk. Let's see what else you can do."" He wanted to see him do other things rather than just tear the rim down every time. My dad wanted to see players put in situations they would find themselves in during NBA games. That's when you saw the pull-up game, the jump hooks, the floaters. Kobe had every shot in his repertoire. The Lakers had the recently retired Michael Cooper, who had been named DPOY in 1987, guard Kobe during his pre-draft workout. After just 20 minutes, Jerry West had seen enough. ""This kid is better than anybody we have on our team."" John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Black: Michael Cooper was 40 at the time, and he had been retired a few years but he was still a freak. Still wiry. Still in great shape. Cooper at 40 was like a normal person at 25. Larry Bird is on record saying Cooper was the most difficult guy he ever played against in his career, the toughest guy to ever defend him. And there's Jerry saying to him, ""Don't take it easy on this kid. Make him work as hard as you can.""  Michael Cooper, Lakers guard, 1978-1990: I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.  And boy was I brought back to reality quick. In a hurry I found out that 40 and 17 don't go together on the court. At the very beginning, I got right in there and got my hands right up in his face. Guys hate that, especially young guys. He just rose up over my hand like I wasn't even there. I was planning on him not being that strong and that he'd be intimidated. This is an unfair comparison to this young man because I really like him, this LaMelo Ball kid in Charlotte, 19 years old he comes out to the NBA and you see his little, frail body -- Kobe didn't have that frail body at that age.  Carbone: The knock on Kobe in high school was even if he had the skills he was too skinny. I met him the summer of 1995, and Kobe trained that whole year and put on 10-15 pounds of muscle. His first visit to the Nets, the GM at the time, Willis Reed -- his hands are huge -- well he grabs Kobe around the upper arm and he's shaking him and he says, ""OK, you ain't so skinny.""  Black: Kobe never backed down from anyone, even at age 17. Kobe did not know how to be deferential. Michael was playing his best and Kobe just had his way with him. Kobe was just destroying him.  Raymond Ridder, current senior VP of communications, Golden State Warriors, Lakers PR staff, 1990-1998: I just saw Michael Jordan out there. Kobe had all the Jordan mannerisms: the fadeaway jumper, dribbling between his legs, tongue hanging out -- he had perfected every Jordan move at the age of 17.      ""I thought I was going to go out there and whip his ass, to tell you the truth. That was my thought. I was like, OK, look, I don't give a f--- how old I am, I'm not gonna let some f---ing guy do anything.""     Former Lakers guard and DPOY Michael Cooper, who guarded the 17-year-old Kobe  Cooper: There were certain things Jerry wanted to see. The big one was: Could he get to a spot? Great players can always get to their spot. Spots, and the angles you take to get there, are so important in basketball. You might not always hit the shot, but if you can get there, that's when you feel like you'll hit 8 out of 10, or 9 out of 10. Jerry requested that he get to an exact spot, say, at the elbow, every time. Not a foot away, not two feet away, not an inch away. Even the very best offensive players cannot get to that spot by just going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes you're gonna have to take me to A to C to F and then come back to B. So that was the first thing I admired about Kobe. I had done this, taken this away against Larry Bird, Dr. J, and a young Michael Jordan, and here's a young man fresh out of high school and I'm trying to deny him certain places on the court, and Kobe was able to get to his spot, I'd say, nine times out of 10.  Ryan West: They had him doing a particular play off a pick and roll where Kobe was the ball handler and he threw me a great pass, and I went up for the layup and completely bricked the layup. I was so embarrassed.  Cooper: One time Kobe comes off the screen and he got me pretty low so I ended up going under the screen. Now, a decent offensive player in the NBA would think, OK the defense is under the screen -- let me take one dribble past the pick and hit a jump shot. Sure, you could hit that shot, but that's the shot the defense wants to give you. He came off the screen, gave me a little pump fake, which rose me off my feet and gave him some room and then he drove -- one-two, bounce, dribble -- got to the elbow, rose up and hit the shot. Then he went to the left side and did the same thing.  Ridder: He wanted to do everything he could to destroy Michael Cooper. That mentality was something he had from day one, and you saw it in this workout. He had the mamba mentality at 17.  About halfway through the workout, legend has it that things began to heat up, with Kobe and Cooper talking trash and throwing elbows. Kobe was, after all, notorious for ruthlessly humiliating all challengers -- teammates, coaches, friends even -- in games of one-on-one. But the truth is Kobe was so dominant and relentless (at one point he hit 12 shots in a row from the baseline) the workout never even got competitive enough to become contentious.  That week in Los Angeles, Kobe was already shooting his first commercial. Even as a teenager he was a genius at building a brand and spinning his own mythology. Growing up a Lakers fan, he knew exactly who Michael Cooper was and, more importantly, what people around the NBA would say if he strolled into L.A. and destroyed one of the game's greatest defenders. So Kobe never said a word. He knew the workout would speak volumes on its own. In fact, the only chatter heard that day came from former Laker Norm Nixon, who tried to encourage Cooper by yelling, ""Bang on him, Coop! Bang on him!"" from the bleachers. It didn't help. Afterward, Nixon walked up to his old friend and whispered, ""The kid just kicked your ass.""  Cooper: He did kick me in the nuts one time with his leg, and I was mad about that. But that was it. I was banging on him. I was hitting him with my forearm and he was banging me right back. I hit him hard one time, in the kidney and it was a cheap shot, on purpose. It was just that he was backing me down, backing me down and so I hit him. He felt it, you could tell. I said, ""Hey man, sorry about that,"" but Kobe was so focused on the workout he was like, ""No, no, no problem, Coach, let's go."" When he'd hit me with an elbow he would say, ""Oh, oh, I'm sorry,"" and I said, ""Quit treating me like an old man."" But no, Kobe didn't talk. And it was a good thing. Jerry hated that. He always said, why are you fraternizing with the enemy out there? Why are you talking to the enemy when you should be trying to kick their ass? No, Kobe had one thing on his mind: He wanted to play in Los Angeles.  Jerry West: He just had that ""It"" factor. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, people like that, they just have it. Kobe had it. You could see it. You could feel it.  Cooper: When we moved to the low post, Jerry took off the restraints. Kobe didn't have to hit a certain spot or go a specific way anymore. So I didn't know what he was going to do. I was at his mercy. Left-hand hooks. One-bounce turnarounds. And he had that little shake shot, that little MJ shake with his back to the basket and that fall-away shot. And he was able to get up and get his shot off and sink it time after time after time. play 0:47 Kobe's early years: From high school star to the Lakers' gold  Take a look back at how Kobe Bryant went from high school phenom at Lower Merion to a teenage sensation early in his NBA career."
"I think you have the causation backwards there, to be honest. The reason that bench looked good is because Lowry elevated them (a pattern that has continued to this day). Quite a lot of those dudes had little success after the Raptors. Patrick Patterson, Greivis Vasquez, James Johnson, Lucas Nogueira ... they were not high end bench players.  Don't get me wrong, we had some legit players in there as well (young Siakam/Anunoby/FVV, Powell, Corey Joseph), but the reason Lowry + bench lineups kicked ass in the regular season is because of Lowry, not the bench (and the regression models that account for teammate impact all reflect this, because those lineups without Lowry weren't nearly as good)."
"You’re acting like we had a choice.. lol. WCS, Boban and Powell are our only healthy big men. James Johnson has played like one game out of the last 6 or 7. Y’all are just a terrible matchup for us when KP is out and we don’t have a center to pick and pop."
"Agreed. Rick wasn't expecting Ben/Embiid to blitz from the start. He made his adjustment at half time starting James Johnson, but the first half minutes with Boban completely crushed their offense."
"Honestly?  I don't want ""growth"". I don't want this team to be a farm system for the rest of the NBA.  I want star/superstar starters, and established, veteran, *adults* on the bench.  Our bench is a college team. They're just not good, and they're not going to get better. They're just not. How much did MarShon Brooks, James Young, JaJuan Johnson, and Fab Melo help the team in their days?  Ainge has absolutely *squandered* his ""war chest"" of picks that he accumulated over the last several years, and somehow he gets a pass by Celtics fans, because he hit on Tatum and Brown.  I do not, for one moment, *expect* a productive offseason for Danny. He's had *years* to be productive... and what has he done with it?"
Thank fuck James Johnson started shooting
This is ridiculous. How is James Johnson in the game ?
Mavs get within single digits and instantly replace their offence with James Johnson 3s
damn bro that 3 would be such a momentum changer and james johnson fucking airballed it i'm dying lol

This James Johnson initiated offense needs to stop now
james johnson really needs to learn to do less

James Johnson has to come out lol

"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings.

"DFS, James Johnson, or JRich for the Mavs  Luka is 10000% our PG our starting lineup is entirely built around it... it’s why Brunson comes off the bench   when Brunson and Luka are on the floor together you could make that argument even though Brunson is kind of a smaller combo guard"
Great shot!  But what he hell was James Johnson doing on defense the possession before?

Smh going for that lob over James Johnson
James Johnson came all the way from the other corner to get in Brunson's lane.

GG Celtics. James Johnson is playing.
"Wow, I feel like I haven't seen James Johnson in forever"
Celtics gotta brace themselves for the James Johnson revenge tour
"I think to be an all time great he has to either develop elite defense like Lebron, Kobe, and Michael Jordan all have or he has to get elite efficiency like Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, or James Harden have who averaged &gt;61% TS for their career. To me averaging more rebounding then them doesn't really help his case too much as it isn't too important for frontcourt players."
Can’t wait to see James Johnson beat up a Morris twin.
"While youre right that those fights couldve been against any clown in a backyard, [i doubt they were. ](https://www.mavs.com/johnson-karate/) Apparently its a family thing.

"&gt;I’m not sure where you’re getting your stats but Jordan only led the league in free throws in 87.  By 31% over the next closest player -- Dominique Wilkins, who wasn't exactly an easy cover.  And 40% over Moses Malone, who himself led the league on a bunch of occasions.  Only Chamberlain and Jerry West -- in one freak season -- ever shot more in a season.  &gt;Also watch some games. Jordan didn’t need calls.  I watched plenty, thanks.  Whether or not he needed them, he got them.  Out of curiosity, if Jordan was that unstoppable, then what, exactly, happened during his final two years at North Carolina?  When his Tar Heel teams won a total of five games in the last four tournaments ( ACC &amp; NCAA ) he played in?  That despite having several NBA-caliber teammates including #4 overall pick Sam Perkins.  What, exactly, happened to turn the guy who couldn't do much of anything in college tournament games into an unstoppable force against much tougher competition?  &gt; Lebron was on magazines coming out of high school and the NBA has propped him up his entire career.  Not with free-throws, like they did with Jordan.  Jordan was 2nd in FTA as a rookie.  James was 15th as a rookie, and has matched Jordan's rookie year only once, in 18 seasons.  Jordan was outside the top-4 in only 2 full seasons ( sixth and fifth ).  James has been outside the Top 10 3 times in full seasons.  There's no comparison between the calls they get/got.  Jordan effectively played in the modern NBA -- no one was allowed to handcheck him -- while everyone else on the court was still playing in the full-contact Nineties.  This is exactly why players like Magic Johnson talked about no one being allowed to get close to Jordan, or it was a foul.  &gt;You can hate Jordan for setting a rough template but it’s just foolish to argue that and then try and pretend like Lebron and the modern NBA hasn’t absolutely abused and ruined that formula.  You are confusing James with players like Harden -- league leader in FTA 7 times -- and Durant -- league leader in FTA twice, and top-3 on three other occasions.  James may get star treatment, but even he never approached the beyond-superstar level treatment that Jordan got.  No one ever has, except possibly Harden."
"Also they didn't have like 65% of their rotation due to COVID. People like Iwundu, James Johnson who were starting and playing +25m in those games are getting DNP/CD nowadays."
"1980’s were the single most difficult era to play basketball. Every team was stacked. There were many many super teams at any one time. You had the Lakers and the Celtics who just kicked the crap out of everyone with Hall of Famers or all stars at almost every position. Then you had the Sixers and the Bucks at the beginning of the decade who were again, full of Hall of Fame and All-Star talent. Towards the end of the decade, the Bulls, Pistons, Knicks, Rockets, Jazz, Hawks, Pacers, Cavs, and Mavs were on the rise. It was a far more talent rich league than it was when Lebron entered the league. Right now, I would say the talent pool is fairly close to where it was then, but that’s only a fairly recent development. During the expansion era, the league got significantly watered down.   The rules were also different. A flagrant 2 now would be a common foul. Guys would maul the crap out of Lebron to send a message, especially if he entered the league then with the type of hype he entered the league in our timeline. Hand checking was allowed, zone D was forbidden, and ISO basketball wasn’t as prevalent.   Here’s a list of players Bird usually had to match up with  Magic Johnson: HOF  Dr. J: HOF  Adrian Dantley: HOF  Dominique Wilkins: HOF  Alex English: HOF  Charles Barkley: HOF  James Worthy: HOF  Bernard King: HOF  Bobby Jones: HOF  Marques Johnson: Should be in the HOF  Who has Lebron had to guard who was that level? KD, Paul Pierce, and Kawhi? Maybe Prime T-Mac early on? Come on man. Bird was a phenomenal player and so is Lebron, but to say the era Bird played in was bad is just revisionist history."
"It's why I can stomach this dunk because Derozan, Ross, and James Johnson used to terrorize the league. Then you got VC, TMAC, Jamario fucking Moon... we've seen some amazing dunks by the Raptors over the years. Its about time somebody boomed us."

James Johnson and a second would be good for Dallas
"Heat organization has been known in the past (when Riley was head coach) to have somewhat draconian body-fat/health requirements, much farther than other teams take it. Heat make very few exceptions to this, Shaq however I believe is one. A recent example of this is when James Johnson came into the season out of shape and wasn’t allowed to play until he was.   Apart from the strict physical requirements, Heat Culture has come to just mean that this organization is  a very hard working, gritty, grind it out organization which players have come to embody. I do think this true about the Heat, but I don’t think they are the only hard working organization either. Part of it is definitely, a marketing ploy, but not entirely as many players are aware that Heat take being in shape extremely seriously."
"**Players leading all-star votes multiple times**  Michael Jordan - **9** times  LeBron James - **8** times  Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter and Julius Erving - **4** times  Magic Johnson, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Grant Hill, George Gervin - **2** times"
"I think you're completely ignoring the player development element of ""Heat Culture"".

Always a tough thing to do but I'll give it a shot  PG- Magic Johnson  SG- Michael Jordan  SF- LeBron James  PF- Tim Duncan  C- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  It was tough not putting Larry Bird on here but I think LeBron adds a different dynamic to this team in particular.

"For decades, NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen remained criminally underrated, emblazoned with the inescapable label of Robin to Michael Jordan’s Batman. Standing 6-foot-8 and 210 pounds, the six-time NBA Champion is celebrated for both his defensive tenacity and offensive skill set, capable of defending the opposition’s best ball handler while retaining the ability to pour in 20-30 points on any given night.  Over the course of a 17-year career that saw Pippen dress for the Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets and Portland Trailblazers, the University of Central Arkansas product bathed in Jordan’s formidable shadow, unable to garner the recognition a player of his caliber–Pippen earned inclusion on the NBA’s 50 Greatest Players of All Time list in 1996–deserves.   Fast forward to 2020 and Pippen is arguably the most overrated player in NBA history.  Of course, that’s not a slight on Pippen. The seven-time All-Star played an invaluable role for a Bulls dynasty that monopolized the 1990s, save for two seasons where Jordan sampled professional baseball. As evidenced by his six consecutive All-Star appearances between 1991-92 and 1996-97, Pippen’s talent was well-respected and recognized among both spectators and league personnel alike.  However, within the vigor that consumes the debate surrounding the greatest players in NBA history, factions arguing against Jordan’s standing as the greatest of all time retroactively inflated Pippen’s reputation.  Since the time LeBron James surfaced as a viable contender to claim the coveted title of greatest of all time (or G.O.A.T), his most ardent supporters cite Pippen’s contributions as a buffer between Jordan and the failures that beleaguer James’ legacy.    As a consequence, a vocal minority of NBA fans now cast Pippen as Jordan’s equal, an assertion predicated on superficial research and selective memory.  Let’s start with the most common argument. In 1993-94, after Jordan announced an indefinite hiatus to pursue professional baseball in honor of his slain father, Pippen propelled the Bulls to the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference on the strength of a 55-win season.   That year, Chicago reached the Eastern Conference Semifinals before bowing out to the Knicks in seven games.   Pippen’s brief run as the Bulls undisputed number one option deserves acknowledgment. Without Pippen, the Bulls most likely stumble to a lottery berth that perhaps irreparably stunts the momentum of a franchise that would later earn its second three-peat within a decade.  However, leading a team to home-court advantage and a 50-win season isn’t an accomplishment exclusive to superstar performers.   During the 2003-04 NBA season, Pau Gasol led the Memphis Grizzlies to the franchise’s first 50-win season. While the 2003-04 Grizzlies finished sixth in a comically deep Western Conference, their 50-32 record would have earned them the fourth seed in the 1993-94 Eastern Conference standings, tied with the Shaquille O’Neal and Penny Hardaway-led Orlando Magic.  Make no mistake about it, Gasol was a great power forward whose name will be enshrined in the NBA Hall of Fame once he formally retires from the NBA,  However, Gasol never emerged as a bonafide superstar.  Like Pippen, the seven-foot Spaniard was better suited to play second-fiddle on a great team than assume primary responsibilities on a middling roster.   Furthermore, following their 55-win season in 1993-1994, Pippen and the Bulls encored with a 34-31 record in the 65 games before Jordan returned from his first retirement to play the final 17 games of the 1994-1995 season.  The Bulls 52% win percentage (34-31) with Pippen at the helm would have positioned the Bulls outside  at least one conference’s playoffs in 17 of the past 20 seasons, with the 2006-07, 2016-17 and 2019-20 campaigns serving as the lone exceptions.   A narrative contending that Pippen is responsible for the Bulls championship glory recently surfaced on social media.   Fans adhering to the idea that Pippen served as Jordan’s peer often cite aggregate finals stats, arguing that during the Bulls two three-peats, Pippen led the Bulls in assists, rebounds, steals and blocks.   Despite being inaccurate–Jordan collected two more assists than Pippen across the Bulls’ six finals appearances–the argument fails to highlight that Jordan outscored his All-Star teammate by 510 points, almost doubling Pippen’s scoring output.  Pippen also exhibited a tendency to disappear offensively during the most important contests. In both the 1996 NBA Finals against the Seattle SuperSonics and the 1998 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz, Pippen averaged 15.7 points per game, though the latter could be attributed to a back injury suffered in Game 3 and exacerbated following a slam dunk in Game 6.   For comparison’s sake, Austin Croshere averaged 15.2 ppg for the Indiana Pacers during the 2000 NBA Finals.  A year later, a 34-year-old Dikembe Mutombo contributed 16.8 ppg for the Philadelphia 76ers.  Finally, Pippen’s run atop the NBA was painfully abbreviated and tethered to Jordan’s scoring prowess. Following the conclusion of the 1997-98 season, The Bulls traded Pippen to the Houston Rockets for Roy Rogers and a second-round pick in the following years draft.   Despite playing alongside an aging Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon, Pippen found himself relegated to third fiddle, averaging a pedestrian 14.4 ppg along with 6.5 rpg and 5.9 apg.   Over the next three seasons, Pippen commenced a steady decline with the Portland Trailblazers, never topping 12 ppg again for his career.  Unlike Jordan, the twilight of Pippen’s career was not adorned with accolades. Where Jordan won three titles between his age 32-34 campaigns, Pippen regressed to an afterthought, a complementary piece on teams that required All-Star contributions from Pippen to reach championship heights.   Pippen’s contributions to the Bulls dynasty remain indispensable. His defensive prowess made for a fearsome tandem alongside Jordan. His slashing ability expertly complemented Jordan’s strengths while his multidimensional game allowed the seven-time All-NBA selection to conform to whatever role the Bulls needed.   But indispensable and irreplaceable are not synonymous. Pippen never matured into a franchise cornerstone, unable to penetrate the upper echelon of the NBA elite. Where players like Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant each emerged as once-in-a-generation talents, Pippen’s skill set was tailor-made to be a supplementary option.  Despite the infinite hypotheticals and “what-if” scenarios floating around social media today, Pippen never was “the guy.”"
We didn’t have him long but I miss James Johnson
"""He cocked that joint back and banged on 'em"" - James Johnson"
Idk about worst but james johnson sure is useless for 16 mil. The new Dwight powell too while were at it.
"Suns  2011: 13 markieff Morris  2012: 13 Kendall Marshall  2013: 5 Alex Len  2014: 14 tj warren, 18 James ennis   2015: 13 Devin booker  2016 4 dragon bender, 13 Georgia’s papagiannis  + 2nd round pick bogdon bogdanovic traded for 8 marquess chriss  2017 4 josh Jackson  2018: 1 Deandre ayton, 16 zhaire smith  2019: 6 Jarrett culver traded for saric + 11 cam johnson   2020: 10 Jalen smith"
I’ve always liked Henry Ellison’s game. The guy just never caught a break. But Detroit ruins everything. Detroit drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. And There has to be a spot for James Young somewhere.
"Sure but when his notable failures include putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love, benching James Johnson when we needed defense, under using PJ, overusing Lou, I'm comfortable saying Casey is a bad coach.  Vogel isn't as good as Spolestra probably, but  If you can manage the egos, coaching a Lebron team is butter so not super fair to compare.   The Bucks do have a lot of issues outside of Bud but his decision making is questionable to down right baffling at times, to the point I wouldn't really trust him outside the first round."
James Johnson is available
"Is he on the same tier as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Thaddeus Young?"
"Bulls could give up porter for him if they wanted him  The mavs could give James Johnson and one of a few others   The nuggets have a few players on pretty big contracts that are tradable  Warriors could give Wiggins  The rockets got olidipo, or Gordon  The griz have a bunch of things they could give  The heat have iggy and Kelly   The t wolves have Ricky  Pelicans have adams  Okc had al horford   The magic have Gordon  The trail blazers have nurkic + another little bit   The kings have Harrison Barnes   San antonio has LA  The wiz have bertons  I could argue all those players are non essential. And Ik a lot of them ofc would never trade for Drummond but most teams have tradable pieces for Drummond"
"James jones was responsible for the bubble too and the award was given out before the bubble happened. we were just so bad that it took him 2 years to dig us all the way out instead of just 1. and to do it he made tough moves that many questioned. trading TJ Warren for cash was made fun of. but we needed that cash to get rubio. everyone said the suns reached on cam johnson, but he played a big role in that bubble run and this year. Dario saric came over in the same trade that lead us to draft cam. He's huge for us too. James did all that and we were given an F rating for that offseason. Then he picked up cam payne right before the bubble. payne has been a revelation. Then we sold high on Rubio and Oubre, both of which have been significantly worse this year, to get CP3. and just for fun signed crowder, Langston galloway, Abdul Nader, and etwuan moore. The last 3 of those guys have been really good for us this year and can't even find consistent minutes because we are that deep. to put it in perspective Isaiah Canaan was our starting PG 2 years ago. no one in the league has done a better job than him in the last 2 years and he should be rewarded for it this year.  with ya'll losing last night we would now be 1st in the east now because we own the tiebreaker. apologies for being 8 hours pre-mature."
"Did you watch this game? Shamet and Johnson were throwing up 3's to try and break the record every single possession and none of the garbage time Kings players were in.  Like you realize when the game was actually a game the Nets bench was actually good right (and has been since the Pacers game)? Also this has happened like once before. Vs the Knicks. Who we were also blowing out. The thing in common is opposing coaches being hard asses and instead of throwing in the towel, forcing their young players to play the game out 48 minutes as some sort of lesson or something. This is literally something we don't ever have to worry about. Also it's not like Kyrie was running around exerting effort, he walked the ball up to half court, got double teamed, and passed it to Shamet.  Uhh did you watch the Durant Warriors or Heatles? The Warriors had Dray and Iggy, then straight garbage, guys like Bell, McKinnie, Jerebko, Quinn Cook. Did you watch the Finals two years ago, once Klay and KD went down the Raptors ran a box and one because the other Warriors were such garbage and thats WITH Steph and Dray on the floor.  The Heatles had like Battier and Allen, but the rest was garbage, they brought Birdman out of retirement, James Jones and Mike Miller who literally could only shoot 3's, nothing else, Rashard Lewis who wasn't shit without PEDs."
"&gt;Lakers really have the most unfair advantage in the league. The most preferred free agent destination for players(rich people)  This is largely a myth.  Very little of the Lakers' dominance is due to free agent acquisitions.  There's LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal, but to-date, those two only combine for 10 seasons in Purple-and-Gold -- and only five of those seasons are noteworthy here -- and both of those guys were not shy about signing with other teams too.  On the list of best-Laker-free-agent signings, you reach Kurt Rambis a lot faster than anyone would think.  The Lakers drafted Magic Johnson, Jerry West, James Worthy, George Mikan, Elgin Baylor, Vern Mikkelson, AC Green, Clyde Lovellette, Gail Goodrich, Norm Nixon, Michael Cooper, Vlade Divac, Nick Van Exel, Jim McMillian, Derek Fisher, Andrew Bynum, Marc Gasol, and many others.  Plus K.C. and Sam Jones who declined to play for them and went on to win 8 and 5 titles in Boston.  The Lakers traded for Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Byron Scott, Anthony Davis, Pau Gasol, Bob McAdoo, and a raft of others.  Want to win like the Lakers?  Draft and trade like they do, and players will want to play for your team, too."
"&gt;  he's a top 5 playmaker who can carry an offense  Even as a rookie he had a higher USG% than most PG's in history and it higher than any year of CP3, Steve Nash, Stockton, and Magic Johnson. In addition he has super high uncontested rebounding Westbrook style. He gets a ton of volume stats. He is a top 5 playmaker in the league, but I would rather have a great playmaker that has &gt;60% TS like Jokic or Lillard. Or I would rather have a worse playmaker that does other elite things like score and defend really well. Considering how much credit he gets for carrying his team, he has always had very mediocre on/off number and even this year where he has had bad team he doesn't improve them as much as you would expect given his reptuation. Like those PHX Steve Nash years, the team would go from bad to elite when he was on. Lebron James has been pretty much the same his whole career even on those terrible Cavs teams."
"There’s quite a few ways actually just like all the reply’s say  The biggest one is he just takes difficult shots. His 3s are often contested and off the dribble.  He was also a better 3 point shooter in the past  Do u think Arron Gordon and cam Johnson are better 3 point shooters than James harden, cuz they shoot a higher %."
"Saw a trade with Dwight Powell, James Johnson, 2nd rounder. I’d probably do that one."
"what gets me about that picture is that in that moment of the game KAT was beating Boogie's team by over 20, but we still remember KAT looking like he's wheezing in an NBA game. You *can* build around ""soft"" guys in the NBA, and Minnesota had the right idea with guys like Jimmy Butler and James Johnson. I just feel like we're watching KAT's time in MIN wind down because this is his 6th year and they've made 1 playoff appearance with one of the NBA's best talents under 25"
"Well. LeBron did that in 2011. Kobe did in 04. Magic Johnson did, Larry Bird did. Kevin Durant has, and James Harden has. Dame has had some awful playoff performances. It happens to all superstars, even the clutch ones. Kyrie hit the greatest or second greatest NBA shot of all time while averaging 27 PPG in finals series though."
Dwight Powell and James Johnson for Drummond?
Why would you trade KP for him when James Johnson + Powell works?
Not much the cavs would want. To match his salary Dwight Powell + James Johnson I guess and then thrown in a 2nd. Cavs can definitely get a better deal.
"If and that is probably the biggest if ever, IF the Cavs would take Powell and James Johnson and some late 2nd rounders for him take it and run away. Worst thing that can happen he stinks and he leaves in the summer and we get rid of Powell's shit contract"
Doncic and James Johnson
"91 Jordan? You mean when he played the corpse of the Showtime Lakers with no Kareem, injured Byron Scott and James Worthy, and a Magic Johnson with literal AIDS? That’s your best fuckin answer?"
Williams is poor man Kwahi rich man Covington or James Johnson
"&gt; Quinn cook, Nick Young, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell averaged 14-22 minutes per game while their minutes in the playoffs dropped to &lt;10 minutes.   Quinn Cook shot 44% from 3, on over 3 attempts per ( in just 33 games, by the way, so you're being a little disingenuous there ).  He wasn't exactly killing their offensive rating.  Young shot 38% on 4.  And it's not like they were blowing every team out -- they lost 24 games and had a net rating of +6, which was 3rd-best that season.  &gt; If you look at the playoff stats, the GSW were 1st in both oRTG and dRTG.    &gt;   &gt;\[and\]   &gt;   &gt;The Lakers last year lost their first game against the Blazers and Rockets  Those Blazers and Rockets won nearly as many games as those Warriors' first two playoff opponents -- despite the season being 10 games shorter.  The 2018 Warriors played the least-impressive slate of playoff opponents in history, and I don't believe there's a team within even shouting distance of them.  The only even good team they played took them to seven, despite being pretty flawed to start, and injured.  &gt;To put it into perspective as successful as MJ teams have been, he has only swept teams in BO7 3 times.    On the other hand, Magic Johnson was involved in winning 5 4-0 sweeps, in just 12 seasons.  As did Kobe Bryant, in more seasons.

"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
"Excellent game by James Johnson, very impressed by him"
Yikes James Johnson
James Johnson has 'crafty old guy at the Y' game but in a six foot seven body
James Johnson doing tippy taps to stop Giannis lol
James Johnson is fun to watch. His reactions are hilarious. Miss the blonde hair
"Starting lineup for our last game was - Doncic - Tim Hardaway Jr - Wes Iwundu - Willie Caulie Stein - Porzingis  we played a 9 man rotation featuring those 5 plus Josh Green, Trey Burke, James Johnson, and Boban  should look similar tonight"
"Would Houston say no to 2 picks unprotected, and Olynyk? I think it would work with the James Johnson trade exception.   Unless Houston and their cheap owner are trying to ride the 8-6 seed playoff bonus honey wagon it seems close to fair enough. Maybe toss in a swap or a top 3 protected 2026 or something."
"Right, and the ""legacy"" of an owner has nothing to do with what their franchises accomplish. Like, all James Dolan had to do to not get shat on was not be an egregious public douchebag while his teams failed.  If you're [Woody Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Johnson), not only do you get handed ambassadorships because your Great-Great-Granddad did something, you can walk down the street without people hassling you about the Jets.  When you're famous and judged on rings (Erneh), you need to have enough value that you have money for the rest of your life, then you have to make decisions about the things people will say to you in restaurants for the rest of your life."
"&gt; As much as I like James Harden as a player, I don't think he's a top 10 guy who can lead a team to a championship. Jack of many trades, master of none. He's more of a Joe Johnson type of player, 2nd round and out. Perhaps Morey has his eye on Howard next... Lin-Harden-White-Monty-Howard lineup sounds fearsome.  Oof. Also further down in that thread someone talks about how Howard is definitely not leaving LA."
"Dwight Powell, James Johnson and a protected 1st rd pick   or  Aron Baynes, Norm Powell and 2 2nd rd picks"
Mavs for James Johnson + filler + some 2nds
James Johnson legendary interview
"Keldon ""LeBron James"" Johnson and LaMarcus ""6'10 JR Smith"" Aldridge"
"Would probably be something like Dwight Powell+James Johnson, salaries match."
"On his game yeah. But it’s no secret his body isn’t taken care of in the same way. And the Heat emphasize that; players come here and get in the best shape of their careers. Harden showed up this year fat. Last time somebody did that for us( James Johnson) we failed his physical and he wasn’t allowed to play for a bit. Just how we are, does it fuckin suck cuz we sometimes miss on trades like this? Yeah. But not like theres a dearth of players wanting to come here either.   r/nba likes to think they know better than one of the most successful franchises in the league. And pat riley ffs. People were screaming how we were stuck in purgatory after the Heatles. Never tanked and still made it back to the finals."
That’s a lot considering you’re trading for someone out of shape and won’t be able to keep up with Miami’s strict health guidelines. I’m not sure if it was the only reason but they did trade James Johnson shortly after him coming back a little out of shape during the off-season. Harden also doesn’t reflect the Heat culture that they already have in place.
"Yeah you’re right, he played with a LOT of good players:  - Adrian Dantley	 - Spencer Haywood - Earl Monroe - Bill Bradley - Phil Jackson - Bob Lanier - Maurice Lucas - Dave Cowens - Nate Archibald - Jo Jo White - Cedric Maxwell - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Magic Johnson - Norm Nixon - Jamaal Wilkes - James Worthy - Michael Cooper - Charles Barkley - Julius Erving - Andrew Toney - Maurice Cheeks - Bobby Jones"
"Powell, James Johnson, our second and our 2025 first top-10 protected (turns into two seconds if not conveyed by 2027). Let's make it happen 👍"
Dallas would be the most likely landing spot because they can match with Powell and James Johnson.
"Think you’ll see a drop off but still will be much better than last years. With additions like josh green, j rich and James Johnson, the mavs shouldn’t be in the bottom half of Defensive efficiency"
I wouldn't be surprised if the Mavs move for Drummond. Since Dwight Powell is apparently cooked since his injury something like James Johnson + Powell + 2 2nds for Drummond or something. This also gets off the Powell money for next offseason
Really wish Luka would stop wasting so much energy on offense so he can carry us on the defensive end. Let James Johnson carry the offense.
james johnson has been spectacular
"The Brooklyn Nets traded for James Harden. They will be a team to watch now! - Magic Johnson, probably"
"Orgy loving Magic Johnson, Revolutionary Kareem, and Prostitute loving James Worthy."
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"

Jon Wertheim.  I'm a big reader and a sports fan so I've got a whole list"
Chris Paul is the best in embarassing a Center James Johnson is the best nba ufc fighter
"The path to winning an NBA title *without* a player at James Harden's level is incredibly narrow. The 2004 Pistons are the only team in the last 40 years to win a title without one of the 20-30ish best players of all time as the #1 option. Every other champion in that span has had at least one of the following players leading the team: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Isaiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, or Moses Malone.  IMO, the risk of keeping Harden outweighs the risk you take by giving him up. I don't think there's a trade package out there that gets you a player with the potential to jump into that rarified level of talent that's required to win the title."
My money's on WCS and James Johnson
I just randomly saw James Johnson vs the nuggets
"But this topic is talking about a real fight, not a fight in a cage with a referee and judges right?   Either way James Johnson is an amateur MMA fighter and his opponents were generally trash. If you were talking about like Jon Jones obviously he'd send every NBA player to the hospital lol"
But why do You have a hard-on for James Johnson tho?

That’s assuming boogie doesn’t know how to fight AT ALL... do you know that for a fact?   And yeah it’s not as big as for smaller guys but 30lb of mostly muscle is still an advantage.  This is nothing like the Nate/Paul fight where Nate literally had no idea what he was doing and was at a size disadvantage on top of that lol. And You can’t tell me James Johnson would easily beat Zbo... the reverse is probably true
Yeah James Johnson and jrich brought some attitude that we were missing.
"Nah, I agree with the guy that commented above. We can replace JRich, DFS, and Maxi with Josh Green, Wes Iwundu, and James Johnson and still have a passable defense. The problem is that those guys are a huge step back in shooting and scoring"
"And according to James Johnson, so could David West."
James Johnson plays the 5 when he was on the court with Maxi Kleber
"Zbo is in the David West, James Johnson echelon of “Don’t-fuck-with-me”"
James Johnson is the only one that could beat him tbh.

We have, however, taken great strides to turn that around, and I think we've got a lot going for us now.  1) A young star player in Devin Booker that shows improvement every single year (though he's off to a slow start this year) and has shown incredible loyalty and passion to the city/fans.  2) One of the most talented and respected vets in the league in Chris Paul, who people call the Point God for a reason.  3) A high energy young core of players that give it all on offense and defense, ranging from respectable role players to potential All-Stars down the line, in Mikal, Ayton and Cam Johnson.  4) A scrappy bench mob consisting of Cam Payne, Jevon Carter, Dario Saric, and Langston Galloway that is just smothering on defense and lethal on offense  5) An endearing and respectable head coach in Monty Williams.  Biggest drawback is our owner is a cheap bastard with a history of meddling where he shouldn't. Lately though, he's been much quieter and hands off while our new GM, James Jones, has turned our trashcan fire of the 2010's completely around and created a very strong, balanced, and deep team. Things are looking these days, so why not praise the Suns?"
"&gt;Isiah Thomas carried his team to two championships in Jordan's era.  ""carry"" - he didn't carry them at all, Dumars averaged just as many points as Zeke and actually had a better ORtg than him in the playoffs overall.  That's not to mention Vinnie Johnson havign an insane playoff run in 89 as a 6th man, and James Edwards/Aguirre balling out in the 90 ring.  I also don't need to mention Rodman off the bench either.  The 89/90 Pistons were some of the biggest non-carry jobs ever."
1. Magic Johnson  2. Larry Bird  3. Michael Jordan  4. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  5. Isiah Thomas  6. Hakeem Olajuwon  7. Moses Malone  8. George Gervin  9. James Worthy  10. Kevin McHale
Petition to never use JJ for James Johnson   We retire the acronym
"James Johnson shaved his hair, was getting use to the hairstyle."
Can you guys believe we went from Justin Jackson to James Johnson?
"Surprising: James Johnson!  All the media would say about him was ""Wouldn't want get in a fight with that guy! GUFFAW"" and then he gets out there and he's awesome on defense, passes well, leads the break when he has an advantage.  Couldn't be happier that we signed him.              Disappointing: C'mon man, we know it's Powell.  Which sucks, because I love that dude.  I'm holding out hope that most of his hops come back with time, and that part of his rim-running prowess was due to a giant catch-radius and skill at slipping underneath his defender.  He'll get more chances this year, I'm holding my stock."
"Nope. They made Sign&amp;Trade to send Wood to the Rockets and got from them the 16th Pick (Isaiah Stewart) and Ariza  DETAILS The Rockets by trading Covington to Portland got Ariza+16th Pick+2021 Protected 1st.  Detroit then made a 3-team trade with Dallas and OKC. The Pistons got Delon Wright (Dallas), the Mavs got James Johnson (OKC), the Thunder got Ariza (Detroit) and Justin Jackson (Dallas)"

luka plays his best defense with jrich and james johnson
James Johnson got that Javale McGee energy
"You got Doncic trying to thread the needle on every pass, Hardaway Jr. and Richardson throwing up bricks, James Johnson thinking his role is to come in and be Kobe, and Brunson playing completely out of control.  The fact that this is only a 11 point game is amazing"
"My point is, there's no point to even make that pass  you have a full 24 shot clock. Hold the ball and get into your half court, there's no reason James Johnson should be attempting full-court passes in traffic lol"
terrible pass by murray   even worse pass by James Johnson
somehow james johnson looks worse without the platinum fro
&gt; if anyone can make the snowball roll it would be LBJ  Lyndon Baines Johnson? Maybe   LeBron James? Not a chance

"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
"Mavs, duh lol   Luka, Boban, Timmy, Maxi, JRich, old school James Johnson. We really gotta fun bunch!"
Just like when James Jones drafted Cam Johnson.
"To me, he's the most interesting man ever.   He would drive 180+ mph cross country on a whim. He played professional volleyball longer than he did basketball. He's in the volleyball hall of fame, and is one of the reasons beach volleyball became a pro sport. He would stay up for days at a time because he could. He was at a celebrity party, one thing led to another, and he ended up beating Jim fucking Brown in a foot race *twice* in a row! Wilt at 43 years old beat Magic Johnson, Bernard King, James Worthy, Byron Scott, and A.C. Green in a pickup game with 4 freshman UCLA college players for teammates. Magic tried to hit a hook shot but Wilt went up and blocked it. Magic said ""Game!"" implying Wilt had goaltended. Well HoF coach Larry Brown was in the stands and Wilt asked him if it was a goaltend. Coach Brown said it was a clean block. So Wilt said to Magic, ""We'll play to 12, winner stays. And there will be no more shots made at this basket."" Wilt proceeded to block the next 9 shots and along with his college teammates beat this all-star squad in a pick up game. Matt Weiner of NBA TV/TNT etc. said he's asked people who played in these UCLA pickup games that Magic would run back in the '80s over the summer, and he said they told him the best player they ever played against was a 50-year old Wilt Chamberlain at those pick up games.  The stories are endless. He's almost mythical in some regards, and yet there are so many people from all over the world and all ages that corroborate these things he was capable of. It's mindblowing to me. The more you look into him, the more incredible he becomes."
"My takeaways:  Luka’s best game so far. He still looks slow, but he’s starting to hit the touch shots around the rim that  are normally his bread and butter. He’s been working the mid range and it looks money. His on ball defense also looks improved. Dude is so, so strong.  WCS, limited as he is, looks a million times better than Powell in the starting group. He should be the starter until KP is back.  THJ looked great. His firepower off the bench gave us a great dimension that that unit has been lacking.  I’m worried about DFS. He has looked very lost on offense. Bad turnovers and decisions all over the place.  I think our best lineups without KP are Luka-JRich-DFS-Maxi and WCS or James Johnson. We saw WCS tonight, now I’d like to see Johnson get a look at it."
Why is James Johnson getting minutes. He played like a moron out there
"30 million in salary, so James Johnson, THJ and a first rounder could get it done imo"
James Johnson looks like a bearded version of that deaf drummer Amazon movie dude
"Cant remember i saw James fucking Johnson and Willie, maybe they were on the team but you dont really want those kind of players if you wanna make the playoffs lol"
James Johnson is not a good basketball player.
james johnson guards harden pretty well

"As a fan of another team, a team that does it right most of the time...I enjoy when other teams overpay for players they have no business giving max to. It helps my team.   I wasn't happy that Riley paid Whiteside all that money, although I understood his hand was forced. Same with paying Bumpy, james johnson and waiters. Glad Riley admitted to his mistake by getting rid of those bums.    There's always a bad franchise that's willing to pay big money for X player. They can't get free agents otherwise."

"It’s been a long time coming. McDonough, previous GM, swung big on picks looking for stars. That was a mixed bag but ultimately landed Book, Ayton. James Jones and Jeff Bower came in and have filled in smartly around with some great trades (Mikal, Saric, Cam Johnson) which raised potential enough — and changed our culture — to land this strong free agent class. Feels good man."
Some guy was calling JJ a 3 and D player the other day and it confused me coz JJ got abused by teams when he was on the Sixers but then he said he was talking about James Johnson like what there's already JJ Redick and JJ Barea and this man wants to add more confusion for no reason
"&gt;For me, I severely underrated the Suns. I didn't think they would be that good (check my post history). However, as of now they are looking really good: everyone seems to know their role. CP3 is such a step up from Rubio.  The reason you are off is that it is not just CP3 that has made the difference so far.  James Jones has really cleaned up the roster and rebuilt the team from the ground up.  Drafting Cam Johnson, trafing Oubre so Bridges can start, getting Crowder so Saric can be a super sub.  We went from having a nonexistent bench to one of the strongest in the league.    And of course all of these guys make strong effort on defense, which we need every game, even when shots arent falling.  The main differences CP3 will make are to keep us working hard consistently, which is something Rubio was not very good about, being more of a laid back guy."
You said they were plus shooters.   Justin Jackson shot 29 percent from 3.  Delon shot 37 percent from 3.  Courtney Lee almost never played meaningful minutes.  Of the new players we got:  James Johnson is shooting 43 percent from 3.  J Rich is shooting 31 percent from 3.
"LBJ is definitely Lydon B Johnson. Also, LBJ has the same syllables as LeBron James. OP is a fool."
"PG - Magic Johnson SG - Kobe Bryant SF - LeBron James PF - AD C - Kareem  All time Lakers team &gt; All time NBA team (that doesn’t get to use players on the Laker team, obviously.)"
" LBJ is Lyndon Johnson, not fucking Lebron James lol that’s so dumb"
"I agree with you on the James Johnson trade . Clearly it was for Cap Space reasons. For JRich it's for basketball reasons. I don't think the FO is dumb to give up an elite shooter like Seth just for clearing cap space.  With ThJ+Johnson's expiring contracts, we have enough cap space to sign Giannis ."
Did you all just give up on Juancho? Obviously comparing the two is idiotic but Juancho shined offensively last year when given starters minutes and James Johnson isn't on the team anymore.
"&gt;MJ [...] are all easily recognizable.  I know the names of like six basketball players total, and two of them are MJ.  So I still can't tell if you're talking about Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson.  And don't think I can tell from context, unless the context is whether or not he was in Space Jam.  Also, is LBJ Lebron James?  I wouldn't have thought the B would appear in his initials, and only realized who you meant because Lebron wasn't in the rest of the list.  I would have immediately assumed you were talking about Lyndon B. Johnson, and then started wondering if I was getting the names mixed up and Magic Johnson was actually the name of the President, and then I'd wonder if I was racist for assuming Magic must have been the name of the black guy.  Anyway, yeah, acronyms suck.  You should pretty much always start a conversation by saying the full name, and then shorten it to initials in subsequent mentions.  ""Yeah, Michael Jordan and Lebron James are both legends, but MJ was in Space Jam so he'll always win out in my book.""  (For the curious, the remaining basketball names I know are Kobe Bryant, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal.  Though I will admit I would get a chuckle if everyone called Shaq ""SON"".)"
James Johnson
"The rest of those Pistons' nicknames were better. Dennis ""The Worm"" Rodman, John ""Spider"" Salley, Vinnie ""Microwave"" Johnson, James ""Buddha"" Edwards, etc."
"The last 20 something games of last year he was averaging like 17 a game on 55% from 3 or something stupid. I still think we have enough shooting with THJ, Maxi, DFS, KP, and evening James Johnson off the bench, and Richardson will be great. But it hurts to lose Seth."
1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron James  3. Magic Johnson  4. Kareem  5. Wilt

James Johnson was traded for Ricky Rubio.
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"small : James Johnson for Bledsoe. can go far as give a 2nd  big (nah not happening this midseason, maybe in offseason) : KP for Buddy + Barnes + Holmes. with fillers of course"
Aren't he and James the Johnson the only guys on the team not on rookie deals other than KAT and D'Lo?
&gt;The real question is why the Wolves traded for a 30 year old point guard who is making close to 20m a year and came off his best statistical season of his career to have him on the bench.   The Wolves had ~17m of extra salary by the name of James Johnson and only 1 PG on the roster coming off a long term injury in D'Angelo Russell. They thought it was better to pay Rubio to be a 6th man than it was to pay James Johnson to give you below average NBA quality play
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more. There are 73 #1 picks  1958 Elgin Baylor - 10  1960 Oscar Robertson - 11  1968 Elvin Hayes - 6  1969 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 15  1974 Bill Walton - 2  1975 David Thompson - 2  1979 Magic Johnson - 10  1982 James Worthy - 2  1984 Hakeem Olajuwon - 12  1985 Patrick Ewing - 7  1987 David Robinson - 10  Staring the 1988-1989 season, there is the introduction of a 3rd team  1990 Derrick Coleman - 2  1992 Shaq - 14  1993 Chris Webber - 5  1996 Allen Iverson - 7  1997 Tim Duncan - 15  2002 Yao Ming - 5  2003 LeBron James - 16  2004 Dwight Howard - 8  2009 Blake Griffin - 5  2011 Kyrie Irving - 2  2012 Anthony Davis - 4  So yeah, 1 of 22 #1 picks with at least 2 all-nba selections"
"Winslow has so far been really great for us. We just had to give Miami Crowder, Iguodala, and Hill (we also got James Johnson and Dion Waiters - traded Johnson for Gorgui and waived off Waiters). It somehow worked out."
"&gt;Durant - 29/7.3/5.3 on 65.2%TS (5.4 BPM)  Durant has played 18 games this season. James Harden has played more games as a Net than Kevin Durant.  &gt;Harden also has Harris who is averaging 15ppg on 70%TS and shooting the three at a 50% clip  I mean, you can look at the stats of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson before and after the Harden trade. All of those players have had an insane jump in offensive production. In fact, Nick Claxton has more than doubled his production with only 3 additional minutes played compared to last season.   Everyone thought the Nets depleted their depth for Harden but anyone who watches the game can see Harden is getting the most out of everyone. Guys that were 3rd string are now quality contributors. That's a pretty clear definition of an MVP."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"That would actually be surprising. I feel like they've always had a captain (at least since the Riley era); heck, even James Johnson was a captain one year."
"I mean a part of the ""heat culture"" idea is finding guys that are overlooked because of question marks on there character, and turning them into serviceable players. When heat culture was first talked about in marketing campaigns, two of Miami's key players were James Johnson and Dion Waiters. It's not exactly a secret that Miami and many other NBA locker rooms have some controversial players."
"I don't rank him on my All-Time list. I'm not Bill Simmons, I don't have a hundred-man, five-level pyramid of basketball greatness. I have a top ten list of players that I shuffle around whenever I get asked the question depending on who I like and who I feel like is getting under- or overrated at that moment.  1. Michael Jordan 2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 3. LeBron James 4. Bill Russell 5. Magic Johnson 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Larry Bird 8. Hakeem Olajuwon 9. Tim Duncan 10. Kobe Bryant  And I only include Russell and Chamberlain because I feel like I *have* to, even though I've only seen highlights and the occasional game from them when they were like 38."
Porzingis using his body to get a bucket? Feels unnatural.  James Johnson turning it over for no reason feels very natural.
James Johnson really is a no no no yes player lmao
"Fair list, this is my top player rankings that's divided into tiers a bit more. I tried to consider the players: Peak Year, Prime Years, Longevity, Accolades, Playoff Performances and Team Success.      |Rank|Player|Position|All-Time Tier| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Michael Jordan|SG|1| |2|Lebron James|SF|1| |3|Kareem Abdul Jabbar|C|1| |4|Magic Johnson|PG|2| |5|Wilt Chamberlain|C|2| |6|Bill Russell|C|2| |7|Larry Bird|SF|2| |8|Tim Duncan|PF|3| |9|Shaquille O'Neal|C|3| |10|Kobe Bryant|SG|3| |11|Hakeem Olajuwon|C|4| |12|Oscar Robertson|PG|4| |13|Jerry West|SG|4| |14|Julius Erving|SF|4| |15|Kevin Durant|SF|5| |16|Karl Malone|PF|5| |17|Stephen Curry|PG|5| |18|Elgin Baylor|SF|5| |19|Dirk Nowitzki|PF|5| |20|Kevin Garnett|PF|5| |21|David Robinson|C|5| |22|Charles Barkley|PF|5| |23|Moses Malone|C|5| |24|Dwyane Wade|SG|5| |25|James Harden|SG|5|"
"If you think Randle would be top 20 in 1990 you dont know a whole lot about the history of the NBA   Mj, Bird, Magic, Hakeem, Robinson, Barkley, Moses, Karl Malone, Ewing, Drexler, Mullin, Isiah Thomas, Stockton, Kevin Johnson, Joe Dumars, Mitch Richmond, Scottie Pippen, James Worthy, Dominique Wilkins, Kevin McHale, Terry Porter   That's 21 undoubtedly better than Randle not to mention guys like Reggie Miller, Tom Chambers, Fat Lever, Kevin Duckworth a bunch of allstar guys"
Fucking OG James Johnson comment god I loved how he drops that quote
James Johnson is washed now but I’ve never seen anybody guard Giannis like he did and the stats backed it up also. However flawed the stats were Giannis was at like 41% TS in 260 poss vs JJ from 2017-19
Hey dont blame us. That shitty contract was on Phoenix.  Honestly I dont know why we moved for him. We had James Johnson on a 16m expiring and flipped it for Rubio with 2 years on that money + McDaniels
"Dwight Powell, james Johnson and a second,"

"Assume you meant Mike James? He was atrocious, but Tyler Johnson was ok! He had two quick buckets in the fourth to help kill the Suns' hope."
Griffin and James not white. Neither is Johnson but I understand that part
"It's not like they're getting blown out. They could easily be in the playoffs if they didn't choke in the clutch, which partly is due to being so young.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd run it back, but:  \- Trade Bledsoe + picks for a 3 + D. Duncan Robinson would be nutty but his D is meh. I'd like a tough guy who can be vocal, a better James Johnson (who's been really great, but his place is on the bench).  \- Trade Steven Adams + picks for someone like Myles Turner. I love Adams but the extension he signed is atrocious and Hernangomez can be a lite version of him, which is more than enough in today's NBA. The fact that you have to take off your 20m$/yr guy because he's getting outplayed is unacceptable.  \- I'd resign Lonzo to be honest. He's got the right attitude, he's improving every year, his chemistry with Zion is nuts and he's a layup package away from being an elite role player. His defence is there, his 3 is there, his playmaking is there, his midrange is there, even his fucking Free Throws are there. He needs to get to the rim. That should be his assignment for this offseason. Even though his 3pt% might not show that, he's taken his 3p to a new level from last year. Last year he would be really good from 3 as a catch and shoot. Feet set, wide open, etc This year he's hitting stepbacks, shooting off the dribble, getting plays run for him  \- The bench is getting stacked in hustle guys (Hayes, Hart, James Johnson) but the Pels need someone who can get buckets. Someone like Lou Williams. Kira and NAW are nice, we'll see their development.  \-Maybe trade BI + picks for a superstar that complements Zion (if the opportunity presents itself)."
"Nah. Our roster isn't good and we are missing 2, maybe 3, key rotation players if you count James Johnson.  We are just young. Zion is our best player and the dude hasn't played a full season of basketball. He's effecient but isn't great in defense and in general makes some mistakes here and there.  But right now, we don't have shooters. We have to be the worse 3 pt shooting team over the last 15 games."
"That's fair. I reckon even if he doesn't get a title Giannis will eventually surpass Kareem due to longevity and being the face of the franchise if he plays out his contract. Also just adding to my previous comment to show Giannis' elite company, here is a list of the the dudes who were the best players on a team with the best WL record in a season multiple times (since the merger).       - 6x Larry Bird.   - 5x Tim Duncan.   - 4x Michael Jordan.   - 3x Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Stephen Curry.   - 2x Giannis, Dirk, K. Malone, Rose and Parker (depending on how you see him vs Duncan in 2012 and 2014 I said they were co-best players)"
S&amp;T for Lonzo? Maybe bring Josh Hart or James Johnson with him.
"I'd be mad because Steve Nash didn't deserve the MVP at all. Let alone 2 of them. He is not in the top 50 players of all time.  Let's look at who has won the MVP 2 (or more) times and see if they are top 50 players of all time:  Giannis (Time will tell, still early)  Steph Curry (Yes)  Lebron James (yes)  Tim Duncan (Yes)  Karl Malone (Yes)   Michael Jordan (Yes)  Magic Johnson (yes)  Larry Bird (yes)  Moses Malone (yes)  Kareem (Yes)  Wilt Chamberlain (Yes)  Bill Russell (Yes)  Bob Pettit (???)    So aside from Bob Pettit and Giannis (still early) every one who has won 2x MVP are top 50 players all time."
"They fucked us up pretty regularly before he got there too, they’ve been our bogey team for years. James Johnson used to be the best Giannis-stopper in the league."
"Has it really though...the NBA knows it went through some dark times in the 70s and 80s.  Basically you had players hitting the league who from a urban under-class that has experienced massive job loss and deindustrialization.  It was a heavy shift in terms the culture of the league. Combine that with the rise of drug culture/violence in many large American cities.  I don't think the NBA ever ran away from that. Its just that more NBA players are like Magic Johnson, middle class, living in middle class conditions versus Allen Iverson.  More guys are like Dwade, not LeBron James."
Reminds me of when we traded for James Johnson. Man moved from Miami to Minnesota and THRIVED. His fits were 10/10.
James Johnson did the same thing to a Martin twin after shoving him and didn’t get suspended
"There's not a way to specifically filter out for the last go-ahead shot so it's possible some of these got 2 in the same game  but here's the list of **most go-ahead shots made in the final 24 seconds of the 4th quarter or OT on a team that won the game since 1996-97, regular season and playoffs combined**  |Player|FG| |:-|-:| |Kobe Bryant|30| |LeBron James|29| |Carmelo Anthony|28| |Vince Carter|23| |Dirk Nowitzki|22| |Kevin Durant|20| |Joe Johnson|19| |Paul Pierce|19| |Ray Allen|19| |Chris Paul|18| |Dwyane Wade|18|  [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/tiny/ygbRx) Generated 4/21/2021.

"Reddick has been separated from the team since like the 2nd month. He's a professional podcaster now, not an NBA player.   The issue is the team has bad defenders in BI and Zion  playing important roles and the other good defenders are young and inconsistent. Zion is improving but BI can't consistently guard other 3s and likely never will.   The defense has started to improve lately. Part of that is coaching part of that is James Johnson. If this was a normal season with more practice time the improvement would likely be more noticeable."
"***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  1992 Dennis Rodman and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)  Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. First and foremost, you have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball which allows him to do so much with so little, truly raising the ceiling. He straight up has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. The chefs ridiculous shooting is just the quintessential necessity in these lineups. The reason he's so important and a starter is that he offers something no other player in the history of the game can offer. Not only this but he has an array of assets and skills that make him super important. He's super clutch and is very reliable down the stretch and is a good team defender. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. He can pick up steals and act as a good leader and with his off ball movement, he's essentially unguardable. His shooting can shut the doors on a match with how nuclear hot he gets and his gravity can seal a win in any match as the triple teams he forces can be exploited. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better, and more efficient in many ways, among many reasons.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He may not have the consistency of 2013, but he can dial in defensively when needed as he is still a living freight train in terms of build. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. If he's in a lineup of bigs and shooting is required, he can fufill that requirement. The 40% 3P% in 2013 seems like his best but it was on 3.3 attempts, he was shooting 37% on 5 attempts in 2018. Same story with FG%. His higher spacing in the Heat days gave him more room to shoot and drive through open lanes, he didn't have that luxury in 2018 yet he still did so well. When you need an instant bucket, you have potentially the most dangerous finisher of all time ready to ram through defenses, and these traits stayed in the playoffs. Essentially, he's acting as a jack of all trades. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. It's precisely the reason I chose 2018. His mix of more experienced playmaking and much higher BBIQ makes him better suited than his younger days. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own drive into the lane, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way. Imagine Draymond in 2016 but on steroids, or Magic with Karl Malones body.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have the 2 clutchest players in Bird and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan. Jordan really completes the team because of his pure transcendence in the field of scoring. Not only that but he has a very versatile skillset. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (The team is too smart to have him be the one shooting from 3) He is GOING to be the leader of the team and thats invaluable. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. His insane athleticism allowed him to process things at an insane pace. His consistency in his midrange came from his ability to find a good spot thanks to his good handles and speed, jump so high nobody can contest the shot and go into his form mid air. This ability to leap and use his incredible reflexes was imperative to his finishing as well as his incredible free throw drawing, absorbing contact and finishing through it. He mixed his ridiculous athleticism with potentially the deepest bag of moves of any guard ever, most notably the fadeaway. All of this allows him to benefit even more from all these elite passers like Magic, Bird, Russell, ect ect. The best thing about him is his postseason success. He was not fazed by pressure, he more so than anyone else in history thrived in it. He lived in the moments where games were decided, holding practically ALL of the playoff scoring records. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. His passing matured as he played more and is now super underrated as he improved his shot selection and court vision. He rebounds excellently thanks to his constant motor, the same motor that helped him earn a DPOY and become the greatest defensive guard. His off ball movement meant he could use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (There are SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Most lists don't have Garnett here. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is super awesome and useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, footwork like Hakeem and offense like a guard. His greatest skill was perhaps the fact that he had the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound anyone. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense."

"Reminds me of the playoffs when we had that entire week of #HeatCulture circlejerk where everyone was saying that Riley was the goat like he didnt offer fat contracts to Waiters, Whiteside, and James Johnson a couple years before."
Arguably baseball is so much harder than basketball. 2 different skill sets and 2 different athletic requirements. Plus you need a whole roster and the luckiest chain of events to win a WS. Compared to 2/3 superstars and some normies to win a NBA Championship.   Here is my comparison list.   Kareem Abdul Jabar - Barry Bonds   Michael Jordan - Mike Trout  Kobe Bryant - Ted Williams   Lebron James - Ken Griffey Jr (hypothetically w/ no injuries.)  Shaq - AROD   Dwayne Wade - Derek Jeter   Julius Erving - Albert Pujols   Magic Johnson - Sammy Sosa   Wilt Chamberlain - Babe Ruth  Bill Russell - Hank Aaron   Larry Bird - Pete Rose   Tim Duncan - Ichiro
"Have you heard of Magic Johnson? Dude had a top 3 player OF ALL TIME in KAJ. He also had All NBA James Worth. Also DPOTY Micheal Cooper and one of the best shooters of the era Byron Scott.  Heard of Larry Bird? His best Celtic team had FIVE HALL OF FAMERS. Four were in their prime (Bird, McHale, Parrish, DJ) and Walton won 6MOTY."
"Magic Johnson needs to be in the conversation. He's a top 5-6 player all time don't get me wrong but he's always been on stacked teams.   Started with Kareem (GOAT level player), Jamaal Wilkes (hall of famer), Norm Nixon (All star), Michael Cooper (one of the best defenders ever)  Later as Kareem and Wilkes grew older they got James Worthy (hall of famer) and still had crazy depth with Byron Scott, Mychal Thompson, AC Green. The showtime teams in the mid-late 80s had 6 players scoring in double figures."
Harrell too  As long as its not against James Johnson otherwise that fight is over pretty quick
I don’t think it was specific to this game. He took a really dirty cheap shot off of James Johnson when we played the Mavs a couple moths back and I’ve  priced he’s been grabbing at it every once in a while ever since  Edit: https://youtu.be/wHNeLrjgPcw here’s the play in question.

"sure, but i don't think it's been that crazy.  Huerter, Young, &amp; Capela have all played roughly 88% or more of the total games, and Collins is at like 84%. on the Mavs, by contrast, Luka's at 90%, DFS, Richardson and Kleber have played roughly 80% or lower, Porzingis their supposed #2 has played 65%.  i get that the rotation inconsistency is also problematic, and not just the number of games missed, but i would say you have better replacement talent and depth on the roster as well. the mavs have willie caulie stein, james johnson and nico melli top 10 in mpg on their sqaud and that's an oof."

"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"We literally own the Lakers and Bucks' futures because of his AD and Jrue trades. The Pelicans had almost no leverage with AD and somehow Griffin worked out Ingram, Hart, Lonzo, two guaranteed first round picks, an unprotected swap, and the impetus to land NAW, Hayes, James Johnson, and more."
"Hopefully Griffin learns from his mistakes and gets some shooting, teams are living with trapping Zion and Ingram.   He also needs to get some wings for the bench, James Johnson has been very helpful since he came here and they could have used someone like him all season. Having Josh Hart who should only guard guards and Melli as your 2 options was not a good choice to go.  Trade Bledsoe"
james johnson in his bag
who is james johnson and why is he so bad
James Johnson is not very good
&gt;*Hard to foul when you barely play defense.*  Exactly some of the Knicks are also intentionally fouling to stop easy buckets. They know what to do on defense.  James Johnson has racked up a million fouls though from trying to guard Randle.
Julius Randle looks at James Johnson and sees the 'drawing a foul on' version of bbq chicken
Yikes James Johnson missed that by a lot
"They made some huge roster changes this season and very quickly became the one of the favorites for the championships. As a result they have a lot of bandwagon fans that don’t really know too much about basketball or the team and those people are the most toxic. I don’t see that as a reason not to like them though. Just have a sense of humor about yourself and the team and you’re better than 90% of other people that started following this year.  The team itself is very entertaining to watch. Of our big three, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, all of them have very different play styles. Harden is a monster of a point guard, very good at getting buckets and even better at assists. Kyrie is one of the best ball handlers playing the game today and his playing is always smooth. Durant is almost as famous for his antics on social media as he is for his bball skills and the man is on many lists as one of the top three players. He makes the difficult look easy, a master of his craft.   Besides the superstars, there’s Joe Harris, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA having the best year in his career. They have three young players, Alize Johnson, Shamet, and Nic Claxton, with a lot of hustle whenever they come off the bench.   Basically, it’s a team with a very new roster and high offensive potential but glaring defensive weaknesses. It’s a great opportunity to watch three future hall of famers play together."
"Is calling Kris Dunn a megastar part of your unpopular opinion?   /s  Seriously though, this has been really hard for Mavs fans. People say “JJ” and I can’t always tell who they mean. We have Mavs legend JJ Barea who retired in the offseason, we had Justin Jackson who we traded in the offseason for James Johnson, who we then traded for JJ Redick recently. It’s just an never ending stream of JJs"

"Just curious, where did you get the TS% stat. If you are referencing the MavsMoneyBall article, that thing is 2 months old and was written right when Porziņģis was coming back from his injury. Prior to that being published, Porziņģis was averaging 20.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg on 47/35/86 shooting. He was also on a minutes restriction, he was a -3.6 and was also playing alongside G-Leaguers and rookies since the COVID protocols had DFS, JRICH, Maxi, Powell and Brunson all sitting. Since that has been published, KP has averaged 21 PPG and 10.3 RPG on 49/39/83 shooting and is a +6.1.   So naturally KP is going to have worse numbers when Luka sits and he was playing alongside James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nate Hinton and Josh Green.   In regards to winning games without Luka, naturally we aren't going to be as good without Luka, same with any team missing their best player. Last year we beat the #1 seed Milwaukee with just Porziņģis. Dončić missed a stretch of games and Dallas went 3-3 including close losses to Miami in OT (eventual EC champions), Boston and Toronto (#2 and #3 seeds). We beat the Spurs, Milwaukee and Philly.   I think you are expecting Dallas to play at the same level when Luka misses games and that's just not realisitc, there's natrually going to be a drop off. Even Porziņģis playing at his best isn't going to drag a team starting Maxi, Brunson, DFS and Richardson to wins over contenders consistently. That's not possible for any team. Look at the Lakers when LeBron sits and just Davis plays. They are naturally not as good as when LeBron and Davis both play.   I guess I just don't get your point. You say that ""whenever Doncić sits, Porzingis is not convincing at being the first guy the opponents guard.""  However stats show Porziņģis is doing fine when he's the primary option, he's scoring well and rebounding well. Then the argument shifts to well we are 1-4 without Dončić. Well obviously that's going to be the case, he's our best player. Those are also games that Porzingis hasn't played either, so it seems completely irrelevant. You go from arguing Porziņģis isn't a good primary option, to he's good at scoring but he can't lead the team.   The sample size is super small for games with Porziņģis playing without Luka, but he's been able to step up when Luka has bad games. Just look at the last game against Milwaukee where Porziņģis stepped up in the 4th quarter and brought us to the finish line."
"Morey and Marks (Nets) have both done a fantastic job but I’m going with James Johnson. People were clowning him early last year but he’s been adding a lot of talent around Booker, not just CP3 like you said. Whereas both Philly and Brooklyn were expected to be top teams, Johnson’s moves turned the Suns from a 9-seed to a top-3."
James Johnson
"&gt;	He took over the Cavaliers in the spring of 1980 and would only own them until 1982, but the damage he did was immense. One of his first moves as owner was to fire the Cavs head coach Stan Albeck and replaced him with Bill Musselman. At first the move was supported by the Cavs fan base as Albeck had struggled in his first season, but the firing of Albeck was a harbinger of things to come. Musselman was not even given a full season before Stepien fired him and replaced him with Don Delaney. Delaney got to finish the season and start the next season as head coach but after just 28 games in two seasons Stepien fired Delaney. He brought in Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach and future Pistons coach Chuck Daley but gave Daley 41 games before firing him. He ended up firing 5 coaches in 3 seasons.  &gt;	Stepien believed he had some kind of special gift for predicting basketball talent, and it was this arrogance which lead to him making horrible trade after horrible trade. Technically Don Delaney was the teams GM, but he was acting at the behest of Stepien. In early 1981 the Cavs made their first of many notable bad trades when they traded a 1984 first rounded to Dallas for Mike Bratz. The Mavericks would be the recipients of many of Cleveland's first rounders. The Cavs also traded them first rounders in 1983 and 1986 and received mediocre talent in return. The 1984 pick is especially notable as the Cavs could have drafted Charles Barkley or John Stockton. The Cavaliers also traded their 1982 first round pick to the Lakers and because of the Cavs struggles that year the pick ended up being #1 and the Lakers added James Worthy to a team that had Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  &gt;	Nearly all of the first rounders that the Cavaliers traded turned out to be high draft picks. The early 80s seen a deluge of talented players enter the league and the Cavs missed on nearly all of them, and even though Stepien did not own the team any longer the fans still hated him.  &gt;	The trading of draft picks became so problematic that NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien was forced to step in and in 1981 froze Cleveland's ability to trade draft picks. Unfortunately for Cavs fans, the league rescinded on this decision at the conclusion of the 81-82 season. The NBA stepped in because there was real fear around the league that he would trade away all of the Cavs first round picks in the 1980s and 1990s and this would in-turn cause the Cavs to became so unstable that they might disband."
Most buzzer beaters in nba history : Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Joe Johnson Lebron James Paul Pierce
Oscars Robertson- 131-50(72%)  Magic Johnson- 108-30(78%)  Jason Kidd- 76-31(71%)  LeBron James- 76-23(77%)  Wilt Chamberlain- 69-9(88%)  Russell wins 75% of his Triple-double games which is similar to the rest of them(Wilt being the exception)
"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
"We doubled Dame and Jayson Tatum, but that was when we had Hart and Zo, and rn we have a bunch of guys who've never played together.   It's amazing James Johnson is fitting in as fast as he has, because he's been here like a week."
"They gave Pels James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, and a 2nd round pick on the deadline."
Does James Johnson frequently turn into prime Harden for random three minute stretches?
"I can't tell you how assuring it is to see us running our offense through James Johnson in the fourth, and not even trying to get Zion touches.     That's winning basketball."
James Johnson being sneaky good at passing is one of my fave things haha
"(Copy and Pasted)  ***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  2017 Kevin Durant, and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)   Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. You have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball. He has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. People hate on Garnett for not having high volume but that helps here as his efficiency is going to be sorely needed. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. Stephs ridiculous shooting is just so reliable. He's also super clutch and is able to act as an ok team defender. It's super obvious he HAS to be here. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better. His only loss is a SLIGHTLY slower first step.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He can shoot and dial in defensively when needed. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. He's acting as a jack of all trades in a way. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own shot, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have 2 clutch players and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan really completes the team. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (ideally not the 3, but jesus, look at the team. No way in hell he's the one getting the ball at the 3 line when you have such a good coaching staff, so many high IQ players, so many great passers and so many elite shooters. A non issue.) He is GOING to be the leader of the team. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. He rebounds excellently and he can use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (We have SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass and offer a new vitality to the team.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense."
Wheres James Johnson when you need him.
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"&gt; the tools to defend Lebron (Bridges/Crowder)  Don't forget Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig. James Jones (one of lebron's favorite teamates)  built our roster to have as good a chance to guard lebron as possible. 4 guys that are all long, good defenders, and don't get tired because there are so many of them.   AD was always the tougher matchup because they usually play another big. But the AD at the 5 vs ayton is a battle"
James Johnson was terrible for us. JJ Redick has been terrible for us. Melli has been terrible for us. All of the above :(
They tried that last off-season swapping curry for Richardson and signing James Johnson. Easier said than done
James Johnson was a turnover machine and shot 22% ish from 3 - why would we keep him?
"We could of used James Johnson this series, instead we got a podcaster and some other euro guy"
"We could of used James Johnson this series, instead we got a podcaster and some other euro guy"
They traded an enforcer who they really needed (James Johnson) for a guy who couldnt even fucking play lmao. Well played mavs.
"It's either Mike James or Tyler Johnson, unless you wanna put TLC (lol) in ."
James Johnson too. Never met an abuser they didn’t like
“I cocked that joint back and banged on him” ~the poet-filosopher James Johnson
"The culture is working hard until you get paid and stop working. Whiteside, Waiters, James Johnson all regressed hard after their contracts. Arguably Tyler Johnson as well. I guess that's the result of taking so many reclamation projects.   We'll see what will happen to Nunn and Duncan Robinson too. Maybe it was bad luck."
After this series you wouldn’t even get James Johnson in exchange for Herro lol
"Heat have a history of employing players with credible domestic violence accusations like Kendrick Nunn, Avery Bradley, and James Johnson, as well as notable dirty players like Olynyk and Dragic.  That is Heat Culture"
"The season averages are not indicative of the Mavs playoff team.  We were playing Wes Iwundu, James Johnson, Josh green earlier this season and just bricking wide open 3s"
I bet Mavs would rather have James Johnson right now rather than a podcaster.
James Johnson failed at it
James Johnson?
"Riley did the same thing a couple of years ago. The team overachieves and so he chugs the kool-aid, ends up making stupid decisions like paying James Johnson, Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, Whiteside, etc. and then they fall down to earth.  Dude didnt even entertain a Herro trade for Harden even tho his best player is 31."
"Pat Riley doesnt get enough shit for his roster building/decision making. Year after year of giving the bank out to guys like james johnson, tyler johnson, dion waiters, hassan whiteside etc.... not giving up herro for harden. But butler went to them and bailed them out and their success last season all of their misses are/were forgotten. Honestly if the team wasnt in Miami they might still be a lottery team"
"Why is this considered rare?  Pat Riley overpaid James Johnson, Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside &amp; Tyler Johnson and his history of draft picks during that era wasn’t necessarily good either."
"He's like the last guy who would do it, though.  Would you settle for James Johnson?"
James Johnson is actually trained in martial arts. He's a black belt and has a 20-0 kickboxing record.
"1. Magic Johnson  2. LeBron James  3. Luka Doncic  4. Ja Morant  What is this a list of? Youngest players with 40 points in the playoffs. Future is bright in Memphis.  But Mike Conley just knows how to close games. 14 assists with only two turnovers, and 20 points as well. His two man game with Gobert was their main weapon in the 4th.  God damn I hope this series goes 7 games"
This. Russ is on the list somewhere near where James Johnson is for me. And I FOR SURE am not fucking with James Johnson. No sir.
"James Johnson is 6'7"" 240, black belt in Karate, and 20-0 in kickboxing competition lol"
That’s what they signed James Johnson for but he’s no longer on the team.
The Mavs got James Johnson because of that right?

"Yup  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ljgmob/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_1612_defeat/gnchlpb/  All the people clamoring about their defense as if it was gonna be the worst the playoffs have ever seen are idiots.  That comment was back in February and they only played a couple more games together after that. So ridiculous that people throwing out all these judgements about a team who didn't give a fuck about defense, had two injured stars taking time, and a flat-earther who kept taking personal leave  No team with 3 bona fide superstars + Blake Griffin and Joe Harris is going to be anything but frightening as fuck in the playoffs, when the veteran stars turn on the intensity and are actually playing together.  The Nets are surprisingly deep. The Blake Griffin acquisition is wild with how he looked in Detroit (people saying he has to retire) compared to now. You got players like Shamet, Jeff Green, Claxton all contributing off the bench at a level you'd think would make them a starter on a ""3 superstars + trash"" type team that people were expecting. Even players like Tyler Johnson, Mike James, and Cabarrot looked good at times last year, and they're fighting to just see the court at all with how deep the Nets are."
Nico a negative on both ends bruh...wish we would’ve kept James Johnson
"In the immortal words of James Johnson: ***""cocked that joint back and banged on him""***"

"Look what he did between the Heatles and now. If you take out Butler throwing a temper tantrum to force his way to Miami, his track record isn’t stellar. Now, you obviously can’t just ignore a move he made, I’ll give you that, but he’s done more than enough to offset that.  Whiteside contract. Meyers Leonard contract. Igoudala contract. Tyler Johnson contract. Kelly O contract. James Johnson contract. Dion Waiters contract. Hell, he even picked Oladipo over Harden, because getting rid of Herro was deemed too much.   It’s not all sunshine and daisies. A lot of luck went in to them making the Finals run last year."
"Detroit was.     The Pel's is not ""shitty"" you are right, but they underachieved by 3-4 wins lets not act like this team was ready to win a playoff series. The best player is 20 and had played 25 games headed into this season. They are one of the worst 3pt shooting teams in the league. All their role players are either over the hill or rookies/sophomores. The team replaced Jrue Holiday with Eric Bledsoe, who had the worst year of his career. JJ redick went from 15ppg on 64 TS% to benched and traded for a second round pick and James Johnson (who was legitimately better for the pels than JJ was this year)."
James Johnson was a goon that series. Should have been ejected a few times
"&gt; James Johnson, good MMA fighter,  He never actually fought in MMA, his record is completely fabricated lol"
"James Johnson, good MMA fighter, he’s about it. Jimmy Butler is also about it. Bobby Portis. That’s about it tho"
"Well he’s not. In that time for sure everyone would know Michael, because he was a superstar. In this era “James” would probably also be firstly referable to LeBron (even though you have James Harden, James Johnson etc.). But in couple of years if you asked on the street “what do you think about James as a player?” Also a lot of people would struggle to know who’s James. And the same is with Michael Jordon. Yes you have some people that would immediately think of Jordan. But a vast majority would struggle, even though they watch the nba and know Michael."
How can you not mention James Johnson going full WWE on Belinelli and JJ Redick   That's some clothesline he did back there
Dragic and James Johnson were the worse offenders for that type of shit
"Dragic smacked simmons, James Johnson got into it with Simmons after cov fouled dragic, d wade tried to pull Justin Anderson's arm off. Very chippy series"
Thank god James Johnson is off the Heat or the Heat would have him putting Middleton is a German-suplex.

"Mave are one of the best shooting teams in the league. Their shooters were out covid/knee surgery and where replaced in the rotation with three of the worst shooters in the league, Iwundu, James Johnson, and Josh Green. That along with Dorian and Luka starting the season cold brought down there season averages but that means nothing now. Timmy and Dorian ended the season on a massive hot streak, realistically the guys around Luka and KP should all be around 40+% from 3"
Thoses bigger players are not named LeBron James. U trippin hard if you think Cam Johnson is good matchup vs LBJ.
"While I was watching the game I felt Nash should had started Mike James, Alize Johnson and Tyler Johnson instead of the big 3.  This confirms it!"
the mavs wanted to get tougher so they got rid of James Johnson for jj redick and Melli
I don't think Johnson or James get any pt if have a 9 man rotation.
James Johnson is a fake anyway
If we knew Redick wasn't gonna want to be here we should have just kept James Johnson to whoop some ass.
"Dinwiddie will be interesting this offseason.   Most likely he will sign elsewhere since he’s said he wants a larger role and this would be his first big potential payday. Odds are the Nets aren’t going to offer the $18-20m per year he wants since their tax situation would likely cost $1.75 for every $1 they sign FA’s with.    If Dinwiddie agrees to a Sign and Trade then Brooklyn would open up potential cap space in the form of a Trade Exception similar to what the Celtics worked out with Hayward when he went to Charlotte. It would also open up the market for teams that can sign Dinwiddie.   Nets can likely sign Mike James again or some other backup PG for much less $ than Dinwiddie should get in FA. Harden, Kyrie, and Durant do a lot of on ball so Dinwiddie would be a massive luxury.   Tsai could just pay the Tax and re sign Dinwiddie at the end of the day.    Then it comes down to can the Nets keep Blake Griffin around for the Vet Min since Detroit still paying him $29m next year. That would leave the Nets with the Tax Mid Level Exception $3y/$18m and Bi Annual Exception 2y/$7.4m to sign FA’s in the offseason. Tax MLE may be able to be split in half to sign 2 players but I’m not 100% certain.   Nets also have their 1st which is like 26/27th range to add a player or use the players rights in a trade. Dinwiddie could create another $15m+ in open cap space if he agrees to a Sign and Trade.    Nets should have at least 2-4 open roster spots depending on Blake Griffin and Mike James since James rights are still held by his Euro team who just re signed the coach who got into a fight w/ James and led to him playing for the Nets. Griffin is just a normal Unrestricted Free Agent.    Dinwiddie and TLC are 2 roster spots that are likely open. Guess it can get up to the 5 roster spot range depending on Tyler Johnson. Nets also have a Euro SG named Isaia Cordinier who they may be interested in bringing over."
"&gt;In the future his 9 finals in 10 years is going to looked at as a INSANE feat.  Without trying to claim that James' consistency reaching the Finals is not impressive, all capitals ""INSANE"" is a little much.  Magic Johnson went to 9 Finals in 12 years, for example -- and missed one due to the wacky and short-lived best-of-3 first round series.  A bunch of Celtics also have an impressive record there, too, as they collectively won the East 10 straight times and 12 times in 13."
We didn’t just give up those players we took on bad salary back (James Johnson and Dion Waiters). Then you have to account what we could have gotten back if we traded Iggy / Crowded individually instead of a broken Winslow. Plus when we made that trade we had momentum to be a playoff team and the season went downhill after that trade. We didn’t have our pick so there was zero reason to give up on a season
"The teammates have to at least be consistently competent. MVP shouldn't have been a question to begin with though. Neither team were going to beat Utah through a 7 game series in the 1st place. Regardless of who the player is, they're not gonna carry the team themselves, they're gonna need #2. Russell (Bill), Chamberlain, Erving, Bird, Johnson, Kareem, Jordan, Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, James, Curry etc... They all need someone to break that defensive strategy designed specifically for them. Damn good season regardless compared to last year. Hopefully 2 years of healing will do some good"
"Also Nate Thurmond to George Johnson to Tree Rollins to Shaquille O'Neal to Lebron James, for more of the conspiracies."
"1. Allen Iverson  2. Russell Westbrook  Now, in no particular order.  3. Charles Barkley  4. Julius Erving  5. Magic Johnson  6. LeBron James  7. Carmelo Anthony  8. Paul Pierce  9. Grant Hill  10. Rod Strickland   Special shout out to Drazen Petrovic."
Steph Curry LeBron James Magic Johnson Michael Jordan Kobe Allen Iverson  DWade Harden Luka Ja Morant
"&gt; As much as I like James Harden as a player, I don't think he's a top 10 guy who can lead a team to a championship. Jack of many trades, master of none. He's more of a Joe Johnson type of player, 2nd round and out. Perhaps Morey has his eye on Howard next... Lin-Harden-White-Monty-Howard lineup sounds fearsome.   This comment is pretty funny in hindsight"
"I understand Lakers fans have been used to this type of shit since the Lakers kings debacle at the very latest, if not since forever, like how the league forced Magic Johnson to the Lakers. Or how AD forced his way to the Lakers, or how the Lakers got 4 top 5 picks in 3 years including moving from 14th to 4th in the draft which just happened to make sure the Pelicans would agree to trade AD to the one team he would go to.   But all I know is I better never see a Laker fan mention the refs ever again. Crazy how y’all are so entitled to preferential treatment that y’all literally bootlick refs. But anyone who sees the BS for what it is is a child.   But honestly I just don’t like Laker fans and their attitude. I remember getting mass downvoted and literal dm attacks last finals because I commented that the Heat wouldn’t get swept. Laker nation was so incensed, so offended, that I wouldn’t just admit the Heat were going to get swept that I had assholes just like you yelling at me and attacking me. To be frank, y’all are the worst part of the NBA community and it’s hilarious to me how pitiful y’all acted when you had to go through a slight rebuilding process because you guys clearly believe you are not allowed to rebuild.   But yeah bro, keep sucking Xi James off and the front office off, y’all clearly are good at bootlicking"
"fair enough, but biyombo? james johnson?"
bismack biyombo? pj tucker? james johnson?
2003: 1st overall Lebron James  2003: Second overall: Darko (Pistons)   These are both not on your list?   Magic Johnson in 1979 was drafted first overall and then won 5 titles and went to 9 finals in like a 13 year career?  These other players account for over 70% of the championships. Why wouldn’t teams go for the strategy that accounts for over 70% of the titles won????
"This is literally so fucking cool.   I did Joe Johnson &amp; Lebron James, Terry Rozier &amp; Larry Bird, and Dominique Wilkins and Trae Young. The UI layout is incredibly intuitive. 100/100, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"OK but it leaves out all the teams that picked first and still sucked  Also james worthy did not go from the bottom to a dynasty, he joined a loaded lakers team that had already won a championship with magic johnson and kareem"
I dont know why people think James Johnson is a good enforcer. Fighting ability has nothing to do with nba enforcing. Its about yelling loudly &amp; strategic pushes
Wasn't that what James Johnson was for
"It’s interesting that Dallas got James Johnson to be Lukas bodyguard and then traded him away, they could definitely use him now"
"I was just messing around and it seems to mess up when players have identical names. I tried Kareem - Bruce Brown and  it took two seperate ""Ken Johnson"" players as the same people and two seperate ""Mike James"" as the same people so it skipped a ton of links."
"&gt;So a team with magic johnson,kareem,james worthy,byron scott, and Michael cooper isn't a superteam?  Magic, Cooper, Scott, and Worthy were drafted by the Lakers."
"So a team with magic johnson,kareem,james worthy,byron scott, and Michael cooper isn't a superteam?"
"tbh its not that surprising for me. They had gervin and I think Larry Kenon, and James silas then Gervin and Gilmore starting out then they had alvin robertson,Johnny moore, Sean elliot, avery johnson, david robinson, tim duncan, parker and manu and kawhi and bowen.  They have been good forever"

I really wanted James Johnson here to throw hands 😂
"James Jones drafted Cam Johnson, Mikal, signed Monty, Jae, and CP3, build one of hell of a bench full of players capable to contribute any point in time. Frank and Craig basicly for free. Payne and Jevon to back up Cp3.  And still the biggest accomplishment he done in the Desert is convincing Sarver to stay away from Basketball operations."
"In no particular order off the top of my head, 20 players that are better than James Harden:  1. Kevin Durant  2. Michael Jordan  3. Lebron James  4. Magic Johnson  5. Kareem Abdul Jabaar  6. Wilt Chamberlain  7. Larry Bird  8. Tim Duncan  9. Kobe Bryant  10. Oscar Robertson  11. Bill Russell  12. Jerry West  13. Stephen Curry  14. Dirk Nowitzki  15. Charles Barkley  16. Julius Erving  17. Karl Malone  18. Moses Malone  19. Elgin Baylor  20. Kevin Garnett  I'll admit that was a little harder than i expected, but i'm sure there are tons i left out."
But if we have to play James Johnson for that we lose anyway.
I mean he dropped like 30/8/8  per game last year vs the clippers without James Johnson so
Who's gonna protect luka now that James Johnson is no longer there

"Yeah a lot of reasons for the defensive improvement.  Really I just think the drop is just more simple. That hedge and recover stuff, just so many moving parts and points of failure. Team was always in scramble mode.  JJ and Melli for James Johnson and Iwundu. Jaxson being better. Naji like you said. Some shooting variance.  I’m interested to see if Stan attempts that sort of defense again next year"
James Johnson is a dirty player.
Would've been nice if the Mavs kept James Johnson. That was Luka's designated bodyguard
"Lmao Jared Dudley has a ring so he must also be better than Harden correct?   Harden is on par with KD as a scorer and it isn't even close when it comes to playmaking. KD's average defense doesn't close the gap either.   I'd actually agree. Kyrie has had a crazy year that has honestly gone under the radar. Though I do believe AD is the better player when you add defense to the picture.   And no, the Nets bench frankly isn't close to the Lakers bench.  Harris, Claxton, Jeff Green, Shamet, Johnson, TLC &amp; Mike James vs Kuzma, Caruso, Gasol, Trez, Morris, Matthews, THT &amp; McLemore.   I don't see an argument for the Nets bench tbh."
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
Wasn't that what James Johnson was for?
"If you rank the Mavs most important players (when healthy) it sounds be some order of Dwight Powell, maxi, Jalen, DFS, Richardson numbers 3-8 and they were ALL GONE, while KP was recovering from Injury and coming back quickly to try and offer some semblance of reinforcements. It was Luka, THJ, and James Johnson trying to win games lol"
I mean we had one but didnt last long (James Johnson)
"Luckily, it doesn't seem serious. He's back on the bench doing resistance workouts after coming from the locker room.   On that note, wth happened to James Johnson?"
And now James Johnson is injured too.  Chase Center is seriously cursed man.
"James Johnson, please don't take out our team two at a time."
"Yes.  Here's a more eloquent way to explain it: [Remember those lofty early comparisons to Magic Johnson and LeBron James? Those have devolved into some projecting Simmons as a souped-up Draymond Green, the beating heart of a multiple-time champion in Golden State. Simmons resembles Green only in the sense that they both have to work around questionable perimeter games. And that's not a diss of Green, who is everywhere when it counts, organizing and screaming and playing as if he wants to take someone's head off, a stark contrast to Simmons stationary in the dunker's spot as if modeling for an undergraduate art class.](https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-76ers-ben-simmons-struggles-roster-changes-game-5-hawks-recap-free-throws-point-guard-analysis/)"

James Johnson vs Metta
"Here’s another since it’s fun  Remember those lofty early comparisons to Magic Johnson and LeBron James? Those have devolved into some projecting Simmons as a souped-up Draymond Green, the beating heart of a multiple-time champion in Golden State. Simmons resembles Green only in the sense that they both have to work around questionable perimeter games. And that's not a diss of Green, who is everywhere when it counts, organizing and screaming and playing as if he wants to take someone's head off, a stark contrast to Simmons stationary in the dunker's spot as if modeling for an undergraduate art class."
"Nothing the Pels did was shitty. They never 'treated the players wrong' nothing was bad about that trade. I'm actually glad they got something out of a player as washed as Redick is, it's a little insane they got a contributor in James Johnson and a 2nd round pick out of guy who can't defend and is regressing quickly on the offensive side of the ball."
"1987-88 - Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan      1988-89 - Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan      2002-03 - Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady      2004-05 - Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash      2009-10 - Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade      2018-19 - Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Paul George, James Harden, Stephen Curry      Here are a few of my contenders, I think 87-88 might be my pick."

"On paper maybe, idk at this stage of his career but for many years he’s actually reliable playoff minutes as opposed to shamet and Johnson. Mike James hasn’t done it yet but would be more in the mould for a Patty Mills type contributor."
Should’ve signed James Johnson too to complete the sweep
"**Nets:** Harden, Irving, Harris, Durant, Claxton with a bench of James/Carter, Mills/Thomas, Brown/Johnson, Griffin/Johnson, Jordan/Sharpe.  **Bucks:** Holiday, DiVincenzo, Middleton, Giannis, Lopez with a bench of Connaughton, Hood/Nwora, Ojeleye/Thanasis, Portis/Diakite.  **Sixers (likely to change):** Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Harris, Embiid with a bench of Milton, Maxey/Springer, Korkmaz, Reed/Scott, Drummond.  **Hawks:** Trae, Bogdan, Hunter, Collins, Capela with a bench of Wright/Cooper, Huerter, Reddish/Hill, Gallinari/Johnson, Okongwu/Dieng.  **Heat:** Lowry, Robinson, Butler, Tucker, Adebayo with a bench of Vincent, Herro, Strus/Okpala, Markieff, Dedmon. (need Oladipo back for some depth)  **Celtics:** Smart, Richardson, Brown, Tatum, Horford with a bench of Pritchard/Dunn, Langford, Nesmith, Williams, Williams.  **Knicks:** Rose, Fournier, Barrett, Randle, Robinson with a bench of Quickley, Grimes, Burks, Toppin, Noel.  **Hornets:** LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, Plumlee with a bench of Smith, Bouknight, McDaniels, Washington, Jones.  **Pacers:** Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis, Turner with a bench of McConnell/Sumner, Lamb/Duarte, Holiday, Craig/Brissett, Bitaadze/Jackson.  &amp;#x200B;  That's 9 other fairly competitive teams out East so top 5, while achievable, could be fairly tough given Chicago's real lack of depth outside of the guard spots if they get many injuries/Covid absences."
If only we had also signed James Johnson
"Plus NAW from Va Tech, James Johnson from Wake Forest, Steven Adams from Pittsburgh."
"A lot of teams have had five:  1983 to 1985 Lakers: Magic, Kareem, Worthy, Jamaal Wilkes, James McAdoo  1986 to 1987 Celtics: Bird, McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, Bill Walton  1997 Bulls: Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Kukoc, Robert Parish  2011 Celtics came close: Pierce, Allen, Garnett, Shaq, and two guys just on the outside in Rondo and Jermaine O’Neal"
I wanted James Johnson as the enforcer role but looks like he got more than the minimum
Don’t think we can directly replace green with Johnson but mills is a huge upgrade over shamet/mike James.
Mills and James Johnson. The latter probably won’t make a difference. The sub is really overstating how successful the team has been in free agency
He's basically taking the Shamet/Mike James/Tyler Johnson minutes and being injury insurance for either of the star guards
Didn’t like that the Nets lost green but replacing him with James Johnson then grabbing Mills is amazing
"The Heat managed to get rid of those Whiteside/Tyler Johnson/James Johnson/etc contracts which should have been untradeable. If they’re bad, they’ll find a way to get rid of them and then sign another star who wants to play in Miami, there are plenty of those."
Honestly just needed someone to fight PJ Tucker. James Johnson will do
James Johnson should be good.
"With Kyrie, KD, and Harden on the floor defenses are gonna cheat off James Johnson 100% of the time, and he’ll still brick open 3s like he did for us in Dallas"
Dwight Howard vs James Johnson in Finals let's go.
JAMES HARD BODY KARATE JOHNSON! 😤
"&gt;Why did you trade for him in the first place exactly?   To mentor Anthony Edwards and have a high quality backup PG, he was also part of the Jaden McDaniels trade which was very valuable.   Rosas also wanted to keep his money on the books for one more year since James Johnson was an expiring."
"literally undoing the lonzo trade and keeping him. also re-signing josh hart.   Graham-Lonzo-BI-Zion-JV  Kira-NAW-Murphy-Hart-Hayes  Maybe keep james johnson if possible. That's a playoff squad if healthy. And point zion feasts in that. Now we have to find a 3&amp;D that fits lonzo's role. Frustrating because that feels like the missing piece to what would be a solid 7/8 seed with potential for 4/5/6. Then after another year together could return everyone but JV next offseason. Hopefully you bring him back and that chemistry / continuity pays dividends in the form of 5/6 seed basement, 2/3 seed challenger. Maybe you bring in a stud piece.   Instead we've got a gaping hole and a shirt on of bs to figure out."
James Johnson is still around somewhere…
… The ones he offered and decided to sign. Along with James Johnson contract which ended up being bad too.
"Lmao sure bro. We were paying Hassan Whiteside, James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Tyler Johnson big money and just a few years later we won the Eastern Conference. Not every franchise has an incompetent front office that can’t recover from a couple swings and misses"
"&gt;We tried to do defense this year with Jrich and James Johnson  C'mon man that's such a shoddy ""try"" at defense, of course it didn't work"
We tried to do defense this year with Jrich and James Johnson. Didn't work. Team needs playmakers and a big who isn't scared and made of glass. Hopefully someone will take our money
"Missing Dinwiddie made Kyrie and Harden have to play way more minutes. Maybe Harden doesn’t have as prolonged a Hamstring issue, maybe Din is enough even with that. We need rotational guys that eat minutes that aren’t Shamet/Tyler Johnson/Mike James tier.   Forward depth looks ok assuming Blake, Jeff are back. Deandre will play in the regular season again unless he’s moved."

Did signing James Johnson and Dion Waiters to big fat contracts make sense?
James Johnson is a weird inclusion here.
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Hakeem Olajuwon 5. Shaquille O'Neal 6. Magic Johnson 7. Larry Bird 8. Kobe Bryant 9. Tim Duncan 10. Moses Malone 11. Kevin Durant 12. Kevin Garnett 13. Steph Curry 14. Jerry West 15. Dirk Nowitzki
"Here's the extract from the book itself:  To bang my point home that Nowitzki was better than anyone realised, I created something in that same column called the 42 Club: I added up the point, rebound and assist averages for franchise guys during the playoffs, and if the number topped 42, that meant we were probably talking about a potential Level 4 top 25 (or higher) guy.  To figure out the members, I allowed only guys who played 13 or more playoff games in one postseason, since that’s a legitimate sampling (more than a month of basketball at the highest level). Here were the 42 Club members from 1977 (What Bill calls the modern era) to 2010 (so we can include LeBron):  Michael Jordan (6x): 49.4 (’89); 50.7 (’90); 45.9 (’91); 46.5 (’92); 47.8 (’93); 43.8 (’97)  Shaquille O’Neal (4x): 43.6 (’98); 49.2 (’00); 49.0 (’01); 43.9 (’02)  Larry Bird (4x): 42.0 (’81); 44.4 (’84); 43.4 (’86); 44.2 (’87)  LeBron James (3x): 44.7 (’06), 43.6 (’08), 51.7 (’09)  Moses Malone (2x): 43.0 (’81), 43.3 (’83)  Magic Johnson (2x): 43.8 (’86), 42.5 (’91)  Karl Malone (2x): 43.0 (’92), 42.9 (’94)  Hakeem Olajuwon (2x): 44.2 (’94), 47.8 (’95)  Tim Duncan (2x): 42.7 (’01), 45.4 (’03)  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1x): 47.1 (’80)  Charles Barkley (1x): 44.5 (’93)  Kobe Bryant (1x): 42.8 (’01)  Allen Iverson (1x): 43.7 (’01)  Kevin Garnett (1x): 44.0 (’04)  Dirk Nowitzki (1x): 45.1 (’06 pre-finals)  There wasn’t a single fraud on that list with the possible exception of … well, I’m trying to be nice, but fuck it—Karl Malone! Every other memorable spring from 1977 to 2010 is represented except for Walton in ’77 (didn’t score enough points), Bernard in ’84 (only played 12 games), Magic in ’87 and ’88 (barely missed), and Wade in ’06 (didn’t heat upuntil the last two rounds). Just like in real life, the best playoff seasons of Ewing, Robinson, and Drexler fell a tad short.  Career-year/MVP seasons for KG, Barkley, and Iverson all qualified, as did Kobe’s ridiculous ’01 season when he quietly peaked as an all-around player. I also like that our most dominant player (MJ) leads with six appearances, and his precocious next-generation challenger (LeBron) cracked the 42 Club at the tender age of twenty-one. Everything about the concept checks out; there are no flukes, no aberrations, no injustices. It just works."
"You mention LeBron James as one of the best to never win DPOY, but you don’t mention Bobby Jones or Dennis Johnson?"

"It wasn't a disaster. We got a really valuable FRP from GSW just to sit Iggy's ass in LA and take his contract. Top 4 protected in 2024, top 1 in 2025, unprotected 2026.   Crowder and Hill were expiring and probably would not have signed an extension with us. Nor would they want to say as we were not contending. We got Winslow, Dion, and James Johnson (who we flipped for Mr. Trebuchet). We waived Dion as we didn't want him to be part of the team, who went on to win a ring with Lakers. It seems all parties involved benefited. Iggy, Crowder, Hill are in contending teams, Dion got a ring, Johnson gets paid, we take in Winslow and GSW FRP."

"Russell Westbrook yelled, “There you go!” Anthony Davis gave a look of pleasant surprise. Alex Caruso belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “Where is everybody?”"
"Just off the top of my head, guys who are vets and would ring chase for vet min (regardless of how likely).

"Same exact thing happened to me and my brother with magic Johnson, thing is, magic didn’t just decline he was pissed we had the audacity to walk up to him and yelled at us, I was like 5 yrs old. James worthy saw all this and came over and signed my ball."
James Johnson huh
"I want the Pelicans to screw with Philly by offering Lonzo S&amp;T, James Johnson S&amp;T, and those Lakers and Milwaukee picks."

"The Great:   -The Davis trade after a really ugly second half to the 18-19 season and basically dealing with NOLA vs the world   -Helping shape a development staff with Gentry to help BI and Zo blossom.   -Naji Marshall UDFA —&gt; contract extension  -The Jrue trade; did right by Jrue and secured a bag of future picks and swaps. To all those people saying they won’t mean shit in five years: LMA and Bosh were all stars five years ago.   -Maxing BI    The good:   -Offloading Solomon Hill’s contract and signing JJ Redick   -Trading second round picks for Derrick Favors at the time   -With Trajan and Swin as well, seems to hit the draft pretty well. Jax, despite recent news (let’s also not mail in the rest of his life for this shit either), Nickeil, Kira, and Naji have all shown signs of a whole bunch of promise and legit talent. Jax was fantastic the second half of last season. Pels probably make the play in if Nickeil starts over Bledsoe. Naji was a fuckin Diamond in the rough.   -Willing to not let open wounds fester and immediately identifies and fixes own mistakes; something a deadbeat VP would not do.   -trading Redick and Melli for James Johnson, Wes Iwundu and a second rounder. Redick and Melli became unplayable and we saved some money for this offseason by offing Melli.       The bad:  -Choosing Melli and Jah over C Wood. Granted there was definitely some behind the scenes stuff with Wood’s attitude, but man Wood would have killed it with Zion.   -SVG  -Way too many guards on the 2019-2020 roster.   -Not enough shooters and defense on this last seasons team.  -Not extending Josh Hart BEFORE last year (this is more TBD/me nitpicking)    The Ugly:   Being the VP of a team who’s best player’s step father is already wanting his son off the team."
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"Bulls have always been able to draft solid role players for there position. (Mitotic, Portis, Snell, Gafford, James Johnson, Gibson, Valentine, Doug, Gray) and then u have Noah, Rose, Butler, Hinrich, Ben Gordon. Duds have been Teague, Hutchinson pretty much and then terrible trades like Doug trade, Aldridge.  Need to give time but Lauri, WCJ, Coby and Pat Williams are starter level players in the league at least"
"""A mix of Lebron James and Magic Johnson"""
"Kuminga is a raw prospect and the GSW dont wanna waste Curry, Dray, and Klay's prime  by getting players that are gonna take a long time to develop. If they really want players that would help them, they should get James Bouknight, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody, Davion Mitchell, Corey Kispert."

"Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Shawn Marion, Draymond Green, Giannis"
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
Lebron James James Johnson are the same size does Lebron have the same struggles as James Johnson
"Nah, I'm pretty sure it was just Hart that was affected since he was the closest to JJ. There haven't been any other reports about the locker room having disdain towards the FO for that trade, or any locker room troubles at all. James Johnson, the guy we got from Dallas, integrated well with the others when he got here."
"The best “superstar” that wanted to come to Miami in a decade has been Jimmy. I love a Jimmy but there’s been much better options available.  Do you not remember the awful contracts we had to give out cuz nobody else would sign for us? Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Hassan whiteside?"

The Brooklyn Nets have one non-American player on their roster.   Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Durant/Griffin  Dinwiddie/Shamet/Green/Claxton/Jordan  Chiozza/James/Brown/Perry/Johnson    That’s a 15 man roster. The depth isn’t that good but still
"Well it worked because the Hawks had amazing amounts of cap room.  Let them do things like take a risk on Capela's big contract because they were still way under the cap after taking him on.  I don't know if NO's crappy cap situation is a residue of them trying to win with AD.  But he's actually been gone for 2 seasons now, so you'd hope a competent FO wouldn't have them flirting with the luxury tax, but they are...

Also, whatever they do with Lonzo (27.5 million hold).  So they look really bad off, but can get out of it at least."
"Okay let's look at the 2012 team. Lebron joined right after an MVP and FMVP season. Kd, Westbrook, and Harden joined after the Finals. Kobe and CP3 joined after the 2nd round. Melo joined after the 1st round. All these guys played a full season.  This year we have Kd joining after the 2nd round, and Lillard, Tatum, and Bam joining after the 1st round. Draymond, Javale, Lavine, Keldon Johnson, and Grant didn't even play in the playoffs.  &gt;As opposed to players like Booker and Holiday who’s season literally ended last week.  These guys are bench players and aren't the reason team USA will win or lose. Moreover, the burden these players carried is less than the burden Durant and James carried before the 2012 Olympics."
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"2015 i watched james johnson dunk on drummond and after the game his media interview he said That was nasty, right? Cocked that joint back, banged on em and ive been hooked ever since"
"Pretty sure James jones will make sure that we keep Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Cam on the roster no matter what. Sarvers has said that CP3 is worth every penny and that he will pay him in a second. And despite being cheap and bad he has supposedly learned from his past mistakes. Thats still to be confirmed though. Think he's probably made the decision to eat the massive salery L until CP3's next contract is over. Then its likely there will be no replacement for cp3 when he leaves.   Mikal and ayton are up for contract extentions this summer but are still on their rookie deals next year. Cam Johnson is on his rookie deal for 2 years. Meaning that there will be 1 year where its bad and 1 year that its extremely bad before CP3 is gone. all of this is assuming CP3 opts out and takes a 3 year extension.   The side pieces may be broken up/reschuffled some it seems like we are all in for the next 2-3 years. Then well figure out where we are at and what has to happen when CP3 is gone."
"I'm gonna try and take the challenge and see if I can name 30 players with a better career than Paul.       Here are 25 players I'd rank higher.      - Michael Jordan - Lebron James - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Wilt Chamberlain - Bill Russell - Magic Johnson - Larry Bird - Tim Duncan - Shaquille O'Neal - Kobe Bryant - Hakeem Olajuwon - Oscar Robertson - Jerry West - Julius Erving - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Stephen Curry - Elgin Baylor - Dirk Nowitzki - Kevin Garnett - David Robinson - Charles Barkley - Moses Malone - Dwyane Wade - James Harden     Then the group that I'd rank somewhere around him in no particular order include Stockton, Ewing, Iverson, Zeke, Rick Barry, Kidd, Nash, Cousy,"
"&gt;Lebron James: he is a physical specimen the league had never seen before, who is to say he won't age differently than other player, I still think it will be his league 5 years from now  smart man  dude only seriously missed on wiggins (cant blame him, everyone did) and stanley johnson (im confused on that one lol i dont remember his hype ever being *that* high)"
Its james johnson. Nobody  wants to mess with him.
"James Johnson and Steven Adams. Also UD, I think he's the last OG enforcer in the league"
"The Warriors fucked up last season, they really had a chance to the WCF or even the Finals if they had traded Wiseman and not traded for Oubre (just removing those 2 they would have been a playoff team without playing the Play In). The next year would be harder but the West is still relatively open.  Whatever they do, I think they need more dept and someone than when Steph is sit could provide scoring. If I was their GM I will target Melo as a FA with the minimum and Otto Porter for a mid level exception. Also Boogie Cousins could be helpful for the RS (not much in the PO) and he already knows the team and if I remember correctly he was friends with some of the guys there.  Other players they may target are: DRose as Steph backup, Robin Lopez and James Johnson (to add some big bodies too).  If they manage to add some of those guys they then just really need to turn Wiseman+Wiggins in something good, but I will also consider just packing Wiseman and one of the picks for useful guys (maybe Marcus Smart?), in the end they already had star power, and it's probably better to add good specialist."

This list definitely was made before James Johnson rolled up [dressed like this.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EM6SfmRXsAIwmxt.jpg)
"For real, real coaches like Riley, Auerbach and Phil Jackson had to get it out the mud with bums like Dwyane Wade, James Worthy, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan"

unless your name is JJ Redick and you happen to live in Brooklyn NY normally and you've expressed interest in a buyout but James Johnson and Wes Iwundu are too tempting
"The heavy rumors around the time was that the Pels were expecting to release Reddick which would allow him to sign with a contender as no one wanted to trade for him (he played awful this year while also carrying a cap hit of 13mil). All of a sudden the Dallas deal was announced out of nowhere that got both Reddick and Melli out of New Orleans for two players, a second round pick, and cash. James Johnson played decent enough to warrant positive reactions from the Pels fans (Melli did better in his new environment as well).  Personally, the Pels were given an option that gave Johnson &amp; Melli a chance to make a positive impact on a fresh team.  JJ was also given that opportunity for the Mavs but was out due to injury or rehab or whatever (my assumption is that he would have probably played for a northeastern team if he had been bought up but we'll never know).   More importantly for them, the Pels turned paying JJ Reddick to leave the team to ring chase into a second round pick and cash."
"I think the 86 Celtics can definitely be thought of as a super team because of Bill Walton and Dennis Johnson, but before that, the team was much more naturally constructed with Bird, McHale, Parish, and Maxwell not being ring chasers or the result of a star taking the hardest road. KC Jones was also a defensive-minded, former role player type coach, I think his attitude and grit affected the perception of those Celtics.   The 08 team Big 3 was also not the traditional super team construction but a lot of the guys that came in like Cassell, PJ Washington, James Posey we're definitely ring chasers. But, people think of Rondo, Big Baby, Tony Allen, Kendrick and Powe who were drafted by us."
"Its beyond an exaggeration. This is a league with Michael Fucking Jordan, the most marketable athelete in the history of the world. Not to mention Lebron James, Magic Johnson, Shaq, Kobe.  The list goes on and on. I love Giannais but oh my god, that has to be one of the dumbest things I have ever read lmao."
"He didn’t collapse when LeBron challenged him.  Bron wanted to James Johnson him, but it didn’t happened, and Crowder became the Rastafarian splash-bro."

If you look at the context of our season, you would tell we were the team with the 2nd most covid protocol and injury problems, Luka had to play with James Johnson and Wes iwundu as his starters, we had a stretch where we lost 6 in a row, 3 of our starters and 2 of our bench players were out , it wasn't due to Luka, in a covidless world, the Mavs this season are atlest the 4th seed, which is plenty of good in a stacked west"

"It's not fair that you got downvoted for your opinion but you definitely glossed over a few important things with Miami since 2014. First with Bosh taking up a max slot and roster spot for a few years while his career was up in the air. Then the surprises like Whiteside, waiters and James Johnson having career years along with solid years from draft picks like Winslow, Richardson and Bam. All of that changes your needs. Specially for a franchise that is used to building through trades and FAs. To end up with a team that has the biggest in season turn around in league history and the longest winning streak in the league that season, it was unexpected. They rewarded those guys which otherwise would not leave a good impression on future FAs. Either way, I don't know what FA would be interested in joining for the end of Wades career."
Yep. It gets forgotten but Griffin and Clax have missed a ton of games the last few years.   So unless we wanna roll Sharpe or James Johnson out there for 30+ minutes sometimes someone like Millsap was needed
James Johnson??

"To get KAT and D'lo to the playoffs? Which is kinda the goal with 2 (3 with Simmons) young-ish franchise pieces.  Like its been fun slandering Ben Simmons all summer, but at bare minimum he is a supercharged James Johnson/Robert Covington on defense and the fit with those 2 definitely wasn't bad. And the wolves have the spacing to absorb him into their rotation and use Ben for his other strengths.  It's not ring or bust. Especially for a franchise like Minnesota"

"Lakers/Nets are not the sure thing everyone thinks.   Nets' depth is ridiculous. They are choosing between Claxton and old man Griffin as a STARTING 5. Their 2nd unit will be Mills, Cam Thomas, Cabarrot, James Fucking Johnson and Claxton. Yada yada super team, yada yada who guards people, this goes to shit when you have basically no depth behind them. Only Mills and Claxton/Griffin are good enough to roll single digit minutes in the playoffs and KD won't endure playing 48mpg for a whole season. Add how injury prone Kyrie is and done, the Nets are built to crumble with this 6-man rotation in the post-season. The Lakers at least tried to shore up their bench. Rondo, Nunn, Monk, Melo, Howard can hold their own enough to allow their own big 3 to rest.   I would bet on the Bucks before the Nets. Maybe even on the Hawks/Sixers. The Nets lack of anything that resembles NBA talent off their Big 3, Patty and Non-Clutch Harris is ridiculous."

JJ said on his pod (the only thing he still puts time into) he felt betrayed by the fo and couldn't imagine anyone wanting to go there.

I’m going to say the five would be…  Tim Duncan-C  LeBron James-F Scottie Pippen-F Magic Johnson-G Michael Jordan-G  My thinking is that the other 4 wouldn’t have a hard time letting Jordan be the alpha. Duncan and Pippen would play great defense and score when needed while Magic and LeBron would have no problem setting up the others instead of just scoring themselves. Plus they are all athletic and long the defense as a unit would be just as good as the offense.

Charles Barkley  I have Shaq and Kobe much higher than other people do, because I think Shaq's peak is probably top 3 all time and his longevity wasn't nearly as bad as people think, while Kobe played in an extremely tough era for a scorer and compared to his era peers was actually way more efficient than people think, plus he spent his absolute skill prime on awful mid 2000s Lakers teams  Kobe gets the nod over Duncan for me because of their equalish accolades and Kobe's head-to-head edge, while Bird gets the edge as well due to aside from 2003 Bird's peak being much more impressive IMO  I lowrank ""older"" players a bit compared to some, which is also why people like Oscar and West aren't on here  Finally, I included Barkley ironically because of what he himself hates(advanced stats)  Looking at his career, I can't really see why it's his fault that he didn't win a ring when he had to go against 2 of the people who are higher than him on here consistently during his prime and it's not like he put up bad numbers"

"I mean Stan also basically insisted on playing multiple bigs together. Like when Zion went out he started Jaxson Hayes at the 4 alongside Steve Adams. I know the roster was limited, but still. There was a game in Philly where he went to a lineup with Zion, James Johnson, Willy Hernangomez, AND Steve Adams.  That all being said, I don’t think most of the failing were schematic."

I like putting money on James Johnson or Steven Adams
"The defense mostly got better once bi and zion were injured and guys like naji marshall, naw and james johnson started games."
James johnson
"Easiest would be: Rim Running Center/Pure Scoring Wing. Examples of this are DeAndre Jordan in his prime, Andrew Wiggins. You basically have one job and other players can set it up for you.   Hardest would be point forward or all-around guard.   Examples of this are Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Scottie Pippen, James Harden.   You kinda have to be good-elite on multiple facets to be considered as effective."
"Stephen A this is why you get for removing the superior debator on the show. Max knows more boxing than stephen knows basketball but Max also knows more basketball than stephen a knows basketball.   &amp;#x200B;  Me personally I believe Max was removed because Stephen A didnt like the fact that Max defines greatness from a different perspective than the old folks. Max kept saying that kd rings meant nothing while stephen a was calling kd the best player in the world because of his rings. I believe very soon Max would start to say ""If you look at MJ's teammates and what he achieved with them a lot of other players would have won just as many rings..."" And I would agree with him because in reality the greatest of all time list should look something like Hakeem Olajuwon, Giannis Antetoukompo, Shaquille Oneal, Lebron James, David Robinson, kevin Durant but it at the moment its MJ, LBJ, Kareem, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kobe. The first list is based on who are the greatest players of all time while the popular list the second list is a nostalgic list based on who was the best player on the best team and who had the most rings.  &amp;#x200B;  The way goats are seen nowadays is stupid and Max kellerman is trying to change the narrative and bring forth reality. People call Brady the goat even though Aaron Rodgers is better but never had the better team, People call Mj the goat even though Hakeem Olajuwon was better than Michael Jordan but hakkem did not have the luxury of scottie Pippen and Dennis rodman. MJ sixth option on the bulls was better than hakeem second option. You see the goat argument that is used nowadays is nostalgic mixed with feelings and little bit of ignorance.   &amp;#x200B;  Stephen A will regret his decision forever but the truth will come out no matter what!"
I trust James Johnson in anything

"Celtics   2011 - Norris Cole (Jajuan Johnson)   2012 - Fab Melo, John Jenkins (Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo)   2013 - Shabazz Muhammed (Kelly Olynyk)   2014 - Julius Randle, Tyler Ennis (Marcus Smart, James Young)   2015 - Rashad Vaugh, Chris McCullough ( Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter)   This is a very bad team. Makes Ainge look really good if you look at who was drafted immediately after."
"Wayne Ellington, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Whiteside, Josh Richardson, DJJ, Winslow, Dion Waiters.  All of them either peaked, had some of their best years or had a resurgence and disappeared when they left the Heat.  Spo is a role player whisper, he gets exactly what he wants out of every player regardless of talent.  this is just in the last couple years."
GSW  Damion Jones -&gt; Deyonta Davis  Jacob Evans -&gt; Dzanan Musa  Jordan Poole -&gt; Keldon Johnson   James Wiseman -&gt; Lamelo Ball    I guess better with ball and worse/no change with the others?
"1.Michael Jordan  2.Lebron James  3.Magic Johnson  4.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  5.Bill Russell   6.Tim Duncan  7.Kobe Bryant  8.Shaquille O’Neal   9.Larry Bird   10.Hakeem Olajuwon   11.Wilt Chamberlain   12.Steph Curry   13.Kevin Durant    This my top 13. I’m not sharing anyone lower than 13, because I don’t want to open up other potential debates lol.  If Steph wins another ring I’m putting him at 9 probably.    And yea I think Steph is better than Jerry and Oscar, and Pedo Malone."
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
"Sure! I sometimes change my mind, because like I said, I think a lot of this is just splitting hairs.  1. Michael Jordan  2. LeBron James  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar  4.

Hakeem Olajuwon   Some notes: (1) if I listed two players, they are interchangeable and I can’t personally decide. (2) I started watching basketball in the 80s. I’ve never seen Bill or Wilt play. I don’t know how to accurately rank them but I just put them at 4/5 out of respect lol. (3) I think everyone in the 6-11 range is practically the same tier of player, with minor differences"
Lakers (guessing their starting 5)  Russell Westbrook (Rajon Rondo) Malik Monk (Lou Williams) LeBron James (Magic Johnson)  Anthony Davis (Kevin Garnett)  Dwight Howard (N/A)
"James. They’re both godly iso scorers but James is the better defender when he wants to be, even though Luka is deceptively strong. There’s a video out there of James doing 1v1 with Stanley Johnson and someone else and man, he made every bucket. Man is an assassin."
after magic had the hiv retirement. james worthy averaged 42% less points and 10% less fg%.   i always found that weird for big game 7 james. although he eas injured in the playoffs before so maybe that hurt him. but it was like 3 years and he retired. i dont think he liked basketball without magic johnson.
"The year is 2021 and the Brooklyn Nets are running their clutch offense through LMA post-ups,while playing a twin towers lineup of LMA and James Johnson"
Hard to win games when you give up an efficient 17 points to players like James Johnson
"harden had 36. not 33. free throw god is back. its a 2 point win against the magic but we're down harris, claxton, bruce brown, durant, millsap, kyrie. I'll take a win anyway we can get it when we're down that many.   james johnson was the guy who stepped up and got it done for us."
The year is 2021 and the Brooklyn Nets are running a Twin Towers line up of LMA and James Johnson.
[Magic Johnson] The Lakers look like a much better team with LeBron James on the court
"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.

Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."
"^^ This.  Know your audience, and don't assume they know things.    Months ago, on /r/nba, I made a post about LBJ and the Great Society.  I'm 43 years old, most of my sports life was before Lebron James was a thing, and people when I was in High School knew that LBJ was former President Lydon Baines Johnson.  I never thought I'd have to spell that out, I was dead wrong.    Don't assume randos on reddit know anything."
"Engaging in good faith: By my count, Simmons is clearly in the top two on 14 teams, maybe in top two in 4 teams, and not in the top two for 12 teams. By your logic, that means he is right around a top 40 player.  The list you wrote before is 42 players long, with some contention at the end of the list. That is pretty clear evidence he is a top 40 player, again by your logic.   | Team   | Best Player 1   | Best Player 2     | is Simmons Better? |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|   |Atlanta Hawks	|Young	|Collins	|Maybe |Boston Celtics	|Tatum	|Brown	|No |Brooklyn Nets	|Durant	|Harden	|No |Charlotte Hornets	|Bridges	|Ball	|Yes |Chicago Bulls	|LaVine	|Vucevic	|No |Cleveland Cavaliers	|Mobley	|Garland	|Yes |Dallas Mavericks	|Doncic	|Porzingis	|No |Denver Nuggets	|Jokic	|Murray	|No |Detroit Pistons	|Grant	|Stewart	|Yes |Golden State Warriors	|Curry	|Green	|No |Houston Rockets	|Wood	|Tate	|Yes |Indiana Pacers	|Brogdon	|Sabonis	|Yes |Los Angeles Clippers	|George	|Leonard	|No |Los Angeles Lakers	|James	|Davis	|No |Memphis Grizzlies	|Morant	|Brooks	|Yes |Miami Heat	|Butler	|Adebayo	|No |Milwaukee Bucks	|Antetokounmpo	|Middleton	|No |Minnesota Timberwolves	|Towns	|Edwards	|Yes |New Orleans Pelicans	|Williamson	|Ingram	|Maybe |New York Knicks	|Randle	|Rose	|Yes |Oklahoma City Thunder	|Gilgeous-Alexander	|Dort	|Yes |Orlando Magic	|Carter	|Isaac	|Yes |Philadelphia 76ers	|Embiid	|Harris	|Yes |Phoenix Suns	|Booker	|Paul	|No |Portland Trail Blazers	|Lillard	|McCollum	|Maybe |Sacramento Kings	|Barnes	|Fox	|Yes |San Antonio Spurs	|Murray	|Johnson	|Yes |Toronto Raptors	|Siakam	|Anunoby	|Maybe |Utah Jazz	|Mitchell	|Gobert	|No |Washington Wizards	|Beal	|Dinwiddie	|Yes"
"As a Nets fan I’m just glad KD locked in that extension until 2026. Hope that Harden does the same with his extension. That way the Nets can recover some assets if they want to move on.    Sean Marks needs to do a better job to fill out the roster. Right now 1/3 of their roster is useless the majority of the time. Griffin, Milsap, Carter, Johnson, and Brembry have been trash outside of a few moments.    Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe are Rookies. Meanwhile Claxton can never stay healthy and when he is healthy it’s obvious that he hasn’t grown his game and is still mediocre. Now you’re at 1/2 the roster.    Mills, Aldridge, and Harris are all streaky and Bruce Brown is 6’4” with the offensive skill set of a 90’s Center.   This Nets decided to go extra small building their roster and the worst part is how slow their “Bigs” are even going small. Their wing defenders are Brown, Carter, and Brembry and they’re all like 6ft to 6ft5 and provide no shooting threat. Their only taller defender was James Johnson who has been straight up terrible so far.    These weaknesses would have been covered up by Kyrie but now these players have to play out of their minds to cover the 25pts + that Kyrie would provide on the court. Nets have a legitimate need in Rebounding, Playmaking, and Shooting which is terrible.   Hopefully after December 15th the Nets will be able to make some moves with limited resources once the majority of the NBA offseason signings become trade eligible."
"I came across this recently but realized it doesn't mean much and mostly relates to a really high usage rate. Others just behind him include Magic Johnson, James Hardin and Lebron, all at or over 3.5 per game."
Our rookies played better than James Johnson and Jevon Carter. I can’t believe they’re still getting minutes.
"everyone on the warriors but moody and beli has a positive +/-, and everyone on the nets is negative except for james johnson."
James Johnson lethargic rebounding and energy cost the Nets 3 points..
Don’t tell me James Johnson is getting Harris’ minutes
"It’s like when people get drunk and order random shit on Amazon, he’s gonna get wine drunk and trade half the team.  *Wakes up*  *Reads Headline*  “Lakers pull off 10-team trade to acquire Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, (the other) Brooks, James Johnson, Tyler Herro, and Andre Drummond (again). Enough to convince DWade to come out of retirement and join the Lakers.”  “Who the fu-… Did I…?”"
"Underrated hallmark is ability to find minutes for lesser role players and have those guys excel in their role. It’s why teams uncovered gems like Bruce Brown, GP2, Juan Toscano Anderson.. the role players that probably would not shine for other teams in other situation but coaching and that situation just works.   Billy Donovan and his 3 guards line up, from OKC to Chicago gets some credit here along this line too, you just gotta make it work and find minutes for guys. Brad Stevens able to make jt work with Evan Turner and that got ET paid. Miami under Spoelstra got the likes of Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow look kinda good. Those guys production just drop off the moment they move on from Miami."
"every game with the no-KD no-Harden lineup to start the second  this time Nash put in James Johnson to make sure there's a 0% chance we maintain the lead, at least he's keeping it interesting"
"Michael Jordan,LeBron James,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,Magic Johnson,Larry Bird,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan,Shaq O’Neal,Hakeem Olajuwon,Wilt Chamberlain,Bill Russell,Kevin Durant,Stephen Curry,Dirk Nowitzki,Dwyane Wade,Kevin Garnett,David Robinson,Jerry West,Charles Barkley,Karl Malone,John Stockton,Russell Westbrook,James Harden"
"Whatever team James Johnson is on, that’s the team that’s winning."
Whoever James Johnson plays for nowadays. Nets? He could take down a few players on his own
"Was trying to name 20 point guards or ""combo"" guards better than him all time. Could only get to 18.      Stephen Curry   Chris Paul   John Stockton   Jason Kidd   Steve Nash   Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade   Isiah Thomas   Magic Johnson   Russell Westbrook   James Harden   Damian Lillard   Gary Payton   Jerry West   Oscar Robertson   Walt Frazier   Bob Cousy   Nate Archibald"
"Are the only options playing KD and Harden or trotting out Carter, Harris, Bembry, Mills, and Aldridge? The Nets immediately lose the lead and the momentum every time Nash throws those 5 out there. There's not a single PG or playmaker in there and they're *awful* on D and the boards. Millsap can't get 3 minutes of run? James Johnson? Hell, Sharpe or Cam? Stagger KD and James a bit more. Once you realize how much of a disaster that lineup is, you have to at least *try* something else."
Where is our King James Johnson?
"The best was the other game when Morris clearly elbow checked Jokic in the chest and then walked away like nothing happened and Jokic bodied the shit out of him. Then Morris complained he got hit from behind like dude that’s your own fault, you acted tough then got scared so you got your ass laid out. Euro players go way harder than the NBA. Except that one dude who used to play for heat, James Johnson I think he’s actually about the life."
"Really?  Pretty sure out of two titles late in the 2010's we drafted Kobe, Shannon Brown, Jordan Farmar, Bynum, Fisher, Ariza, Walton, and Vujacic which was most of our core role players outside Pau/Bynum/Artest.  In the early 2000s it was Kobe, Lue, and Fisher and acquired other talent through trades of players we drafted like Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.  And in the 80's Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and AC Green were all drafted by Lakers.  Sounds like we typically draft superstars to go along with a superstar that joins via free agency/trade."
James Johnson laughing at these fools
"If the family full of black belts is also the one giving out those black belts (this is how I heard he got his, I mayb be wrong), it kinda ruins credibility (unless you're like a renowned family of fighters, which they are not). Getting a black belt is not like getting a communications degree where they're basically equal everywhere.  Can James Johnson fight better than most? Almost certainly. Is his fighting ability also way overblown by nba fans and players? Even more of a certainty."
The supposed best fighter in the NBA is James Johnson and even his MMA background is a lot of fluff from what I understand.

"I find it hilarious that people want NBA players to be out of the league for fighting.      EVERYBODY in the NBA is a ""fake tough guy"", because even if they are real tough guys, they wouldnt show it, because it could destroy their career.      You think any NBA REALLY would pick a fight with for example James Johnson? I like this example, just because he would eat ""real tough guys"" alive. Literally. He could kill and eat them. Yes, especially the ""street fight dudes"" like the Morrisesessess.      But that brings me to my real point:    I know you are all really cool and tough and all could beat me up and bla bla bla. But for me, adults who get into fist fights (outside of sports) will always be weak and dumb. THE MOST EMBARRASSING are all the streetball videos on yt right now that advertise with violence.   If Basketball makes you so angry that you fight, that just means you fucking suck at basketball. If you have to run up on the league MVP to cheap shot him you do it, because youre frustrated that he\`s so much better than you. And if frustration on a basketball court is enough for you to get violent, you are child. Your brain is on a childs level.   &amp;#x200B;  THere is NO reason to even engage in fights in the NBA. I love the players who just walk away to the other side of the court. All the cool tough guys would say that they are pussy, but they are just smarter than you."
"James Johnson, heard has 4 black belts in Martial Arts"

James Johnson has a black belt and does mma on the side. Derrick rose once stayed at a hotel that was said to haunted. He ended up bunking with James Johnson cuz he was afraid and felt if there was a ghost JJ would kick its ass lol

James Johnson
James Johnson lol
The answer is James Johnson and few others. Johnson is 7-0 in MMA.
"James Johnson, a real fighter off the court"
James Johnson among current players  Bob Lanier was a great enforcer of the late 70s/early 80s.
James Johnson. Zach Randolph scared me too
James Johnson is a dude I wouldn’t mess with
James Johnson
How is James Johnson not mentioned yet. Black belt karate and 20-0 MMA record.
James Johnson has a second degree black belt and is undefeated in all 27 of his kickboxing and mma matches.
James Johnson cos he's the only guy I know has actual fighting skills and could hold his own in a fight. He has a black belt in something and he's been in amateur MMA fights I believe.
James Johnson is an actual trained MMA fighter
"James Johnson, never backed down from anybody on the court. It probably helps that he is an undefeated kickboxer."
James Johnson. Family of black belts
Why has nobody mentioned James Johnson yet?  He has a legit blackbelt
"Shocked nobody has said James Johnson, professional ass beater"
James Johnson
No one has said James Johnson? An actual certified badass!
James Johnson
He's really good at beating up women though  https://www.si.com/nba/2014/06/07/james-johnson-arrested-memphis-grizzlies
"Never said otherwise.  If James Johnson was still on the Heat, they may have a chance but otherwise...."
"Lmaooo James Johnson is the PINNACLE of a fake tough guy. I’m surprised all the bullshit he pulled actually worked to make people think this.   There’s zero record of any of his fights, his undefeated 8-0 record or whatever it was doesn’t exist. And his “black belt” is from a place where you can literally buy them"
Most people really don't understand how much of an advantage technical training is in a fight. I'd love to see James Johnson vs. Jokic's MMA trained brother. Wish he was still on the Heat haha...
Oh gosh not again. In before the obligatory ‘James johnson. Bro that dude knows MMA don’t mess with James Johnson!!!’
James Johnson
James Johnson is always the first person ready to throw down.  Zach Randolph is another one.  Just ask demarcus cousins lol
"Him and James Johnson are the guys I recall having like some amount of actual fight training, I think. I'm pretty sure West trained in Boxing and JJ some kinda martial arts."
"We should have round house kicked him away from the team after that first year, instead we gave a four year deal and i got to watch him suck ass on the court. Man James Johnson was so bad on the heat"
Unless you’re James “Bloodsport” Johnson. 20-0 in kickboxing and 7-0 in MMA.
I'd like to see James Johnson have a scrap
Gotta admit I don't know who that is. From google he's got a shit ufc record but he at least has one. There's no evidence that James Johnson has ever fought a sanctioned match.
"I think he's even a tier lower than Blake. All we have is claims from James Johnson about his record. Blake actually has quite a few documented instances where he performed standup and has made many comedic videos. Now I wouldn't call Blake Griffin a professional comedian, but I do know that he's done professional comedy work.  I'm fairly certain that James Johnson does train in combat sports, but I have no evidence that he's actually done professional work in the field."
"&gt;by his 18th birthday, he secured seven world karate titles, nine national crowns, and compiled a sterling 20-0 record as a kickboxer.   [Source](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/20/james-johnson-mma-nba-fights-blake-griffin-arron-afflalo-serge-ibaka-suspension-fine)"

"Lowry, Jimmy, Haslem, Riley, Dragic, Wade, James Johnson, the entire heat culture circle jerk is nauseating. Hated that franchise for years."
james johnson?
james johnson lookin like a 70s pimp lmao
James Johnson is 7-0 in mma.
That’s all fine but I’m pretty sure we’re talking about actual fighting. That’s why nobody fucks with James Johnson an actual mma fighter that plays in the nba. I never see Jimmy or any of these tough guys including the Morris twins talk shit to him
If you train in any real contact martial arts you know that James Johnson is full of shit. Or rather he’s probably mentioned he has a black belt in X and uneducated people run with it like he’s some kind of assassin ninja.  You can legitimately get a black belt in “karate” at the age of 9 by kicking some cardboard plates and doing some kata rehearsals. Even Judo black belts which are legitimate with years of hard sparring have MASSIVE skill divides based on tournament results in high level competition.
that James Johnson is undefeated in Amateur MMA fights
"Dude James Johnson wasn't in the gym sparring rounds. He probably punched a heavy bags a few times growing up.   He doesn't have 20 years of experience; Lillard uses boxing to condition himself in the off-season you wouldn't say Lillard has ten years of boxing experience.  I'm not sure what you think Martial Arts is but literally if you don't train for months let alone years consistently you lose alot, take this from someone who is around people who have actually been training 20+ years.   People who take even 6 months off come back and struggle against guy less experienced than them. Now imagine you haven't trained consistently at all and the guy you're fighting is a once in a lifetime athlete who happens to be 250+ and 7'1, who is significantly stronger than you.   Like I said previously martial arts isn't a video game where once you max out a stat it stays put; you will regress.   I'll say it point blank Johnson has about as much fighting skill as you probably do.   Johnson has no discernable skills that make him a threat; Jokic brother is an MMA fighter and Kickboxer I'm sure Jokic has sparred around a bit. So using the logic that he has trained and or atleast been exposed we can arrive at the same conclusion that Jokic and Johnson would be a even fight with no one having an advantage."
Idk James Johnson might actually be tough
If only the Heat still had James Johnson
"Johnson has about as much a chance as anyone against Jokic.   Johnson's whole claim is that he has racked up a undefeated record, one that isn't verifiable, and not even any state athletic commission can vouch for it.  He is a self reported black belt in an undetermined martial art.   I've been around BJJ/MMA long enough to be the first to tell you this is the hallmark signs of a faker. Johnson probably has trained a little but he probably began stretching the truth and now the myth of him being this mythic level fighter is born.   There is a certain personality trait that gravitates towards lying about martial arts and takes advantage of the misconception highly revered black belt, a black belt isn't like a prestige of something that once it attained you are privy to secret powers.  These kinds of people know that people don't really understand exactly what martials arts are or what a black belt even means. The average person couldn't tell you the difference between Judo/Jiu Jitsu/ Karate/TKD, so people spout lies that makes themselves grand figures.   As evident with James Johnson he duped the whole NBA fandom because his is unanimously regarded as the dude with a black belt that can beat up everyone on the court.   People talk about Johnson here like he is the Boogeyman.   All I'm saying is people on this sub have to stop making him out to be a superhero.   He doesn't have any advantage over Jokic like this sub may suggest, everything about Johnson is self reported and so it equal footing between him and Jokic."
Too bad James Johnson is not on the heat anymore
"So like James johnson who I think plays for the heat still.  but also weight classes exist for a reason,  so could still be iffy."
Yes and his black belt is from his father. And there’s an MMA fighter named James Johnson so the sketch records get twisted with him apparently.
“Jokic is so tough he is Serbian!” “No Jimmy is really tough they will fight next time” “James Johnson is a black belt he would kick jokers ass” like Jesus Christ shut the fuck up lol.
James Johnson would body both of them
"Idk about that one.  IMO  DFS&gt;Cam Kleber&gt;Hunter Powell&lt;Clint THJ&lt;Bogdan  James Johnson&gt; Hill Trey Burke&lt;Huerter  Gallo,Rondo, and Dunn haven't really played.   I think it's closer than most think."

I will always love James Johnson lol great reaction
"Alex Len, Stanley Johnson and a top protected 1st rounder  for  James Harden, PJ Tucker and 2 lotto protected first rounders, 2nd rounder (conditional)"
"Did any other Hornet defend James tight at the perimeter? I didn’t watch the whole game, so i don’t know. I might be wrong about this, but it seems like it’s in the scouting report to not mind Johnson at the 3pt line.   Dude doesn’t even look at the basket when he was there. I’d much rather tell my players to double the ballhandler in p&amp;r / handoff situations like that, esp when the screener/handoff-er has a slow release on his 3-pointers and doesn’t even attempt a proper roll.   That’s just my opinion, tho. I don’t think we can know for sure unless somebody shares the scouting report used for the game lol  Edit: grammar"
"For real. Guys like Portis and James Johnson are super underrated, they can fire up the whole team just by playing tough- Bucks need that. Too many games lost because of whining and frustrated iso play last couple seasons."
I love James Johnson over there dancing
&gt; James Johnson is a black belt in Karate and has a kickboxing record of 20-0 and also fought in MMA.  I'm sure you'd fuck him up.
James Johnson is (basically) the same height as Luka but if you look at them separately James looks like he'd be way taller
"I've never seen a bigger case of ""you dont want to fight with me"" from a guy who has never publically fought anyone than James Johnson.  He's All-""Hold me back"" First Team."
James Johnson is the best player on the court right now haha
James Johnson is pretty impactful so far.
James Johnson MVP for mavs this game?
James Johnson pissed at the world after getting fined 40 Gs
I kinda like James Johnson dude is all hustle all the time
"Well he’s also been injured since our second game and only played 4 minutes in that game. You gotta give him some time, James Jones killed it with cam Johnson so I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt right now."
"lol what?  Man gets paid like 18 million  If James Johnson bumped me, im milking my injury all the way to court"
"wow man you wouldn't even try to throw pocket sand in James Johnson eyes or something?  get down behind him and have your twin push james over you?  Do the Goku move versus Raditz, and let your twin special beam cannon both you and James Johnson ?"
"James Johnson is such an asshole. Sat a few rows behind the Heat bench when they were playing the Hawks once. For some reason this game, the heat bench decided to stand the whole time. A woman shouted politely asking them to sit so her son could see the game and Johnson screamed back at her “shit the fuck up and sit down or I’ll make you.”"
"They were both T'd up during the incident... James Johnson was the aggressor and the only one who did anything, yet the Mavs got a free throw. Now the Hornets get fined more too? Big lol"
James Johnson is FAKE news from the FAKE news establishment.!
"I have a twin brother. If James Johnson wanted to fight him, then I'd have to let my brother die."
"if james johnson bumped me I would say ""apologies"" and walk away fuck my pride"
Wait.. wouldn’t most high IQ ball players treat James Johnson the same way behind the 3pt line?
Isn’t James Johnson a black belt?
"No, like real training. Not just “this guy seems tough.” See James Johnson for example."
Except James Johnson.
James Johnson
James Johnson?
"He’s fighting Frank Gore, not Jake Paul lol wouldn’t even be close to the same  Either way we need James Johnson in there"
Fuck. We're turning against James Johnson now?!
Dude *look* at James Johnson and tell me that’s not a bad motherfucker.
"Heads up, James Johnson's 8-0 record has zero video or professional evidence. Not one article describes a fight of his either (there is a different fighter named James Johnson to add to the confusion)."
If Deron lets us down like Nate I say we force James Johnson to go in the ring.
"He should go to MMA after his career is over , already expressed interest in doing so. Have him versus James Johnson at some point"
"Facts. Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Whiteside, Mcgruder, Derrick Jones Jr.  We got all those dudes a nice pay above the league minimum because they actually deserved it"
"Jesus. Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, LeBron James (yes, he's a point guard)."
"Did you guys hear hes literally Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Lebron James and Giannis combined?"

"D-Wade and B-Uzoh, right next to each other where they belong.  Two fun facts: Wade's game also happened against the Nets, and both Ed Davis and James Johnson were involved in both games."
"&gt;60%+ FG percentage is heavily biased towards people that take shots in close, and field goal percentage leaders have a lot of not super impact players on it.  A shot near the rim is a tough shot to earn.  &gt;You know McHale did that once right? His next highest season average was 22.6 points per game and he also barely broke that 60% mark at 60.4% If you lower it to 24 points, or lower it to 59% then dozens of other players get in lmao.  That's just a bad point. Dozens of players have gotten close to 25 PPG on 60% shooting, Charles Barkley was ONE BASKET away, but he didn't. Think about how many player haven't achieved that.   &gt;Btw did you know only Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young have 800 games and averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals 49% FG and 30% 3P?  Why is this bad?"
yall literally had james johnson
"Giannis' career right now is better than McHale's lol  Why do you think the arbitrary numbers you set to make McHale stand out makes him seem better?  60%+ FG percentage is heavily biased towards people that take shots in close, and field goal percentage leaders have a lot of not super impact players on it.  Like is Deandre Jordan in the discussion for top 200 players all time?  He's the field goal % leader currently.   You know McHale did that once right?  His next highest season average was 22.6 points per game and he also barely broke that 60% mark at 60.4%  If you lower it to 24 points, or lower it to 59% then dozens of other players get in lmao.  Btw did you know only Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young have 800 games and averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals 49% FG and 30% 3P?  Lmfao"
"lmao i’m still on 21, i just remember a bunch of posts about how the nets bench is washed bringing up james johnson"
"How is it false?   Derrick Rose ($5.5 million), Joakim Noah ($3.1 million), Taj Gibson ($1.2 million). That's a total of $9.8 million in salary.  Mike Miller ($5 million) and Udonis Haslem ($3.5 million) is $8.5 million.  They would have had to take $433,000 less each on their first year to go to Chicago instead.  The Bulls needed to create cap space for the third guy, but even GarPax probably isn't too incompetent to move a 25-year old Luol Deng and a 2nd year James Johnson to get there."
"Dwight Powell, James Johnson (an expiring) and a 2nd round pick from the Mavs. Give us a trial run to see if he can be great with an elite PnR guy. Look at the looks Luka gets Powell and Cayley-Stein, if he can get those and inhale rebounds for the worst rebounding team in the league, that would be worth a look for the 2nd half of this season. And then if not, let him walk and we have that contract off the books."
"in a vacuum, don't think it would be a bad gamble at all for powell and james johnson, should the cavs want to take on powell's contract  the question is rather can the mavs do better with those assets"

"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
You had a playoff drought for 9 years LMAO. Your overlord couldn't even get you into the playoffs 2 years ago.   Also you have like 4-5 great draft acquisitions:  1949 - Vern Mikkelsen 1958 - Elgin Baylor 1960 - Jerry West 1979 Magic Johnson 1982 - James Worthy   Literally a pay to win team
"He hasn't been very good. Can't knock down a shot and sometimes just holds on the ball way too long without even making a move. His defense has been very good at times, but not as consistent so far, probably has to do with being out with COVID though.  One problem actually with both James Johnson and Josh Richardson is they both sometimes unnecessarily take on a responsibility to  create for others when we really do not always need that of them. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Burke are all capable of creating offense. Richardson definitely is a good passer, but we don't need him trying to ""run the offense"" from the top, he needs to move the ball and find the open man when he sees it."
We *did* get James Johnson for a reason
"Vinnie Johnson, James Edwards, and Rick Mahorn were some of the best bench players you could have too, they were STACKED"
"Then you'd definitely be getting some consideration. This Suns FO is really meticulous about any trades, the only two they have done since James Jones took over is the CP3 trade and 6 for Saric and 11 in 2019 (which led to Cam Johnson). It's impossible to know what they want to do, as their draft history of Johnson at 11 last year and Smith at 10 this year."
James Johnson could kick a couple asses.  There's a fuck ton of bad MMA fighters out there too.
"Awful take. Only person who would really have a chance is James Johnson, but he's trained."
Don't fuck with James Johnson.
It’s not that serious bruh it’s just a highlight commending a fantastic dunk by James Johnson
"Its weird to say, but Miami should of kept James johnson to help bam out. The heat really need a center to grab rebounds and defend."
"a directly related to this call but this seems like a place to discuss it - I really wonder about the consistency from these after the fact reviews, this was not called a foul on the floor but seems pretty clear and obvious that this should have been a flagrant on James Johnson.   https://twitter.com/evxz17/status/1355762695299981318  I think (hope) the majority of us understand that refs are human and reffing a basketball game in real-time with near-perfect accuracy is an impossible task. However, it is infuriating when there is a noticeable lack of consistency from the reviews.   Since the league already seemingly reviews entire games, why not publish a ""Full 48 Report"" instead of ""Last Two Minute Report?"" More transparency is good. It would allow fans to see that in fact the refs are not biased against them they call certain things certain ways consistently - see x,y,or z. However, the lack of consistency and transparency leaves more questions and complaints."
"I think Johnson matches James in terms of speed, power, and body control. LeBron is 3 inches taller, 20-30 pounds heavier, and has the edge in endurance and agility.  Calvin Johnson was a spectacular athlete, and LeBron is better than that."

"i doubt there will be a huge bidding war honestly.  not because Lowry's not good but because the teams that want him won't be super flexible in what they can give up. like Clippers would definitely want him, but the contracts they need to send out are multi-year and hefty (Morris, Beverley) and they don't have firsts or intriguing young players to trade. Dallas can do it with THJ and James Johnson but if they don't want to give up THJ then it gets murky - Powell is on a long term deal, they need Kleber etc - Nets can't do it without one of DAJ or Joe Harris that's not happening.  imo the teams with a viable path to trade for Lowry are Sixers, Nuggets and Heat. Nuggets can do Gary Harris+Millsap (unless Raptors say absolutely no multi-year deals), Heat can do two of Dragic/Iggy/Olynyk/Leonard, Sixers can do Green/Scott/Ferguson.   it's possible i'm forgetting or not considering some other team but those seem to be the likely candidates."
