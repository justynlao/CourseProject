"It's because Morris and Facu play in the 2nd unit and so our team's worst play-- Markus Howard is the PG for the 3rd unit. And that dude is the text book definition of a chucker-- at 5' 10"".  I still like Bol, RJ and Zeke and pieces long term (even if I'm annoyed we wound up with Zeke instead of Precious, Bey or Maxey)."
"As a Nugs fan our 5 worst players lineup is really fun to watch PG Markus Howard SG R.J. Hampton SF Bol Bol PF Vlatko Cancer C Zeke Nnaji  Idk if we have the best 5 worst players, but watching them check into a game is fantastic as a victory cigar lineup"

"I know, I watched the game he’s washed as hell but nuggets have given significant minutes to 3 rookies, minutes to Markus Howard who’s not at all ready for the NBA as well as the two I’ve mentioned above.   It’s not really a comparison half these guys wouldn’t make any other roster"
"Yep, [Markus Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Howard), undrafted guy on the Nuggs' roster."
I wish we lived in a universe where Markus Howard was 6”3 or 6”4....Dude was practically Steph Curry in college
"He’s so so so much worse, it’s not close. I actually watch most of the Nuggets garbage time and Howard is a ball hog, chucker and he’s far too loose with the ball. There’s a reason why our third unit is almost always outplayed and a large part of it is because of Markus Howard."
I loved Markus Howard  and Myles Powell coming out of college. This move was filthy.
"Markus Howard is 5'10, he's on a two-way contract. Monte is 6'2"
3. Markus Howard (Marquette/NCAA legend) already had 00.
Not the NCAA leading scorer for 2020 Markus Howard.   No clue how this guy averaged 28ppg in college and can’t hit a shot when he plays for us.
Ive met Markus Howard a few times and stood right next to him. He is lucky if he is 5'9
&gt;vs a Nuggets team that really needed to win  Ant was great but we most definitely did not need to win if u saw markus howard out there LOL
Markus Howard really did not have the physical tools to be anywhere near Edwards
"Marquette legend, Markus Howard"
Nice post but we just lost to markus howard
Nuggets are done. Healthy theyd be a threat to anyone but its too much now. Wouldve been funnest team to watch imo these playoffs if healthy.  Markus howard baby
We have Markus Howard we don't need them back rn
Agreed! Only if you trade Steph for Markus Howard though.
"The last Nets game we had Markus Howard, Bol, Vlatko, and Javale out there for an entire quarter"
"This should be huge, last game the Nuggets had to play Bol Bol, Vlatko Cancar, and Markus Howard meaningful minutes"
Monte is unavailable unfortunately. We'll do Markus Howard and a second.
Bol Bol  Vlatko Cancar  Markus Howard
Markus Howard
"To be fair, the Nugs were playing Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol, Shaq Harrison, and Markus Howard all double digit minutes. That’s not a recipe for success."
"First one we choked super hard  This one is just a lot of shit we're dealing with, injuries, tiredness, etc. Just happy we could compete while giving guys like Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol and Markus Howard significant minutes."
Do you even know who Vlatko Cancar and Markus Howard are? What roster lol
"Bro the nuggets were giving minutes to vlatko cancar, bol bol, and Markus Howard in the first quarter tonight.  Jokic was 29/7/6 on good efficiency. This was also a b2b. You know, those spots where all the other superstars in the league sit out and rest instead of playing."
"Yeah we're playing on a back to back and our 5th game in 7 nights with 6 out of the top 10 rotation players out, can't be mad at this loss, just completely out of gas. Shit we were playing Bol Bol Vlatko Cancar and Markus Howard against Kyrie KD lineups."
"They definitely are. Though while Nets are missing Harden, Nuggets are missing 5 of their top 8 players.  I mean Cancar, Bol Bol and Markus Howard played 50 mintues tonight. Even while 21 up never thought we were running away with anything."
That’s career high 13 point Markus Howard to you
Nuggets wasted a prime Markus Howard game wow
"And then like 3 replacements for the starters out too lol, if Markus Howard is getting serious minutes we r fucked haha"
Imagine getting cooked by Markus Howard
"At one point, Kyrie-KD were on the floor against a lineup of McGee, BolBol, Cancar, Markus Howard and Facu and the Denver lead stayed at 12 points. This wasn't one or two possessions. That was several minutes"
Markus Howard giving me J Crossover vibes (a compliment)
Markus Howard and Bol Bol were so terrifying they had to play KD and kyrie together to keep it from getting out of hand
I’m telling y’all Markus Howard has that microwave badge. This dude dropped 40 points in a half in college.
Markus Howard out here slaying KD and Ky?
TIL there is an nba player named Markus Howard
Markus Howard breakout game
markus howard getting 0 minutes?
"It’s disingenuous to point out the lakers without lebron while only mentioning Murray. Nuggets are down 5 guys. Only guards on their roster that arent out are facu-rookie, Markus Howard-rookie(3 mins per game) shaq Harrison(signed less than a month ago, and Austin rivers ( signed less than a month ago). They might be red hot because jokic is truly that good, but it was anything but a surprise. Using that game as a “it already happened” when we’re going to see Monte Morris, will Barton, and pj dozier come back for the playoffs isn’t fair to the nuggets depth at all"
"I keep saying this but Markus Howard is not bad. He didn't break Ncaa records on these very courts by luck. The man plays 2 minutes every 4 weeks, he's gonna go in there and chuck some shots.  He's probably nervous too tryna prove himself to coach."
"Posted the following yesterday. Markus Howard was at +10 MHP but he's now at +7 MHP in 105 minutes (2.4 MHP per 36). Yikes. I don't have the numbers to back it up but I think he's gotta have one of the lowest positive MHP per 36 in the league.  --------------------------  Even fuckin Keljin Blevins has +5 Marvel Hero Points.  To follow up, I looked at players with the lowest PER. The player with the worst PER is Anžejs Pasečņiks, who played 6 minutes with the Wizards and missed one 3, got one rebound, one assist, and gave up 5 turnovers for a whopping -4 Marvel Hero Points.  However, 6 minutes is almost nothing. Theo Pinson has played 33 minutes this season and accumulated -3 Marvel Hero Points, aka MHP (4 TRB, 2 PTS, 1 TO, 8 missed FG). Terrance Ferguson played 49 minutes and has -4 MHP (2 PTS, 1 TRB, 2 AST, 1 STL, 4 TO, 6 missed FG). Kris Dunn, who's almost been invisible for the Hawks in 42 minutes, has exactly 0 MHP.  Then there's Markus Howard. He has 10 MHP, but he's played 101 minutes for the Nuggets (3.6 MHP per 36). He got 33 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, 9 turnovers, 39 missed shots, and a missed free throw.  And then there's Josh Hall of the OKC Thunder. He's played 205 minutes, but has only gotten 24 MHP (good for a 4.2 MHP per 36, less than half that of the worst qualified player). That's because while he's scored 44 points, 32 rebounds, 22 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, he's also had 18 turnovers, 41 missed FGs (12/53), and 15 missed FTs (18/33). Just goes to show how badly a player would have to play to get negative."
Markus Howard very well might be the single worst player in the NBA this year.  Holy hell.  The only dude on the team I get absolutely zero enjoyment out of watching.
And then their offense is 90% Markus Howard and Bol Bol chucks
"we need them off the bench. this way we can play all three of Millsap, Mcgee, Green rather than having to play Markus Howard."
The most screen time Markus Howard got all year.
Why is Markus Howard not passing for the easy basket? I know it's garbage time but still why _wouldn't_ you wanna score?
"Players are drafted based on how they are projected as prospects, not how well they play in college. It's why Markus Howard went undrafted and why Garza will go in the 2nd round this year"
Because guys that struggle with athleticism and size can overcome that with skill in college but not in the nba. I’m a huge Marquette fan and Markus Howard is the best college player I’ve ever seen and he likely won’t cut it in the nba because he’s small and an average athlete.
Look at someone like Markus Howard. He'd cook tf out of us
Markus Howard
He and Markus Howard are like black holes on offense in garbage time lol.
"Markus Howard and Bol Bol could probably be better than those guys in a game against NCAA competition, yes"
"That’s not necessarily true. Guys that are drafted high need to have the build to develop into NBA players, they aren’t necessarily the best players in that moment against college competition. Like, Markus Howard and Bol Bol aren’t NBA bodies right now and their draft position reflects that, but they’d be more dominant against a team of NCAA players than Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman were before they came to the NBA, IMO. It’s just that wiseman and Edwards have higher ceilings than a guy like Markus Howard or skinny Bol"
"I’m talking about the median top 15 NCAA player. That team’s best players might be a little better than the worst players on the NBA team,  but the 15th worst NBA player is gonna be better. Like Markus Howard might be on that team (back of bench with the nuggets) and was the leading scorer in the NCAA for like two years, averaged 25 and 27ppg at Marquette on 43/41/85 splits, taking over 10 3s a game. Dudes like that+NBA training, conditioning and muscle mass would smoke most or all current teenagers in the NCAA.     15 trash centers is not the same as 15 worst NBA players, I think the assumption is it would be an actual team."
Guys like Markus Howard and Tyus Jones came into the league with similar haircuts and changed it up as soon as they got their first NBA check. Trae likes his hair
"To be fair that doesn't necessarily mean anything for the NBA.  Tyler Hansborough and Markus Howard are both top 25 scorers in college basketball history  And in college, a lot of the times assists tell you more about the quality of a player's teammates than the player himself.  Too much variability in skill"
Can we at least get Markus Howard back in Milwaukee?
"MVP disagrees with you. Let's see KD win a series with Facu, Markus Howard and Rivers as his backcourt."
"&gt;Dozier was playing like one of the best defenders in the league, yeah. That’s what it was. He can guard 1-4, elite on the perimeter and as a team defender, and is in nearly all of our best defensive lineups. He was a defensive anchor for us this year. Posting Dozier’s splits shows you have a complete misunderstanding of his role lol.  Bruh, you keep moving goalposts. First you said it was Barton and Dozier after Murray got injured, that was wrong. You then said Dozier started later (the wrong number of games) and that he was ""balling out"". That's a phrase that usually means scoring a lot. I get that Dozier is supposed to be a defender, if I didn't know then any of your comments about how the Nuggets are missing their top defender would be a dead giveaway.  &gt;The 2-way players are Shaq Harrison and Markus Howard, both of whom got playoff minutes. So yeah, we were giving playoff minutes to guys on two ways.  I thought I was watching the Nuggets, maybe I missed when Harrison and Howard were starters. Or why do you keep saying that you're [starting](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nwaka3/game_thread_denver_nuggets_4725_phoenix_suns_5121/h18o1fm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nvkvzx/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_defeat/h14jn17?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [way](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nrvs79/highlight_lebron_chills_in_the_backcourt_the/h0jd7om?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [players](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nmqtqa/nikola_jokic_is_having_a_historic_series_so_far/gzq9wj8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)?  &gt;If you were reading stuff from any nuggets beat writers you’d know that, burn you don’t, because your comments are totally agenda driven.   I mean, I'm not the one pretending the Nuggets are starting two way players when they're no, so I don't know how I'm the one who's agenda driven. I'm not sure why beat writers would be writing about a hypothetical rotation that will never happen, but if you have any of the articles, pass them along."
"Dozier was playing like one of the best defenders in the league, yeah. That’s what it was. He can guard 1-4, elite on the perimeter and as a team defender, and is in nearly all of our best defensive lineups. He was a defensive anchor for us this year. Posting Dozier’s splits shows you have a complete misunderstanding of his role lol.    The 2-way players are Shaq Harrison and Markus Howard, both of whom got playoff minutes. So yeah, we were giving playoff minutes to guys on two ways.  Facu would only get spot minutes (similar to Shaq’s role) if we were full strength. Rivers would not play. The healthy rotation is Murray/Barton and Morris/Dozier, maybe with some Facu spot minutes. If you were reading stuff from any nuggets beat writers you’d know that, burn you don’t, because your comments are totally agenda driven. Denver is not going to play a 5 guard playoff rotation with Gordon, Porter, Jokic, Green and Millsap also getting minutes."
"Manute bol's arms are nearly a straight line. Its easier for shorter people to pack on weight but im going to assume this player is unwilling to get bigger arms. Markus howard has pretty big biceps.  Im not talking about height, but also muscle.  If this player lifted weights, he probably would be too small to guard players and he would struglle getting open looks if he doesnt have handles. Hed a be limited to being a catch and shoot player."
Markus Howard?
Markus Howard played significant minutes that series. Markus. Howard.
My boy Markus Howard deserves a shoutout too
It doesn't make a difference. Markus Howard would probably get cooked too but he can make 3s better than him
Yeah he's actually a tier above dame. Jokic is one of the few who can make any player better than they actually are (i.e rivers facu markus howard). Dame time is good and all and he falls everytime in the playoffs because he doesn't elevate his team to another level. Playoff jokic is a different beast. Dame definitely did not outplay jokic lol
"How can blazers fan talk trash after losing to Markus howard + Austin rivers lol, you guys were pretty pathetic and dame is probably one of the biggest whiners in the league"
Jokic will have help if Murray comes back 100% and Will Barton and Dozier were injured aswell. We had to play Markus Howard stretches lol
It isn’t over yet don’t give up hope. I wanna see my boy Markus Howard back in the Fiserv.
As someone who watched a lot of Markus Howard at Marquette this performance tracks.  He's not going to do much passing.
Know it’s garbage time but Markus Howard is such a ball hog jfc
"look at how bad the defense is by Markus Howard, he just lets craig cut (more like walk) straight to the rim in front of his face lmao"
Also no Markus Howard lol
If he doesn't start he might end up only playing the 6-8 minutes that Markus Howard was getting previously.
Better than Markus Howard is not a high bar lol
i mean they'd rather play will barton instead of markus howard
"Replacing Austin Rivers, Facu and Markus Howard with Jamal Murray, Barton and Dozier would probably end games before OT lol"
We want him gone too. His attitude is inexcusable. Fucking hell markus Howard had a couple good games n made his way into the play off rotation. Bol doesn't give a fuck
Markus Howard
"Nuggets have been missing Murray, Barton, and Dozier for over a month. Their guard depth is laughably thin: two rookies (Facu Campazzo and Markus Howard) and two free agents at the time of the injuries (Austin Rivers and Shaq Harrison) are what they have with backup PG Monte Morris for their entire backcourt"
"Yeah he's hurt too, and we still don't know when he's coming back. That's why u see markus Howard fouling crowder on 3s."
All good man hope y’all can make some noise Markus Howard is my boy
Markus Howard is probably my second favorite player in the league but the Suns should be going at him every single time down. He plays hard but has little defensive IQ and is way too small to make up for it.
Can't believe that Markus Howard is in the rotation
"Jokic brought Facu, Austin Rivers and a dude named Markus Howard into the second round. That's the MVP."
"Nuggets have a few above average players right now - MPJ, Monte, AG - the problem is they are playing multiple below average players significant minutes - Facu, Austin Rivers, Markus Howard, even Millsap lol"
"Sometimes they have to. Like denver with Markus Howard, Shaq Harrison, or Austin rivers."
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
Lol. What take of mine is delusional?   Jesus christ get some fucking therapy or something.  We had the best player in the series and the better coach. We also had to play two guys who weren't in the league in April and were playing Markus Howard real minutes.
"Try to look at it this way, the main media narrative is to say ""Jokic single handle is going to win the MVP"", ""Jokic doesn't have any help"", ""Look at the lineup Jokic just won playoff series with""   Now the coach, in effort to give a compliment to his best player, impulsively says a bunch of old guys who couldn't play in the NBA when they were young men, can don a jersey as middle aged men and be competitive as long as they have Jokic.    It feeds into the narrative of minimizing the contributions of Jokic teammates. Clearly he knew as soon as he said it, it's not a good narrative to push out there. It wasn't just Jokic hitting three pointers on the road late in the game (Austin Rivers) or point guards coming off the bench stepping up to score 28 points and 22 points (Monte Morris). Many of his players are guys working hard to establish a reputation as belonging in the league. (Campazzo, Morris, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Markus Howard). Their playoff run doesn't happen nor continue without consistent benefaction from those players.  Malone's comments should be cognizant of the hard work contributions of those players to push back on the narrative to champion their cause. Malone wouldn't like it much if a player used the old Jerry Jones line during their 90s Super Bowl run, ""anybody can coach this team"".    Clearly you're a big fan of the team. Famdom doesn't give accessible  privilege of insider access to private conversations or thoughts. It's also impossible to summarize how every coach in the league is viewed unfiltered by their players where you can garner a ranking system to determine ""the most love in the locker room of any team"""
"&gt; It would be interesting if they could keep this going vs denver  I feel like this should be if Denver can keep it going against the Suns. Suns are a 2 seed for a reason, they're a damn good team. Feels like Denver is playing with house money right now (and I say this as a Denver fan). The fact that we somehow got through the first round and our injuries are to a point where Markus Howard is getting serious minutes is wild to me. I won't be shocked if the Suns crush us and I won't be shocked if we beat them, I'm just excited to watch the matchup."
even fewer that can make the playoffs with Markus Howard in their rotation
"Healthy Markus Howard &gt;&gt;&gt; Dame, and it's not really close."
Best I can do is 2 Bols + NCAA scoring champion Markus Howard
"People were donwnvoting me after Game 5, but I will say it again. This Portland team needs to blow it up, you were outplayed by a team with a guard rotation of Austin Rivers playing 40 minutes, Compazzo, Monte Morris and Markus Howard. This starts with CJ he under no circumstances can be on the team next year if they expect to ever do anything with Dame. It’s not 2019 anymore."
at this point idc who wins i’m just glad Markus Howard is getting playtime
Second only to Markus Howard
I’d rather have Markus Howard playing minutes for us
"Facu is an undrafted rookie averaging 6 points a game on the season, and Austin Rivers is the starting 2, who had been an unsigned free agent until a few weeks ago.  First off the bench is Monte Morris, 2nd round pick who is admittedly a solid guard, and Markus Howard, an undrafted rookie who is really not good by any metric.  That backcourt is also tiny as fuck.    The fact that our backcourt is responsible for winning two playoff games against y'all isn't really an indication that they are objectively better.  Lillard and CJ and Norm and Simons is 100% the better backcourt and guard rotation.  It's not even fucking close.  The fact that we have outplayed your backcourt twice is a strike against y'all, not really a point in our favor if we're talking straight talent."
"Dame has been better. While there’s certainly an argument to be made that he’s facing possibly the weakest backcourt in any playoff series of his career (two rookies in Facu Campazzo and Markus Howard and two free agents as of a month ago in Austin Rivers and Shaq Harrison) NOBODY could’ve guarded him tonight. Nurkic has played Jokic very well, and he’s been inefficient by his standards."
"I can’t believe the Blazers are struggling against a team starting Campazzo and playing Austin Rivers, Jamychal Green, Monte Morris and Markus Howard big minutes."
Markus Howard
Markus Howard has zombie eyes.
who the fuck is markus howard
Markus Howard is one of our better shooters if he plays. One of the greatest college scorers ever
Marquette legend Markus Howard
"I'm like 5 seasons in the future in 2k MyLeague.  Just lost a 7 game series to the Orlando Magic.  Markus Howard averaged 35 points a game and genuinely destroyed me.    My god, I had no idea he was real."
Markus Howard bruh
"Howard "" Jamal Murray"" Markus !!!"
MARKUS FUCKING HOWARD
Markus Howard shot selection is very questionable but he’s making them so
Imagine getting dropped off by Markus Howard
"&gt; Markus Howard went 3-14 off the bench  That's all you needed to say. If you need to have a rookie taking 14 shots, it's not looking good."
Who the heck is Markus Howard?
Markus howard plays nba minutes wtf
He'll help a ton with 3s. He'll also mean we don't have to play our 2 way player Markus Howard...
"I mean, look at Denver’s lineup.   Campazzo and Rivers are backups. Markus Howard went 3-14 off the bench. Millsap sucked. Porter was a non factor. Same with Gordon.   The entire team shot 34% from the field. That’s terrible. Denver attempted 10 more shots than Portland and got blown out by 20.   This isn’t all on Jokic by any stretch."
"Norman Powell looking like Prime MJ tonight.   Markus Howard building a house with those bricks.  MPJ got the ""I forgot I'm the second option"" disease from Porzingis.   Jokic's worst playoff game."
Who is markus howard? And why was he given the greenlight to let it fly
"Maybe run some play for him off the ball, run over the screen, something, it's a really shame Watch Markus Howard take heavy contested step back 3 and see MPJ  stopped in the corner"
"Yeah, plus Shaq harrison, also signed as a FA, and Markus Howard, who literally only played in garbage time all year and now is getting real minutes."
Markus howard got shooters
Markus Howard out here assassinating Nurkic
Nurk falling to the ground off a Markus Howard screen... Lol
"We all know Markus Howard is the strongest small guy in the NBA, look at how easily he got nurkic to the floor"
Nurk flopping on a screen by Markus Howard. LMAO
Markus Howard
and the nuggets have been playing Markus Howard who might be the worst defensive guard in the league
"I feel like Markus Howard is way better than you're giving him credit for. Dude can score in bunches, in the last 5 games of the season he averaged 14.2 pts on 52/44/100 splits. He's also been very efficient in a limited role off the bench this series."
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
"You can just go to stats.nba.com and go to the Video Box Scores, then click on Dame's 3PA and watch [all of them](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FG3A&amp;EndPeriod=0&amp;EndRange=28800&amp;GameID=0042000162&amp;PlayerID=203081&amp;RangeType=0&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;StartPeriod=0&amp;StartRange=0&amp;TeamID=1610612757&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).  This is what I found:  1. Stepback on Gordon, contested make  2. Stepback on Jokic off mismatch, contested miss  3. Stepback on Markus Howard off switch, fairly open miss  4. Open 3 off screen, miss  5. Stepback 3 on Gordon, open shot but miss"
"only nuggets with a block were Facu, Monte Morris and Markus Howard hmmmm"
I have no real dog in this fight but seeing Markus Howard get real minutes in the NBA playoffs warms my heart.  Yes I know it's because Murray is hurt but still
"for anyone else reading this chain, just to show you how disconnected this dude is from reality, he doesn't consider 2:43 left in a game to be ""2 mins"" lmfao  &gt;2:43		Vlatko Cancar enters the game for Michael Porter Jr.	104 - 125	 2:43		Markus Howard enters the game for Monte Morris	104 - 125	 2:43		Shaquille Harrison enters the game for Nikola Jokic	104 - 125	 2:43		Zeke Nnaji enters the game for Aaron Gordon	104 - 125"
"Fo real. We’re missing our starting PG and SG and backup SG, while integrating an international 30 year old rookie Facu Campazzo, former free agent Austin Rivers, and Aaron Gordon into the starting lineup and former free agent Shaq Harrison and rookie Markus Howard into the second unit in the goddamn playoffs! That’s ludicrous. But if we lose this series the narrative on this sub will be because Jokic is a defensive liability who will never win a title. Even though he’s literally played at an elite level in the playoffs his entire career thus far..."
Markus Howard 3 over much larger defender.  Giannis jumping over a human again would also be nice.
Is Facu really better than Markus Howard?  Also that’s not his first bucket Sperro
We don't. Blazers aren't that good. We shouldn't score this many point playing Shaq Harrison and Markus Howard and Austin Rivers playoffs mins
MARKUS HOWARD MINUTES THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
"TF? Malone, Markus Howard is not a 2 way player"
Where has Denver been hiding Markus Howard?
"With how small Markus Howard looks at 5’10, I don’t understand how Mugsy Bogues had a career at 5’3"
"Markus Howard was taking shots like he was Curry, he has to chill out a bit 😂. PJ is confirmed out for the series pretty sure. But Barton coming back will be huge for you guys."
"That lineup is nasty, especially considering we're giving Austin Rivers and Markus Howard meaningful playoff minutes. Facu and Monte are great, but they struggled to keep up with everything on the defensive end anyway. I'm now seeing why you guys have one of the best offenses in the league"
"Murray+Barton+Dozier.  I mean, we have two 10-day guys in the rotation (Rivers and Markus Howard). Monte Morris is just returning from injury."
It’s like he thought Markus Howard was gonna go head to head with Dame offensively lol. We’ve seen this kind of 3 guard lineup all year. At least get Shaq in for his defense and perimeter defense. Nothing else was working against Portland’s back court.  Not to mention Jokic sat with a minute left in the 3rd which lead me to think we’d see Jokic sooner in the 4th. Nope.
"I wish. I just think there’s too much firepower from Portland against guards like Facu, Rivers, and Markus Howard. I hope I’m wrong, but I see, at max, 2 cold shooting nights from Portland. Blazers in 6. Could even be 5. They miss Dozier’s defense too."
Or playing Markus Howard in the FIRST QUARTER for meaningful minutes. Did not see that coming.
"Maybe Barton wouldn’t play amazingly, but the question is really would he play better than his replacement guards, who in this game were Austin Rivers and Markus Howard. I don’t think that’s a particularly high bar to clear."
"Denver when healthy is an amazing team all around, but right now they’re not healthy. They’re missing practically their whole guard rotation, including their second best player. They’re literally starting Austin Rivers, who just got waived a few months ago. Markus Howard is now forced to play rotational minutes, and he was probably their worst third stringer this season. All their replacement guards are severely limited in one way or another and have one giant weakness, either they can’t shoot or their defense is garbage or some mix of both."
"It absolutely is, Lillard is a yearly MVP candidate and CJ is a top tier shooting guard. Them vs Facu, Rivers, and Markus Howard is a way bigger gap compared to Jokic, MPJ and Gordon vs Nurk, Kanter, RoCo and Carmelo (especially when our dumbass fans boo him for some reason which just pumps him up)  It was also amusing to see Malone play Millsap/Green against Kanter, one of the best offensive rebounders in the league while we have Javale just sitting on the bench"
People who aren’t nuggets fans don’t realize how insane it is that Markus Howard is getting real playoff minutes
"that’s putting it lightly too. Portland’s backcourt is vastly superior to the Nuggets backcourt right now. They don’t even have Barton/Dozier to put on Lillard/CJ  It boggles my mind why Malone didnt play Shaq, Markus Howard didnt have a bad game but we need more defense than offense. The Nuggets were letting Portland take warmup shots"
"Markus Howard wasnt even a rotational player until 2 weeks ago, and Austin Rivers did not have a job for months until we were forced to sign him."
And he was a positive in the minutes played. Jama is 13-2 against you all time youre deluding yourself if you think that’s not a different series.   You went against fucking Facu and rivers with Markus Howard getting a lot of minutes
Bol Bol 1  Markus Howard 2   Don't care about the rest.
Yea that was awesome two of the most wholesome guys in the league. I had Jokic and MPJ on my fantasy team and am I huge Marquette fan so i tried to catch as many Nuggets games as I could this year. Really hoping Markus Howard can carve out a nice career in Denver.
"Murray out wouldn't be so bad if we had Barton n monte starting, but they lost to facu rivers n markus Howard. I do wanna see dame succeed but any team taking him is gonna have to give up alot of assets or its gonna be a 3 or 4 team mega trade for the team getting him to be put in a winning position."
"Losing to Facu, Rivers, Monte &amp; Markus Howard definitely began the turmoil."
"Dame to the Nuggets in exchange for Vladko, Markus Howard and a second."
"You do realise Barton was a positive in his limited minutes against the Suns? More Barton and Murray minutes also mean fewer minutes for Markus Howard, Rivers &amp; Facu. I'm not saying we would've won for sure but, that changes everything."
Markus Howard
"If Markus Howard could figure out the NBA game, he could put up points in bunches. He was electric in college. I loved watching him at Marquette. Prob never get to steph curry level, but maybe Seth Curry level."
Most of the minutes were still being shared by the other starters.  Markus Howard was averaging about 12 minutes a game (off the bench) as he didn't start any games as per ESPN stats. [denver post-season](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/den)
"Nuggets weren’t just missing Murray, they were missing their whole backcourt of Murray, Barton, and Dozier. They were legit playing Markus Howard real playoff minutes"
"Lmao nuggets with Murray have literally destroyed you for years but yeah missing two starters, their best defender and MPJ obviously playing hurt to anyone with eyes didn’t matter at all.   Barton was on a minutes restriction for 2 games. No coincidence the one game Barton and Monte started was the closest but of course the soft ejection happened  They started a back court of fucking Facu campazzo and Austin rivers and Markus Howard got significant minutes lmao. Yeah they were a good team without Murray but with Monte, Dozier and Barton all in the rotation but their spacing was fucked because all had some level of injury.   MPJ was horrendous and obviously playing hurt based on the reports that came out. But sure he’s healthy because you say so  Delusional"
"Jokic played alongside Markus Howard, Austin Rivera and Facu Campazzo and won a series"
Markus Howard hopefully  He can be the next IT
"Markus Howard but, I want a pick in return."
"Well it’s kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
"&gt; Excuse himself, admit he’s soft, blame other problems and accept no responsibility?  I mean, that is Embiid, right?  Running away from interview as a cry baby when he had a shit game, not owning up to his responsibility, not talking about his _eight_ turnovers and also completely disappearting _when it mattered_, _again_. Those 2 missed free throws in the other game and now being useless in the last 2 minutes.  But well.... If you don't like him and Simmons is _this_ bad, we may include him in a trade for Millsap, Bol Bol and Markus Howard."
Austin rivers and Markus Howard are not really near caliber
"Ben Simmons for Markus Howard, ez"
"Bol isn't very good and has poor body language. I think we've given up on him tbh, even Markus Howard gets playtime"
"He was bad but Austin rivers, facu, MPJ, Markus Howard would routinely get blown by"
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up.  LMAO  Markus Howard for Seth Curry straight up.
Averaging 34/10 against Rivers and Markus Howard (and losing) is not the same as averaging 30/11 against Simmons.
"I know for a fact Trae isn't losing to a backcourt of Markus Howard, Rivers, Facu and an injured Monte."
"Another guy triggered, I stay winning.   Jokic had Markus Howard, Facu and Austin Rivers playing significant minutes in a playoff series and still won."
"I won, where do I collect my prize? And, Wiggins, Dray &amp; Oubre are all high-level players. Jokic won a playoff series with Markus Howard, Rivers and Facu as his guard rotation."
Bro Jokic was playing with Facu campazzo and Austin rivers starting with Markus Howard getting significant rotation minutes lmao. Anyone pointing to that suns series as a negative against Jokic when he had to do literally everything is a goofball.    25/13/6 with a g league back court and literally zero help dude was doing everything like what else could man do   22/7/5 on .53/.36/.85 isn’t even bad in the Lakers series.
"Bro. We were **starting** Austin Rivers and Facu, then playing Markus Howard meaningful minutes.  Two undrafted rookies and a dude who was out of the league a month or two before playoffs....."
"What about literally everyone else on the floor for the nuggets? Their only good defender is Aaron Gordon.   Rivers, Facu, MPJ, Markus Howard, Millsap, Morris were all horrendous defensively but yeah it’s definitely all Jokic."
"Aaron Gordon was the only help he had on defense. MPJ, Rivers, Facu, Monte, even fucking Markus Howard couldnt stay in front of anyone. Only center that could do a decent job when his perimeter players can’t guard anyone would be like Gobert or Bam.   Dude has never had good defensive help unlike pretty much every other big who people consider to be good defenders."
"I think Denver is mostly ok at guard with Barton, Monte, PJ and Facu. Unless they all get injured at the same time again. Markus Howard will get some more minutes also. The man is walking bucket, if he can stay on the floor defensively is another story. Add MPJ getting more reps running pick and roll, and Jamal coming back and things get crowded pretty quickly.   Schroder's attitude may be a concern. Denver plays a pretty unique style of basketball. With Jokic everyone eats and there isn't a lot of room for selfish play. Schroder will be playing for his next contract and I can see his minutes and shots being an issue for him.   I certainly don't think it's a no-brainer to bring him in."
"Markus Howard alpha dogged him right back out the door.   *I’m the long range chucker around here…well me, Bones, and Bol Bol.*"
Lol u think clippers do anything with Austin rivers and markus Howard ?
No but Facu and Markus Howard aren't exactly great players
"Yes he is lmao have you forgotten how he literally always kicks the suns ass without fail?. Of course you have suns fans have forgotten a lot after beating 3 teams with injured stars. 13-2 and it’s not a fluke  Literally look at the drop off for you once Saric went down, Jamal is 20 times the player saric is and it forced the nuggets to start fucking Campazzo and Rivers. Y’all were whining so much about Saric being out but yeah Jamal wouldn’t make a difference dude buddy. Fucking Markus Howard got significant minutes lmao. You literally lost the minutes when an injured Barton was playing I don’t even wanna know what Jamal would do to Booker and Paul shit would be inappropriate.   With all 3 of Dozier Barton and Murray playing the whole series no doubt the nuggets win imo. With just Jamal, a known suns killer, I give them a very very good chance. Booker and CP3 both play worse when they actually have to defend which they did none of against Facu and Rivers."
"Poor Markus Howard, he’s a person you know!"
I will trade Markus Howard for Steph straight up.
"and more than half of those players are going to play in the G League next season. Along with some of the guys drafted from the NCAA the year before that and the year before that. The G League will include guys like Markus Howard, Luka Garza, etc. who were towards the top of NCAA basketball.   There's more media pressure and environments, but definitely not more top level talent. Half the teams that guys play have like one player good enough to even make it to the G League the next season."
"Markus Howard? Who's this guy, I'd never heard of him.  Googled him and he's 5'10?  He any good?"
"I mean I don't want to really talk shit or anything, but we could easily just say ""the fuck we supposed to do when we're starting Facu (rookie) and Austin Rivers (wasn't on a team a month before) then giving Markus Howard (undrafted rookie) significant minutes"""
"You mean to tell me Dame averaged 34 points per game and still got bounced by Facu, Markus Howard &amp; Austin Rivers? He needs Jesus, not a trade if he wants a ring."
"Send it to the Nuggets for ""future MVP"" Bol Bol &amp; the ""next Curry"" Markus Howard."
"Rivers hadn't played in months, Facu is a rookie, Markus Howard is a 2-way guard and Monte was playing injured for the first 3 games.  If you can't beat that guard rotation, you aren't 1 piece away from contending."
"There’s basically two types of players who put up insane stats in college as seniors then don’t get drafted or are picked late. Either extremely unathletic, post scoring bigs like Garza, or very short guards who just spam 3pt shots like Markus Howard. Neither type can succeed in the NBA, mostly because their offense isn’t that great relative to NBA competition, and their physical shortcomings mean they are terrible on defense."
Players with mediocre stats are usually freshman with high ceiling.  What you said reminds me of Markus Howard
"Jeez. This narrative around Blazers and Dame has to stop.   A full strength Blazers team consisting of Dame, CJ, Nurk and pretty solid role players in RoCo, Norman Powell is somehow better than Nuggets who were forced to start a backcourt of Austin fucking Rivers and an aged rookie in Facu. Give me a fucking break.   Unknown entities like Markus Howard were balling out against Portland lmao"
"Yep, he won DPOY as a guard while matching up against guys like Jalen Brunson, Markus Howard, Shamorie Ponds, and Myles Powell"
"But Shaq said he is most talented high schooler he seen. /s   He is the worst Markus Howard at least started trying his hardest, both of them were just chucking shots in garbage time last season. But Howard towards the end changed his ways  probably realized that 3-6 pts means nothing if he run and guns them."
"Bro lmao he can't do what Jokic does. Sure, they're both slow, but Bol is weak as fuck. He's had his shot, multiple times. He just appears disinterested and plays terribly. Look at Markus Howard, he spent basically the entire season playing garbage time, except he proved he can be effective and earned his minutes, becoming a part of the rotation for the playoffs. Bol Bol is unplayable. He doesn't have a true position, he's too slow to play forward and too weak to play center. Other than shoot and maybe dribble, he can not do anything at an NBA level."
no markus howard and rivers this time
Monte wasn’t 100% either.  Literally our top 4 guards were all out or hobbled. That’s why facu and Austin were starting. And shaq Harrison was seeing minutes. And Markus Howard.   Two 2-way guys and 2 guys signed like a month before the playoffs we’re getting serious rotation minutes all at the same position.  “Just Jamal” Lmao.
Remember Sam Vecenie saying Markus Howard was one of the ten best shooters in the world when talking about him pre draft
Carsen Edwards and Markus Howard are the biggest flamethrowers I’ve seen in recent years

"Markus ""Markman"" Howard"
But was this a performance from Markus Howard where he dropped 30+ in a tight overtime win against the thunder in the preseason?
Howard Markus
Markus Howard
Markus Howard the Duck
"Idk I feel like 100 ducks wouldn’t be able to organize an attack and would be super easy to incapacitate. That plus the fact that you could take tons of duck bites before you’d be unable to fight back yourself.  But yeah 100 Markus Howard would fuck you up. Too intelligent, especially if they could use weapons."
"Markus Howard, like a smaller Michael Porter Junior. A Michael Porter Junior Junior if you will."
"Denver's starters were the bench. Blazers second team couldn't get over Markus Howard, Compazo, and Cancar"
Shit Markus Howard looked like MJ out there
"#Yes, just dont have Jameer Nelson, Muday, Barton, Monte Morris, Campazzo, Rivers, Markus Howard, Wilson Chandler, and Murray defend perimeter."
"&gt; no, a backcourt of Campazzo and Rivers is not a good team  You forgot Markus Howard, aka Michael Porter Jr Jr."
well jokic has brought a team with markus howard and rivers starting to the 2nd round tho
"We were starting Facu, a rookie, Austin Rivers, someone who was out of the league a month prior, and playing Markus Howard, an undrafted rookie who has an argument of being legitimately the worst player in the NBA, significant minutes.   So I don't get what you mean by ""push narratives"". It's an amazing feat no matter what playoff team it was"
"He’s funny because he was impressive in his short minutes late season. Then he was terrible in summer league/preseason, and then last night he was awesome when he played real NBA minutes. I think he’s just a system player. Plug him in next to some good players and he’ll step up, but he can’t do much when sharing the floor with the likes of Bol Bol and Markus Howard."
"I was originally more of a college basketball fan than NBA, and in college they rightly include regular season + post season. Does this mean that UNC's Tyler Hansbrough has more points than Marquette's Markus Howard? Yep, I thought he was a punk at the time, but Hansbrough led his team to a lot of victories and so he got to play more often. I don't see this as a penalty for Howard but rather a hard-earned accomplishment of Hansbrough... same logic with NBA IMO."
Lmao Markus Howard is a coveted defender? You're tripping dude. He's only in the league because he's a decent shooter
Clear sign of a trap game   Markus Howard hitting 8 threes confirmed
"That series combined with the 1st round loss last season. The poor guy must be thinking ""How could they have beaten us with fucking Campazzo and Markus Howard when we beat them the last time without Nurkic?""  Shit must have wrecked his mind so bad."
Must have been traumatized when a healthy Blazers lost to Jokic and a bunch of rando guards like Markus Howard in the 1st round last playoffs.
"Worse backcourts? Not many. Worse *defensive* backcourts? Tons and tons and tons.   The nuggets weren't even the worst defensive backcourt in that series lmao. Them not being scorers or stars doesn't mean they're easy to score against dude.   Like Dame is a hell of a lot better than Markus Howard, but Howard is way harder to score on. He's literally a defense only guard. Also Facu ain't a bad defender at all. In fact he's known as a good defender - he just can't switch at all cause obviously he's tiny."
Lol twolves k love. Talk to me when kevin love drags Markus Howard and Austin rivers to round 2 in the playoffs.
"&gt; Duke Zion was easily a top 25 player in the world  These were the 25 highest scorers in the 2018 season. Harden, PG, Giannis, Embiid, Curry, Booker, Kawhi, KD, Lillard, Beal, Kemba, Blake, KAT, Kyrie, Donovan, LaVine, Russ, Klay, Randle, LMA, DeMar, Luka, Jrue, Conley, D'Lo.  Players not mentioned: LeBron, McCollum, Vuc, Jokic, Butler, Simmons.  He's definitely not easily a top 25 in the world.  &gt; There is also zero chance Montrezl averages 35 points in college.  Guys like Markus Howard averaged 28, Chris Clemons 30, Doug McDermott 27, Jimmer 29. In his prime, full grown man strength Trez could definitely hit 35. Most NCAA centers are twigs, they need time to gain mass, Trez would eat."
"Bol has a longer way to becoming a rotation level defender than Markus Howard. I personally love having him as a hype man in blowouts and just as a quiet, mysterious, slender-man chilling on the bench, but there have been more than enough occasions to make me think he does not vibe with the team or Malone much at all. While I would be happy shipping him out for anyone big and remotely competent as a rim defender, even Jordan, we did have Javale log a billion DNPs in the playoffs last year.  No one will ever be Mason Plumlee :("

It worked tonight but I think a lot of it is that Denver didn't have their full wing rotation. Jokic's playmaking is going to be back in full force if/when Barton and Dozier are back. It's clear that Jokic just doesn't have the same chemistry with Rivers and Markus Howard
"Wait, that's THE Markus Howard?"
Did anyone have Anfernee Simons and Markus Howard playing meaningful playoff minutes?
"Markus Howard, I'm gonna need you to step up bud. Thanks."
Markus Howard got his first NBA check and got his Trae Young hair done
"Markus Howard is getting play now, during the fucking playoffs.  I asked in a game thread earlier this season why he wasn’t getting run, and the reply was, “literally unplayable”.  Just glad to see it, he was great to watch in college."
Markus Howard was an absolute BUCKET in college
Markus Howard has a very aesthetically pleasing game
Wow nice by Markus Howard
Man do I hope Markus Howard can carve out a career. He’s such a fun watch.
Markus Howard babyyy
Markus Howard is kinda nice.
Markus Howard?????
Markus Howard is a playoff rotation player in Denver backcourt.  That says a lot about the injury situation...
"You're a moron. Did you even watch the game? Jokic played 17 minutes. AG played 12 minutes. MPJ played 15 minutes.   They had Markus Howard play 32 minutes, Shaq Harrison play 21 minutes and fucking Vlatko Cancar (WHO?!) play 17 minutes. Do you genuinely think they were trying to win this game?"
"The Blazers have played really good recently. Definitely true that they have been the luckiest team, their record shouldnt have been anywhere near what it was when Dame was singlehandedly clutching wins out of his ass for the first part of the season without Cj and Nurk.   Its a different story now and over their last 12 games or so they have the best net rating in the league.   Nuggets are missing Murray, Barton, Rivers and Dozier (who is very overlooked and underrated, Denver's best perimeter defender)  It just might be too much for the Nuggets, i mean they will be playing the early games with Shaq Harrison/ Markus Howard on playoff minutes at the guard spots. One is an undrafted rookie and the other is a two way contract who wont be egligible for a two way even after this season."
Known defensive stalwart Markus Howard is gonna bury him
"Idk, why would it want to make Markus Howard worse? Just following your lead"
If a genie gave Markus Howard the body of Shaq and shooting of Curry could the Nuggets sweep the Trailblazers?
MARKUS HOWARD
"Markus Howard squeaking by with that game high in the last game of the season. Won’t be his last though, dude is a scorer"
Markus Howard
You seen Markus Howard tho 🪣🪣🪣🪣
"You don't think carrying a squad that gives legitimate minutes to guys like (no disrespect) Shaq Harrison, Facu Campazzo, Markus Howard, and Vlatko Cancar to the 3 seed is carrying?  We lost our second best player, another starter in Barton, and our 6th man in Morris, not to mention Dozier who is one of our better defenders (ALL GUARDS) and we still kept winning, if that isn't carrying I'm not sure what is."

"Players always want to win, especially guys who don't get many chances. You can bet Markus Howard is going to play his heart out today."
It is not going to be Bol Bol.  Lakers legend Markus Howard is going for 50.
Markus Howard 30 piece incoming.
Markus Howard 30 piece incoming?
Just play him in the 1st quarter to get his triple double while dropping dimes to randos like Markus Howard and Vlatko Cancar.
"Yeah, they’ll put in Markus Howard for 40 minutes to make sure they can’t score/s."
"I'd never heard of Campazzo, but check out Markus Howard highlights at Marquette. He can light it up and I'm glad to see him get some chance in this league."
Markus Howard &gt; both
"Markus Howard was the only thing that made Marquette basketball worth watching for most of the last decade, but goddamn he was fun to watch.  Between him and JTA, it's been a fun year to follow MU boys in the pros"
"Tough for rookies to win it, but I believe in Markus Howard"
Markus Howard 👀
"so did Denver, I’m not sure what this guy is trying to say with the Nuggets “going in at full force” against the Pistons. Markus Howard and Vlatko Cancar started. lol."
I mean I wouldn’t say we’re going full force when Markus Howard and Cancar are starting both only have played like 3 games with real pt. It’s just that jokic doesn’t want to miss games. And Jokic not trying at all
Markus howard
