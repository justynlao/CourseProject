"besides ours:  Yves Pons, JT Thor, Sharife Cooper, Cade Cunningham"
"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
"Looking at their roster on NBA.com Pat Bev is better than Kyle Anderson, John Kochar, Sean McDermott, Sam Merrill, Yves Pons, Xavier Tillman, and Ziare Williams. He’s a better role player than 7 out of 11 guards/forwards. So yes, it simply is true"
"You also have the next one lined up in Yves Pons. What a big factory Memphis has become - Tillman, Tillie, Pons"
Yves Pons super blocks not getting any love
I loved Yves Pons in the draft since I thought of him as one of the two best defenders in the entire draft behind maybe only Herb Jones. He’s been incredible on defense so far and I’m thinking that he lasts in the league in he can shoot like 30%+ from 3. His defense is so good that I think he sticks in the league for a couple years regardless but the 3 ball will really determine how much he’ll be able to make in the NBA.
*Beware the Yves of Pons*
"Sorry Ja, gotta make a roster spot for Yves Pons"
it was the Yves of Pons
"[This is Yves Pons, btw.](https://i.imgur.com/NAV1338.jpg)"
Yves Pons is incredible.
Summer league gods  I want Yves Pons to be good so badly

Yves Pons sounds like the type of guy that sells death sticks on the down low
