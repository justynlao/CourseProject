I'd say like Trae and Mikal Bridges would be kinda close. Doesn't have to be an all star.
He is already better than both of them.  Instead of Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges he plays with a bunch of bums.
If the Suns wanted to get on the John Collins rollercoaster and the Hawks wanted to get on it Mikal Bridges doesn't have the upside but he's healthy and probably defends and fits with Young and Capela better.
I seem to remember Mikal Bridges holding him to 16 on 20 shots
"I'll throw out a few names. C. Wood if he comes back and plays like he did pre-injury. Terry Rozier at least in the convo imo. Maybe Julius Randle. Mikal Bridges if defense was valued as much as offense though his offense has also improved. Lonzo because free throws and more threes? Chris Boucher? Trent Jr? Richaun Holmes? Long way of saying no, right now Grant seems like a lock."
"The Jazz got wrecked (specifically by Hollinger the most) for signing Favors. I can't tell you how many times I had to read that you shouldn't allocate your MLE to a center. And yet the Jazz stuck by their guns and it paid off, so their FO will get no credit for staying steady and doing things strategically. Yeah maybe not executives of the year, but how do you build a championship roster in a year? It's a stupid fucking award honestly that eliminates all context.  Like I said though, I'm not taking credit from James Jones and what he's done, because it's been extremely impressive. But I think a player like Mikal Bridges is a huge part of what ya'll are doing, and he doesn't figure into the EOTY conversation at all because you already had him. Should James Jones not get credit for snagging him earlier than this year?"
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"In fairness, people also very mad shat on the Sixers for that same Mikal Bridges trade at the time. There was plenty of cross-shittery, depending on your stance."
"We shat on them for the Dario, Cam Johnson, TJ Warren and Mikal Bridges trades but they improved their spacing/shooting with each move.  Now theyve got a good supporting players around their offensive core and they’re good."
Mikal Bridges good call
"Every time someone mentions X player is playing pretty good this season, 9 times out of 10 dude is averaging 40% from 3.   Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nicholas Batum, and even Jeff Green are all averaging above 40%.  Frank Kraminsky is averaging 42%.  Even Kent Bazemore.  Come on."
Butler is averaging 20/8/8 and I feel like that's pretty reflective of his impact lol  G: Conley  G: Mikal Bridges  F: Josh Hart  F: Draymond Green  C: Rudy Gobert
"Careful, Mikal Bridges might read your dumb comment and reach his long-ass arms from Phoenix to wherever you live and smack you upside the head"
mikal bridges 5x on the 1st team and 5x on the 2nd team
Mikal Bridges is a Lebron Stopper confirmed???
"Yeah, Suns fans need to watch out. I remember when Mikal Bridges said he was going to be a Sixer for life."

"Booker is still talking when he bounces the ball to the ref. He pretty clearly said something bad because Mikal Bridges had just been looking at Booker, then looks away, then after he hears something but before the 2nd tech whistle is blown, he snaps his head back to see who said whatever was said."
"Mikal ""Mikal Bridges"" Bridges"
we also got roasted over the trade that got us Mikal Bridges on this sub
I was pretty in the bag from the start.  When Mikal Bridges hits his first 3 of the night the Sun's win 75% of the time.
Don’t forget about zhaire smith and a Miami first for Mikal DPOY 15ppg 66ts% Bridges

One time before his rookie season I said hi to Mikal Bridges in a Chipotle in downtown Phoenix. Nice guy
Mikal Bridges
MIKAL BRIDGES
Darío Saric and Mikal Bridges were undoubtably the MVPs of this game. I will not be taking any questions at this time.
God I love Mikal bridges
Mikal Bridges.
Glad we trade Mikal Bridges so we could try and find a star. Dude is a stud.
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges, baby"
Someone tell the commentator that Mikal Bridges and E'Twaun Moore are different people and always have been.
Shoutout mikal bridges
Mikal Bridges has to be a top 5 3&amp;D player in the league right? Although I think that’s actually limiting his skills
"Mikal Bridges is one of the two guys who is both long enough AND strong enough AND quick enough to guard him, along with Ben Simmons.  Luka has a really difficult time playing against both of them, which is why he routinely struggles against the Sixers and Suns"
"My first team all defense would be RuDPOY, Miles Turner, Simmons, Mikal Bridges, and   ##DORT"
Jamal Murray aka Mikal Bridges defensive instructor
No disrespect to Jamal but Mikal Bridges is levels over him defensively. So is like tons of more guys in this league
That's a weird way to spell Mikal Bridges
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
"Mikal Bridges has given Luka trouble for this exact reason, he’s all over Luka when they play."
"Yeah true, the only reason I think it's a bit more is that they literally did have Mikal Bridges but then traded his rights for the rights to Smith.   So at the very least they could've had Bridges, who is starting and playing very well for an elite team this season. Having him instead of Danny Green out there (assuming everything afterwards played out the same way) would be a pretty big upgrade."
The 76ers passed up on both Mikal Bridges and SGA for Zhaire Smith (who has played a total of 143 NBA minutes and isn't even in the league currently).  I guess they did also get the 2021 Heat pick that they used as part of the Tobias Harris deal - though they may have been able to just use one of their own picks in that trade.
Is Mikal Bridges a truly elite defender? I've only seen a handful of Suns games this year. His wingspan is ridiculous. But really he's stuck out to me as a deadly shooter more than anything else.
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
"Ntilikina over Mitchell/Bam, Knox over SGA/Mikal Bridges, Toppin over Haliburton. Just stop it already, both franchises have missed badly but for Knicks fans to shit talk us about missed draft picks is just hilarious, y’all have no room to talk."
"Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are mature young guys, same with Jevon Carter.    I think Anthony Edwards has all the potential in the world, and KAT is an Elite talent.   They are worth keeping.     But everyone else is not good for the Timberwolves, including Malik Beasley.    It doesn't matter how many points you put up, if you character isn't gonna help the team. It would be smart to trade him.    Trade Rubio to the Clippers for Lou Will, T Mann, and Daniel Oturu"
Mikal is so underrated  (Almost said Bridges lol which would make things confusing given the teams playing rn)
people really don't watch games and then try to say mikal bridges and saric are our star players because of on/offs and all-in-one stats that use on/offs lmao. it's embarrassing.
"Chris Paul has been the constant presence through the first 30 games (only missing one so far), so obviously he's probably the biggest reason. Booker and Ayton are the next group that's been a big reason why.  But personally I think Mikal Bridges improving on offense has been a real x-factor for their winning. The addition of Crowder and the continuing development of Cam Johnson go with that too. When those 3 wings are locked in on both ends, the Suns are almost unbeatable."
"If you use your eyeballs, it's pretty obvious this is not the case. Not saying he's Mikal Bridges out there, but he doesn't get hunted in PNR or anything like he's Enes Kanter."
"all-in-one stats turn people's brains into mush. i got downvoted yesterday for saying that booker is a better player than mikal bridges despite having worse all-in-one stats. people have no clue how to contextualize these, the discourse around them is just bad."
Phoenix have been a baldy run organisation for a while. But they probably didn't want to spend the money on him especially since the drafted mikal bridges. Plus that other wing who the reached for last season.
" &gt;	Two defensive centers - Gobert and Ayton.    Really understating how much better Gobert is than Ayton. Guys like mikal bridges and Cameron Payne are inexperienced, while Joe Ingles, Bojan, Derrick Favors, Jordan Clarkson all have experience."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"Chris Paul deserves credit for making them home court contenders, but not playoff contenders. A lot of people argue that differential is a better indication of how good or bad a team is and Suns were actually [8th in the west last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2020) having a positive differential for the entire year. Their starters were really good but their biggest problem was their bench and lack off backup PG. They got Cam Payne who played awesome and capped off their season with that 8-0 bubble run. Take this along with the natural progression of young players (Booker, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson) and pretty good veteran additions (Jae Crowder, Galloway, Moore). If they had the same team as last year I think they would have have been fighting for 8-6th range instead of the current 5th-3rd range. Chris Paul turned a borderline playoff team to home court contender."
"I love Chris Paul and I think he deserves a lot of credit, but not necessarily as much credit as some people are giving him. There is a strong argument that differential is a better indication of how good or bad a team is and Suns were actually [8th in the west last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2020) having a positive differential for the entire year.

Not a bad team. Not necessarily saying you called the Suns a bad team in this situation but I know a lot of people have."
Not with two Mikal Bridges out there!
I can't believe I forgot Ben Simmons and Mikal Bridges for on ball.  They are probably better than Aaron Gordon.  Gordon would be like 7th.
"Sorry I wasn't clear : Draymond, Giannis, AD as 4's HAVE to provide some rim protection as part of their off ball responsabilities, Draymond can do much more, but part of what he's asked to do is rim protect, which will always make him more valuable then a wing defensively.  If I include bigs, there's no wing/perimeter players on that list. Like yeah Mikal Bridges or Jayson Tatum provide great off ball D for wings, but the value of that is way way way less important than what Draymond provides"
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"The back end of those picks, 25 on, could be good. But I’d still rather have the PHL package if it was indeed Simmons, Thybulle and 3 firsts (plus swaps obvi) because I think PHL’s back end picks would have a better chance of being bad. Embiid has a pretty solid chance of aging poorly. He’s incredible now but I could see injuries sending him to an early retirement. In addition, I expect Harden to play out his career in BKN and his game looks like it’ll age well. But Philly is (love my city BUT) not exactly a destination. I could see Harden bolting for LA or MIA in two years had he come here.   People dog Simmons for his fit with Embiid but building around him alone would be easy. Next year you flip Wall for more shooting/depth. You use all those picks to draft Mikal Bridges/RoCo types to build around Wood and Simmons and I think literally in one year you’re good again and you still have potentially game breaking picks coming middle of the decade. KD and Harden’s games will age gracefully together up there, Kyrie obviously is a wildcard but he’s the youngest of the three.   Shrug, just my 2.0."
"Not only that, but Mikal Bridges has been playing really well too."
"Frank Kaminsky is, but only when he passes to Mikal Bridges."
"If you paid any sort of attention you’d know that the Hawks have been ravaged by injuries this season more than any team not named Portland. I know this is hard for you to accept but when the players that the front office spent $30+ million for in the offseason combine to play a total of half the games combined its going to affect their record. Bogdonavic hasn’t played. Gallo has missed half the season. Deandre Hunter, by far their best perimeter defender and a 17 ppg scorer, has missed half the season (this would be the equivalent of the Suns losing Mikal Bridges). Kris Dunn, one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, missed most of the season.  I gotta say this is both funny and weird coming from a Suns fan. You’d think a fan of Devon Booker, a player who’s finally making his first playoff appearance, would be *more* understanding after hearing years of “Booker is an empty stats player”.  Think about it this way. This year will be Booker’s first season in the playoffs. Do you think every season prior to this year he was an empty stats, non impactful player? Or does he finally has a half decent team around him? Honestly think about it. Which one of those scenarios is more likely to be true."
Look at this guy not even mentioning Mikal Bridges lmao
"Mikal ""The Warden"" Bridges is here to lock all y'all best players up"
Cedi Osman??! Lol  Mikal Bridges is Prince
"I’m not feeling great. Ben Simmons is playing great, so a lot of homers in my sub are saying, “Thank god we didn’t trade him, fuck Harden!” But Harden is playing like a top 3 player right now. Ben is playing like a top 20 player. To me, that’s worth surrendering your draft control for the next five years (your window anyway) to pair two top 3 players together.   Anyway, missing on Harden is just the latest in a comedy of errors going all the way back to forcing Hinkie out. In summary:  1) Force Hinkie out 2) Hire the Colangelos 3) Trade draft capital to move back into the first round to take Andres Paschecniks (out of the league) 4) Trade a FRP to move up (with your biggest rival) to draft Fultz.  5) New GM because your last bad one couldn’t stop making fun of his own players with fake Twitter accounts. But first, your coach will run the draft! Proceed to draft the perfect 3+D wing, Mikal Bridges, a senior from a championship team. Wait, nope, you’ll trade him for a total project who’s now out of the league. 6) New GM proceeds to liquidate remaining assets for the wrong players: Jimmy and Tobi inbound 7) Despite being the wrong players, you’re now pot committed so it’s time to pay up for Jimmy because you need a real guard initiator/scorer. Nope. You let him walk and sign a washed big man: welcome to Philly Al Horford. Oh, and let JJ walk because you want to save money on tax. Snag Josh Richardson for Jimmy who will promptly prove his 3-pt shooting was a flash in the pan. 8) Owners clean house because they don’t like how their own mistakes taste. But welcome to Doc and Morey who will try to make this roster work, without having sufficient draft capital or decent contracts to trade.   Being a Sixers fan is fun! But hey, at least Embiid looks like a top-10 all-time big man. There’s that."
"""Quote all the stats you want, I have my biases and don't care whether my anecdotal points are based on fact or just narrative and personal preference cause I can't find tangible evidence why Booker is better than Lavine. I also won't accept any other evidence because I have no answer for them and i'll resort to ""shaq tautology"" of ""ringz erneh"" - IsnautIgor that's what you sound like lol  The Suns were 26-39 (13th seed) last season before the bubble hot streak btw lol they were going nowhere until they brought in help in CP3, Deandre Ayton, Jae Crowder and the improvement of Mikal Bridges. Lavine has never played with anyone even close to the caliber of CP3, a guy who brought a team thats supposed to be tanking to the playoffs.... so you tell me who's the main reason the Suns are doing well this season lol"
"Right! I think about this once a week.  And I'm not even a Philly fan.  Imagine Embiid, Simmons, Jimmy Butler, and Mikal Bridges. Plus... whoever."
"I feel like an abused spouse. Like, I'm afraid that if I start to trust again that the team is just going to hurt me. I can't even bring myself to the mental headspace to accept that this team is legitimately good.  Also, I just fucking love mikal bridges. I was amped when we drafted him and I'm so happy he's panning out. He gets some respect but I feel like he's still pretty underrated."
"Mikal right now for sure. He's such a good defensive player and as the stats show he's been better offensively. His 3 point shooting is seriously underrated. If MPJ isn't even scoring as well or efficiently as Bridges, there is 0 argument for who is better right now.   If you're building a team of course, it makes sense to bet on MPJ's potential. But for me, he makes lot of mistakes defensively and I would feel more sure with Bridges on my team since I view neither as having 1st option potential, and think MPJ has fringe-2nd option potential."
Mikal Bridges I pretty much know what I’m getting every night from him. MPJ is way too inconsistent.
Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith absolutely awful as well
Give me:  Middleton  Ben Simmons  Mikal Bridges  Haliburton
I'd go  Dame/Jaylen Brown/Mikal Bridges/Bam Adebayo/Myles Turner  Bench: Gary Trent/OG/George Hill/Dwight Howard
Bam Adebayo   Larry Nance   Mikal Bridges   Joe Ingles  It's defense floor spacing and maybe the biggest one is getting a big who can really playmake and destroy defenses for blitzing Dame off the short roll.
"does it bother anyone else that there is a Miles Bridges and a Mikal Bridges in the NBA and they are 2 years age difference, and they are both 6'6""?  Both first names have only a difference of 2 characters, other than that, they are the same.   It just seems like they should be brothers"
"Right now? Batum is playing really good defense and hitting 45% of his threes. (Frankly, I cannot believe how much better he looks this year)  Middleton has always been one of those guys.   Royce O'Neale is one of those guys.   KCP  Justin Holiday.   Mikal Bridges  Slowmo Anderson.   Devin Vassell is going to be that guy.  There's plenty of guys who are both a significant plus on defense that can also hit threes at a pretty solid clip.   Gary Trent's defense is not on that level yet."
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Steph Curry  SF: Devin Booker  PF: Mikal Bridges  C:Bill Russell
"Suns have Ayton and Mikal Bridges who can be frustrating to watch on offense on certain nights, however they make up for it on defensive end."
"&gt;but how quickly we forget that the Kobe/Dwight/Nash Lakers were supposed to be a super team  And you apparently forgot that both Howard and Nash were traded to the Lakers, not signed -- and the latter was for two firsts and two seconds, one of which became Mikal Bridges.  That was one of the worst trades in Laker history.  The Howard trade only wasn't terrible for the Lakers because of Bynum's injuries and, emotions, I guess."
"Whichever team has better momentum leading into the playoff. They're both such good teams that are hard to seperate, I might give the advantage to Phoenix tho since they're far better defensively and I think Mikal Bridges could be the X-Factor that decides the series."
I really thought they were gonna steal Devin Vassell from us dude would be perfect for them off the bench wings would have fits having to deal with Mikal Bridges then see him checking in to clamp em up too.
Lonzo  RJ Barrett Mikal Bridges  AD Jokic   Two superstars surrounded by decent perimeter shooting and good defense 🤷🏽‍♂️
"No idea how good his defense is but he gives me major Mikal Bridges vibes. Hard worker, can knock it down and plays his heart out. Guys who'll be in the league for a long time."
 Mikal bridges 5 times
I mean sun's have mikal bridges dude has like 10 foot arms he can possibly help vs jazz
They need players like mikal bridges You know solid defensive players who don't need the ball to get Value
"1: bojan - (bench) mikal bridges - (cut) OG 2: Khris Middleton - (bench) Fred VV - (cut) Lavine  3: Halliburton - (bench) Gray Trent - (cut) Lonzo  4: kuzma- (bench) KCP - (cut) Carmelo 5: Dame - (bench) CP3 - (cut) - Kyrie  This was really tough. Number 2 and 5 were the toughest. Middleton and FVV have proven themselves as being able to play in high leverage games. Lavine probably has the highest upside but is just not as proven.  Secondly, I think Kyrie just has to be the odd one out as he would be the last one I would want on my team as you just never know what he’ll do. For instance this year he just didn’t show up for 7 games. The nets had harden and Durant so they were fine, but if you’re team wasn’t as talented and was depending more on him?? Yeah. Not great."
A lot of NBA fans don’t fully know Mikal Bridges yet but I hope the Suns have a chance to show out for a big crowd because a lot of people will know his name.
Mason Jones on Mikal Bridges this season
It’s close but I don’t think Mikal bridges is “way better” than DeAndre Hunter
Mikal Bridges
I get sad every time I see Mikal Bridges on Suns jersey knowing that we had him and traded him for Zhaire and late 1st 😭
I'd like you to meet Mikal Bridges
"While Book + Luka Makes a very big guard lineup and gives a team two playmakers that can do everything offensively, they would suffer horribly defensively.     Neither of them are great defenders and both generally rely on using their size to switch and defend guys that won't shoot, so that better wing defenders can guard whoever the attacker is on the opposing team.    Suns would need to rely on Mikal Bridges even more than they do now and wouldn't have Ayton to anchor the paint. They'd probably have to keep Baynes, who is good, but generally relies on drawing charges rather than defending the paint; which will be more vulnerable with Book/Luka getting blown by every once in a while.    They'd look like early James Harden Houston Rockets, but presumably with more movement in Monty's .5 offense."
"PG - Luka, Trae, Suggs, Ja, Brogdon  SG - Beal, Lavine, Mitchell, Shai, DeAndre Hunter  SF - Tatum, Brown, Ingram, Emoni Bates, Mikal Bridges  PF - AD, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Zion, Sabonis  C - Jokic, Bam, Wiseman, Embiid, Gobert"
Mikal Bridges is so LONG
Mikal Bridges.

Not hard when Luka is defended by Mikal Bridges and Chris Paul isn't.

"lets look at it in order  * why the fuck would you put spida on the pg position? he’s score first priority   * mikal bridges and donovan, while good talents, its just bad synergy  * who tf puts josh hart @ sf? is it because of his rebounding?  * bam and kat, while good talents, its just bad synergy even if they should get along on paper (bam is a defensive playmaking big and kat is purely offensive elite stretch 5 big but no effort in defending)  to sum it all up, nice collection of talent but horrible synergy. A good coach and a good system could probably make this work"
"Fuck it.   Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton"
"Not a star yet, but Mikal Bridges is on his way."
Luka will always put up awesome stats but I'm not sure there is a player in the league that makes it tougher on him than Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges was under McD, but as I understand it it was actually a Sarver decision."
The Ty Jerome pick/trade was highly praised whilst the Cam Johnson pick was lambasted and not just by Suns fans. Was Mikal Bridges James Jones as well or Mcdonaugh's last hurrah? James Jones and Memphis have cornered the market on older prospects.

Mikal Bridges is a beautiful man
Mikal bridges is a great on ball defender but he’s not too good at anticipating and getting over screens.
"Yeah but they gave up a first round pick and that could be anything, it could even be Mikal Bridges!"
This pick was traded for a lot of good players. And then there is Mikal Bridges
"&gt;The 6-11 Miami Heat don't own their own draft pick. It belongs to...the OKC Thunder, unprotected of course.  &gt;In 2015 the Heat traded their 2021 first round pick to the Suns for Goran Dragic.  &gt;The Suns traded this pick to the Sixers in 2018 to move up and take Mikal Bridges.  &gt;The Sixers traded it to the Clippers in the Tobias Harris trade.  &gt;And then the Clippers traded it to the Thunder for Paul George.  &gt;With the team ravaged by Covid, the team has dug themselves into a hole that will be difficult to recover from, and Sam Presti is rubbing his hands together.    Commenting to come back to this when the playoffs start. Say hi everyone"
Didn’t he do this a month or so ago to Mikal Bridges?
Have you guys seen how big Mikal bridges mouth is? He can stuff 5 hot dogs at the same time
Or on Mikal Bridges https://twitter.com/FOXSPORTSAZ/status/1340143732994224129?s=09
Im pretty sure I watched him do it to Mikal Bridges earlier in pre season but I’m not 100% sure it was him
Stole Zhaire Smith from em for the low low price of Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
literally any good young player. I like mikal bridges
"25 on the Suns is Mikal Bridges. If you don’t know, you will soon :)"
All my homies like Mikal Bridges.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is so good too
I'm bout ready to give him away for Mikal Bridges ngl
Mikal Bridges is *the* 3 and D player
"Yes, behind the help of Finals MVP Jevon Carter, DPOY Mikal Bridges, 6MOY Cam Johnson, and Backup Point Guard Chris Paul, anything's possible"
He's been in a funk the whole season. He's missing shots he always makes. He's missing layups and midrange shots he alwayyyys makes. His 3 pointer has never been special but he has always had the ability to make tough layups and midrange is his bread and butter and is always at the top of free throw percentage. I'm sure it's a mental thing at this point since he looks frustrated by the way he's playing. Also a sign that it's mental block at this point is his free throw percentage taking a big dip. Or are you going to tell me the better players around him have made is free throw percentage take a hit? Everyone on the team seems to be struggling offensively except for Mikal Bridges and Cam Payne.
"is 2017 really deeper?   2018 is luka trae ofc but there's also JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Ayton if you go in lower tier player but still very good you get Shamet, Mikal Bridges  even the second round is  stacked w/ Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, De'vonte Graham Shake Milton or Gary Trent Jr  there's lot of work to be done but imo 2018 will be an all time great draft"
Mikal Bridges
"Ben for Mikal Bridges, who says no?"
"Mikal Bridges and Jae are pesky and tenacious on D. And it’s def not the norm for him, gobert usually eats Aytons lunch - but the one game this season we played them Ayton outplayed Gobert. I would hope our next matchup against them goes differently"
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Those last two weren't even our picks. We traded them on draft night to Boston and Atlanta  You did miss drafting Mr Sesame Seed over Mikal Bridges
Add Mikal Bridges 😏
Mikal Bridges too
"Cavs, but Larry Nance Jr is better than Drummond. Could also make the argument for Randle because I don't see how his playstyle possibly translates to a strong team (which has always been his issue).  Sneaky answer right now is also Mikal Bridges on the Suns"
Mikal Bridges. Time to build an annex cause Mikal Jail is overpopulated.
"Mikal Bridges deserves a shoutout in this conversation, Gary Harris too"
"Dude watched two other ball hogs get signed by the team, was relegated to a 3rd option after an All-NBA/Most Improved season, and played for a dipshit GM and owner. Him leaving got us the pick that eventually turned into Mikal Bridges. There should be no ill will whatsoever."
Mikal Bridges &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kelly Oubre
Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson
"Jay Wright knows how to coach his guys up. Its shocking that Nova guys are not drafted higher. Most have the attitude and work ethic that will make them decent/good in the NBA.  And Eric is no exception. I have always wanted him and Mikal Bridges to be drafted by the Jazz. While Hart and Brunson have not been super great, I wanted them, too."
"Yeah, pretty unfair people always give him shit for being drafted before Mikal Bridges"
"shouldn't that have been expected with more more chefs in the kitchen now with the addition of cp3?; i would think that explains a slight dip in ppg more than some sort of ""regression"" or falling off.   he's still at almost the same efficiency he's just getting 2 less shots up with cp3 and the emergence of mikal bridges (~10 fga this year and only 6 last year). ideally it's something like 24-25ppg from booker, ayton and cp3 with like 14-15 and then mikal continues with his 13.  but i'll admit, i'm not watching y'all unless we're playing so i'll take your word on it over me box score watching"
Where is Mikal Bridges man? Suns missing him.
Mikal Bridges
"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"
"Who of Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges amd Royce O’Neale is a 1 or a 2? Because all three are among the most guarded-by-Dame and guarding-Dame.  Simply, they are all top perimeter defenders who get put on the greatest perimeter threat. That’s why they guarded Dame - not because they’re PGs. These three were also (last season, Mikal has dialled it up now) meh offensively, spotting up in the corner. And that’s why Dame guarded them - even though he didn’t play a minute at SF in any of those games.  This is all to illustrate the “who-guards-whom-determines-positions” is nothing but a way to legitimise heightism and nothing like how modern NBA defences nor offences are structured.  Defensive strategy is based on assignments, not positions. Positions are a thing on offence. Best defenders are set on most dangerous offensive players. Lesser perimeter defenders, especially ones with outsized offensive roles, are stuck on the corner shooter in the hope they don’t have to defend. No NBA coach will just go: PG-on-PG, SG-on-SG etc. in every game they play."
Lmao this isn’t even a debate. This is like debating “would you rather have Lebron or Devin Booker and Mikal Bridges”
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Mikal Bridges and Ayt... wait actually it’s Cam Payne
That team is STACKED lowkey. Chris Paul Devin Booker Mikal Bridges. That's great
Mikal Bridges Jaylen Brown Christian Wood SGA Jerami Grant
On the other hand Mikal Bridges has picked up the slack
"Mikal Bridges, CJ, and Batum"
"I think through a ton of trades, one of those lakers picks ended up being Mikal Bridges. I’ll take it"
"Mikal Bridges, hasn’t missed a game yet"
"I wish OG and Mikal Bridges would get more recognition. They're just as good, if not better defenders, but get less hype than Dort. idgi"
"Okay, but would you rather have mikal on his salary plus all the shit you gave up for Harris or tobias on his contract? Pretty clearly you'd probably rather have SGA or Bridges and all the extra shit. That's all I'm saying."
"Brett Brown wanted Zhaire.   Mikal Bridges, MPJ and Shai were all around that range, really rough move."
"its not Philly trading away mikal bridges for basically nothing, but it isn't great. that said, people knew hayes was an Uber bouncy project player."
Monte Morris   Kcp    Mikal Bridges   Crowder    Boucher
mikal fucking bridges
"Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges are more impressive IMO, but Boucher def deserve some cred"
I never want to see Mikal Bridges’ face again.
"Seth Curry, Mikal Bridges, Duncan Robinson, and Lauri Markannen."
Mikal Bridges - next question
Pj and mikal bridges twins 🤨
At the moment I have no one to name honestly  Edit: Mikal Bridges and OG
They also took Mikal Bridges.....but thank you (coming from a Suns fan)!
"Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo, Josh Hart, Eric Paschall."
Mikal Bridges
"The first person on the Suns to get 30 points this year was Mikal Bridges.   They have 7 guys currently average 10 or more points (Crowder is 9.9 but fuck it round up). And that’s also while playing the slowest pace in the entire NBA.   Ayton’s scoring will go up as he develops more chemistry with CP3, but at the moment he is just playing within a slow paced offence that has a lot of mouths to feed."
Whatever Charlotte PG you think is worse between Ball and Graham   Jrue Holiday   Mikal Bridges   Tobias Harris   DeAndre Ayton
"This one was pretty well earned, Donovan Mitchell got absolutely raked through the coals by Mikal Bridges."
Less of a focal point of the offense but his defense is actually impressive now. Doesn't make full use of his physical tools consistently to establish position early and would rather take mid-range shots + the emergence of Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson and the rest of their FA signings like Crowder &amp; CP3 having more plug and play potential. He could easily be a 20/10 guy but I'm not sure he wants to do that and would much rather contribute in ways other than scoring.
"It seems like we have been a lot more focused on getting Mikal Bridges or Jae Crowder the ball. The last 2 years, we have had the idea that we constantly need to feed DA, but this year he has taken a huge leap on defense... and been a much smaller part of the offense as a result. I think he is doing more this year to contribute to winning compared to before."
I never thought Kings would be good come end of the year cause they dont have the players to be good.  When you look at Suns Booker and CP alone makes them good thats not counting the many other good ass players they  have.  Funnily enough Booker isnt even their best player currently. It's fucking Mikal Bridges. I seriously hope they make playoffs this year.
"I love Devin Booker but I just don't see the potential in this team. I don't like that their big move was to go after a 35 year old with an extensive injury history. I don't see Paul playing almost every game like last season because that feels as rare as halley's comet.   Even though the Suns have had a strong start, I am still very skeptical because A) they started strong last season and B) there is an argument that Mikal Bridges has been their best player this season. While Bridges is a baller, Booker needs to be this teams best player and he hasn't been that."
"While I'm at it, here's who I think for the West:  * Nikola Jokic * Paul George * CJ McCollum * LeBron James * Brandon Ingram * Mikal Bridges * Anthony Davis * DeMar DeRozan * James Harden * Luka Doncic * Steph Curry * Kawhi Leonard"
"He has a very similar guarding profile to Dame - ideally the weakest perimeter player on the other team. But more flexible to taller players if that's the least dangerous matchup. I had a look at their top-15 respective matchups (based on [NBA tracking data](https://go.nba.com/bo3c)) by minutes played last season.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want one, but to avoid an even longer wall of text, here's a summary (these are sums over the top-15 defensive assignments for each, positions from wikipedia):  * Luka spent 34:29 on PGs, 40:55 on PG/SG, 11:53 on SGs, 27:43 on SG/SF, and 52:36 on forwards who aren't even part-time guards. That is far more time on only-guards at 86:17 minutes compared to 52:36 on only-forwards, or about 64% more time on only-guards than only-forwards. * Dame spent 55:38 on PGs, 43:33 on PG/SG, 31:46 on SGs, 10:56 on SG/SF, and 36:21 across three different forwards who aren't even part-time guards. More time on players who are never-PGs than only-PGs. * Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both top-15 lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. * Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens. The only difference is that one is taller so the coach maybe has more flexibility in picking the more suitable guy to guard.  Also, this ""you are what you guard"" concept is a mess of a circular argument. But even if that is applied, Luka is certainly more of a guard than a forward. And since he's a guard, he's also clearly playing at on-ball/point rather than off-ball/shooting guard."
Mikal Bridges. That is all
Mikal Bridges
As a Knicks fan who wanted them to pick Mikal Bridges over friggin Kevin Knox. He is the suns best defender and just plays his role so well
"Assuming full fitness and like 95% appearances.  Curry, PG13, LeBron, KD, Gobert/Bam/AD could probably do it.  You'd still need a stacked bench but something like  Van Vleet, Mikal Bridges, Covington, Crowder, Claxton/Allen should be enough shooting and defence.  I didn't go for Kawhi - because of appearances even when fit.  And I prefer PG13 compared to harden with a LeBron ball team.  Aside from that the teams only major weakness is a lack of high Volume efficient 3pt shooting off the bench aside from Van Vleet. So someone like Norman Powell could work.  I also think you could probably get it to work on a reasonable salary total say 165 mil for nets and warriors totals. You'd have had to draft amazingly for it to work but: Zion, Doncic, Bam, Tatum are all on rookie deals this season. So that is like 40 mil for 4 all-stars. Add in 40 mil for lebron and 45 mil for steph to take it to 125 mil. You then have like 40 mil for 7 guys.  Crowder 10 mil  Bridges 5 mil  Brunson 3 mil.  Then you have 22 mil for a centre another good wing defender, an elite 3pt shooter and probably another great defender."

"Well as much as someone can rightfully hate the man, he definitely had a part in turning the Suns around. He trusted James Jones, wanted to get Monty, lets them have full control of the roster moves now, is not afraid anymore to spend money for players, and he is investing millions into the stadium and training facility. Not to mention he is the sole reason we have Mikal Bridges. So yeah, if he stays like this then I like our chances"

Mikal Bridges is an untouchable
Mikal Bridges kinda cute
Mikal bridges has a beautiful smile nh
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
"Mikal Bridges. Such a well rounded 2 way player and he’s playing big minutes on a contender. I was also surprised how active he is in the Suns offence, he doesn’t create too much but he cuts hard and keeps the ball moving and Paul does a good job of leveraging his activity in the offence."
"It’s not like he’s not an all star? Plus he’s getting paid at a super max. Obviously the Jazz could not afford to lose him. And rn, the Jazz are doing great bcuz bogdanovic has been on an absolute rampage.   I have guys like Jrue holiday/Mikal bridges/ Tobias Harris/ demar Derozan as much more underrated."
take out caruso and put in mikal bridges
Just wanna say when we talk about wings who can guard 1 through 4 or  whatever that usually means they can do it in spurts/switches. Mikal Bridges does it every night and usually his assignment is to take on the best opposing guard and hes incredible at it. His defensive ability is wild
Mikal Bridges had a bad game perhaps even terrible. Maybe GSW had a game plan to score on him on offense.
"I mean off the top of my head they praised CP3 for savviness in drawing a foul call on a mismatch with Looney and praised Mikal Bridges for that pump/fly-by on Wiggins. They're constantly praising the Suns' shooting night, throwing in bucket by bucket stat updates. What more do you want lol"
I agree but honestly you guys are a tougher matchup for the lakers than people think. Mikal Bridges and Aytons defense are gona be key to winning but either way the Suns are not gona be a cakewalk for LA
I mean by abusing the hell out of the prompt.  PG- Trae/Ja/Lamelo  SG- Luka/SGA/Herro  SF-Kawhi/Mikal Bridges/Dort  PF- AD/Zion/TJ leaf (need a minimum salary guy)  C- Ayton/Jaxson Hayes/insert minimum guy  &amp;#x200B;  Boom below salary cap and most definitely an all time great team.
[Lebron James dirty push off on Mikal Bridges (pre-season)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BRipIAgitDc)  Speak for yourselves Lakers fans
"Idk if it's only bc I watched us beat the Suns last night, but   - Devin Booker: for as much as he hates the double teams in the summer) he's reached a level of superb ability where, like kobe, all the shots he takes are these difficult, contested, on-his-own-pace jump shots that SOMEHOW float in. It's pretty fuckin impressive - Chris Paul: I sound like a total dork but his passes are so fucking beautiful every time. This man is only like 6'0 throwing PERFECT live dribble passes to the weakside while being contained by his own teammate, the other team's guard, and the 7 footer guarding his teammate. And when i say perfect i mean shot pocket every time! AND HE DOESNT EVEN TELEGRAPH IT LIKE A CHUMP!  - Mikal Bridges: Idk how but he makes layups like his contract is based on layups made per game. Long ass arms and he just doesn't seem to EVER miss em (maybe it's the pickup baller in me that's only impressed bc I've missed my fair share of layups)"
Mikal Bridges has been really rubbing it in our faces that we picked Knox over him whenever we play
He does for us a lot of what Mikal Bridges does for you guys
Imagine if the Knicks had MPJ or Mikal Bridges. I KNEW Bridges would be a great 3 and D guy and was so surprised the Sixers traded him and Knicks passed on him for Kevin Knox. I can understand MPJ but Bridges would have been great
athleticism: cp3 turning back the clock would be nice    skill: mikal bridges with upper level offense skill would turn him into a top 20 player   size: uhhh 6’8” dbook would be nasty
Damn the Suns got 2x 1st-round picks &amp; 2x 2nd-round picks out of a 37-year-old Nash  3 of the picks didn't amount to much but the 2018 1st-rounder became Mikal Bridges.
"If this is to say AD was the main reason we won, I agree lol. He's a matchup problem for the Suns. Ayton can't hang with him at all currently.   Mikal Bridges is the truth though. Jesus he's gonna be good in a few years."
"That Mikal Bridges fake-relocate-drill play happened in two seconds, I think. Absolutely gorgeous. Goes on to show how insane these NBA players are."
Imagine how much better the Knicks would be if they took Mikal Bridges. Or Philly if Elton Brand wasn't an idiot
NBA TV had CP3 and Mikal Bridges moms on. Mikal's mom is hot daaaum

**MIKAL BRIDGES REVENGE SERIES**
"And I didn’t say Thybulle deserved to be there.   It should be Mikal Bridges, and probably will."
Mikal Bridges gotta be in there somewhere
"U gotta be trolling, right? Mikal Bridges, Oladipo or Jrue Holiday dont play better defense than Wiggins?"
The 76ers would win games 75-50 if they kept mikal bridges
And it hurts because we should’ve drafted MPJ being he in the essence of a trust the process draft pick but instead we opted for trading mikal bridges who is also the perfect fit on our team for zhaire smith who almost died of a sesame allergy
"All those negative things you just said about him are probably accurate...and yet he still works everybody except Simmons and possibly Mikal Bridges (jury is still out there, but he finally conquered Dejounte Murray by posting him up this year).  I think that either next season or the season after, Luka will get into better shape.  This should help his free throws and transition game especially."
"Smh disrespect for our God and Savior, Mikal Bridges"
Was going hard for Mikal Bridges. Literally anything would’ve been better than what we ended up with. Bridges had a great game vs us and Knox never leaves the bench
"Nate won. But the best answer is Luka, Zion, Bam, Mikal Bridges, Lonzo. Or maybe replace Bam/Lonzo with Murray/Turner."
"Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Ben Simmons, Myles Turner. Two guys who are great ball handlers in Murray and Simmons, great scorers in Booker and Murray, and some lockdown defense from Bridges, Simmons, and Turner."
"Who won: Chris. This feels like the best combination of roles. True playmaker, two defend-and-defer guys who aren't useless on offense, pure scorer, and a two-way guy. Malik's team is gonna be ass on defense, Simon's team is alright but a little weak defensively (with Simmons being the only average or positive defender on the whole thing), Nate's team has worse spacing than the 2019-2020 76ers, Sasha's team is solid but I have serious doubts about a Trae/Fox backcourt due to defensive issues, and there may be too many mouths to feed on offensive.    What I would do with the same graphic:   PG: LaMelo Ball, $2  SG: SGA, $3  SF: Mikal Bridges, $1  PF: Zion Williamson, $5  C: Bam Adebayo, $3."
I’ll give mine first   $5 Doncic   $5 Tatum   $3 Bam   $1 Mikal Bridges   $1 Lonzo  I think I like the first team best. This also reminds me to update the one I make with prices like this this off-season because a lot of these price values woof
"No way Mikal Bridges is 6'6"""
"He's (6'5) taller than Royce O'Neal (Jazz) and one inch shorter than Mikal Bridges (Suns). I'm sure there are a lot more examples, and it seems (very brief research) like the average small forward is about 6'7"
"Mikal is so much better on offense comparing them is laughable on that end. In my opinion Bridges is a better on ball defender as well, but even if he wasn't Thybulles defense is no where near good enough to put him over Mikals offense.   You didn't really provide any justification for ""disagreeing heavily"" with me besides your unfounded opinion."
Doubt he will ever be a better role player than Mikal Bridges
"Chris Paul   Devin Booker     Mikal Bridges   Torrey Craig   Deandre Ayton   Yes, I just listed the Suns starting 5"
I don't want to say new appreciation. But I was general shocked to see how long Mikal Bridges wingspan is. When this man is in a defensive stance he can easily touch his ankles lol
Mikal Bridges is the only other player that I've seen bother him like that. Kawhi when he's locked in as well
Mikal Bridges he deserves a ton of credit to the suns success
"On the defensive end, maybe, but not offensively. Bridges has shown the ability to take defenders off the dribble, pull up for midrange shots, and generally create offense for himself. In addition to being an exceptional cutter and finisher. Plus he's shown playmaking chops...it's not an exaggeration to say Mikal has all-star potential just off his offense."
Mikal Bridges. Never hear a word about him.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"Philly fan? Don't disrespect me like that, I am a Raptors fan.  Thybulle defensively is good enough to be in the conversation for second-team all-defence. Is he a lock? I don't think he is, as you can make an argument for other players at the guard and forward spots to be over him such as but not limited to Jrue, FVV, OG, Mikal Bridges, Covington, etc as well as Thybulle not playing starter minutes (but he has balanced this out with playing more games than a lot of others players in all-defence talks) and the Sixers already having two other players who will certainly make all-defence in Embiid &amp; Simmons which can have voters leaving him off their ballots entirely. But to suggest he absolutely isn't good enough to be in the conversation is just ridiculous. The only reason Thybulle is even playing is because he is so good defensively that even while being one of the worst offensive players in the league he is still valuable enough on the court just off the strength of his defense. I suggest you watch some Sixers games especially when Thybulle checks into the game."
MIKAL BRIDGES
More angry mikal bridges please
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges activated Heavenly Father Mode in OT, dude was omniscient"
Mikal Bridges wanting a DPOY so he pulled a stunt in OT. And Ayton as well
Mikal Bridges just dominated OT on both ends harder than basically any player I've ever seen
Mikal Bridges
Great point but let me offer you a counter point:  Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal “Reed Richards” Bridges
Mikal Bridges just ended the game by himself.
Pictures of Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are gonna be in the nba dictionary under “elite 3 and D” when it’s all said and done. Change my mind
Mikal Bridges
Mikal fucking Bridges.  That is all.
Mikal Bridges made so many winning plays in OT that it boggles my mind. He is so goddamn good already.
mikal bridges takeover
Mikal Bridges
"Going to overtime was totally worth it to unlock Super Saiyan Mikal Bridges. Jesus Christ, what absolute domination there.  GG Cleveland. I like the promise of this team, which is great since I plan on buying season tickets next season."
If Mikal Bridges isn't on an All-Defense team this year I will riot
Mikal Bridges
mikal bridges said fuck this we gotta play tomorrow
i am starting to think that this guy is pretty fucking good at basketball. not quite at mikal bridges levels yet but maybe if hr ontinues to grow
Mikal Bridges.
"All the conversations about Booker and Paul, while such little mention of the team having DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, and Cam Johnson all playing extremely good basketball is what's truly been funny. This team has an elite supporting cast around their top 2.  I think that is the reason Phoenix does not need two guys, and I think CP3 brings a bit more to the team and that is reflected in the impact metrics. If Booker goes down, you trust CP3 to pick up the scoring or get a guy like Ayton more shots and more involved. If CP3 goes down, you lose a great defender and your main playmaker."
Ayton and Booker both saw a decrease in their stats in both raw numbers and FG%  Mikal Bridges improved by 4ppg and had a + .04% on his 3-shot  You know why they're winning? CP3 and Jae Crowder.  Homegrown my ass lmao
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"You're joking? Leaving aside Klay with injury, there's still Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart, mikal bridges, Covington, Danny green, OG Anunoby off the top of my head."
"Every move he made was the correct decision.  &gt;intentionally drafted seriously injured players  Draft Embiid ✅  &gt;traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday  For Nerlens Noel, and a pick that became Saric, who was part of the trade for Butler ✅  &gt;traded a rookie of the year MCW  Traded him at his absolutely highest value, received what was technically the Mikal Bridges pick. ✅"
"I suppose but I think guys like Mikal Bridges and Danny Green can fit anywhere.  They have proven that regardless of who the coach is  or who is setting them up, they can take and make threes and play high level defense at a high rate.  For Bullock I have no doubt about his shooting.  He’s like Joe Harris in that it translates anywhere it’s just the defense I hold skepticism on."
"It's a great idea to bring up, but your criteria are too loose.  &gt; Average defender: this one is tougher to define because defense stats can be often misleading, so I'm gonna go by eye test and my general opinion while trying to be as unbiased as possible  Don't ever go by ""eye test"".  Just use Defensive RAPTOR from 538.  For my list I'll only include players with at least +1.0 rating (top 100 defensive players this year) with 500 minutes or more.  &gt; Above Average 3pt shooter: the player must be above ~35% 3pt% for the 2021 season, and attempt at least 3 3s a game on average  At least three 3s a game is good, but 35% is too low.  We're not looking for average shooters, we want good ones.  I'll use 37%.  These guys fit that criteria this year (in order of Def RAPTOR rating):  1. embiid 1. batum 1. crowder 1. christian wood 1. Gay 1. covington 1. melton 1. anunoby 1. p George 1. connaughton 1. muscala 1. randle 1. kleber 1. Green 1. jrue holiday 1. Leonard 1. royce o'neale 1. Finney-Smith 1. Korkmaz 1. Niang 1. Mikal Bridges  Considering that 5 of these players are making over $20 mil a year, it's hard to classify them as 3 and D players people would be talking of filling their roster to complete it, but theres still good names there.  Randle is the only questionable one on the list because this is the first year hes been good defensively and/or had a decent 3pt%.  But if he can turn around one, why not the other?  Christian wood is also someone people might scoff at, but this is his 2nd year in a row of a good defensive RAPTOR season and makes him 2 for 2 when he gets non-garbage minutes.  Additionally, here's a list of players who just missed the 3pt requirements (either in % or attempts):  1. campazzo (36.9%) 1. cam johnson (36%) 1. neto (2.6 attempts) 1. bazemore (2.5 attempts) 1. vanvleet (36.7%)  You're obviously still right there aren't many, but considering most people are thinking of a swingman (SG, SF, PF) for a 3nD player, it looks more like around 15 players (including those from the ""almosts"") aren't making tons of money and could be considered a swingman.  And the list would only get smaller if we limit to players with consistently good defensive seasons or 3pt numbers."
and we have the best one  MIKAL JAIL BRIDGES
We need a 3 and D like Mikal Bridges. Let’s offer 20m per year.
"Kleber, ingles, tobias, and batum at his age are all terrible defenders cmon bro  List also needs torrey craig, jaymichael green, mikal bridges, bacon"
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
"Give me Mikal Bridges, OG, and Jerami Grant from that list."
"Last year we were solid and young, got hit by ayton suspension. Young guys got another year to develop, everybody got a second year in montys system, filled out the roster with guys like Jae crowder, cp3 tied it all together and brought them to the next level. We’re a top 5 defensive team and a top 10 offense. Cp3 and book kill teams on the pnr, team is filled out with good catch and shoot wings like mikal bridges, can Johnson, crowder"
"Suns fans where you at?  We all know Book is wet, and CP3 is the Point God, but the real best player on the team is none other than Mikal “The Warden” Bridges."
Any team with Mikal The Warden Bridges is a winner for me.
4/7 continents are connected by land.  Mikal Bridges the other 3
water covers 75% of the planet surface  mikal bridges covers the rest
Yeah luckily we have Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder this year instead of Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges.
His name is Mikal Bridges.
"That's not true. CP3 is a huge part of our success and no one will dispute it. We love him. It's just dumb when people say he single handedly turned our team around because it disrespects the improvement of Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Ayton, Jae Crowder impact etc. We just want our whole team to get credit for what they are doing"
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
Mikal Bridges
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5. Steph Curry  Honorable mentions: Chris Paul, Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, James Harden  **Rookie of the year:**  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Tyrese Haliburton 3. Anthony Edwards  **Sixth man of the year:**   1. Jordan Clarkson 2. Jalen Brunson 3. Joe Ingles  **Most improved player:**  1. Chris Boucher 2. Mikal Bridges 3. Christian Wood  **Coach of the year:**  1. Monty Williams 2. Quin Snyder 3. Mike Malone  If there's any specific questions about a ranking or omission, I can add that in the comments."
"He started off the year really well but then struggled for not after getting covid. Lately he's been back to himself and playing really solid basketball. His 3pt shooting is as advertised and his defense and ability to drive to the rim are way better then anyone expected. Mikal Bridges took the biggest leap this year, and Cam took a leap as well. Overall a really like Cam as a player, he was definitely worth his draft spot"
And Mikal Bridges scored 0 points
"But seriously yes.   I’ve watched every suns game the last 3 years. I watched the suns be a shit stain of the NBA. A complete dumpster fire would be a compliment.   The Suns are a top team. With back to back Ws against the nuggets and jazz, 2-0 vs the leagues top team (for now), Ws against the Bucks, the 76ers, the Blazers, and the leagues best road record, an 8-0 bubble record, AND FRANK FUCKING KAMINSKY?   of course they are contenders.   Devin Booker has been embarrassing every single fucking defense this year with midrange mastery.  Chris Paul is State Farm.   Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.   As an AZ sports fan, the real test comes in the playoffs where AZ sports always fall short, unless it’s the Phoenix Mercury or 2001 diamondbacks.   You’re god damn right we’re contenders."
"Mikal Bridges played 20 minutes and did almost nothing. 1 shot, 3 defensive boards. That’s impressive.  Also, Booker neutral, Paul and Ayton big time positive plus/minus"
As a Jazz fan I'm scared and a little embarrassed there is a Jazz fan commenting who doesn't know who Mikal Bridges is. He's a very good and important player in the NBA.
Mikal Bridges has long ass arms
Along with Mikal Bridges
"What decides potential? Because Mikal Bridges has already shown he is top tier starter in the league. The only thing others may have him on him is handling/playmaking. But that only matters if they’re some of the best at doing this, whereas Mikal is already one of the best 3/D players"
"I'll take one Mikal Porter Bridges Jr, please"
Mikal Bridges
"Nova products have been great lately. Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Eric Paschall, Donte Divencenzo, Josh Hart, Omare Spellman’s played some fair minutes, Saddiq Bey, Arcidiacano’s in the Bulls rotation.   All players from 2016-2020"
"Fair enough, I think in terms of potential Rj has a higher ceiling than Mikal Bridges for example but I see your point."
"That's why I think OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges are guys to follow right now, they kinda fit the ""profile"""
I'm a p recent fan so my list skews towards current NBA players.  1.CP3  2. DBook  3. Curry  4. Bill Russell  5. Mikal Bridges  6. Giannis  7. Duncan  8. Kareem  9. Butler  10. IDK
"this is why you don’t listen to basketball nerds. all your opinions should be formed off of what i have to say. i am not a nerd. in fact i am extra dumb at basketball.  in my opinion, the greatest basketball player ever, is mikal bridges. this should be seen as the truth, and other opinions will not be tolerated   anyone have any questions?"
"Doing more than 10 because I want to:   Jrue, Dort, Ben Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Marcus Smart, Bam, OG, Draymond, Embiid, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi, Myles Turner, Dejounte Murray"
"Jrue - Smart - Simmons - Draymond - AD  Lebron - Dort - Mikal Bridges - Giannis - Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  Honorable mentions : Butler, Bam, Kawhi, Embiid, pre injury Isaac, OG Anunoby, all the perimeter guys could be taken before Lebron, Dort or Mikal I wouldn't argue too much.  edit : I admit Smart is a ""legacy"" pick I haven't watch him this year"
Mikal bridges is pretty good.   Healthy Klay too
"i won’t argue the shooting part, the defense part just isn’t true. mikal bridges gets those flashy blocks that get posted on house of highlights. Rj is ranked 13 in defensive rating, much higher than mikal bridges"
If you don't think Mikal Bridges is better than RJ Barret you obviously haven't watched the Suns play one game this season
Mikal Bridges is far better than RJ Barrett. Come on.
"contenders usually have a need for role players not potential all stars, all stars require more ball time causing a  threat to the system they have implemented, throwing a guy like mikal bridges at the sixers would obviously be much better because he’s a solid player that you know what you’re getting, 3 and D. Now if you asked a building team if they’d take RJ or Mikal, they’d probably take RJ because he has the potential to be the number 2 or 3 on a contender."
"Lol wow! I am a huge mikal bridges fan, but do we think he’s ever going to be able to be a 30ppg scorer on a western conference finals team?? (He’s ahead of Jamal Murray)"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
Mikal Bridges
"I wouldn’t necessarily take anyone off, but man, y’all still don’t know about Mikal Bridges."
"  Full list:  1. Luka 2. Zion 3. LaMelo 4. Mitchell 5. Tatum 6. Fox 7. Simmons 8. Booker 9. Adebayo 10. SGA 11. Ingram 12. Brown 13. Murray 14. MPJ 15. Morant 16. Young 17. Mikal Bridges 18. Sabonis 19. Edwards 20. Ayton 21. Haliburton 22. John Collins 23. Jarrett Allen 24. Lonzo 25. Sexton  Every ballot had Luka and Zion as 1&amp;2, but 3 and onward varied."
"OG, Mikal Bridges or RoCo"
Mikal Bridges
"No, they would still miss it. Steph is averaging 40.7 points/100 possessions. Kobe only scored at a higher rate than that once in his career. If you cherry pick that season, 05-06, Kobe is still scoring at an 8.3 TS% lower efficiency than Steph, which is a huge difference in efficiency.   Steph has played well enough offensively, that even cherry picking the best Kobe probably makes their offense worse replacing Steph.   Their defense would improve a little bit, but Steph is a good team defender as is and Kobe isn’t like a Mikal Bridges or Ben Simmons level of defender or anything.   This Warriors team is terrible. Even adding LeBron or Jordan to this team probably doesn’t improve them much, the guys on the team just have such bad skill sets that there is only limited ways for a star to improve their teammates on this team."
Like when the sizers drafted Mikal Bridges? God I’m so glad they traded him to the Valley Boyz. That man is a gem.
"WAIT. hold up. Mikal and Miles Bridges aren't brothers???? I thought OP was making a joke, so I made a joke too. But those two aren't brothers?????? My life is a lie"
I mean for the longest time I thought Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges were brothers
"They need Mikal Bridges and Malcolm Brogdon, run those guys out there with Doncic, KP &amp; Klieber and they'd be unstoppable"
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."
"If I play a true perimeter player at the 4 for as much as he played that season in Phoenix, they better score a lot of points. I'm giving up rebounding and paint protection as a sacrifice for better offense. He got a lot of easy opportunities feasting on slow-footed defenders, but was it worth it from a team perspective? Not really, so they traded him. They would much rather have a guy like Mikal Bridges that shoots, defends consistently, and plays team basketball."
"Mikal Bridges. He's a fine player, but not the $20M/year player a lot of Suns fans want to believe he is. When locked in, yes he does make players work hard, but this whole ""warden"" nickname is a bit overblown. He's still too skinny to defend anyone in the paint and vast majority of his shots are assisted."
Does Mikal Bridges count as a guard? Because if so then add Mikal Bridges vs everybody
"&gt; Probably a better passer than a Mikal Bridges type  Bridges is actually a really sneaky good passer for a 3&amp;D guy. I agree generally though, Chuma's passing is what tipped me off to him originally earlier in the season.  I don't think he has to be shoehorned as a PF. His offense is better there for sure, his his shooting and defensive versatility is more than good enough to be a full time SF."
"Yeah I called him DeAndre Hunter the other day. More shot creation ability than the typical 3+ D guy. Probably a little more physical than Batum. Probably a better passer than a Mikal Bridges type. Think he's long term the 3rd best player on a high quality team(if Orlando can ever get to such a state). We'll see what happens when Isaac is back, not a very Steve Clifford thing to play a Isaac/Okeke front line but I bet therell be parts of management that want to see them use it for minutes at least."
"The timeline where CP3 remains a top point guard in the NBA who elevates the play of everyone around him. He’s absolutely elite and you’re lucky to have him.   Also Mikal Bridges, who Brett Brown infamously traded away for Zhaire Smith on draft night in another Brett Brown special despite Bridges’ mom working in the fucking Sixers building, has become a top defender at his position."
"Josh Hart, Mikal Bridges. Donte, Larry Nance,"
He can be like Mikal Bridges is for the Suns. Doesn't have to score to make a huge impact on the game
"He’d have to beat out Mikal Bridges which he absolutely shouldn’t.   May happen because of popularity, but Bridges has been the best defender in the league at his position."
"Because nba front offices care more about projectability and younger age than college performance, which is the antithesis of Wright's system.  But that still doesn't explain Mikal Bridges and Bey slipping so low to me"
"The addition of Crowder, Galloway, were really good  Dario, Frank really found their roles and improved  Mikal Bridges took a leap  but CP3s leadership and holding everyone accountable is legit and really underrated"

“Lebron is better than mikal bridges” filthy casuals
&gt; Like Lebron wants to play second fiddle to ~~Dbook Mikal Bridges~~ Cameron Payne
"Mikal Bridges is a Rams fan and it hurts my soul. At least Booker supports the Arizona teams, seeing him wear the Kyler Murray rookie of the year shirt and going to ASU basketball games makes me happy"
&gt; Like Lebron wants to play second fiddle to ~~Dbook~~ Mikal Bridges
Pretty hard while playing alongside Michael Jordan's hero Mikal Bridges
"I like Oubre but Mikal Bridges playing amazing while the Suns have taken a huge leap forward is definitely a bad look, especially as he has regressed on the Warriors"
Lillard and 14 mikal bridges
"I'd bring in Bridges for RoCo. RoCo has been good, so I wouldn't be upset if he got it or anything, but Mikal Bridges has just been better."
"Mikal Bridges been playing great defense, should be second team"
"Missing Mikal Bridges, Dort, and Jrue imo"
"I wanted MPJ really badly, but I was happy with the Mikal Bridges pick, and cautiously optimistic about the Zhaire trade.  Oh well."
"No homer, but Mikal Bridges..."
"&gt;So you're trying to ascribe value to Embiid for the team being worse when he sits - that's not how it works. He gets no credit for those games, his value is zero in each one.   This is one of the dumbest statements about a team game I've ever heard. I guess LeBron James has zero value to the Lakers this season because he's missed games. No. That shows how important a player is to their team. If your record gets 20% worse when a single player sits, they're quite valuable to your team. Moving on.  &gt;Even if Embiid is more valuable per game that he plays, Jokic is still very valuable, and because he plays more games his value will surpass Embiid's.   How? If Jokic wins more games. Sure. If he put up his current stats and goes on a losing streak, then I doubt we'll be having this conversation in a month. Someone else will become the front runner.  &gt;Value over replacement - Jokic is at 5.8, Embiid at 2.7.  &gt;Win shares - Jokic at 10.7, Embiid at 6.2.  I can't believe people still quote these stats. They're next to useless. Do you think Domantas Sabonis is the 19th best player in the league? Do you think Montrezl Harrell is the 10th best player in the league? Also, since we're using WS. Why not use WS/48 where Jokic .300 and Embiid is .295. DRTG where Embiid is third and Jokic isn't top. ORTG, where Jokic is 6th and Embiid is 19th.  You can use crappy stats to favor either side of the argument. Advanced stats in general that aren't player specific(RTG, WS, VORP) are mostly trash. I'm trying to imagine in what world someone would look at VORP and WS and be like Mikal Bridges is better than Jamal Murray."
Mikal Bridges when he's on is a sight to behold.
"Watching him this season, he reminds me of watching Mikal Bridges as a rookie. You can just tell he has it."
"Pat is your guys Mikal bridges, even when they play bad it’s gonna be things like a quiet night and slow shooting. He’s never gonna cost you wins and if I’m being honest I can see this kid being better than bridges. He’s already further along in his rookie year than Mikal was"
Well Mikal Bridges exists
Nope. Mikal Bridges is at least one Luka-stopper. Luka still has nightmares of Mikal Jail.
I feel like 5 Mikal Bridges lacks playmaking so not very far.
"I'm more mad not picking Mikal Bridges then MPJ. MPJ had terrible physical, there was no excuse why the FO took Knox over Bridges."
"Suns picking Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson as 4th overall picks in back to back drafts. Yuck  Some notable players available after them were Jamal Murray, DeArron Fox and Jonathan Isaac.  Oh well the Suns are rolling now and mostly made up for those bad draft selections with Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson."
"De’Andre Hunter, Rui Hachimura, Mikal Bridges before him"
Mikal Bridges
"I love cp3 and it’s amazing having him on the team, but man some of the credit he gets for other guys having good individual performances while being on the floor with him is obnoxious. Having him on here instead of Mikal bridges is an absolute joke."
"Probably. Build a team with lots of good shooting and a decent center and I don’t see why they couldn’t be serious contenders with his playmaking. He can’t be the best scorer on your team, but he could be the best player.   For example:  Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Rudy Gobert.  Simmons is probably the best player on a team like this because Beal sucks so bad at defense, but a team like that could win the championship.  Some of this depends on era too. Are they winning a championship against healthy Brooklyn? No. Could a team like this win absent of a super team (like if the super team gets injured like in 2019, or 2020) sure."
"He's still great.  in no order OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (yeah he's a wing and a guard at the same time), Simmons, Jae'Sean Tate, Lebron, Dort, Butler, and him would be my top 9, I just chose 9 because I just woke up and I'm sure I forgot somebody good."
"Well first like I said the Pistons were #1 in the East the year before in the regular season. The Suns haven’t made the playoffs forever. And yes I know they have CP3 now, but it still doesn’t change the fact they haven’t played the playoff in forever, so that’s one reason people don’t pay attention to them as much.   Second, I don’t think you want to look at it that way with stars. The Pistons had a historic defense. Ben Wallace was a far more impactful player than Devin Booker. Booker may be the more popular player/elite scorer but Ben Wallace was far more impactful and decorated than Booker. Chauncey Billups also wasn’t a fancy player, but he’ll be a HOFer one day. The only time the Nuggets with made the WCF was with Billups, who was just a winner. And Rip and Sheed made All-Star teams in their career, and Tayshaun was a better version of Mikal Bridges with multiple All Defensive teams, even if it’s somehow written in history that this was a “no-name team.”  But like I said their defense was historic and they had a good track record from previous years, so that’s why they weren’t as big of a underdog as a lot of people today make it out to be.   Plus they had Darko."
Booker/Cam Johnson/Mikal Bridges/Crowder/Ayton
"I can't believe the Suns found a way to win with CP3 and Jae having bad games, having no production from the bench (aside of Craig), and shooting 20% from 3 against a pretty competitive team in Charlotte.   My takeaways:  - Charlotte wins this game in regulation if they hit their FTs, the sign of a young team. They're right in the middle of the pack right now in team FT%, if they get that up to 80%+, they're going to start closing out games.   - Devonte' Graham went nuclear on us. He hit some shots yesterday that I couldn't believed, with Mikal Bridges draped all over him. Gotta give it up to him for such a stellar performance.  - Defense travels. The Suns are a great defensive team with the best road record in the NBA. I believe that those two things go hand in hand. Mikal Bridges is an elite wing defender at this point that deserves All-Defense recognition. He has the perfect combination of length, basketball IQ, and an elite transition game. He is shooting 41% from 3 on decent volume, firmly placing him in the elite 3&amp;D tier. Eddie Johnson said it best last night: ""Every great team has a Mikal Bridges.""   - Charlotte got rooked by a combination of Booker/CP3 foul baiting and poor/inconsistent officiating. It's frustrating, but they did have an opportunity to win the game at the line. You can't turn the ball over 20 times and shoot less than 70% from the FT line and then expect to win.  - The Suns struggle with closing games comfortably, particularly against lesser competition. Last night, we saw Book iso on at least 3 consecutive possessions late in t he 4th. He took bad shots and Graham made us pay.   - Dario Saric is struggling. He is a vital cog in what makes our rotations work. When he's not playing well, you can tell because our production falls off of a cliff."
"Bridges has been rotating in and out of the top five in the DPOY conversation this season. I'd be shocked if he ended his career without at least one DPOY award as well, assuming he maintains his development. Our announcers have taken to calling him the Warden and a regular joke around the team is that he sends people to Mikal Jail. I'd say he gets the hardest defensive matchup in about 85-90% of our games and almost always rises to the challenge."
You might not think of bridges as a big defensive threat but everyone else does. Have you ever heard of Mikal Jail?
I'd like to see Mikal Bridges (6 steals) and Harrell added to this list

"I think both Bridges played super well.     Mikal is really long, so he has huge defensive potential.  In general i hope they are both good players for their teams.     Miles will need to start taking the leap from a handles perspective.  He could have a Julius Randle style impact if so."
"Those are likely the consensus top 4. I’d also add Dejounte Murray, Gary Harris, Thybulle, Butler, PG, Kawhi, LeBron, Mikal Bridges, Derrick White and PBev. All of those guys aren’t as consistently solid, but for one game/possession I’d take all them over FVV for guard defense."
"The future pick can be traded before the draft.   Look at 2021 Miami pick as an example.  Heat used it to get Dragic in 2015. Suns used it to get Mikal Bridges in 2018. Sixers used it to get Tobias Harris in 2019, and then the Clippers used it to get Paul George in 2019."
"&gt;Also I need more from Gobert I think bens doing better right now and guarding more spots  lol like I said in the post:  &gt;If you think anybody other than Gobert is DPOTY you're a casual or extremely biased  The Philly fans ""Ben is dpoty because he guards multiple positions"" take is so dumb lmao. Do ya'll seriously think he's the only player in the league who can guard multiple positions? Draymond, Giannis, LeBron, Adebayo, Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges all can, and frequently do guard 4+ positions. It doesn't mean they should be dpoty 😂😂"
"Before I start thank you for introducing me to “skyfuck”. 👍🏽 love that.   For the Suns I’d like to see a deep playoff run this year, but I’d settle for a second round exit. Cp3 continues to mentor and ball out while Booker fully arrives as an all star. Mikal bridges evolves into his final form as the teams Swiss Army knife. I might be one of the few that was glad we stayed out of the trade game this year. I like the group we have. Maybe a huge pickup in free agencyin two to three years, possibly a replacement for an aging cp3. Ideally we get a title hopefully next year but realistically I think two years from now will be a good window for the Suns. Then I think Booker skyfucks the aging group of all stars currently at the top. I don’t think an old Nets, Lakers, Warriors beat us and unless Giannis gets a jump shot I’m not too worried about the bucks. The heat might get it together if Robinson and hero get more consistent but I’d be more worried about the Celtics young core as they grow.   TLDR: First Suns title in 2-3 years, fingers crossed pieces in place for more. Booker/Bridges gonna be a problem."
Mikal Bridges.
Current :  Russ - Jrue - Mikal Bridges (that spot changes every week) - Middleton (I don't have a real 4 I know) - Wood  &amp;#x200B;  All time :   Billups - Hamilton - Prince - Sheed - Big Ben... original I know
"i've already cried about this on this sub since it happened, but a couple weeks ago i legit got downvoted to like -10 for just straight up saying mikal bridges having a better RPM than devin booker doesn't mean he's a better player. really, the majority of people read that comment and thought mikal bridges is a better player than devin booker because of impact stats lmao. the way people use all-in-one advanced stats without context here is so, so bad."
"honestly man, if it's any Sun, it's Devin Booker. lol He's awesome, but he's not on, like, Bradley Beal's level, much less a full blown superstar. I think he's good enough to be a leading scorer ona. championship team, I just think there's a good reason the team got better this year and it's a combination of Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul, and the addition of Jae Crowder. Chris Paul is a basketball genius, I don't care if he's only averaging 16 a game; hes influencing the game more than a lot of 25 ppg guys."
"No they do not LOL. Again, I’m not talking about regular season Lebron. I’m talking about playoff Lebron where he is locked into every defensive coverage they will run to stop him. If you think Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges can slow Lebron down...you gonna be in for a surprise if they meet LOL.  Notice how I didn’t even mention the AD factor. It’s nothing against the Suns, but you don’t go from perennial non-playoff team to championship contenders in one season with a bunch of players who’ve never played in the playoffs."
"I still don’t get why they drafted Fultz after he missed every shot during his workout. Should have swerved hard and taken Tatum.  Booker is less realistic of a timeline change.   Even if you don’t change any draft picks, if you just prevent them from their stupid trades, they could probably have a Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Mikal Bridges, and Joel Embiid starting lineup."
Mikal Bridges will be up there next year too. Guards the best player every night on a top 5 defense and teams specifically game plan to get him off their top guy through switches. Even LeBron. He just needs a little more size and a playoff run to show the world what we see every night.
"i was mad we traded zhaire smith for mikal bridges.   on the other end of the spectrum, i fist pumped when the celtics took tatum and josh jackson fell to us."
"In hindsight, Fultz. Still 100% think they made the right pick given the circumstances at the time.   Overall, probably Okafor. But even that was ownership forcing Hinkie into making a pick he didn't want to make.   I'm also still pissed we traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith on draft night"
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
"I know they lost, but man Mikal Bridges is the truth. I'm so pissed we traded him."
Eh. I’ve always thought this 76ers team was a bit lacking in talent to be honest. The fit is great but if you take the roster one by one. Simmons can not shoot to save his life. Seth Curry can’t play defense to save his life. Thybulle is a bad shooter. Tobias is a bad defender. Korkmaz also can’t defend. Too many specialists. They need a few more balanced guys. At this point the only true 3 and D players they have are Danny Green and Embiid. Granted when Morey got the team it was a mess. He did a great job but from the position he was in you can only do so much. To me they’re a Mikal Bridges (in place of Korkmaz) away from being a complete team  Granted Doc wasted the clippers last year
The depth of this draft can be ridiculous though as you have Luka n Trae with Ayton Shai JJJ MPJ WCJ Sexton Mikal&amp;Miles Bridges and the players that’ll pop out in the future.
Hell maybe even just not trade away Mikal Bridges
Opposite but for Mikal Bridges
Jazz Twitter came at me for saying Mikal Bridges was better than Royce O’Neal.
mikal bridges survives on a diet that is 90% chipotle
damn. mikal bridges stay safe
mikal bridges vs kd in the final is gonna be fire
It's gonna come down to Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder.  When they lost the two games in LA those guys were ice cold. When they started hitting their shots the Suns were able to win with a banged up CP3.
Mikal bridges developed a hitch in his shot as a rookie after shooting 40% from 3 in college. Was awful for his first year and a half but then figured it out again and became a lights out shooter.
Mikal Bridges has a weird catapult 3. I can’t tell if its actually bad form or he’s just so long it looks bizarre but I just know some fuckass coach is going to ruin his career over it.
Mikal Bridges.  oops
"Mikal Bridges ranks 68th percentile in defensive EPM. Using these stats to say Booker is a poor defender is unbelievably dumb.  If you watch the Suns play and defend, it would be extremely obvious that Devin was not a bad defender this year."
"Could have been Mikal Bridges. Grew up outside of Philly, went to Villanova, and his mom even worked for the Sixers when he was drafted by them. Then the Sixers blew it."
Mikal bridges
"Mikal Bridges is the best at defending Doncic,  ask any Mavs fan and check the Suns-Mavs games."
"&gt; MPJ will probably average 30 at some point in his career. He can learn to play average defense, is 6’11, and is one of the best young scorers in the league  That is only looking at what he does good (scoring) which admittedly is a very valuable skill. His playmaking is really bad though just look at his assist/to ratio and he was bad at this against the Suns series. His defense is terrible, the Suns went after MPJ more than any other player on defense this series. And he has injury issues.   &gt;mikal’s ceiling is a elite 3 and D wing.  A lot of players start out as 3 and D players and keep adding to their game. I get Bridges is old for his class but he has improved every single season so far and is still only 24 years old compared to MPJ's 22. Mikal hasn't missed a single professional game in 3 years of playing. Isn't a playmaker but has great playmaking for someone not expected to be a playmaker in that he doesn't turn the ball over and makes the pass if there is an open man. I will admit the absolute ceiling of MPJ is higher but the floor is higher for Mikal as well as the most likely outcome imo."
"If you ditch Kawhi then Mikal Bridges is the first person you should plug in there, not Caruso."
"MCW, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Fultz   Draft picks are hard to gauge. Worst thing the Sixers did during the process was give up Picks for Tobias and then give him a max, and then lose Jimmy.  Edit: Also the Mikal Bridges trade. Some questionable decisions from the FO but overall they’ve still done pretty good."
"i respect you defending your guy as a suns fan, but you saying mikal can guard those guys like shuts them down. no doubt he’s better defensively, but mikal’s ceiling is a elite 3 and D wing. MPJ will probably average 30 at some point in his career. He can learn to play average defense, is 6’11, and is one of the best young scorers in the league. Definitely had a bad series but he’s young. No way im missing out on his upside for mikal bridges"
1. Doncic  2. Young   3. SGA  4. JJJ  5. Ayton  6. Porter  7. Sexton  8. Mikal Bridges
"Sexton literally just averaged 24 on good efficiency, he’s got waaayyy more upside offensively. Elite scoring guards in this league are more valuable than 3&amp;D guys (yet to be seen if Mikal can be more): you can build a team around Sexton, but you can’t around Bridges."
Mikal Bridges got robbed
"Who’s y’all third team? Dejounte Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Capela is mine I think"
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
1. Luka 2. Trae 3. SGA 4. Ayton 5. Mikal 6. Sexton 7. MPJ  8. JJJ 9. Miles bridges 10. Jerome Robinson Etc  MPJ is the hardest one for me. He’s obviously got enormous offensive upside but (recency bias alert) he was abused soooo badly on defense by my suns. He was literally almost unplayable in a playoff series because of it. Not to mention he tweaked his back again at 22 years of age. Still a lot of questions with him.   Secondly I may be biased for mikal and his upside might be less than some of these guys but he already provides enormous value in playoffs. He would be a starter on most of the playoff teams left still at this point. Two way player who rarely makes mistakes while doing lots of things pretty well.
1. Ayton  2. Bagley  3. Luka  4. Trae  5. SGA  6. Jaren Jackson  7. Mikal Bridges   8. Sexton  This is with team fit in mind
Mikal Bridges getting Shawn Marion treatment. Kobe made all defense teams on reputation just like Kawhi will.
How the fuck does Mikal Bridges not make one of these
Mikal Bridges revenge sub-plot
Drafting is a crapshoot.  Sometimes you pick up DBook at 13 and get Mikal Bridges in a trade.  Sometimes you pick up Bender and Chriss.  It happens.  Everyone hits their fair share of HRs and whiffs every now and then.
Mikal Bridges. Suns getting snubbed left and right
"It’s okay, this gets offset by Mikal Bridges."
Not saying these guys don’t deserve it over him but I was hoping Mikal Bridges would make an appearance here :/
Mikal Bridges should be on here.
&gt;player  Only seeing Mikal Bridges comments actually... maybe the stray Anunoby
"Lebron over Kawhi is a fair take, but I don't think Kawhi should've made it either. And I certainly don't think either should've been in the running for DPOY lol. Mikal Bridges should've made it over Kawhi."
"I’m a Sixers fan too - what in the world makes you think mikal is overrated?   I agree Kawhi is getting the Kobe treatment now with selections based off rep, but bridges is elite and is far from overrated"
Mikal bridges robbed
Mikal bridges robbed
No Mikal Bridges is certainly a decision.
The more valuable player in the Finals will win it. If its Mikal Bridges then its Mikal Bridges. If Cam Payne then Cam Payne.  This has been my hot take. Feel free to reach out for interview requests and I also am willing to hop on your pod.
"I always try to look at the leaders, to see how many weird outliers there are.   18th - Kanter  16th - Jonas Val  14th - mikal bridges  No offense to those dude but something is seriously wrong if your stat has Kanter as a top 20 contributor lmao  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ws"
Mikal Bridges clamping KD - you heard it here first
"I always thought it was more 2013 Spurs. Kawhi was a two way player averaging 14 points a game and not a star yet. I see a little bit of Ayton as a big version of Kawhi in him as well as a little bit of early Kawhi in Mikal Bridges. Also at that point in career, I see a lot of Tim Duncan in Ayton. Tony Parker was considered one of the best PG's in the league and kind of a hipster pick to be the best PG that year. Chris Paul is one of the best PG's in the league with Curry and Dame but some hipster pick him as the best at improving floors and ceilings ie best PG in the league. Good well coached team all that shares the ball with a great bench."
"Ernie Johnson calling Mikal Bridges noodles made me cringe. He straight up just googled Mikal's nickname which are all trash. Real fans know Mikal's nickname is the ""Warden"""
"yea thats nuts having him on this list. Its not like he's the next person who'd be on this list, probably far from it, but I'd much rather just have a dude like Mikal Bridges on my team than Westbrook. Nobody winning a ring with Russ on their roster."
"Og and Mikal Bridges fit the whole Kawhi/PG/Butler/Brown career arc (perimeter stopper &gt; 3&amp;D &gt; ""oh there is more"" &gt; all star)"
Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton next season.
"Shake Milton or Kevin Huerter, Landry Shamet &amp; Bruce Brown probably, Mikal Bridges"
"Definitely Mikal Bridges, he’s been huge for Phoenix this year with his scrappy defense and shot making"
"Same could be said for Chris Paul or Devin Booker. No one is “stopping” these players, you can only mitigate their impact. And if that’s what you meant, then Mikal Bridges."
I fucking love Mikal Bridges
Lol yeah I like the raptors tbh OG is one of my favs in the league right now. He is a slightly better version of mikal bridges in my eyes
The Mikal Bridges Fan Club is looking to expand. We're taking applications.
"Sixers legend, Mikal Bridges. Haha… :("
Mikal is a Bridges over troubled waters
Mikal Bridges in that class too.
Kenny mistaking Cam Johnson for Mikal Bridges
Go take a look at the top ten names in most made corner threes. It’s all highly effective guys like Danny Green and Mikal Bridges.
" Schroder had to deal with Mikal Bridges who previously had the assignment of AD before he was out. Bridges is an elite perimeter defender who has length on a smaller  Schroder, who can't consistently attack the basket with Mikal on him. If his shot isn't falling, which is usually the case, then he is completely neutralized on offense if you take away his penetration. It's unfair to blame Dennis without acknowledging the defense that shut him down."
"Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF."
"I cannot say enough good things about Mikal Bridges dude. Been watching him since his days at Nova. He's the kind of guy any and every NBA team would want. Talented, versatile defender. Great shooter. I know he's kind of considered a 3 and D guy, but I think his offensive ceiling is a lot higher than that. I think 2-3 years from now, idt he's even gonna be considered a 3 and D guy, just an elite two-way player.   I'd cut off a fucking pinkie to have Bridges on the Wolves."
"Having a lot of friends in the media and being a great leader has finally paid dividends, after spending the majority of his prime being underrated, CP3 suddenly is overrated.  He's been at an All NBA level for sure, all the MVP talk is a pure joke, that team is good, that team only missed the playoffs last year because Ayton got suspended 25 games, that team killed everyone with CP3 off the floor too this season, that team won a playoff series with CP3 playing with one shoulder. Devin Booker is awesome (probably a better player than CP3 at this point), Mikal Bridges is one of the best 3&amp;D guy in the league, Ayton has been awesome, the role players are all good, the team is deep, Monty is a great coach : can everybody stop acting like this is some sort of 2009 NOLA carry job by CP3 ?"
That’s true but Porters size and shooting ability automatically gives him a higher ceiling. If he can ever reach it will be the question but I can’t see a world where Mikal averages 20+. But again if I’m wrong and he can get to 22 a game with that defense I can’t imagine MPJs peak being higher than Bridges
Here’s some more context. MPJ is one of the worst defenders in the league. Bridges is one of the best defenders in the league.  And you misspelled Mikal twice...
"Jokic did about 5 things last night that just made stop and say ""how?""  Even more so, Mikal Bridges is one of the best in the league at reading passing lanes and using his length to give the illusion of guys being open and he just gets totally drawn into the cut."
Cam Johnson = James Jones Mikal Bridges = Kawhi Lite
"I'd love if we could trade him for Mikal Bridges, but I know the Suns wouldn't go for that"
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker 3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton
"It was a rough few years of draft picks, but Ayton, Cam Johnson, and Mikal Bridges have all been very good draft night pickups for the Suns."
Man I really like Mikal Bridges
Finals MVP Mikal Bridges don't @ me
Mikal Bridges is the lead singer in a Blink 182 cover band.   He’s doin All The Small Things
Mikal Fucking Bridges
"mikal ""all the little things"" bridges"
Is mikal bridges the guy the sixers traded on draft night that said he was excited to play on the sixers lol?
Mikal Bridges has been so fucking huge for the Suns.
"yeah, so does my Mikal Bridges t-shirt."
"Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, and/or Mikal Bridges. Plenty of 3 and D wings to choose from."
"Jaren Jackson Jr, or Mikal Bridges."
Idk if he’s unknown enough but Mikal Bridges I think is going to grow from being a great 3 and D wing into a legit 2 way star in the mold of Paul George or Jimmy Butler
"Mikal Bridges, literally impossible to dislike"
"Not trying to be a dick, but Mikal Bridges also fits that description"
mikal bridges &gt; kd
where does it rank on the spectrum of Markelle Fultz to trading the rights to Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith?  Somewhere around a Jahlil Okafor?
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"That 2018 draft is STACKED....  Luka, Trae, MPJ, Shai, Ayton     And then you have a ton of young talent such Bruce Brown, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Mikal Bridges, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Jaren Jackson, and even Marvin Bagley (still has time to develop and improve)."
"1 - Luka  2 - Donovan (Biased, I know)  3 - Tatum  4 - Ja  5 - Trae  6 - Zion  7 - Ayton  8 - SGA  9 - Fox  10 - Bam  11 - MPJ  12 - Anthony Edwards  13 - Lamelo Ball  14 - Mikal Bridges  15 - Sexton"
"The suns in 2018 is kind of comparable. Got Ayton, Mikal Bridges, and then we missed on Okobo. I remember I wanted them to draft Brunson but we ended up trading for Carter who is still a good role player. We may have missed out on Luka but we still go 2 of the top 6-7 players in that draft.n"
"I think the Suns are very similar to the 2018 Rockets, but with much better ball movement and generally better across the board _____ Chris Paul is Chris Paul _____ Devin Booker is James Harden. They have a different play style and Harden is obviously a lot better, but they are the bucket getters _____ Mikal Bridges is a better version of Trevor Ariza ______ Jae Crowder is better than PJ Tucker _____ Ayton is about equal to Capela"
"Which of the following players are you taking Bagley over?  Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter, Collin Sexton, Kevin Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Briges, Michael Porter JR"
I wanna see Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges on this list next year.
"I genuinely love this year's team so fucking much.  In terms of analysis, I was shocked that Malone had no defensive answers. Jokic was lowkey cooking and it did not matter, and that's with the Suns playing bad defense in the first quarter (and were kind of lucky the Nuggets still missed everything).   MASSIVE props to Ayton for picking up two early fouls and then just, not.  He's been so huge in the playoffs I am almost running out of superlatives. He's embodying the archetype of a top ""role player"" center at this point even better than Capella. Watching Warriors fans wishing Wiseman can be like Ayton is so much better than where we thought he was going to be post-suspension. Huge credit to his work ethic AND mental resolve.  Chris Paul and Devin Booker are incredible. Mikal Bridges is finally cooking.   We won with no one scoring 20 two days after 4 guys got 20 points. And it was even easier this time.  Hope MPJ is going to be okay, I would absolutely hate if this means his back issues will be lingering. The Nuggets had a potential homegrown dynasty brewing before Murray went down. Huge respect to both the team and the fans, although I *will* get cocky if we win in less than 6."
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
Mikal Bridges
"5 of the 8 remaining teams have never won a championship,, with all 4 of the West teams, and the Nets of the East, and the Nets being the heavy favorite to win the East (and the finals), assuming the big 3 stay healthy, It is fairly likely that a first time champion will be crowned, and after tonights performance, I believe that it will be the suns vs Nets in the 2021 nba finals, which is probably the best matchup for the Nets considering the suns have CP3, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig, who are all capable defenders, as well as Cam Payne, who isnt necessarily a great defender, but definitely a pest, and Ayton at the anchor, with Saric, who has shown he is a good defender who can stretch the floor, I think this team is the only team with enough defensive assets with the offensive fire power to challenge the Nets"
Right now: Booker/Mikal Bridges  All time: Nash/Booker/Bridges
All time: Shawn Marion   Now: Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges +28, Chris Paul +26, holy shit."
Mikal Bridges
What’s wrong with go-go-gadget arms Mikal Bridges?
"Jrue and Middleton and Bucks role players play better at home. Cam Johnson, Cam Payne and Mikal Bridges play worse on the road. I've been going with Bucks."
"Eh, but their team is *young* like, wouldn’t be surprised if  a guy like Mikal Bridges has another level they can get to. Like maybe in three years he’s an all nba guy. He has time and the tools"
"It maybe the best comparison, especially considering their size.  I also think Ayton was a good pick but I will say that cp3 really unlocked the roster. I mean I think a starting lineup of Luka, Booker, Mikal Bridges, TJ Warren, Richaun Holmes wins more then 19 games that rookie season.   But yea, I agree Ayton is a good match for Booker."
"On Embiid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd7Rn5U4VzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd7Rn5U4VzY)  On Mikal Bridges: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtO1hpZx4aU&amp;t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtO1hpZx4aU&amp;t=7s)  That's just from this season, didn't even have to go back that far."

"Here's the thing tho, I feel like outside of the echo chamber here - a good number of people expected the Bucks to even the series back up down 0-2. [I thought it was very likely he'd have back-to-back 30+ pt games since that's just the sorta player he is.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ogzqil/why_are_people_getting_on_middletonjrue_for_being/)  Milwaukee had a counter. (literally Jrue and Khris pls don't play like trash again) Phoenix doesn't. They shot 70% from 3 and lost. Booker's been going nuts. I don't see where they get that extra push other than Mikal Bridges development flying forward 3-4 years sooner than it should these last 2 games."
"1. Single game Plus minus is garbage do you used that, Pat would be the finals MVP  2. Mikal bridges was 3/3 from three and totally could have hit more if he just got the damn ball the bench mov was something stupid like 72% from three, that’s just booker being a ball hog.  3. It wasn’t that he was doubled, it’s that he walked directly into a trap."
"The only thing I disagree with you on is your edit at the end that says it'd be nice for CP3 to get a ring before he retires.  Fuck that. CP3 has long been the [dirtiest player](https://youtu.be/i9SUoe9Tzi0) in the NBA. [Everyone knows this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7i62HLZSlc). It's [well-documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNXFXVyYrE). He's a [world-class flopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw). Someone once made a [fake trailer with Chris Paul playing the protagonist Cock Puncher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM-6WmQNncs). Damn near [everyone HATES Chris Paul](https://youtu.be/6xQpd3C5fxE).  He deserves to be Icarus, flying too close to the sun and burning his wings at the worst possible time.  DeAndre Ayton, Monty Williams, Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne, Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig all seem to be perfectly good dudes. I'd be genuinely happy for them if they pulled it off and won the title.  But Chris Paul? Fuck Chris Paul. That dirty cock-punching flopper deserves no championship."
"Cam Johnson, Deandre Ayton, Cam Payne, mikal bridges. some of the most likeable guys in the league. Look at cash considerations Torrey Craig and Cam Payne fighting his way back from China and the G league. DA growing up in the Bahamas then moving to AZ for high school, stays at the university of Arizona. Drafted #1 by the suns. Great story, great player, great fans. Go Suns"
I’m so mad Mikal Bridges only shot 6 shots
Mikal Bridges is a great perimeter defender.
"Coach Bud was right, the bucks are playing random and its paying off because Coach Monty cant make big adjustments. If the bucks ran side pick and roll with giannis and khris and giannis in the midpost as much as fans asked for, I feel that the suns would have figured something out by now. But it seems like the bucks just do whatever comes up and use those plays in big moments which makes it hard to scheme for. I think the suns should match the chaos with more chaos, throw in zone, throw in traps, throw in ayton just straight up in the key and not guarding giannis just for a few possessions so the bucks are not as comfortable.  It will be interesting to see if jrue keeps guarding cp3 or switches to booker. Jrue guarded booker in the third quarter and was menace, but i feel like if I'm the bucks, I would stick jrue to cp3. Let booker get his, that really throws the rhythm of crowder, bridges and ayton. Ayton looks discouraged without his usual looks in the pick and roll from cp3. Cp3 is choking/getting shut down. Cp3 needs to get early pick and rolls to get early seperation and be able to make plays in space, but that bucks starting 5 is looking bigger and bigger each game. If he's not making plays for mikal bridges and ayton, then its just a lot of midrange jumpers for the suns. Which admittedly, i thought is how the suns would win because those shots are usually cash for cp3 and Booker. But now we are seeing that its stagnating the offense, like Steve Kerr told us it would.   With that being said, its like jeff van gundy said, the biggest adjustments to make are playing harder and making more shots. The suns looked like they were going to run away with it in the first quarter then they stopped playing hard and making shots and the bucks started playing hard making shots."
"it was so annoying when mark jackson was like ‘they gotta get devin booker the ball and apply the pressure’ after they finally start playing like the finals TEAM that they are and Mikal Bridges hit a couple big shots. the rest of the team shot 73% from three for fucks sake, maybe the focus shouldve been on finding the open jumper and not devin booker heroball mid range isos"
"Suns were a couple of calls that should have been called against them from losing to an injured Clippers team in 6 games. From Mikal Bridges fouling Terance Mann the last minute, to Cam Payne losing the ball all on his own, and then some. They were phony all post season"
"I agree he’d be a great role player.  I’d rather Tatum and Middleton get those minutes generally, but he’d be nice to bring in for any lineups where more defense is needed.    A clear winning formula for this team is Durant + spacing + defense, and Mikal Bridges would play that role well.  If Grant is unable to go, he’d be a good replacement choice."
"Saric has a higher PER than crowder and mikal bridges...  At the end of the day, one is a starter and the other isn't. Don't be stupid"
If were going by 2015 rules then its mikal bridges

They’re perfect fits for the team right now. Sometimes that value is much higher than just a stars name. Depth and their roles are very why suns are where they are at.   And mikal bridges is going to be a star.

Lakers don't have the resources to trade for a player like mikal bridges let along dame
"i had a guy tell me mikal bridges is a better player than devin booker because of impact stats when he was defending ben taylor, who said two years ago booker could be a third option on a good team lmao. it's actually crazy what people will allow themselves to believe if someone says something with authority."
"Every defensive metric certainly doesn’t say he’s below average. That’s just wrong.  He was in the 60th percentile of d-epm. Tatum was in 54th along with Middleton, below average would be like Lowry in the 46th percentile of Dame in the 33rd. Jaylen’s closer to Mikal Bridges, Steven Adams, and KD among others than he is to being below average.  He’s above average in d-raptor too for this past regular season. Some guys below him (below average with numbers in the negative) include KD,  RJ Barrett, Siakam, Middleton, Lowry, CP3, and Tatum. The difference between him and Tatum was more than the difference between him and Dejounte Murray, Lebron, Lonzo, Ayton and Adams as well as equal to the difference between him and Mikal Bridges and Jrue. He’s historically been above average in raptor too.  The stat he generally doesn’t look good in is regular season dbpm but even that doesn’t carry over to his postseason numbers. He also generally raises his game in the postseason. While playing less games than the Miami Heat players, he had the 4th highest total defensive win shares last postseason after Tatum, Lebron, and AD."
"top versatile defenders: giannis, ben simmons, Bam, Kawhi, AD, Jrue  young and upcoming: Mikal Bridges, OG, Thybulle"
"If everyone's healthy and wanted to play in the olympics, i'd still want Mikal bridges in my top 12 roster for Team USA"
Uhhh that means i would want Mikal bridges to be like the 10-12th man for Team USA?
"I'd honestly take mikal bridges as my 3rd SF off the bench even if everyone's healthy. Durant/kawhi/mikal. You need someone to set screens, cut, hustle, and hit open 3's.   Lebron as PF"
"Although he isn’t the most talented 1 v 1 player out there, Mikal Bridges would be a great fit on this team. Low usage player who can hit open shots, plays good defense, and has no ego. He would also be ready and in shape since he’s playing in the Finals now, and he can take the same plane as Booker, Middleton, and Jrue after the Finals is over."
Mikal Bridges cool too
"Johnson had some pathetic fake injuries the last two games—as a bucks fan I really like Mikal Bridges and Ayton, the rest of the suns are entitled flippers"
"why arent they feeding mikal bridges, he was looking really locked in earlier"
Has anyone ever seen Mikal Bridges and Jay Pharaoh in the same room?

"That's 1 MVP caliber players, 1 starter and a guy who's out of the league. 33% hit rate. I'd live with that.  Plus, other than Kristaps, the next players drafted 5-10 are role players at most. As for Noel's draft, the next 3 guys after him are role players as well. It should also be noted that in that same draft they got MCW (who becomes the LA 2018 pick in Mikal Bridges)."
feels like everybody in this game is off except mikal bridges

Why are people saying Mikal Bridges flew out James Charles ?
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Mikal Bridges. Mikal, OG, Siakam gimme that  L E N G T H"
Mikal Bridges
Elgin was 34 and on t the level of mikal bridges with worse defense. He is somewhat overrated in his last season  it's not a name game. Russell had just as good of a team

Can't forget Sixers legend Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges might not be one of the 12 most talented 1 v 1 young USA players, but he plays such an important role (low usage, great shooter, good defender, good attitude and doesn’t need the ball to make an impact), he should be on this team. I would put him over Lavine actually. No need to have Lavine when you have Trae, Mitchell, Booker, and Tatum already."
Think u mean Mikal Bridges
"Mines is almost identical.   PG: Steph &amp; CP3 is spot on. I have Lonzo in place of lowry for a taller, defensive guard.   SG: I have Klay as a starter, whille Harden will be the 6th man for the offensive firepower, and Jrue.  SF:  Lebron/Durant &amp; Kawhi is spot on. I have Mikal bridges instead of PG as the slasher and dirty work guy. I had PG initially in my mind first though,  PF: I have exactly the same  C: The same besides Jarrett Allen. i had Brook Lopez to space the floor if needed."
"Starters in **bold**  PG: **Curry**, CP3, Lonzo  SG: **Klay**, Harden, Jrue  SF: **Lebron**, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  PF: **Durant**, Draymond, Zion  C: **Davis**, Lopez, Bam"
"If you’re on the Suns bandwagon, Mikal Bridges should definitely get the nod over Love if we’re just talking about player and not position."
Mikal Bridges and Robert Covington are not a 40 point swing in a game against Australia.
"Kidd: Ja Morant (Obviously J Kidd didn't have the athleticism, but pace and poor shooting) Kmart: Jon Collins Van Horn: Kelly O Kittles: Reggie Bullock RJ: Mikal Bridges MaCCullough: Alex Len"
Pretty much this.  I'd honestly rather have a team of Dame - Mikal Bridges - Durant - Draymond - Adebayo or Brook Lopez than all 5 all stars
"Role specialization in basketball has caused stars to focus on only one side of the ball. If you add some 3D guys like robert covington and mikal bridges, I can guarantee USA is going to start winning by 30 again"
Thybulle hitting 3s? Man is about to get Mikal bridges money

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."

We're a Zeke Nnaji turning into Mikal Bridges away
"Yes, and the Bucks were also down after the first quarter and down through about midway through the second. The wheels came off as soon as Ayton got taken off the court.   It is never a good thing to lose by 20, but consider that Giannis had virtually the same stat line in game two and the Bucks lost. Hell, even Mikal Bridges underperformed by ten points, whereas Giannis overperformed his average, as did Holiday. Holiday and Middleton were a combined 50% from three.   It took big minutes and a historically significant performance by one of the league superstars to beat the bench by a less than totally embarrassing amount. Holiday, Middleton, and Giannis combined for 75% of the points scored by the Bucks. It is unreasonable to imagine that type of trend continues."
Mikal Bridges took one to the kisser. Ouch
Mikal Bridges always looks like he's smiling
Mikal ' D' Warden' Bridges
1. Giannis 2. Booker (its wild so many of you think CP3 is better than book this year. Books clearly been out best player all year) 3. CP3 4. Ayton 5. Mikal Bridges (don't @ me)
"Yeah I can get behind Simmons as number 1 this year. Other guys like Lu sort, mikal bridges and jrue holiday are definitely in that conversation too. Wiggins was absolutely elite at one on one this year though, it was phenomenal to watch, especially after that stat from 2017 or something where a shot contested by Wiggins would actually be more likely to go in lmfao."
"Damnit. Booker, Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges will have to do it alone."
"Definitely call Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges to the Olympic team right now - they shouldn't have to worry about the Finals, their country needs them."
"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton"
MIKAL BRIDGES
"Actually that whole 2018 draft class is insane. All of them are so young and so good. Deandre Ayton, Trae, Luka, Mikal Bridges, Michael Porter Jr. ..."
Ayton was picked because that’s conventional draft  wisdom dating back for decades. It’s why everyone just accepted that Hakeem basically had to go number 1 over Jordan.   But trading a future pick(2021 lol)  to move up 6 spots and pick Mikal Bridges. Cam Johnson was called an absolute reach. The last time the Suns did take a guy experts and fans said was the actual  BPA was 2017. They drafted for fit snd drafted around their team.
"Cam Johnson was the 11th pick and Mikal Bridges was the 10th pick and got traded for. The lower you get in the draft, the more blurry the line between BPA and fit becomes. By time you're in the back half of the lottery, you're usually not expecting guys to be stars, so choosing between low success rate higher upside gambles and solid guys that fit your team starts to be a far more balanced tradeoff.   Ayton was picked because a lot of people, including the Suns, thought he was the best player in that class. At worst it was debatable, but it wasn't some fit over BPA decision."
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul  4. Khris Middleton  5. Jrue Holiday  6. De’Andre Ayton  7. Mikal Bridges  8. Brook Lopez  9. Jae Crowder  10. Pat Connaughton  11. Cameron Payne  12. PJ Tucker
"You say that but honestly, the way the Suns got to the finals after being the worst team not long ago was by drafting guys like mikal bridges and cam Johnson and even Ayton arguably."
"Yeah np man, we’ll take Mikal Bridges. Thanks."
He’s also being defended by a future All-NBA defender. Mikal Bridges is the truth.
So what you’re saying is Mikal Bridges is the greatest player in the league?
People should be scared that Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges are both good answers for this.
"Edwards already broke out lol he scored like 25 a game second half of the year. Reddish is a good idea but it would probably be a mikal bridges scenario at best, hawks have lots of guys who need shots"
"Ayton if you don’t consider his playoff performance so far a breakout and mikal bridges. Mikal has the tools to be ELITE.  I think with Paul getting older, more will be expected of bridges to contribute."
lol the Sixers traded away both Tatum and Mikal Bridges. Good thing they don't really need any wing depth.
Mikal Bridges. Feel like he's doing that now but feel like he can be a near 20pt scorer next season
Mikal Bridges for Ben Simmons who says no
Murray couldn’t even get that lmao Mikal Bridges better than him lol
No damn way Mikal Bridges now is the equivalent to Kawhi in 2014. Kawhi was making his defensive presence known on the court while also shooting 18PPG on 61% FG through the whole series. Mikal is special on defence but is not comparable to Kawhi back then. He shot decently last game but was off game 1. Mikal will not even come close to matching Kawhi’s efficiency throughout the ‘14 Finals
"He absolutely was not.   Kawhi was phenomenal that series, and was by far the best defensive player on the court. He was also giving you the most points a game (tied with Parker) but on 75% ts rather than Parker’s 51%.  I agree that he was not a well known name, but he was nothing akin to Mikal Bridges."
"He's a very good role player, akin to someone like Mikal Bridges. If he's your franchise player, you're a 25-win team. If he's your third or fourth best player (like Bridges), you can be a championship contender."
Cam is 2 years away from an extension unless he regresses or suffers a siginificant injury he will see 15 I  suspect based off age and potential. Mikal Bridges is looking at 20M or higher
"I remember people said that trading for Bridges was bad because we weren't ready to compete so giving up the Miami pick was a bad move. A couple years later and Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are key contributers to a finals squad. Two of the best 3 and D players in the league, not to mention both can attack the basket and hit mid range shots. I love those two"
"The Bucks have had this same problem with their defense for literally years. Doesn't matter if it's Fred VanVleet, Jae Crowder, or Mikal Bridges: they're getting killed from 3 by opposing role-players every time."
"Considering the Ben Simmons saga at the moment, The lucky Kawhi shot that took Toronto to the finals and played against an injured Golden State team, Oh lets not forget “The process”, almost killing Zhaire smith at a team lunch, Fultz forgetting to shoot, Losing Jimmy Butler, Trading Mikal Bridges for no reason, Our GM had a burner account criticizing Embid and had to quit, Why must you torture us Philly fans like this?Have we not suffered enough?"
"I find it interesting that the Sixers, who worked SO hard to fucking LOSE every year to stock pile lottery picks, seemed to get the most disappointing picks (though they are not all 'busts' exactly).    Nerlens.   Michael Carter-Williams (and he was ROY).   Okafor.  Simmons.   In fact, the only player they drafted during their FIVE-YEAR 'process' that will be with the team moving forward (assuming a Simmons trade goes through) is Embiid.   And they got him the second year.   One of the best players they picked up Mikal Bridges, and they shipped him out straight away but has developed into a solid player.   Ty Jerome too.   They also shipped out Jerami Grant pretty early as well.   That team has just been all about moving and getting assets and throwing everything to the wall and seeing what sticks and jumping off if it doesn't work straight away (with Embiid and Simmons being the only players they have been willing to wait on).   All of that instead of taking the time to develop the talent they get."
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
"1) i purposely left out klay because this post doesn't include all-star players. I can respect Robert Covington, OG anunoby, Mikal Bridges pick. But i believe with the 3&amp;D status, he is up there.  2) I mentioned in the next few years, he could be an all-defensive player. Pels terrible defensive rating is because as a whole, the team doesn't have good defensive players; Zion and BI are not good defensively.   3) i'm not sure about this. I'm not qualified to evaluate half court offense.  4) i believe he can be an all-star, not necessarily next season or the season after that. The point being, he is only 23 and has a lot of room for improvement. His reworked shot mechanics has proven that he has a great work ethic and works hard to develop his game. So it is not unplausible that he can become an all-star caliber player"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"Joe Harris, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, and DeAndre hunter too"
Who was with his team longer: former Atlanta Hawk Luka Doncic or former Philadelphia 76er Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges reminds me of Tayshaun idk why. Maybe the wingspan
"The 76ers could have picked Jayson Tatum instead of Fultz, and then did nothing... they could have a lineup of ben, shamet, Covington, Tatum, and embiid. With players like Mikal bridges and thybulle coming off the bench    There's a reason the great artists seem to die young: the longer you live the more mistakes you make. Hinkie was canned before he could finish executing. All Philly had to do was not fuck it up"
Yeah he has the size of a SG. He can guard guys like Mikal Bridges but not guys like Luka or Paul George
Mikal Bridges.
"I think any random top 25 team is off.  And maybe not even the best teams some years could pull it off.  But I do believe some of the best college teams in history can definitely pull off some wins given 82 tries.  2018 Villanova I think has a shot.  They had Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divencenzo, Omari Spellman and Eric Pashcall who all made the NBA.  Phil Booth was in the G-League and Colin Gillespie was an all-American who will probably make the G-League or a European League after he 'graduates' next year.  Jermain Samuels might also go pro after he graduates next year as well.  That roster has 5 NBA players and 8 pros.  They were really good.  &amp;#x200B;  The 2010 Kentucky team was also really stacked.  They didn't win the title, but had John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Daniel Orton, Patrick Patterson, Deandre Liggins and Darius Miller.  7 NBA players.  There are also a couple UNC and Duke rosters as well as Michigan's Fab Five.  Some of these teams I think can do much better than 1 win too.  Wouldn't be surpised if that Kentucky team could get at least 5."
"&gt;The biggest difference was the CP3 addition. Jae was an improvement over Kelly, and Mikal did play a lot better, but CP3 over Rubio is by far the biggest improvement.  They improved from .667 over the second-half of 2020 to .708 in 2021.  The difference is just 3 wins.  You are divvying up a very small improvement now, which was the entire point.  Booker improved.  Ayton improved.  Bridges improved.  Crowder arrived.  Payne played.  All that, plus Paul, led to just +3 wins.  &gt;CP3 is $24 million dollars better than Rubio. He’s an actual scoring option and has consistently led better offences. He’s also been one of the best closers in the game.  Not for the Suns he hasn't been.  Maybe peak Paul versus peak Rubio.  The Suns beat the Lakers despite Paul's 9/8 on 44% true shooting, not because of it.    &gt;His minutes were slashed for a reason.  Which was what, exactly?  He was playing fine up to that point -- as I showed.  Did he do something off court to anger Carlisle?  &gt;And no, it is not common for your sixth man to see 33% of their ppg cut and their TS% decline by 5%.  I never said it was common for a coach to slash his 6th man's minutes by 40%, despite that player playing just fine.  But that's what Carlisle did.  &gt;And what happened after Game 3? They couldn’t hit their perimeter shots like they did the first 3 games, so Luka and the coach had less trust in them.  Doncic wasn't hitting his shots, either.  9-24.  17-37.  11-24.  &gt;Your second article references Shams reporting that it is unlikely for Pelicans to match any significant offer for Ball, and the third article literally says this:  And what, exactly, do you think that says?  It says the Pelicans may, or may not, decide to continue with Ball.  Meaning that it was precisely not ""common knowledge"" that he would leave.  As I clearly showed -- even Ball and Williamson were quoted talking about his potential return, and you damn sure don't and didn't know more about the situation than those two."
Luka  SGA  Collin Sexton  Ayton  Mikal Bridges  MPJ  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Trae Young  If the Kings rejected a 1 to 1 swap of any of those players I would riot.
"Cp3 averages a lot of points and you're blaming Jokic? They tried playing up to the level of the screen but, Mikal Bridges and Crowder were shooting 99% from 3 so, they moved to a drop and CP3 torched them. It's easy to look good on offense when you don't have to work on defense. The Nuggets had 2 rookies in the rotation along with a guy who had played for the team for 1 month, let's not act like team chemistry doesn't matter at this level when it comes to defensive rotations.   The same thing happened with Gobert and people decided to call him overrated on defense as well."

"There was an athletic article where 13 coaches were polled on who their defensive teams of the year would be with 2 points given for their first team votes and 1 to their second team votes.   The only difference in either of the teams from the actual results was that Smart and Mikal Bridges tied for the second guard spot on the second team, knocking out Thybulle.  Not saying Smart should’ve made all defense (I don’t think he should have) but the idea he was hurting our defense is silly."
"After exhaustive research of watching an entire summer league game of this player where I mostly paid attention, I've reach a firm conclusion.  Trey Murphy is going to be the best player taken after 7th and will be the steal of the draft.  He will be a taller, better shooting Mikal Bridges, with better interior defense but not as good perimeter defense."
"Your arguments is basically ‘if a played develops in Timberwolves it means that player is good, if he does not it means the team development is bad’. This statement is a little bit incorrect. I know you support Toronto and this team is famous for developing lower picks/undrafted players, but I see Timberwolves trying to do the same and having initial success with guys like Reid, Nowell, and McDaniels.  Everyone has the benefit of the doubt, especially when the whole front office is new and ownership is about to change. It took 1 year for Phoenix to turn the things around, and suddenly Booker became a star instead of being inefficient choker, Mikal Bridges is a genius draft selection, Ayton before Luka is a great fit. No one trashes Phoenix for selecting Smith over Haliburton. I’d say Phoenix drafted more busts than Wolves for the past 10 years. One year, the narrative has changed. Let us change our narrative."
"I was very impressed by his summer league game versus the Warriors.  His shot looks damn pure.  Add in the length and good athleticism, he looks to be the a taller Mikal Bridges.  At 6""9.25 with shoes, decent lateral movement, a 7""1 wingspan and 8""9.5 reach, he has all the tools to be a versatile defender.  I'm confident his shot will translate in the NBA, but will have to see how he handles the quicker, craftier and better perimeter players of the nba.  Nevertheless I think the Pels got a steal with Murphy."
"He has had injury concerns and hasn't consistent put his best out there. He would have game where he was on fire, then he would be 2/10. Inconsistency plus being pigeon holed as pretty much just a shooter without much off ball or on ball handling moves, and mediocre defense, leaves him as a mystery. Guys like Mikal bridges, Ayton, Luka, Trae, and more have been healthy and putting up consistent numbers each year. MpJ kinda popped out this past season. Denver should wait and see if he can stay out there and consistently perform. It's a risk. But most likely it'll be like hawks-Collins situation where they still end up paying him after"
did Mikal Bridges get an extension?
Mikal Bridges baby!
Mikal Bridges.
Mikal Bridges
Took WAY too long to see his name. I hated seeing more people upvote the wrong M. Bridges!  Oh yeah: Mikal Bridges.
"This is an over exaggerated narrative. Everyone played worse than normal defense last year and there are a variety of reasons that happened. In terms of advanced stats, Jaylen had a higher d-Raptor than guys like KD, Middleton, Lowry, CP3, and Tatum along with guys who are called underrated defensively like Harden and Doncic. Same distance away from Mikal Bridges as he was from Tatum and CP3. Similar story with defensive epm."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges and I’m not scared to say it
Mikal Bridges will be a superstar. Already a great defender with a great 3 point shot. He always knows the perfect time to cut the rim and we saw flashes of him being able to create his own shot in the playoffs.
"I think Mikal Bridges could evolve into a player like that if put in the right circumstance. Great shot, learning how to attack of the dribble, good length which can translate to a solid to elite defender. Just has to put some pieces together"

"We hope he can become a Mikal Bridges who can create his own shot better than Bridges, he just has so much potential"
"Was super high on him last year during the draft cycle. You see how Mikal Bridges has evolved into a highly impactful player and one of the best 3&amp;D prospects of the past few years, then you see how Vassell was putting up similar numbers to Bridges' age 21 dominant junior season while he was a 19 year old sophomore. Plus he was showing shot-creation growth in his second year of college. I think *low-end* he's a premier 3&amp;D wing, high-end he's a All-Star shot creator &amp; lockdown defender.  Similar rationale is also why I'm high on Moses Moody even though this question isn't about rookies."
mikal bridges (ignore my flair)
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges will be the best player on the Suns in his prime.
I have no clue so I'm gonna go with Mikal Bridges
from what i've seen mikal bridges probably
Not sure if he’s the best but I’ll give a shout-out to Mikal Bridges; very good at timing his cuts and finishing at the rim with his long arms.   Opponents tend to hide their worst defensive G/F on him so he takes advantage of them falling asleep.
" Mikal Bridges, routinely guards the best scorer on the team night after night but didnt even get a mention for the all defensive teams"
"Who on this list is he definitively better than? I mean maybe if he was in the same role as sexton he could put up better numbers, but maybe not. I dont like him as a prospect more than sexton. I don't think barret is trash, but even Mikal Bridges has a better role in todays nba, even if he isnt a bucket getter like RJ"

"Having only looked at the Suns on this list, how the fuck did Cameron Payne make any list? And if he made the list, how did Mikal Bridges not make the list?"
Mikal Bridges  He showed flashes of his offensive ability more and more last season and I think he's ready to average 16 to 18 points per game.  He has already shot 50/40 for 2 straight seasons.
"You're literally saying that Ayton/Crowder/Bridges can provide a similar level of defense as:  Toronto:  * Siakam: Long and bigger than 2/3 of the Suns wall you're mentioning * Leonard (a DPOY level defender, very strong)  * Gasol: Former DPOY, amazing hands and IQ  Miami:  * Butler: 1st team defense level, strong * Bam: Almost DPOY level * Crowder: is Crowder  Phoenix:  * Ayton: Young, but not even 2nd team defense. Still gets bullied by Giannis strength wise. Not to mention foul trouble * Mikal: The weakest one out of everyone, length means nothing here if Giannis can carry you * Crowder: is Crowder"

The following roster averages close to 76 PPG - 76.4 PPG to be exact:     PG: Jrue (17.7 PPG)   SG: Mikal Bridges (13.5 PPG)   SF: PJ Tucker (2.6 PPG)   PF: Giannis (28.1 PPG)   C: Gobert (14.5 PPG)     I believe this roster for sure is a serious contender - likely even the title favourite. We've got 4 borderline all-defensive players and an absolute stud in PJ Tucker.
"Lots of people saying OG and Bridges, so let's compare objectively:  [https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/#!/?PlayerID=1628384&amp;VsPlayerID=1628969](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/#!/?PlayerID=1628384&amp;VsPlayerID=1628969)  OG beats Bridges in every stat by *a little bit*, other than blocks, where Bridges is better *a little bit*. Bridges has the better 3PT by about 2.5%, but OG shoots a higher volume (2 more per game), so that makes sense. Bridges has a better offensive rating, OG has a better defensive rating.   From this, I think it's fair to say that Bridges is a little more efficient, but didn't have as big a workload (whereas OG was a pretty central part of the raptors last year) - OG had 5% higher usage.   Also, it's pretty difficult to get a good one-to-one comparison here because of the discrepancy in team strength - OG was playing on a gutted raptors team that missed the playoffs, and Mikal was on the runner-up - so things like offensive/defensive ratings and +/- are for sure going to be skewed here by the context.  So, what does that all mean? Not much. I think all in all, they're *very* close, and I think it's hard to make a compelling argument that one is just straight better than the other for real."
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
PG: Lonzo  SG: Klay  SF: Lu Dort  PF: Mikal Bridges  C: Myles Turner
"Peak Klay. Not sure if we will see it again though  Right now, Mikal Bridges, Covington, OG, Jaren Jackson Jr. Best value is definitely Dort now though."
"He COULD fit the archetype easily.  Top 5 3pt% shooter in the league, and he's a premier defender.  We have to fault him in this conversation because he can do what Joe Harris does just as well as Harris along with a lot more?  OP didn't specify so if you're looking at snipers from downtown who play D, KD can't be ignored.  I gave Mikal Bridges if he's only asking for those 2 facets of the game, specifically."
"""Any player, typically not a star, who specializes mainly in three-point shooting (""3"") and defense (""D""). The term is most often used in the NBA, where this specific skill set has been increasingly valued in the 21st century""  I'm going with Mikal Bridges."
"Dennis probably picked the worst season to bet on himself. A shortened offseason and condensed scheduling leading to the Lakers having multiple extended injuries and could never build a cohesive starting unit.  Then comes the playoffs and he's actually good in Games 1-3. The problem then was Davis goes down, which results in Mikal Bridges switching on to Schroeder on defense. Bridges is an incredible defender against guards, and that's how you get 3 straight terrible games for Dennis to finish the series, including a goose egg in Game 5."
Counting all-around game along with 3 &amp; D: Kevin Durant  3&amp;D alone: Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is up there all things considered.
Mikal bridges maybe?
"Danny green, Mikal Bridges, OG"
&gt;84 mill to 5.9 mill  Mikal Bridges really cost this guy tens of millions of dollars lol
Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
It’s kind of like would you rather a 30% chance of Mikal Bridges or 1% chance of Giannis?  * hypothetical odds and comps
"Depends how you define *high* like, I’d say he has a chance to be in a Mikal bridges type role for us. I’d say that’s pretty high because we don’t need him to be an all star for us."
"Ignore the other posts they're vastly underrating those guys to hype Dirk up as if what he did isn't impressive without embellishing.   Kidd = Conley/Lowry type vet PG  Terry = Clarkson if he was a legit passer/rich man's Delon Wright  Marion = Mikal Bridges level defense, similar offensive value even though their games are different  Tyson = Clint Capela but DPOY level, or middle class Gobert  Dallas had a strong ass roster, people just expected them to choke."
"I like Isaac a lot as a player. Unfortunate he’s been absolutely riddled with injury. Almost like a worse shooting, supersized Mikal Bridges."
"True as long as you have players with specific skillsets.  I think you can make an entire team out of guys 6 foot 5 to 6 foot 9.  Heres an entire starting 5 of 6’6 guys.  PG: Lonzo SG: Lavine SF: Mikal Bridges PF: Zion C: Draymond  Also for better or for worse the Bulls starting 5 coming up is basically all wings + Vucevic lol  Lonzo, Lavine, Derozan, Patrick Williams, Vucevic"
"Mikal bridges does the same thing for rhythm. Seems like he’s automatic every time he does that but when he doesn’t, he misses"
he looks like Mikal Bridges and Cam Payne had a quick son during the playoff run
Mikal Bridges will win after averaging 20+ppg
"Yeah now I understand more the articles from year ago when Suns followers were saying that with Oubre there is little ball movement, and with Mikal Bridges it just moves more and better."
Mikal Bridges is the answer.
Mikal Bridges
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."

"Fred Vanvleet, Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges"
"The problem is that the qualifying system wouldn't allow for NBA players to participate.   That said, I think a team something along the lines of:  Nerlens Noel-Mikal Bridges-Derrick White would be a fun team."
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
mikal bridges?
I think a better comparison for Kuminga would be Harrison Barnes with great defense. Moody could fall in between Mikal Bridges and Middleton
"I can see Kuminga playing a modified Iggy role — aggressive and attacking the rim, providing switchable defense and good passing.  For Moody he can be our Mikal Bridges. They’re very similar from a physical and skills standpoint"
"Good call I love Mikal Bridges, he’d be a great pair with OG for this scenario actually, he’s not as proven defensively but I respect the fearlessness he had going at LeBron in this playoff run, also shoots better percentages across the board than OG, albeit on less attempts (OG low key shot .398 on 6 3’s a game this season)"

"I was gonna say the offensive gap is so huge that it bridges the defensive gap, but wow mikal is really an efficient scorer"
Mikal Bridges  Excellent 2 way player that doesn't have any major weaknesses and always makes the right play for the team.
"We could have had so many guys who weren’t Knox. Both Mikal and Miles Bridges, MPJ, and Shai all went within 5 picks after him.  Pain."
Is that where the Mikal Bridges are?
"They literally are worse than all 3 teams fully healthy.  ""duh duh it was a sweep Murray wouldnt have changed anything duh""  its not just no Murray vs with Murray. If the roles were reversed, the Nuggets would have Murray, Dozier and Barton while the Suns would be MISSING Booker, Mikal Bridges and like Cam Payne. 100% the Nuggets would have swept this team the same way the healthy Suns swept fucking Campazzo, Austin Rivers starting backcourt."
"Mikal Bridges, borderline all star isn't even on this list, but KD is number 1? Make it make sense."
"Mikal Bridges is a good example. Derozan is certainly a better basketball player than him, but I would consider Bridges a better NBA player and therefore more valuable to an NBA team in a game 7 of the NBA finals for instance (barring the need for a primary scorer ofc). You're right that colloquially when people say better NBA player, they also mean better basketball player in a vacuum, and that is where I disagree with most people because I think there is a difference. Media people/analysts are also certainly thinking the same as other fans in that if you asked Kendrick Perkins who was a better player, Bridges or Derozan, he'd 100% say Derozan. There is just no consensus way to describe such players and saying ""better"" can be confusing."
"I’m not saying that. I’m saying it’s not as bad as you’d assume, and not as bad as guys like Ben and Russ.   And if you think the guys I listed, fox, Morant, Sabonis, Ingram, I’ll throw in some more that have bad defence like Vucevic, Westbrook, cj etc, are all around top 50 who exactly do you have above them ? That seems completely absurd but I’d love to hear if you have actual takes or if to prove your point you’ll throw guys like Mikal Bridges in there.  I’m also being extra reasonable by not including guys like Beal, Mitchell, Trae, Zion and kat who have bad- terrible defence."
"If Mikal Bridges insists on getting $20M+ extension, I'd send him in a sign-and-trade deal with Saric and Jalen Smith. CP3, Book, Simmons, Ayton would be fun to watch."
"28 games is a great sample size to start for now imho, and his game would keep up easily  When he came back he obviously wasn't 100 percent as he didn't end up playing in the next series. He also did not get the injury back in the knicks series so obviously that meant he wasn't 100 percent so that statement is false  Mikal averaged 13, great efficency, and great defense OG averaged 16, great efficiency and great defense Hunter averaged 16, great efficiency and great defense  The reason Mikal gets praised is simply because of the finals run, had Lakers not been injured with AD, Suns COULD'VE LOST  I didn't count them out yet Same for the Nuggets series but, idk why i just think they couldn't have gotten past the first or second round if both teams were healthy, none the less, Bridges is just known better here because of the finals run from the Suns  OG played great but team was just discombobulated  or just terrible, and record shows why  Now right now, do you think Bridges and Anunoby could be a number 2. I dont watch there games at all so I have no say in that  But as a Hawks fan, in those 28 games where Hunter played. Bogy, Gallo, Rondo, Dunn were out of those times. He provided all four of those combined out there, at times he looked like the number 2 with Trae there. If not he was the number 2, record did show other wise, mainly because of coach el pee  But if you say that's not a good sample size, imho in this argument, 28 games is good imho, and it should be used. You really think Hunter wouldn't have kept that up? Eh maybe his averages dip to 14-15 but thats still good  Regarding the spacing thing, yes he only shot 33 from three (32.6 is 33) whilst all Anunoby and Bridges shot over 40  It is terrible, but as I said prior, Hunter was the only known shooting threat the Hawks had at that time. Collins shot 40 percent but isn't known as a spot up shooter, Reddish is terrible from three. Huerter was in a terrible slump early on, heck even Trae was terrible from three.  On the 5 game sample in the playoffs, he was huge from three in 37 percent, during his rookie year he evan shot 36 percent He was only getting better and better but injuries kicked in for both him and our squad, that he was the only known shooter. So he had to jack up some shots. Him and Trae to say the least  TL;DR: No-lifer Hawks fan trying his best to support Hunter At least I am honest to myself"
I feel like Ayton is getting a max in RFA regardless so they could just wait that one out. Bridges is weird because I feel like avoiding letting Mikal go into RFA would be best for the Suns.

"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."

Heck yeah. Imagine a one point game with 24 seconds left and you got a 1v1 with Jayson Tatum vs Mikal Bridges for the game.
Mikal Bridges
"Only 70% of his shots assisted is actually pretty impressive for a 3&amp;D wing, enough to be at least *somewhat* encouraging. Mikal Bridges, another guy in that mold that people seem to be pretty high on, takes 87% of his shots assisted. Jaylen Brown took about 70% of his shots assisted in 2019, and he lowered that to 63% the next season and 58% this season.  More specifically, OG takes nearly all of his threes off the catch, but he self-creates about half of his twos. It's not like he has *no* self-creation ability, he's actually a pretty solid off-the-dribble slasher— adding even a halfway efficient pull-up three or midrange game would open things up for him immensely. Again, that's still not *easy* to do, but it's also a lot more straightforward than if he had no handles to speak of."
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal bridges trips jrue at halfcourt too, shoulda been a foul for that"
Mikal Bridges and TJ McConnell are underrated
"Levert was just as good as Dinwiddie, and it was an insanely low bar to make the playoffs that year. They also had Allen anchoring a top ten defence in the league, a huge reason for their success that had nothing to do with Dinwiddie.   Fred is better at every aspect of the game besides like finishing around the rim. He probably could do that. We just didn’t see him in that situation.  Bertans is a defensive liability that gets played off the court half the time. Boucher is also a very good shooter (albeit on less attempts) but he’s also a good rim finisher and an above average defender. This is like comparing Duncan Robinson to Mikal Bridges"
Mikal and Miles agents have to be looking at that and saying yeah you better pay up. Nate Duncan just ran  through his rookie contract scale extension podcast  and the numbers he came up with for Miles was 4/60 and Mikal I think was 4/84 maybe it was 88. Mikal is more valuable than Gordon and Bridges is maybe a slight rung less valuable but also is 2 years younger. Miles should be asking for at least what Gordon got and Mikal 4/100+
"Mikal Bridges, terrence mann, everyone loves those smiles"
"mikal bridges rightfully should get more OG anuoby and AG, elite defender and very efficient player"
If AG gets 4/92 then Mikal Bridges is going to get something huge
Mikal bridges agent got a baseline now
"Not that it means anything, but if you cross reference the Athletic top 125 with players listed in this thread the order would come out to: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby. Also, havent seen him mentioned yet, but Joe Ingles could be in the mix as well."
1.Mikal Bridges   2. OG Anunoby   3 Marcus Smart   4. Robert Covington   5. PJ Tucker
"Are we sure the Hawks drafted for fit? If you look at their respective drafts, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, Okongwu and Johnson each had a strong case for being the best player left on the board. Yes, they all complement Trae but unless you're a big man who can't protect the rim or a small 2 guard who can't play defense, it's really easy to find players who complement Trae.   The Okafor pick is actually defensible when you consider the fact Embiid's injury history. It's hard to draft around a player who hasn't played a single game for you yet. Plus if they drafted for fit, they would've probably ended up with Justise Winslow or Mario Hezonja. Porzingis would've been a tough sell at #3.   The Sixers' problem is that they didn't draft well, not that they didn't think enough about fit. If Fultz didn't get the yips and they didn't trade away Mikal Bridges, we'd be looking at a lineup of Fultz - Bridges - Simmons - Harris - Embiid. Certainly good enough to win a championship."
"You might as well make an argument for the rest of the board over Trae while you're at it. You know, are we sure that Sabonis and Mikal Bridges aren't better than Trae Young? I'd sure like to see Trae carry a team the way Lonzo has."
Jimmy Butler for JRich is an insane deal even if JRich was a Mikal Bridges level 3&amp;D guy. I think it ended up being a S&amp;T between the Sixers and the Heat so the Sixers were happy to get *something* in return for Butler
"Lmao are you forgetting about Jah at #4, MCW, trading away Mikal Bridges"
Mikal Bridges!
"So weird Simmons is getting all the hate in this situation. The 76ers have been responsible for his development and his utilization. In the same way they were for Fultz. He isn’t worth what you think but you still don’t want him anymore and that’s his problem?   After the playoffs Rivers and Embiid threw him directly under the bus. Not like Rivers has a history of scapegoating players or like it was Embiids first year taking the NBA seriously as evidenced by him finally quitting Krispy Kreme’s to still look gassed as fuck at the end of the 3rd. But yeah Simmons needs to be the only adult in the room and decide to play for people that have openly talked shit about him?   Strange the last couple years that the narrative around Philly has been an organizational problem (look into why Jimmy Butler left, no one seemed to be in charge) but all of the sudden this 24 year old kid is the one reason this team can’t win.  Hilarious we have Barkeley who also forced his way out of philly to never win a ring talking about what is expected of Simmons directly into Shaq who was famous for being physically dominate with no work ethic or reliable jumpshot to be criticizing Simmons.   Anyone ever think this dude shoots jump shots just fine and that’s not what he’s told to do for the team? There was a Rivers quote last year from mid season that was basically “he plays defense, I give a fuck if he shoots the ball”. Then Rivers wants to act like he has no idea what’s going on against the Hawks.   This feels more like backlash against the player empowerment era. The 76ers are mad they spent too much money on Simmons and can’t get a decent return for him. Well sorry guys but this is America and a capitalist system and you don’t always get what you paid for. How are we talking about Simmons and not how poorly the 76ers have managed this situation pretty much at every level?  PS thanks for Mikal Bridges 😏"
"Actually he didn’t draft Fultz, that was Coangelo. And he turned MCW, the 11th overall pick into the 10th overall pick that would become Mikal Bridges. Unfortunately Elton Brand/Brett Brown turned that into Zhaire Smith and the Miami pick"
Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton
As a team though center is locked in with ayton. Sg is locked in with booker aka ben simmons didnt hit this jenner shot either . And you have a god pg. All of which are very expensive to replace because of their talent. Then you add two dogs in mikal bridges and jae crowder. With dario sitting on the bench ready to run around any bench player. Yall have a noice team
"Phoenix Suns: pg chris paul sg devin booker sf mikal bridges pf crowder  c ayton  bench: payne, shamet, cam johnson, jalen smith, mcgee (if we trade for thaddeus young then insert him at pf)"
"Mikal Bridges was at the wedding. He a perfect starting 3 for this squad.   The second team is solid too with CJ, Simons, Layman, DeRozan, Zach Collins (who is obviously healthy on this magical all wedding team)"
Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges
"PG: Chris Paul  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Mikal Bridges   PF: Cam Johnson  C: Deandre Ayton  Bench 5: Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Abdel Nader, Javale McGee, Landry Shamat"
"Starting: Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton Next 5: Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, Javale McGee"
"&gt; Dame exclusively guards other PGs.  Thank you, I’ve not had a good laugh yet today.  In the three games Blazers played the Suns this year, Dame’s defensive assignments were as follows: * Mikal Bridges 17:28 * Chris Paul 3:46 * Devin Booker 3:04 * Jae Crowder 3:02 * Cam Payne 2:09  All of them played in all three games btw.  &gt; They’re both at least always guarding and being guarded by other guards.  Dame was guarded by Mikal for 20:28 over those three games. Far and away more than any other guard."
"What do Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale have in common when it comes to their offensive role? Standing in the (weakside) corner.  Who was assigned to guard them when they played Portland? Damian Lillard.  Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale were also the primary defenders assigned to guarding Dame.  Who was assigned to guard Mikal and Royce when they played Dallas? Luka Doncic.  That doesn't make Lillard a SF. It doesn't make Mikal a PG. That's because Luka and Dame have the same role on defence -- *stand vaguely near the weakside corner shooter and theoretically help on drives, but ideally take a break.*   Lillard doesn't pressure opposing ball-handlers all game long. PatBev does it a lot. Rubio does it sometimes. They have very different defensive roles because they have different skills and play in different schemes.  You're idealising things to the point where they no longer real relation to reality. Fine. You do you. But as useless as positions in the NBA of today, at least on offence the PG position is as well defined as any -- bring the ball over half court, run the largest chunk of PnRs, decide where the ball goes.  At the end of the day the only person for whom it matters who plays at which position is the head coach of that team. That's why positions exists -- so the coach can more efficiently organise players into a cohesive whole. And Carlisle was adamant Luka plays PG as far as he's concerned, and he was the only one whose opinion on the matter mattered."
I don’t think “prime McGee” was ever better than current Mikal Bridges
"Can anyone explain why they put Mikal Bridges above all those guys? He has worse stats than OG, Hunter and Wiggs and OG and Hunter are definitely better defenders than him. I don't get jt lol"
Mikal Bridges close midrange shot
"Jokic and Dame then try to get guys like Lonzo, RoCo, Mikal Bridges, Andrew Wiggins, Jae Crowder."
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There’s a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
"Mikal Bridges  He does everything well and has no real weaknesses. He's going to be a near allstar level player soon, and a perennial defense player of the year candidate as long as the Suns continue winning."
"don't @ me.  trading for noel then failing to make him into anything.  MCW for 2 years of decent production and then gone?  then post Hinkie process,  ben simmons big mental block over jaylen brown/jamal murray/ingram  fultz, another big mental block over tatum/ball/fox  imagine drafting hometown kid mikal bridges and then trading him before he even puts on the jersey once and his moms works for the team.  sixers ""greatest"" hits all make me giggle.   sixers draft strategy:   is he hyped in the mock draft? yes.  can he shoot? who knows.  does he have the right temperament and intangibles? who the fuck cares."
That was the Mikal Bridges pick right? So there's even more trade shenanigans there
He’s worse at 3&amp;D than players like Mikal Bridges and Malik Beasley though
"He was still a stud for me. I won 9-cat off FG%, FT%, steals, blocks, and turnovers.  My best players were Giannis, Thybuille, Mikal Bridges, Draymond Green.   I wish I was kidding. I had a few other bench guys and what not that kept the fg% high, ft% to compensate for Giannis/Dray.. mostly defensive guys"
"KAT and Dlo were injured  all year.  We had the worst coach in the NBA for the first half of the season.  Would you be calling Mikal Bridges garbage if he had to shoulder the load with no Paul or Booker for 60 games and the team lost a bunch?  Looking at raw stats without understanding context, or actually, you know, watching the fucking games, leads to terrible, uninformed takes like yours   Again, you have no idea what youre talking about."
Malcolm Brogdon  Jimmy Butler  Mikal Bridges  LeBron James  Myles Turner  6th man Eric Gordon
imagine they keep mikal bridges instead of trading him
Luka always plays poorly against Ben Simmons or Mikal Bridges. He struggles against long quick athletic guys
"He's ok but still a bust since he never improved since his rookie years and never lived up to his potential. If you're a number 1 pick, at least be an All-Star. He's not even elite on 3's or defense so he's more useless than a guy like Mikal Bridges."
*grumbles about Mikal Bridges *
"I mean, is he though.  The list of players I'd rather have than Wiggins is pretty big.  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, PG, Butler, Tatum, Derozan, Middleton, Hayward, Ingram, MPJ, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges, Powell, OG.  And then it's arguable for Bogdanovic, Barnes, Slo-mo, THJ, Harris, Hunter, Miles Bridges, Morris, Ant, Bey.  I know some of these guys can slide to SG/PF depending on teammates, but that's a lot of guys that can be a SF on a team where it'd be at the very best, Wiggins competing for the starting job.  That's not a good outlook to be paid 30m when 25 guys are at least competing with him or outright better."
"he doesn’t need to be an all star jus do what he did in regular szn, and build off it. jus be that perfect 3rd option and be that 3 &amp; d role literally like mikal bridges"
"Aayton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Devin Booker gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mikal Bridges yelled out, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before CP3 hit the locker room door, former NBA player and assistant coach Willie Green hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
"ofc with filler (spurs have extra FRP from CHI anyway), but also we betting MPJ upside here. giving max for player that have FG assisted at the rate of Mikal Bridges is risky. can he take it next level as creator or he's just elite C&amp;S shooter? you dont want give max for the latter. their offense fine, but you need help on defense for Jamal - Jokic. Gordon - Dejounte at least can balance it."
"&gt;one of the reasons the bucks won is due to their perimeter defense.  The Suns shot 49/38.4/85.7 from 3 over the Finals.   CP3 shot 52% from 3, Mikal Bridges shot 42.9% from 3, Jae Crowder shot 41% from 3, Cam Johnson shot 43.5% from 3.   CP3 put up 62.2% TS, Bridges put up 66.3% TS, Crowder put up 61.2% TS, Johnson put up 67% TS.   They would've shot over 40% from 3 as a team if Booker hadn't taken so many while shooting 26.8%.   &gt;PG is a way better defender than Tatum and say that it’s gonna be hard for him to overtake PG but then u say defense doesn’t matter when involving Trae  The defense wasn't the defining reason that Tatum would struggle to overtake PG, it was one of a bunch of things that I listed.   The point was that PG and Tatum are the same archetype of player and Tatum is strictly worse within that archetype at this point.  &gt;If PG is an all around better player than Trae, then the hawks improve, am I right or not.  You're wrong. All-around better matters when you're ranking players on a list, it doesn't mean that switching a lower-ranked player for a higher-ranked one necessarily improves the team.  Trae serving as the offensive engine for the team is more valuable than getting a much better defender."
"You wanna tell me what would have happened if the nuggets at full strength played the suns without chris paul, mikal bridges and cam payne? Because that’s basically what happened in that series lol"
Mikal Bridges 100%
Mikal Bridges
"Booker averages 30p and 7a, on 50/40/90 shooting on the best team in the West and is right up in MVP voting.  Ayton averages 20p and 14a on the highest efg% in the league while contending DPOY voting.   Yet... it won't even be either of these guys.  Mikal ""The Warden"" Bridges AND Cameron Johnson will both be 25 and 26 next year, and will only improve from what was a great year for both to become the absolute ""Glue guys"" holding together the defence while shooting over 40% from 3. Propelling the Suns to a comfortable 1st seed.   Mikal will be offered Max level contracts when he enters RFA and Cam will be considered the steal of his draft.  They will both become household names. Mikal will literally be the most desired player in the 2022 off-season if he isn't signed to an extension this season."
Mikal Bridges.
Mikal “the warden” bridges!!
Mikal Bridges will develop his own shot and become an all star
"We needed basically everything, not just a center. That team was built for tanking. Personally I wanted Porter Jr. but there's a ton of guys that got drafter after WCJ that have been way better - Shai, Sexton, Mikal Bridges just to name a few. Chandler Hutchinson was ass too."
"I’m a big fan of Mikal Bridges, but he is starting to get overrated. He’s a great 3nD role player, but he’s not a top tier wing."
"When you’re talking about how good a finals team is it doesn’t help to point out how young the players are. Mikal Bridges and Ayton are cool, but are far from making the team spectacular."
"Buddy Hield's contract is similarly bad lmfao, and Barnes doesn't put them over the top. Like if you asked me Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder or Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum maybe different story"
"Wiggins is overpaid and it sounds awful when you hear ""max contract"" but as you said if Wiggins was a free agent he'd get $25M p/y easily.  18ppg 3D wing that can create his own shot. Mikal Bridges is expected to be offered in the range of $20M p/y and Wiggins is easily the better player of the two."
"I would swap Mikal Bridges with OG anunoby. Not a slight against Mikal, I just think OG would be a better fit  All of the 3 and D wing archetype that are physically strong"
Def sounds like a create-a-player name lol but he’s the next Mikal Bridges - with the chance to be more 👀
"Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges, Kris Middleton"
Kawhi    Mikal Bridges  Patrick Williams
Mikal Bridges vs Aaron Gordon
Mikal Bridges is the Warden
"Don’t forget trading away Mikal Bridges, whose mom works for the team, for Zaire Smith, who almost died like immediately after showing up to training camp"
I can see Hunter getting with Mikal Bridges got and Cam getting what Kevin got
We don’t get Barnes if we made the obvious choice in Doncic so who knows?  Maybe Fox would’ve been traded since he never got the chance to show out.  Moving up was such a curse- Mikal Bridges or MPJ was our projected pick- definitely can’t go wrong with either one.
"[This is a good way to actually gauge defensive performances](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630558/head-to-head/?sort=MATCHUP_FGA&amp;dir=1)  There's more context involved with help defence and stuff, and sometimes if a dude gets completely lost on a screen it the tracking doesn't pick it up as guarded by them. For the most part though, this paints a pretty accurate picture of a defensive performance.  Only on possessions when Davion guarded them:  * Devin Booker went 1-3 * Mikal Bridges went 1-2 * Jae Crowder went 0-1"
76ers mikal bridges
"Majority of Mocks draft are the general consensus here, and these things are pretty clear when it comes to the lottery guys and top of the draft.   Exhibit A: best player available of 2016 on draft night was Simmons, not Ingram not Brown  Things do get murkier when you get to a 3-4 range like the 2017 of Tatum and Josh Jackson. Or in your case mention of DSJ draft year  .. but the point remains the same that it was applicable to the draft of Tatum and Mikal Bridges.. Even on draft night they always had the best prospect available right before the selection and the little table of 4 people would talk about who should go where and usually it’s Mike Schmidt with the intel and that represents the consensus."
"I tend to agree with the people sh1tting on this post. Teams trade up or down for multiple reasons and that is they're trying to get the best player possible.  With Mikal Bridges and Zhaire Smith,  did any one look at the pre draft analysis? Imo, the 76ers did draft the best player available at a lower slot and received some reward. They traded up for the best player player available overall in Fultz. That development goes differently has nothing to do with draft night selections .   Jason Tatum could have blown out both knees like Jabari,  Jahlil  Okafor could have developed similarly to Embid . The best player drafted is only truly known years later not at the time of draft"
"One that's kind of interesting is really anything to do with the 16th pick last year.  The Heat gave it up to get Goran Dragic from PHX, Phoenix used it to trade Zhaire Smith and it up for Mikal Bridges from PHI, Philly used it to trade for Tobias Harris from LAC, and LAC used it as the premier pick with Shai and Danilo for PG.   Also, the Gerald Wallace deal for Dame"
It's wild to me that an asset involved in Nash's trade was eventually used for Mikal Bridges lol
"&gt;The 76ers could have had Embiid, *Jaylen Brown*, Tatum and Mikal Bridges had they just picked the best available player with their own pick  FTFY"
Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith
"While this has been true, Sarver maxed Booker, extended CP3, extended Mikal Bridges, and extended Landry Shamet so it's not like he's pinching pennies.    Ownership and management really just don't want to go with a 5 year max on DA and I don't blame them."
"Wow, this is a really good one. I completely forgot about it.  I just looked it up. What's weird is, one of those first-round picks was then traded to Philly in the insane Michael Carter-Williams trade, who used the pick and then traded the player back to the Suns: Mikal Bridges."
I sure hope you mean mikal bridges.
"Jamal Murray, SGA, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Clint Capela"
"They think if they pretend he's Mikal Bridges, he'll actually play like Mikal Bridges"

"PG - Jamal Murray SG - Shae Gilgeous Alexander SF - Mikal Bridges PF - Tobias Harris C - Clint Capela  I just went with what I think might have a great lineup combination of offense to defense. Also, I had MPJ, Fox, McCollum, Allen/Ayton on my honorable list."
He was in the same draft class as Mikal Bridges.
PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: OG Anunoby  SF: Michael Porter Jr.  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Deandre Ayton  Alternate (probably better) lineup is putting MPJ at the 4 and having Mikal Bridges play the 3.

Second year Pistons Forward who mainly occupied a 3 and D role last year but has massively improved his shot creation abilities and for some reason has become an amazing rebounder. He’s also great at off-ball movement and usually makes the right play.  He’s a massive building block for the Pistons and will complement Cade’s game perfectly. Player comps include OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges.

"It never was, it was Mikal Bridges vs OG more than it ever was Miles. Atleast until /u/johnjoe201 was crying about how Miles Bridges never got no posts on /r/nba but OG was in the thread about his 23 point game vs the Mavs, even though Bridges already had a 30+ point game and not a single Hornets fan a thread about it.  Miles Bridges has had a fantastic three games so far this season and I find it funny that Hornets fans would rather come talk about OG than how fucking great Miles Bridges has been this season. Atleast post some of his tracks, best rapper in the NBA easy."
"The draft order of Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai GA, Miles Bridges ... Michael Porter Jr. was a trajedy."

"Yeah MPJ and OG are good candidates, Mikal Bridges is one to keep an eye on as well"
So you don't consider Warriors Harrison Barnes and Mikal Bridges from last year ELITE role players?
"Harrison Barnes/Mikal Bridges type. If Reddish can become an above average 3 and D guy and the Hawks are making deep runs every year, I think they are the winners of the trade."
"Giannas and Zach lavine are the obvious choices.   Low key sleepers is anthony edwards, mikal bridges, Andrew Wiggins"
"I don't hate Mikal Bridges, but I think he looks like Oscar from Shark Tale"
Mikal Bridges is going to take another big step forward this year and make that extension look like really good value. Love the way he played last night.
100% agree.  Fultz over Tatum or Lonzo Not keeping Mikal Bridges Handling of Jimmy Butler Coddling Ben Simmons Drafting Okafor
"The Lakers are going to really struggle against teams with good ball movement. Their perimeter defenders are too old to chase around a bunch of Mikal-Bridges-type dudes. The reality is LeBron can't run a ball movement team because he wants to be the maestro. He's been incredible doing it. But when he can't be Superman in every other respect, that style will struggle against the Phoenix, Utah, Denver type teams. But I think built to beat the Nets/Bucks type teams."
It depends on why. If AD was tryna tell me about the new coin he's investing in you'd be damn sure I'd rather look at Mikal Bridges ass instead or something
He didn't say you could take 2025 Mikal Bridges.
If only Rondo could have used those finger guns to make Mikal bridges go away
Mikal Bridges might just be one of the best off ball players in the league.
"who would u rather have, mikal bridges or lebron james, and you cant say lebron james"
Mikal Bridges and yes he’s our long boi.
"Yeah, and Mikal Bridges is better than LeBron."
"Wow I think I struck a chord. Sorry man I didn’t mean to trigger you that much. Ground your chakra, think about your reply, and just nail it the first time. I can’t keep up with 3 reply’s to my 1. Kinda like the lakers not keeping up with Mikal bridges"

Mikal Bridges is the future. Holy Hell
MIKAL. BRIDGES. !!!
"no I'm gonna fight like hell, just like Mikal Bridges fighting through a screen or Cam Johnson on a close out to the open shooter."
"Without thinking too much about it I feel like the Suns have a number of guys you could slot into it.  CP3 (About as pure PG as you get)  Tyler Hero (Not really big enough for the 3, lacks the handle to be a 1)  Mikal Bridges (Can't really play the 4 much, not really a 2 either)  Tobias Harris (Would struggle to slot up or down for too often)  Deandre Ayton (Can't really play him anywhere but center)  It would be a good team. While no 1 guy is super versatile positionally they fit the molds really well and would mesh well together. SF/PF is really tough because they're so swappable these days. I'm sure there's probably some better picks for this that I'm not thinking of."
"The JJ China video, the Bjelica thing, the draft night humiliation of Mikal Bridges' mom, Furkan requesting a trade that one time"
i wonder what kinda contract he gets compared to Mikal Bridges.
They are Philly boys. He also gave a shoutout to Mikal Bridges for his extension the other day.
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."

Oh yeah if aron baynes was younger maybe it'd be him but yeah Ayton is otherworldly gifted physically if only he could dribble even half as well as mikal bridges (who himself isn't a great dribbler) then I'd imagine Ayton just barrelling into people.  But yeah jokic is fucked with how strong he is he may not be the quickest cetber but dude definitely can absolutely bulldoze people
MPJ is extremely efficient when he gets his shot but he's not super good at getting opportunities to shoot at times  Mikal Bridges is keeping him from getting the ball
Mikal Bridges
"If we are doing the one game sample size thing, Mikal Bridges last game played he was 7/6/2 on 3/7 shooting and 0/1 from three. Mikal Bridges not doing so hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"yeah it's a stupidly good deal. mikal bridges gonna make 20 a year when he is 23. duarte is gonna be on his rookie deal hitting his ""prime"" who you rather pay? i dont think i'd be that surpricing if he at least competes with mikal. he is just making quarter of what he pulls. michael porter jr gonna be on 207 over 5 years... i'd take duarte over that really."
"if you listen to McDonough every good pick was McDonough's idea and every bust was Sarver's idea. He's quick to point out that he drafted Booker and Ayton but is pretty quiet about Alex Len, Tyler Ennis, Dragan Bender, trading up with Bogdan Bogdanovic for Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, and Elie Okobo. McD was even sniping the Mikal Bridges pick saying he wanted to get Sahi instead when bridges had his shooting hitch but now is suddenly all in on Mikal now that hes proven to be one of the best 2 way wings in the league. You cant trust anything this guy says about the suns  His tenure oversaw the absolute worst period of history for a franchise that had never been a bottom dweller but if you listen to the guy on twitter youd think hes a genius. Its pretty damning that the team was turned into a finals contender two years after he was fired with 80% roster turnover."
"Pj tucker is a 3 and d guy who doesn't shoot a lot of 3s and is losing his defence as time goes on The role he plays has evolved to a point that players like mikal bridges exists or Oj and guess what tucker has maybe 4 years left before he reutres at most the bucks have to do a risk assessment of do we want a player that will be difficult to trade because they are under luxary tax or if they just save him as a bench warmer because bucks don't want to play him much besides very specific matchups as he ages.   There isn't many teams who would want to trade to trade for tucker that also have the assets to do so that fit what the bucks would want so they had to determine is a pretty sizeable chunk of luxary tax money worth it for a dude who harms their team more than he helps them because of how their roster is constructed.  I'm not saying it's correct what they did I can't say for sure but there is a reasoning behind it and owners are justified for not wanting to go too over the luxary tax especially for some of the ""poor"" owners like sarver God I want him to sell the team and fuck off but I understand the dude is like working class compared to some of the other owners"

"Literally had this conversation this morning in my friends groupchat. Here are some of the strange things we've seen from the sixers the last 10 years:  1. Ben's current BS / his refusal to shoot a basketball 2. Fultz forgetting how to shoot a basketball with proper form 3. The Andrew Bynum fiasco 4. Drafting Okafor at 3rd overall, a huge bust. Was waived by the Hawks last week, borderline out of the league at this point 5.  Traded Mikal bridges for Zhaire smith, he ate sesame, almost died and is now out of the league 6. Colangelo and wife had burner accounts dissing everybody on the team and their colleagues (""find a new slant"" , big collars...) 7. The Process"
More Mikal bridges scoring. Even the coach and players have been talking about how mikal needs to get more opportunities to be a ball handler
"In simpler terms, I think the Suns are trying to find a way to get a younger star to replace CP3's impact, ideally with Ayton on the team as well and Brides too. Hence why Jones and the Suns wanted to offer a 3-year or 4-year max, either as trade bait or as salary cap space coming off the books to allow more cap space. I think the Mikal 4-year deal and especially the Paul 4-year deals (with only 2.5 guaranteed, most likely 3 years) and the Shamet 4-year deal (with only 2 of those 4 guaranteed) adds to that theory as well.  To add to that, I think the Suns with that logic in mind are leery of being max'ed out (pun intended) in being able to having the two rookie max deals they are limited to and thus limiting options in terms of what younger stars they can chase. So I do think they are OK with Ayton getting a max, but the 5-year thing and the fact teams are limited to only two players on 5-year rookie max deals made them hold off on Ayton for now.   I hate how the process played out though and I hope this doesn't affect Ayton and the team (though it probably will at least short-term), but I can see in a small way the Suns intentions. At least they are planning ahead for the post-CP3 years.  In the end, I do kind of get the Suns thinking honestly, and I think the cheap old Sarver may not necessarily be the thing here regarding DA given the Bridges and Shamet deals. But at the same time the optics still are bad, and James Jones better knock whatever plan he has out of the park."
"I know Sarver's history but yeah you're just not gonna convince me he currently is some massive cheapskate when he has empowered James Jones, who just made decisions that brought them to the finals, and also just gave CP3 a gigantic deal like 4 weeks ago. So are these guys all dumb, or smart? because again they made the finals last year with two all stars. I'd kill for that level of dumb. The Mikal Bridges deal is unbelievably savvy as well.   Everyone needs to just take a step back. There is no business reason to give Ayton a 5 yr max this offseason, I know he's probably disappointed but the CBA specifically gives teams this power. If you want that max show up and be playoff Ayton for 82"

He’s been super busy being a footnote in every Mikal Bridges article ever written.
Mikal bridges got the max?
It’s quiet basic one Mikal Bridges would simply sit on another’s shoulders and they can hook shot over Ayton
"Clint Capella. Great comparison. He was a couple of years behind Ayton in terms of development, but his age 24 season (with Harden and a mostly injured) compared nicely to Ayton's age 22 season (with  Book and a mostly healthy Paul).  The fact that he is so much like Clint Capella is exactly my point. He's better than Capella, of course, but he's just not a max guy. Role players are never max guys. He's a great role player though.  I mean, honestly, do you think he's worth nearly twice Mikal Bridges?"
"\&gt; NBA finals run, you give him what he wants and figure the rest out later.  When you have your own money to spend on a team, you go throw max deal at a 14/10 guy and deal with luxury tax implications later.   Just because the team reached the Finals, it doesn't mean everyone on team are equally deserving. Cam Payne, Nader, and Mikal Bridges understood that, and they got paid."
Luka for MVP  Green for RotY  Nwora for 6MotY  Mikal Bridges for MIP
"&gt;	No body played harder or had harder assignments than Ayton  Mikal Bridges would like a word about your ""harder assignments"" take there"
"Yeah I'm gonna disagree. Ayton is not worth twice the value of Mikal Bridges. Depending on the night, they basically take turns being the 3rd best player on the team."
"Mikal Bridges and Landry Shamet, if Chris Paul is still there, CP can make any decent center look good, Some of you guys thought DJ was the best center in the league for a while because of CP3."
"Might be unpopular, but I think this Shamet deal is pretty good. Under 11 for a complementary shot creator who can play with any of your guards is a good deal. And I think Shamet has more room to improve too as a secondary facilitator as well (could be a good long-term fit next to Booker too). The Suns still lack a sure long-term secondary shot-creator and scorer, and while I think Ayton can be that guy if the Suns believe in him long-term (more on this below), Shamet is another good fit for that.  That being said, the main elephant in the room is still the lack of an Ayton deal. If the Suns don't want or don't value Ayton long-term - which is looking more like the case, just work out a trade and let him go to a place where he can be appreciated. I like the Mikal and Shamet deals a lot sure but it's inexcusable to not have Ayton signed given he's still far more important long-term than those two.  It's beyond stupid sure since there is no big man remotely available that could be had for the Suns that could A) elevate the team further than expected improvements from Ayton and B) prevent the defense single-handedly collapsing due to loss of Ayton (Ayton may not be as good an individual defender as Bridges - though he's pretty good too as we saw v Jokic - but he's a more important team defender than Bridges since the defense will collapse without Ayton unlike if Bridges isn't there)...but the Suns have made their bed on DA.   If the Suns brass think they can remain competitive for the next half-decade plus by replacing Ayton with someone like Nerlens-type player, they are beyond deluded and stupid. But again, they have made their bed on this and on Ayton."
I actually think paying mikal first makes sense because you lock him up cheaper for the next 4 years in case he blossoms into a max player.  Aytons already at that level so you're gonna pay him the same basically this year or next. But if Bridges has a great season it would've costs the Suns a lot more

And so, Williams went outside and sat by the desert while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, we got Mikal Bridges on our team,'"" he said. ""'The best defensive player in the world is a Phoenix Sun.'"""
"Being honest it's not Mikal Bridges, maybe in a couple years.  But he better damn well be in the conversation for All-Defense."

"Great game! Congrats to the Suns and their fans - 17 straight is quite a streak. Was hoping to see more of Booker, hope he recovers quickly.  A couple times I thought Bridges and the Suns wings noticeably out-length'd the Warriors perimeter players and there was no answer inside for Ayton. Steph struggled tonight against that length but at least he wasn't grabbed/fouled as much as I think he usually does.. Length + the best solution seems like the best solution against Steph but luckily not many Mikal Bridges exist"

Mikal also guards every teams best player and can already shoot and is still improving on the offensive end. He's going to be a consistent all-defensive player and probably in the all star talks the coming years too."

Mikal Bridges for Most Improved Player
Before the year started someone told me that Hood was better than Mikal Bridges. Yikes
"He has made a huge jump offensively this year, but he’s been an elite NBA defender since basically day one. [This](https://youtu.be/0hFNHp_hNe8) is an 11-minute defensive highlight reel from just the first half of his rookie season. It starts with him absolutely bottling up Chris Paul. Who knows, maybe that stuck in Paul’s head when he decided to join the Suns.  Bridges just locks people down. Some call him the Warden, but all agree he is owner and presiding officer of [Mikal Jail](https://mobile.twitter.com/BookerElite/status/1341989658029301761/photo/1). He locks someone up damn near every game. He’s locked whole teams up before. It’s actually getting so crowded in there that there’s talk of building a prison."
"so blessed to be able to watch all time greats such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Mikal Bridges, etc."
"For this season, people can look at his box numbers and try and judge him but as a Suns fan who has watched every game, he’s easily one of the best defensive bigs in the league. He’s elite as a defender.   Offense will most likely stay the same this season because we’re playing fundamental basketball. He’s screening, rolling to create space for shooters like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges, rebounding and defending. The occasional shot he gets goes in most of the time."
Mikal Bridges
"&gt; You are really arguing Cam has been better than Mikal Bridges it is just beyond absurd.  I never said that. What you have done is something called [strawman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man). I suggest reading it up because it is something that many people here often resort to doing like you have here.  &gt;You are cherry picking a few stars when almost all the numbers would say Mikal has been much, much better.   I never said Mikal hasn't been much much better. I just said some advanced stats also favor Cam Payne. Once again you should look into strawman that I linked above, you could learn a lot from it.  &gt;Pure on/off is a bad metric  Every advanced stat with 10 game sample size is a bad metric. That is a big reason many of them aren't even available like PIPM, Raptor, TPA (outside of twitter), and real plus minus.  &gt;Win shares VORP TS% PIPM  You are the one cherry picking advanced stats and even using advanced stats that aren't available yet. I just said some favor Cam Payne. Once again you will benefit greatly from reading what I have stated and reading about strawman that I posted above."
"Doesn't matter, won't matter. It's Mikal Bridges. Say it."
"You are really arguing Cam has been better than Mikal Bridges it is just beyond absurd. You are cherry picking a few stars when almost all the numbers would say Mikal has been much, much better.

"I will forever be furious we didn't draft Eric Paschall. Him and Mikal Bridges, both, are guys that I wanted the Jazz to get, but Bogy has done well enough for me to get over Bridges, but Paschall would easily have been our 2nd best bench player last playoff."
Y'all jinxed Mikal Bridges tonight
~~mikal bridges~~ langston galloway
MIKAL BRIDGES
"Who does Delon Wright remind me of? I wanna say Michael B Jordan, but I'm not completely sure...  Edit: autocorrect. Meant to say Mikal Bridges"
"Game thread last time against the Bucks didn't even have 20 comments total at the end of the game. Today, the game isn't even started and there are at least 20 comments simply saying ""Mikal Bridges""...  I'm so fucking confused right now. Go Pistons!...?"
"They're for real, but the jury's still out on Ayton. He needs to find offensive consistency to become an all-star, probably won't happen this year. Honestly at this rate it might be possible Mikal Bridges makes an all-star team before Ayton"
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Did I miss something? Why is everyone saying Mikal Bridges??
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges.
I’ll call him Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges could of been a sixer. Thanks for him.
Mikal “about to be make $25M per year” Bridges
Did you guys know that Mikal Bridges is my father?
"But I think you have to compare Bridges to last year's OG because he signed his extension early this year. At that time, OG had had some injury troubles his first two season, was still pretty low volume from 3 and had a slightly lower usage than Mikal does this season. I don't think last year's OG is much if any better than this year's Bridges, although he was 2 years younger. I think if Anunoby was negotiating an extension today he'd get more than he did this offseason, because being able to take 6 threes a game and dial up his usage is huge. I think getting Bridges at 20 would be totally fair; he probably does have less upside than OG, but he's also an iron man which is a point in his favor."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"So will Mikal, who is often a non-factor on offense(especially in the clutch) and hasn't played inspired defense since the All-Star break. Suns' fans refuse to criticize him because he plays The Right Way, but most 13ppg scorers with inconsistent defense don't end up justifying a max extension.  Bridges might be the only future max player in the league who can score 0 points in games twice in the same week and not catch any criticism from their fans. I wish I loved anything as much as Suns fans love denying Mikal's limitations as a player."
Mikal Bridges should fire his agent if his agent brings him anything short of a max extension.
Mikal is great at what he does I just think OG is slightly better. Imo OG is the best wing defender in the league while being a slightly better 3 point shooter (exact same percentage but more volume). While he's less efficient overall I think that's because he's forced to create for himself a lot more than Bridges is making him the better scorer. He's also a slightly better rebounder.   They're extremely close but when it comes to 3&amp;D guys I think OG is the cream of the crop.
Malcolm Brogdon  Malik Beasley  Mikal Bridges  Miles Bridges  Marvin Bagley
"Top 10 isn't crazy bad but it get bad pretty quickly with 2k lol. Ben Simmons is 36th overall behind Deaaron Fox, Kristaps, and Derozan. CJ's rating seems really low. Mikal Bridges is rated higher than Jerami Grant. Embiid and Seth Curry have the same 3pt rating. 2k has a lot of wack ratings lol"
"regardless of what anyone in this thread thinks, both knox and frank have a lifetime to turn it around. they're both younger than mikal bridges. having said that, i dont see the knicks as the place where that development happens, especially when they've effectively been replaced with quick and toppin."
"Yeah, we added Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Torrey Craig on top of not losing Ayton.  Add Crowder/Craig/Payne/Ayton to any team and they improve a ton.  Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are playing amazing this year as they have another year under their belt.  I'm not saying Paul isn't making us better, he obviously is, but people acting like he is the sole reason why we are good this year are ignorant at best.  Incredibly young team.  If we just ran it back, we are probably around 5th or 6th this year in the west."
Or Mikal Bridges.  Or Miles Bridges.  Yeah.....
"It was basically the ""he's young, so he'll definitely make major huge leaps"".  Basically the same reason why Kevin O'Connor loved the Mikal Bridges for Zaire Smith trade, and called Smith a ""way better prospect"".  He's younger, therefore he will become way better.  Speaking of Mikal Bridges, I remember on our sub, one thing that was posted at the time was ""If you goal is to make the playoffs, draft Mikal Bridges.  If your goal is to win a title, draft Kevin Knox"". Talk about a take aging like milk."
"Chris Paul isn't even the sun's best midrange shooter it also helps that Ayton goes toe to toe with gobert really well, offensively and defensively.  That and mikal bridges locks up d mitch and makes him look much worse than he actually is"
"First team: OG, Smart, Jingles, Joe Harris, Mikal Bridges.  Second team: Capela, Crowder, Kleber, Covington, Fa$tPP - (no bias I swear)"
"Honestly mikal bridges Dude is amazing and will likely. Blossom into an all star  He was in the dpoy for a while (which means you can help patch up treas shitty defence) , gives trae an amazing 3 point shooter to pass to, can drive to the rim, and he is learning to create his own shits which puts less pressure on trae to actually facilitate"
"A young up and coming team already with established (if still rising) talent in Booker, projects like Ayton. They pick Mikal Bridges and trade for Cam Johnson in the 19 draft (a widely panned trade, too), hire Monty Williams as offense guru, go on an inspired 8-0 run in the bubble, then flip basically Rubio, Oubre (who now can't shoot) and a pick for Chris Goddamn Paul. Get Crowder as wing help and boom: kickass 6 man rotation, plus guys like Saric who's a great small 5, and Cam Payne staying good. That's exactly how you parley being young and up and coming, and getting better right now without losing any of that long term hope. Monty's added a real offense, snd credit to James Jones, the Bridges and Johnson picks basically got them here"
"Ultimately a lot of analysts will consider players in terms of what they bring to deep playoffs teams. There isn't much place for Russell Westbrook on one of those if you consider how defenses treat him in the playoffs and how much shooting you need to place around him for him to be effective.   So yes, he's better overall player than a Mikal Bridges or Joe Ingles. That goes without saying. But what does it actually mean in the long run? We should be able to distinguish between a player's box scores/first-order impact and their fit/flexibility/second-order impacts. Russ is incredible at the first but quite low on the second. I think Nate Duncan considers the second to be way more important when ranking players"
"Mikal Bridges is the one, he would fit perfectly on every team"
"What’s your definition of a role player? If it’s just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who’s just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don’t require super high usage."
Mikal bridges sheesh
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is developing into one of the premier 3nD wings in the NBA. The kind of guy literally every team in the NBA would want.
If you've got something like:  Luka / Beal / Mikal Bridges / Aaron Gordon / Capela  you're certainly a contender.
Shoutout to Mikal Bridges. He’s such a great glue guy for the overachieving suns. Plus he’s turning into that guy that every team will want when he’s a FA. Just a great fit with anyone.
Mikal Bridges? The Suns are the 2nd best team in the league and Bridges it their best defender
1. Luka  2. SGA  3. Trae  4. JJJ  5. Ayton  6. Sexton  7. Mikal  8. Bridges  9. Mitchell Rob  10. MPJ  11. GTJ  12. Brunson  13. Bagley  14. Donte
If dort gets in over Mikal Bridges...
"Exactly, people always laugh at the Knicks for taking Knox. But in reality the more sensible move would’ve been Mikal bridges or miles bridges."
"s/o to Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson for hitting3s to keep the game in favor of the Suns, we would have likely pulled away before CP3 came back to finish the game tbh"
Mikal Bridges is really good at basketball
Mikal Bridges actual nickname is the Warden which is better than all the dumb shit they have on bball ref
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14. Duncan Robinson  15. Kevin Huerter  16. Wendell Carter Jr  17. Donte Devincenzo  18. Shake Milton  19. Kendrick Nunn  20. De'anthony Melton  21. Afernee Simons  22. Lonnie walker  23. Marvin Bagley III  24. Jae Sean Tate  25. Landry shamet  26. Josh Okogie  27. Grayson Allen  28. Mo Bamba  29. Mo Wagner  30. Kevin Knox"
I think mikal bridges could end up being really good and a good season like this they could end up attracting a star
Billups- Lowry   Rip- Middleton   Prince- Mikal Bridges  Ben Wallace- Draymond Green  Sheed- Aldridge
None.  We already have Mikal Bridges and will need to pay him soon
"There are 30 teams in the NBA who are actively looking for these kinds of players and whom they would be a good fit for. It's always far far easier said than done. And alot of these guys who are called 3+D lists are really either  a) The Gary Trent types who are great shooters but who's reputation as some kind of defender is pretty fraudulent.    b) Or the Josh Richardson types who people say ""are floor spacers"" but nobody actually guards, teams are fine letting shoot and provide no actual gravity or real floor spacing ability even if their %s are ok.   The legit 3+D wings like Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby arent that common, and they arent really going to be available."
"I have to admit, I can see it being considered top 4 all time in a decade, depending on how the guys develop, but there's a ton of talent. Besides Luka probably being a future MVP, this draft could overcome other top-heavy ones with it's depth. I think Ayton, Bagley, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Mikal &amp; Miles Bridges, Michael Porter Jordan, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Timelord, Gary Trent Jr., Shake Milton are the notable ones."
You could say he’s trying to mend some (Mikal) bridges
Mikal Bridges some would say
"What’s up Bucks fans who doesn’t watch any Suns games. Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Deandre Ayton have taken massive leaps this season. They’re not the same players they were last year. CP3 isn’t leading the Suns right now to 12 wins above the 8 seed all by himself lmao."
"Off topic, but what do you think is the value of Mikal Bridges? Like a first and a good role player (i.e. campazzo) is enough?"
"I like how George Hill immediately grabs the person closest to him, Mikal Bridges. Doesn't matter if you're teammates or not, that shit was crazy."
"I love that at the end of the clip, George Hill embraces Mikal Bridges at the bottom right of the screen. Wonder what Bridges was thinking at that moment"
Could you imagine if a team had both Thybulle and Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is not our best shooter
I still have a hard time remembering which team Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges play on.
"it's same for us with american names, like miles and mikal bridges, michael porter jr, michael carter- williams etc etc"
[Here ya go](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/insider/story/_/id/31198084/nba-best-25-25-ranking-young-stars-future-potential)  Mikal Bridges and Tyrese Haliburton??? Get them the fuck off this list. LaMelo at #3 before all those other proven dudes is the biggest joke of 2021.  They have Sabonis below Mikal? 🤨  These three ESPN “writers” are hot sweaty ass.
Mikal Bridges with less shooting but better scoring ability
"Not even that, it’s just hard to be 280 at that position. Guys like Mikal Bridges, Middleton, KD, that’s who Zion will be guarding. It would be really hard for him to carry that big ole’ body of his through screens all the time, something MPJ is no necessarily the worst at though he is 6’10"
"Don’t know if it would be the top, but I’d take cam Payne, cam johnson/Jae crowder, and mikal bridges."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
I love Mikal Bridges
MIKAL BRIDGES IS THE GOAT. I SWEAR IT.
Yeah I agree but this post is about miles bridges not mikal bridges
"honestly, as a someone who has potential to be franchise player and walking 25/12, he should not defer to Mikal Bridges and especially not to freaking Jae Crowder  i get that he's still 3rd option but it should be much more clear"
76ers traded mikal bridges
"Not to mention Mikal Bridges. Clippers wanted to trade Harris no matter what, Sixers could have easily gotten him with their own picks and not needed the Miami pick to execute that trade.   It’s really a testament to how asset rich Hinkie left the organization for them to be the 1 seed after some big time clown moves."
"You brought up ft% thats why I brought it up. Rjs ft% is what mostly hurts his ts%  Also you cant compare the efficiency of established players in the league that are 23-24 years old to a 20 year old as justification for who has the most potential. I gave you those fg% as examples of why you shouldn't just judge a 20 year old on efficiency metrics.  Knicks are my second fav team so I watch most of their games. I've seen him play. Hes a solid defender and has been a huge contribute in the knicks sucsess as well as hitting really big shots in the clutch. I honestly dont think you watch them play and you just hop on bball reference, glance at ts% and call it a day.  Do you seriously think a near 25 year old Mikal Bridges has more potential than rj because of his three point percentage? In case you didnt know the guy came in the league 3 years older than RJ and came into the league with 43/33/80 splits. But please, tell me more about Mikal Bridges having more potential than RJ for his shooting splits at the same age RJ will be in HIS 5TH SEASON  Now lets look at Deandre Hunter. At 22 years old (2 years older than RJ) He had shot 41% from the field and 35% from 3.  Your only argument is RJs efficiency (which has dramatically improves over last season) despite me showing you multiple reasons why judging a 20 year olds efficiency stats isn't the best way to assess potential.  Ayton having more potential than RJ is a pretty fair assessment imo."
That was Mikal Bridges wasn't it?
Mikal Bridges for me. Dude is that perfect number 3 or 4 option that makes smart plays on both ends.
"This confuses me along with the Mikal Bridges trade. Perfect story and player for the Sixers system, and they trade him away anyway"
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
"I personally think Ayton is the Suns third best player, but no it's not a joke. Mikal Bridges has a legitimate case."
Mikal Bridges
Yes. I love how well they play together. I like Mikal Bridges a lot
All the dudes that can do that are on one hand and if you think Mikal bridges can guard both KD and kyrie then that’s hilarious
"Mikal Bridges, OG, Giannis, Jimmy Buckets all do this."
"I’d just do what he did in Houston but scale it up a bit. Everyone should be thicc, switchable, able to hit 3s, and good rebounders.  PG: James Harden  SG: Josh Hart  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Anthony Davis"
"I think a few things happened.   First, the Suns actually had Ayton on the floor for a stretch of competitive games. The suspension and injuries last year pre-bubble killed the team.  Second, Oubre being out meant Mikal Bridges could start. His smart, unselfish play on both sides of the floor is invaluable to the Suns. Oubre is fun to watch, but he’s a black hole for ball movement and he’s not quite as good on D as Bridges.  The bench showed a ton of improvement, headlined by the late signing of Cam Payne giving the Suns a real backup PG.  Ricky Rubio showed the league just how much real point guard could help Devin Booker and the young Suns core.  And Booker showed the world what Playoff Book really looks like."
Devin Booker is younger than Mikal Bridges
At least you traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith
I made a post about Mikal Bridges vs MPJ to get other peoples' takes and the results are interesting. Seems like people are pretty split. You should check it out
MPJ has been averaging like 20/9 the last month and a half while mikal didn’t even score last night lol. I love bridges but MPJ is better
"I think this is a great skill vs impact comparison. Micheal Porter Jr is the more skilled player while Mikal Bridges is more impactful to the game, mostly due to some elite defense and decent playmaking skills"
"On the Nets right now I'd take Mikal Bridges.  If I'm a rebuilding team looking for a guy to build around, I take MPJ."
"I never thought he was good. I told my Knicks fans friends during that draft that they should draft MPJ, SGA, or Mikal Bridges"
"Luka dropped 42 pts TD on Mikal Bridges.  The only guy in the league who has a good proven record against Luka is Ben Simmons although Luka scored 27 pts in 3 quarters on a 2nd game of a back to back against Simmons and Embiid, his best performance against the Sixers.  Notable fact is that Luka never played with KP against Ben Simmons and KP is a big part of our spacing and offense."
Just ask Mikal Bridges
"fox, SGA, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Deandre Ayton"
"Mikal is so dope. I was always a 20 year old raw player &gt; experienced college guy but after seeing how impactful Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson have been from day 1 compared to Jalen Smith, Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender, I’m definitely going to value experience a lot more."
Both are good but you could drop mpj for mikal bridges And suddenly have the room to get a all star Instead of vanfleet
Wait someone who isn't a sun fan rating mikal bridges  I'll take it
Jrue - 17.1  Lu Dort - 12.6  Mikal Bridges - 13.2  Lemickey - 25.4  Steven Adams - 7.7
"PG: Chris Paul 16 PPG  SG: Marcus Smart 13.4 PPG  SF: Mikal Bridges 13.2 PPG  PF: Draymond Green 6.6 PPG  C: Nikola Jokic 26.2 PPG  Fantastic ball movement, elite defense, and overall solid enough shooting to make up for Draymond's complete lack of it."
Chris Paul (16) Royce O’neale (7) Mikal Bridges (13) Lebron James (25.5) Rudy Gobert (14.5). Just 76 ppg.
"Don’t worry, there’s still a lot of time. I don’t know about how college days but Mikal Bridges was on a similar where he was a 3&amp;D in college, became a D in his rookie year and now he’s a 3&amp;D&amp;S. S for slasher"
"I think he opts out for a longer contract. They way they’re playing,  Suns should do everything they can to keep him. Don’t they have to pay Ayton and Mikal Bridges soon too?   I feel like that squad is gonna be super expensive to keep together."
Mikal Bridges one rebound in 20 minutes. Dude was so close to the Tony Snell stat line lol
"Tbh I still have hope for Ayton. Worst case scenario you guys trade him and start Saric at the 5? Also, I watched this game and Mikal Bridges is looking amazing. I really hate that we traded him."
"Lakers: Steph Curry.  Nets: Mikal Bridges, Jarrett Allen."
Also traded away Mikal Bridges 🤷
"What you are missing here is that Chris Paul was not the only addition to the Suns this season. Compare the Suns bench from last year to now. Look at how players like Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric have taken significant leaps as contributors. Look at what newer additions like Jae Crowder and Cam Payne have brought.  I get that not a lot of people watched the Suns last year but it was a very different team in more ways than just Chris Paul. As for those 20 win teams, yeah, it's not a surprise that you win more with a supporting cast who can all legally buy alcohol."

We traded Mikal Bridges for him. Rip
Miles and Mikal Bridges always throw me for a loop when looking at their names.
We used the Miami 2021 pick to grab Mikal Bridges so he was kind of yours too.
Mikal Bridges.
BRO WE LOVE MIKAL BRIDGES OUT HERE!! SUNNY SIDE UP!!
I like Mikal Bridges.
mikal bridges
Devin Booker and Mikal Bridges and others
"I'm not sure but I think the perfect types of pieces around Ingram and Zion look something like Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges and Jonathan Isaac. At least two of our starting 5 would need to be pretty great level defensive players but it to work on that end. The reality is we run a pretty legitimate offense even if the roster is a shambles, I just wouldn't be shifting Ingram so soon."
Would love him on the suns. We'd have to give up mikal bridges another player and maybe a first but I think would be worth it.
"To think they traded NCAA champion De’Andre Hunter for Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker lol. To be fair, I can relate Pelicans fans considering the Sixers also traded away Mikal Bridges ahah"
Mikal bridges
"Dort   Mikal ""the Warden"" Bridges   Cam Johnson   GTJ   OG   Herro"
Mikal Bridges isn't number 1 because his jerseys are always sold out.
"&gt; Mikal bridges  Eh, he is already 24.  Probably closer to his ceiling than people realize."
Mikal bridges seems like the type to make one all star game in his career
Mikal bridges too
"Probably Simmons right now. After that you can start to have more conversations about Kawhi, PG, Holiday, Mikal Bridges, and so on (listed in no particular order)."
"**TEAM DRJISFTW**  Fans are excited when the Dr. Jisftw used his vast medical fortune to buy an expansion team. Moreover, Damian Lillard fans are excited that the roster appears well-suited to his particular game, particularly in regards to 3+D wings in Royce O'Neal and Mikal Bridges. Due to the owner's flair, the team is slated to join the Eastern Conference.  Armed with Ben Simmons (well known defender) and those two (underrated defenders), the lineup immediately clicks together and becomes a top 10 defensive unit. Lillard thrives as a result, averaging 25-8 and emerging as a potential MVP candidate due to the stats and the team record, as the group vaults up to the # 4 seed in their first year of existence.  That said, the Eastern Conference is no joke this year, leading to a very difficult matchup with # 1 seeded Brooklyn in round two. As expected, Damian Lillard is a monster in the series, averaging 33 points per game. The team trades punches and trades wins with Brooklyn all series long, going down to the wire tied 3-3 headed into Game 7.  Unfortunately, the game is marred by some shaky officiating, as the refs call quite a few fouls on Dr. J's wings for their physical defense. James Harden ends the game going 12-14 from the FT line, which may be the difference in their 109-105 win. The team goes home salty and disappointed, but confident that they can contend with the best of the best down the road."
"PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Royce O'Neale  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: Ben Simmons  C: Nicola Vucevic   Is this a championship contender? It's an odd ""Big-3"" of Dame/Ben/Vooch, but Vooch provides spacing for Ben to work in the interior. Dame and Vooch aren't the best defenders but you're surrounding them with two 3&amp;D guys and one of the best defenders in the league right now."
I don't think so.  I see Hunter being like Mikal Bridges on the Suns - the above-average glue guy. I still think Collins is that 1B option.
Mikal Bridges  14 ppg on 65% TS with all-nba defense
Mikal Bridges
"Clarkson, Joe Harris, Schroeder, Mikal Bridges, DiVinchenzo have all been solid this year."
"Your team has a very well constructed roster. I attribute most of that to Mikal Bridges, he’s such a good role player"
"Respect the reply but against great teams like Milwaukee and the 76ers the margins are super slim (and unlike most of this sub, I don’t think the Nets are some impenetrable force), especially with a team that severely lacks in wings over 6’7.   Is it the end of the world? No. But the Lakers without Kuzma or KCP would be hampered. The Suns without a Mikal Bridges or Jae Crowder would be hampered a bit.   Long story short, it’s the playoffs so it stings a bit. There’s only but so many players on each roster that you expect to play well on this stage"
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
"Exactly. He wasn’t a terrible offensive player but he’s transformed himself into a top of league level isolation scorer. That rarely happens. For comparison, someone like mikal bridges has very similar early career numbers to kawhii. If he turned into a number 1 option on a championship team it would be nuts!"
Mikal Bridges. He's always been an awesome defender. The offensive potential was there as a rookie but he wasn't quite putting it all together until this year. He's become hyper efficient and there is still tons of room to grow as well. Much more to his game than 3 and D.
I thought Mikal Bridges was going to be another underachieving forward that the Suns wasted a pick on. I definitely don't feel that way anymore
"This team would probably be the favorites to win the championship. Brooklyn would be the only comparable team.   The defense wouldn’t be bad, they have Giannis and Mikal Bridges, which can help elevate everyone else."
The only other guys I can think of that actually give Luka Trouble are Dillon Brooks and Mikal Bridges.
We suns fans probably would have guaranteed that mikal bridges would be the one most ready for the playoffs. Instead cam Johnson and Ayton have played better. Lol
Quietly Mikal Bridges is been run out this rotation
forgot that Miles and Mikal BRIDGES  have no relation with each other whatsoever
Sixers would have Embiid Big Vuc Simmons Holmes Grant TJ McConnell Mikal Bridges(traded draft night 2018)
"Mikal Bridges would have been perfect for the 76ers, I still don't understand why they traded him"
He has the 7th highest value over replacement in the 2018 draft class. 1. Doncic 2. Trae 3. SGA 4. Mikal Bridges 5. Mitchell Robinson 6. Ayton He also has the 7th most win shares behind the same 6 players.
"I think Gasol is just a little too old/slow to give Ayton too many issues, but if the Lakers decided to slot in Trez at the 4 and AD at the 5, that lineup would be really hard to beat.   Our second best rebounder is Torrey Craig and our two bigs off the bench (Saric and Kaminsky) simply can’t defend the paint or work the post consistently.   The Suns can pack the paint like they’ve done effectively against Giannis and Embiid, but I really don’t like the prospects of that in a playoff series.   The Suns can pull it off if our wings get hot from 3. If Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, and Jae Crowder are hitting their shots, we’re very tough to beat."
"That 2018 Villanova team started Brunson, mikal bridges, Donte divencenzo, Eric paschal, and Omari spellman. It’s wild that they had no super stars but started 5 nba players."
"&gt; Lebron had chances to drive against smaller Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges that he didn’t take in order to facilitate more.  yea about that, there is a person called Drummond trying to get position for post up/offensive rebound and ruin the spacing"
Lebron had chances to drive against smaller Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges that he didn’t take in order to facilitate more. I’m sure he’ll take more of those in game 2 and Davis will come out driving inside as well.  Ayton won the first matchup but he will need to be ready for the counter punch
And we had Mikal bridges and traded him for zhaire fucking Smith
Mikal Bridges: Elite role player
"That was a loaded draft: Sexton, SGA, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges  And then Jevon Carter, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham ALL in the 2nd round"
"&gt; The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and **Grayson Allen**."
"The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and Grayson Allen.   Not to mention Marvin bagley!!! ….poor kings"
Mikal Bridges impressed me. allowed Suns to run a single cover on LeBron and double the hell out of AD.  Stopped LeBron getting his teammates going. Forced AD to become the playmaker which he did not do well.
"Relax, he played great last game and kept us in it during the first half when Lebron was getting handled by Wiggins. He’s actually been really solid all year. He just has a tough match up against Mikal Bridges, who’s a borderline all-defense player."
Lebron secretly loves being held captive by Mikal Bridges
Fuck you got me. Idk the bridges name lol like his game though. Miles is on Charlotte?  Edit: Mikal?
Devin Booker is a bad man.  Anthony Davis got bullied tonight by Ayton.  Mikal Bridges is a stud on defense.
LMAOOOO DRUMMOND GETTING BIG BODIED BY MIKAL BRIDGES
Watching Mikal bridges play is pretty mesmerizing
Sixers legends Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric on the floor
Ok dumbass who is going to guard AD and LeBron? Don't tell me it's going to be Ayton and Mikal Bridges that's a fucking joke
"Guys like Dorian Finney-Smith, Royce O'Neale and Mikal Bridges are going to be such X-Factors during this playoffs. Fantastic 3&amp;D players that allow their teams to space their floor with their fantastic 3 ball but also make an impact on defence."
"That pick only turned into Mikal Bridges, no big loss...  Man, I wish we had Mikal Bridges."
"Generally speaking Redditors love certain categories of players.  1. Volume shooter with good TS - Curry, Dame, Beal, Lavine   2. 3 point specialist with high consistency - Ingles, Joe Harris, Clarkson, Seth Curry   3. Lots of blocks and steal - Myles Turner, Thybulle   4. 3 &amp; D specialists - Covington, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  Sometimes they go out of fashion but based on what I have seen here, it is generally true.  Players with 'clutch' reputation also have a lot of goodwill.   On the other hand, Triple double gang has polarized reputation."
Desmond Banes has the opposite build of Mikal Bridges it’s honestly amazing to see
mikal bridges. Traded for that boy from his home town team where his momma worked.
"Kinda impossible to be ‘random’ and have that type of impact in the playoffs but I get what you mean…  **Seth Curry**- can’t be understated enough how much of a non-scorer Simmons is. All it takes is a smart coach and the right defender and he’s practically Draymond green. So, Curry will be that 3rd scorer and I can see him having a 20-25 point timely game   **Joe Harris**- Jump shots will stop falling for 2 of the big 3, and Harris will get open looks and have a 20 point game. Media will jump all over it  for the unsung hero angle   **Mikal Bridges**- he’s not even really random but since it’s vs LA the masses and media will be shocked at anyone other than the big names playing big. Bridges will have at least 1 game where he’s hitting open 3s all game   **Enes Kanter** - Kanter always gets buckets, he’s gonna have that 1 game where he gets enough minutes and shots to score around 20. Denver may be a perfect matchup for him since they will almost always have a traditional 5 in so Kanter can stay on the court"
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
"Omg, he said Mikal Bridges lmaooooo. That dude went from 9 to 13 a game. That’s not much of an improvement in my opinion"
5 Mikal Bridges
"MPJ, Miles or Mikal Bridges, Thybulle"
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"I think Brooks is a very good wing defender, but I don't think he's better than Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Matisse Thybulle, Dort, Draymond, or Jimmy Butler.  And it's hard to label defensive positions with all the switching now. Brooks is a wing defender who just defended Steph Curry, a small guard. We've seen OG Anunoby and Draymond guard like every position."
Mikal Bridges is primed for a breakout in these playoffs.
People really underestimating how good your team is. They think its just CP3 and Booker vs Steph and Draymond. But the Suns role players like Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges are incredibly good. Not even mentioning Ayton who has become a good rim defender.
"Why is it wrong for CP3 to be in the conversation? Obviously he's not gonna win MVP, but he should be somewhere on the discussion ladder. He's the biggest catalyst in the Suns securing the 2nd best record in the NBA this year. He's getting so much credit because he deserves the credit. You can still acknowledge a great signing like Jae Crowder and the development of Mikal Bridges while understanding that CP3 is the main reason why the Suns took this big ass leap to the top. We don't get to see all the behind the scenes shit, but the way the players talk about him paints a pretty clear picture regarding his impact within the organization. Wherever he goes he adds wins, and he showed it again this season with the Suns. Nobody had them winning 50+ games this year."
"I hope we play y’all so Mikal Bridges can average 20+, 80% of Lakers Reddit will talk abt a scrub going off as an excuse for losing when it’s actually Mikal continuing an already fantastic year"
"Ayton and Bridges are amazing, don't disrespect my man Mikal by not even mentioning him"
"All of the young players made improvements (Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jevon Carter, Cam Payne) and the culture of the Suns completely changed. That started last year before CP3. Although CP3 deserves a ton of credit, it's easy to see how Monty has done an amazing job and deserves this award"
"so deandre ayton was awful two years ago, mikal bridges were awful two years ago, they both improved tremendously each of the last two seasons, but monty should get no credit and all the team's improvement was just CP3 and regular development. lmfao clueless."
One of the biggest for sure. He’s made guys like Mikal bridges a lot better.
And told James Jones he would back off and let him do his job. And invest millions into the stadium and new training facility. And be the sole reason we have Mikal Bridges.  I hated Sarver as much as anybody but you have to give him credit
"Me too. That’s why I think they should move him while his value is high. He’s definitely in the way in NO.   NO needs a pass first point guard who can defend and space the floor (Lonzo). They need to run their offense around Zion who deserves even more usage than he’s getting. Surround him with Danny Green and Mikal Bridges like defenders with a low usage rim protector who can preferably space the floor like Myles Turner so the paint is wide open for Zion.   Alexander-Walker can come off the bench and score and still play thirty minutes. Kid has the talent. And then a decent scoring big who plays better defense than Willy.   That’s a lot of work, but it would fix them. Trading Ingram is the easiest way for them to get some of those pieces.   Like imagine if they had Boucher instead of Steven Adams clogging the paint. Would you trade OG and Boucher for Ingram?"
"Zach Lowe's a fucking hater man. Dude has enjoyed a lot of revenue shitting on the Knicks over the years.  And quite frankly, the only necessary argument for Thibs over Monty is so simple to me, a fucking casual could conclude the same logic;  - Phoenix Suns projected win total, and seeding: ~35 wins, top 8 (lower half) West team  - NY Knicks projected win total, and seeding: ~22 wins, bottom 5 team *league-wide*  CP3, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges?  Before the season, nobody would have dared to compare Julius Randle to *any* of them, let alone anyone else on our squad. Look at our talent comparison on paper? Lmfao please dude, what a joke.  Fuck Zach Lowe, and fuck anyone that seriously considers Monty Williams over Thibs for COTY (excepts Suns fans, cause bias, can't blame em lol)"

Mikal Bridges is insanely good.

"Did you see the suns last year?  If Ayton doesn't miss over 30 games in a shortened season, they make the playoffs.  They went 8-0 in the bubble.  They didn't just add CP3 either.  They've added several very good players.  Crowder, Moore, Craig, Cam Payne.  Plus their young players have developed as expected.  Mikal Bridges has become a dangerous shooter and a guy who should be in the talks for all defensive team if not defensive player of the year."
Fun fact: Mikal Bridges hasn't missed a game since middle school.
"&gt;My issue is that Mikal Bridges is also that good   LMAO. If he were as good as Matisse and played 1000 more minutes, he'd be the DPOY.  I don't mean to shit on your guy - in fact, I'd trade them in an instant cause I'm very unconvinced of Matisse's offensive potential - but they're not in the same tier as defenders."
My issue is that Mikal Bridges is also that good and played 1000 more minutes than Thybulle. I'm not inherently against rewarding guys that don't play big minutes but I think there has to be more of a clear gap in performance than there is between Bridges and Thybulle.
"If he only plays 20mpg, mostly coming from the bench, did he guard the best player in the opposing team?   This kind of question makes me believe he doesnt deserve it over mikal bridges / og.   Not saying matisse is a bad defender, he is obviously a great defender and for sure will be an all defense later in his career. Its just only 10 spots available.   Yes, I disagree with murray making all defense too."
"Totally, Jokic playing every game is nearly common knowledge among fans, you might know that about another dude from your home or fantasy team too .  I'm saying if you follow Mikal Bridges that closely even though you don't care about the Suns or have any connection that seems pathological."
I think Mikal Bridges hasn’t missed a game since HS either
"Khris Middleton last year, Tobias Harris, Chris Paul, Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, Mikal Bridges, John Collins were all pretty close-very close"
"Mikal Bridges played all 72, and he’s #1 in my heart."
Mikal Bridges is Kawhi Lite
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
"Give us Mikal Bridges, and we'll consider it"
"We really picked Kevin Knox before Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges and MPJ..."
"Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder Cam Payne and Torrey Craig have all been great in addition to our big 3. You are disrespecting a damn good team by saying they'll be clapped. Chris Paul has been near MVP level, no way a team lead by him is an easy out"
Cam Payne is the best Sun. Mikal Bridges is also the best Sun
"He’s just potential. He’s raw and skinny.   But he’s a 7 footer with some legit guard skill and is easily a great passer for a rookie.   It’s hard to not raise eye brows when he crosses an All NBA level defender like Mikal Bridges, or is shooting off balance threes off pin downs, or naturally doing stepbacks and pull ups at that height. That’s not something we see very often for someone that big.   He was probably the worst player in the league by far before he went to the G League. He’s been better since, but obviously still not good."
“What would a winning trade of Mikal Bridges for Zion look like?”
Mikal Bridges
I like Mikal Bridges
I liked Mikal Bridges before and I didn't even watch Suns games but damn this dude is good
Mikal Bridges is your favorite player's favorite player
Mikal Bridges
I’ll never forgive Brett Brown for trading Mikal Bridges.
Philly coulda had Mikal bridges bro
Mikal Bridges and DeAndre Ayton both not getting a single vote is a goddamn travesty. I'm more upset about that than I am Monty not winning COTY.
"2010,  Nash's last great year.  However, Book and Mikal Bridges (along with CP3 ofcourse) are making the current squad a hard run for 2nd place ahead of Barkley/Majerle's squad in 93."
"2018 can be up there with any of them really. The depth of this class is just stupid.  Luka, Trae, Porter, SGA are stars for the next decade, health permitting.   Ayton, Sexton, JJJ, Mikal Bridges look like high level starters who can be ~3rd best players on a playoff team and should only continue to improve  Robert Williams, Time Lord, Miles Bridges, Trent, Miles Bridges, Graham look like 4th/5th best players on a playoff team  And then the long list of quality role players: Huerter, Brunson, Walker, Donte, Carter, Milton, Holiday, Allen, Brown, Shamet... I haven't given up on Bagley and Knox turning into good role players either, I think they could use a change of scenery."
"Mikal Bridges and Frank Kaminsky. Those two love each other, wholesome af whenever they assist it to the other"
Okoro gonna turn into a smaller but stronger Mikal Bridges
"CP3 is president of the players though, he will give an executive order to give the MVP to Mikal Bridges, and then he will deport Nicholas Joker. Big brain moves"
"Lmao if u filled that lineup with 3 and D guys like OG and Mikal Bridges, I don’t think u have any hope at stopping that lineup whatsoever"
An elite 3 &amp; d role player like Mikal bridges or OG anunoby
"I wanted him, Shai, and Bridges. Hated what we have up to get Mikal, but in the end it was a steal."
Royce O’Neale Dort and Mikal Bridges are all the same type of lovable I don’t make the rules
Yeah well we were one Mikal bridges from taking game 1 so that's just how it goes in closely matched teams. All it takes is one asshole hitting everything from 3.
"It *sort of* changed my opinion, sort of did not. Like credit to him he played great in those two games and really throughout that series mostly.   But I also am very aware that... who's the Mavs best defender / who did they try to guard him with? Maxi Kleber and DFS? Neither is great... So I reserve judgment. The Mavs defense didnt really have a good answer to at least make things difficult on him which the Nuggets did last year with Jerami Grant, and this year will again with Aaron Gordon (should they match up). Both guys are better defenders individually than any Mavs player they threw at him, really. Mikal Bridges is also better, as is Jae Crowder probably, should the Suns and Clippers meet in a WCF.   We shall see is all I'm saying. I still dont overall buy their offense without an elite playmaker. Still think there's too much isolation (though it's better than last year in that respect)."

Does that Shake Milton shot make up for trading away Mikal Bridges?
"Mikal. He has been a lethal 3 point shooter this season, shooting over 40% from 3. He also has size and length with an absurd 7'1"" wingspan.  Dort is very good, but it's Bridges."
he's nice but he's no mikal bridges

Mikal “The Warden” Bridges
You mean Mikal bridges happened. That 5 minute stretch in the 3rd where the bucket was a keyhole and we lost defensive intensity was bridges hitting absolutely everything. Cp3 just came in and cleaned up the remains.
Mikal Bridges
"15-man roster:   **Guards:** Luka, Trae, SGA, Sexton, Brunson, Duncan Robinson, Trent Jr, Shamet.  **Forwards:** Mikal, MPJ, JJJ, Miles Bridges  **Centres:** Ayton, Mitch Robinson, Williams.   A lot of those guards can play the 3, so the rotation would look something like:   Trae, Luka, Mikal, MPJ, Ayton.   SGA, Sexton, Trent Jr, JJJ, Robinson.    Brunson, Robinson, Shamet, Miles, Williams."
Mikal Bridges. Has a more refined offensive game. Dorture Chamber is the man though.
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
The thing about Mikal Bridges is that he has the talent to become a Kawhi lite player. He's already a 40+% 3 point shooter and can develop into a 50-40-90 player. Think the next step for him is to build his frame out a bit and get to the foul line more.
Trae/Luka/MPJ/Mikal/Ayton  SGA/Sexton/GTJ/Miles Bridges/Robert Williams  Could easily make the ECF
"Shai would have been dope for you guys. Suns were gonna pick up Bridges and trade him + a pick for SGA from Philly.    But at the last second, Philly got worried that Mikal wouldn't make it to 16 so they straight up picked Mikal.    And then someone in the front office decided that trading the unprotected Miami pick + Zhaire Smith was worth it.    We didn't get Shai and Philly didn't end up with Mikal in the end, but it worked out well for everyone. We got a great wing defender to put next to Book and Philly used the pick to get Tobias Harris."

Mikal Bridges = more speed and handles  Og Anunoby = More strength and Defence
Mikal THE WARDEN Bridges
"Lol there was a thread post-game last night that was titled ""OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges?"" like wtf is the point and who cares about that comparison"
"Ideally CP3 opts out for a multi-year deal at less annually. We use the new space to lock down Payne and maybe Craig. If we can then get a backup 5 behind Ayton at a reasonable price, I think we're set to see what we can do for a few years. At that point our team looks like:  Guards of CP3, Book, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter on multi year deals  Forwards of Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Centers of Ayton, the hypothetical backup I talked about and Dario"
"I definitely think so. A starting lineup of Luka with SGA, Mikal Bridges, JJJ and Ayton would be great defensively as well as offensively. Then have Trae Young lead the second unit with MPJ and Miles Bridges, Robinson etc... Absolutely stacked, I think that team easily makes it to conference finals. Starters and bench players can be switched depending on matchups and so forth"
See I think they’ve got a great “situation” not just a great “cap situation.” Chris Paul probably either opts in next year or declines and signs for 2-3 more at a lower price. The decline in Paul’s contract should open space for Mikal Bridges’ extension. The core of Paul/Booker/Crowder/Bridges/Ayton is set for 2 years at least.
"Totally agree. Also gives us some terrible draft day interviews, like the Mikal Bridges fiasco"
"I will give you Okafor, but Noel and MCW were not bad in context. Especially MCW. They were both drafted in an all-time shitty draft. They didn't miss out on any franchise changers by drafting Noel. I'd argue Noel has had a more successful career than many of the other top 10 picks in that draft.  I'll admit MCW turned out to not be very good, but he was a very good pick for the Sixers. He was drafted 11th (in the historically shitty draft), he won rookie of the year, and got traded for a future 1st round pick before anyone realised he was bad. The pick he was traded for turned out to be the 10th pick in the 2018 draft (historically great draft). This pick could have gotten us Mikal Bridges.  There also used to be a lot of rumours that Hinkie was forced to take Okafor, but that might just be people not wanting to admit he made any mistakes."
Maybe Mikal Bridges is secret Iguodala? Pray
"He really is the gold standard prototype of a 3&amp;D role player. He can defend 4 positions on ball, he's long and athletic, is a great and instinctive help defender, solid passer, reliable shooter, and an underrated cutter. Literally every team in the league would love to have a Mikal Bridges type"
Hey now it’s not like Mikal Bridges would’ve been an excellent fit on our team or anything
"I *think* I am taking Mikal? But I fully know that 1. I am biased 2. OG is very fucking good. And he's not like a concept either, he's tangibly great.   Maybe it's because I am more familiar with Bridges' scoring flashes watching my own team more.  BTW they can't be compared as defenders, they fill different roles."

Deandre Ayton is starting to show why he was taken 1st overall and Mikal Bridges is a superb defender who can knock his shots down at a decent clip. It goes without saying Booker and CP3 are incredible.   The Suns just have a well constructed roster. I think we’ll see a Jazz vs. Suns final, with the winner facing the Nets."
Mikal Bridges
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
"Honestly, they stockpiled a shit ton of assets and just carelessly used or lost some of them/let the players leave in FA.  They're still in a fantastic position, but I'm wondering what this team could be if they had a competent FO.   Just off the top of my head, certain players they had at one point included Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Mikal Bridges"
"Suns matchup well vs the nets.  They have probably the single most well equipped player to attempt to slow down KD in Mikal Bridges.  Also, who is Brooklyn guarding Ayton with?  Griffin?  KD?  Bring a slow AF DJ out of DNP hell?  Speaking of Ayton, the dude is a GD swiss army knife on defense who can guard all 5 positions with proficiency.  That being said, KD is still KD, and Kyrie is still Kyrie.  But I think the Suns have the defensive pieces to make things more difficult than Milwaukee has shown for sure though."

"Bridges, Mikal"
"Yea man, there are some days where the open looks just don't like to fall but sticking to our game enough allows the shooting percentages to eventually realign.   You gotta love the role players really putting it all out there and taking the shots. Mikal Bridges man keep it up. Now we need to find a way to spark Cam Johnson!"
Mikal Bridges.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal “the warden” bridges!
Mikal Bridges is who Kawhi Leonard thinks he is.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal freaking Bridges.
"And with that logic, do you take Jordsn Clarkson or Alec burks over mikal bridges or ayton? Bridges and ayton aren’t really shot creators at this point in their careers whereas clarkson can create his own shot well"
"Not to overreact, but the Phoenix Suns are winning the NBA Championship.  Memes aside and the classic r/nba overreaction comment hopefully avoided, I really do think they have a good chance, due to the thing I always look for in the playoffs -- a complete roster.  I love the way the Suns are built.   Point guard, 3&amp;D, elite scorer, big man.   If you evaluate rosters throughout the NBA based on the idea that those 4 player-archetypes round out a team, I just don't see anyone anywhere close to as complete as the Suns (the team they're playing in the Nuggets I'd argue is closest with a fully healthy roster).  I'm not saying other rosters aren't ""better"", obviously when you have the talent of the Clippers/Nets, and great teams like the Bucks (sadness) and Jazz.  But just looking at those categories, the Suns are insane:  * Point guard: The point god himself cp3, great backup option in Cam Payne  * Elite scorer: Booker. Enough said. Important that this role is fulfilled by someone that can create their own offense.  * 3&amp;D: Fucking loaded. Proven playoff 3D guy in Jae Crowder who makes all the teams he's been on better. Mikal Bridges and Torrey Craig are legit as fuck. Then a 6'8 Cam Johnson to maybe give a spark when the others don't have it. Four guys!  * Big guy: Ayton. #1 overall pick. Solid as fuck already at 22 years old. Lets the game come to him. Efficient, strong, good rebounder. Good feel around the rim and short range touch shots. Just a really good big man offensively and defensively. Maybe not as dominant/assertive as people would want, but come on.  Love rosters that are complete like this."
No because Mikal Bridges will be a superstar
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is my deity.  Chris Paul surrounded by young talent is the biggest game changer

"What an electric game. If this is the whole series, its not going to be any less stressful than the Lakers. I do have to say, it did feel like we had the benefit of the whistle tonight, and Suns fans know well how that feels. Overall though, it felt like the game had a really good pace. Didn't even seem like there were that many timeouts. I had a lot of fun with this one.  Ayton showing again that he's one of, if not the best Jokic defender in the league. Yeah, Jokic still got his, but he had very few easy shots, and Ayton was taking it to him just as hard on the other end. That's going to be the deciding matchup in this series, so its great to see Ayton start out strong. Also, Mikal Bridges.  GG Denver. I can't wait to see what adjustments you make for game two. This series is going to be crazy fun (and significantly more civilized than the Lakers series)."

I wonder how pissed Mikal Bridges’ mom is at the sixers for trading him lol
Mikal Bridges
"I’ve been making these claims before the series started. You guys were gonna win against The lakers game 4 since AD was having a bad game. Aswell you guys have way more depth than the lakers. Plus you guys have 3 all star caliber players, with and elite 3&amp;d player in mikal bridges and Jae crowder who doesn’t get the right amount of appreciation."
"It’s almost like hitting 41% of your 3s instead of 28% while not getting better looks opens up the offense substantially! I mean it would be one thing if Thibs got Randle much better looks or something, but even Knicks fans recognized that the biggest difference between the regular season and the first round is that Randle just stopped hitting those contested shots that he was hitting all year, the offense didn’t actually improve.   Who improved???? How about Cam Payne going from out of the league to one of the best backups, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Cam Johnson, and Jevon Carter? Ayton’s offense didn’t take a step back, he just got less looks because our offense was an incredibly well oiled machine that didn’t rely on him to get shots like we needed out of him the previous two years... thanks to Monty. And then I know it’s tough to gauge defense if you’re not watching a team, but Ayton has gone from a very below average defender his rookie year to our defensive anchor and most important defender... in the two years under Monty.  It’s wild that your argument is that... our players didn’t improve... but we went from the 17th best record to the 2nd best record. Could that be... coaching????? I mean I’m sure you’re going to respond with CP3, despite the fact that the first round clearly, clearly showed that our team’s success isn’t dependent on CP3."
Your the team that might have to face that in the finals.  No Jae Crowder or Mikal Bridges alive can stop that scary bad man.
Lol that's probably true. They may not win it this year but that team is virtually guaranteed a few championships in coming years. Also you could switch out MPJ for Mikal Bridges or JJJ for more defense if you wanted.
"I think there are 4 big storylines in the series   Joker vs Ayton,   Mikal Bridges vs Michael Porter Jr.  How healthy will CP3 be  can anyone on the Nuggets Stop (or slow down) booker  If you want a bonus storyline look to Cam Payne vs Monte Morris"
Mikal Bridges is a better individual defender than anyone on Portland's roster
Did you not read what I said: Ayton averages 22ppg in his career against the Nuggets. CP3 will get better and score. Mikal Bridges can score as well.
"Devin Booker, Cam Payne, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul"
"Got me interested thinking of what this class would have to do to top them  Luka gotta win like 8 championships? Maybe he gets bored and takes a couple seasons off to focus on streaming and lets Ayton pick up one or two?   If you think those two can stack up with MJ and Hakeem at the end of the day then I think it’s a question of do you think two of Trae Young, MPJ, Mikal Bridges, SGA, and/or Jaren Jackson Jr can stack up against John Stockton and Charles Barkley..?  It sounds crazy now but I’d give them a chance, I think.  Looking at it I think it’s more likely that the best four players in the 84 draft will all be considered better than whatever contemporary player you compare them to in 18 but 18 will be deeper class that produces more “average” starting level players and it will devolve into a weird argument of whether a draft class is better because of a few amazing players or of one amazing player, a few great ones, and a solid few really good ones. Most people will prolly lean with the draft that has a few amazing players I think"
&gt; he is no ~~trae young~~ K'von Huerter or ~~deandre ayton~~ Mikal Bridges. winning means something. empty stats guy this one
"The L2M is bogus anyway, there were a couple more bad calls both ways that they called correct in the L2M that I really don't see any justification for.  If that Mikal Bridges steal on PG was a correct call like they said it was, Patrick Beverly has fouled Booker like 10 times per game"
Lamelo Shai Mikal Bridges JJJ Ayton
"He's worth it but I think he will take less to also allow Suns to pay Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne and CP3..  I think 5 year 125 Million... With Mikal taking a 4 year 100 Million, Payne at 3 year 36 Million and Cam Johnson at 3 year 30 Million."
Mikal bridges
"&gt;Deandre is an anchor on defense which doesn’t always show up in stats. Not even contested shots would show up. KAT is obviously better from a skillset standpoint on offense by a large margin but what Ayton provides to his team on defense is astronomical to their success.   And you don't think the Wolves would have been a top seed if you gave KAT Jae Crowder,Booker,CP3 and Mikal Bridges?"
"&gt;I got you, but Ayton is also anchoring the defence on a team about to go to the finals. He might be a ""role player"" but your definition but he's helping his team win more than a lot of all stars do, including the guy on your team. Honestly I think you're just mad about that, will you concede Ayton's worth a max if he shoots 9 threes a game?   Most of those all stars don't have CP3,Mikal Bridges,Crowder and Booker as teammates.   Lol if he could shoot 9 3's he'd be the best C in the league."
[Paul George is shooting 4-of-15 (26.7%) in the Western Conference Finals when guarded by Mikal Bridges.](https://twitter.com/esidery/status/1409066409653506048?s=21)
Mikal Bridges got robbed of all defensive team
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges shooting 3-6 with no 3pt attempts can’t happen. He was virtually nonexistent outside of grabbing rebounds.
Outta nowhere Mikal Bridges FMVP would be fun. FMVP does tend to lean towards wing players.
"between Ayton, Trae, Mikal Bridges, Kevin Huerter, and Bruce Brown, and obviously Luka, the 2018 draft really showed up for this year's playoffs."
The out of bounds on cam would be inconsistent calling bc every time that play happens with more time on the clock it’s not out on him  Mikal bridges foul on PG shouldn’t have been called that was a steal
"so the mikal bridges foul on PG to prevent the 3 on the first time they did it, to me that's hard to call intentional because he almost got it clean, how do you adjudicate that? If i make a legit attempt at swiping the ball and get your arm because i'm being aggressive is that an intentional foul?"
Mikal Bridges can
MJax just call Mikal Bridges “Miles Bridges” or am I trippin?
"Bridges fingers are still bent by the ball after it goes off PG, it's off Mikal."
"I saw that we were special the moment we traded for Mikal Bridges. At that moment, I knew we'd be in at least the WCF within the next couple years."
"Yeah he was injured this past season but he’s definitely solid and has great potential.  Right now he’s on the tier below luka and trae.. Ayton may be on their tier now but below those three it’s a toss up between SGA, JJJ, &amp; Michael Porter Jr.    Honestly 2018 was a nice class with Huerter, mikal bridges, miles bridges, and several other solid players later in round 1 &amp; even 2"
Mikal Bridges
You need to give team 2 one of Mikal Bridges/Jae Crowder or Myles turner to make this more fair. I think team 1 easily wins with these teams
dude saw Mikal Bridges make one midrange J and started typing
"There are very few players who you can just give the ball and score for you efficiently. Watch KD, Kawhi, Kobe, MJ, etc.  Mikal Bridges is young and can still develop but it's pretty hard to imagine him having the skills to be at Kawhi's level.  The main difference is being able to create off the dribble and just pulling up for a jumper, make plays, etc. which Kawhi can do. Mikal, on the other hand, needs to be given the ball in his spots such as the 3 pt line with the occasional slashing.  Both can defend but Kawhi is the more proven defender.  You can easily see the difference on offense by watching a few of their highlights."
"I feel like if you swapped CJ and Dame with CP3 and Booker, they'd probably be okay, the issue is the team doesn't have enough defenders to make up for them and they have ZERO good guard defenders. Dame is just as bad as CJ on defense these days, and Simons isn't what I'd call a stopper by any means.   there's no Mikal Bridges to send after the other teams main guy and there's no Ayton to cover up their mistakes. Nurkic was better defensively a couple years ago but the broken leg and other injuries have left him much weaker to perimeter players. don't get me wrong, they NEED to replace CJ with a two way player but I blame Olshey more than anyone else."
Ayton/JJJ/MPJ/Shai/Luka  Off the bench: Timelord/Miles Bridges/Mikal Bridges/Sexton/Trae  This would be one of the greatest teams ever before these guys are in their primes
I think moody can be a solid contributed to a team and sort of have that Mikal bridges impact
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
"Yeah I think Chris Paul absolutely deserved to make All-NBA and the fact that he is still super impactful speaks after losing a step speaks to how much of a basketball genius he is. I'm a huge fan and think he's probably still a top 15 guy in the league which is fucking incredible for someone his size and age. I just think there are a handful of guys that are more valuable and acting like this Suns team was missing the playoffs if Chris Paul doesn't show up seems super wrong to me with the way Mikal Bridges and Booker were playing in the bubble. The Suns were an above average team last year when Ayton was healthy anyway. So yes I expect them to be an above average team without Chris Paul and wasn't that surprised that they won 2 WCF finals games without him even if he is arguably the best player on the team. This Suns team has a ton of talent.  &gt;it's hard to argue any other guard has as much positive impact on team winning than CP3.  This is the reason I brought up Dame and Steph. It's not a slight on CP3. I don't think its hard to argue that Dame, Steph and Luka are more impactful. CP3 is still on the short list and IMO one of the 5 best PGs of all time. I just think the idea that he singlehandedly turned around the Suns is a little overblown and its weird to see from a media that historically hasn't given him enough credit."
"Lmao, they could have had Luka, Trae, JJJ, WCJ, Mikal Bridges, Shai, MPJ."
"Doncic, Trae Young, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, JJJ, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Jalen Brunson, Shake Milton,... 2018 was the year the NBA gods smiled upon Draft Day. At this rate it will be one of the all time great draft years littered with MVP's, All-Stars, 6MOY's, DPOY,..."
"Her favorite active player is Mikal Bridges. All-time, she’s a little less definitive, but when I asked she said she’d probably pick Paul Westphal."
Nah ayton is cool. Let him declare mikal bridges the best role player in the league or something. (He might be)

"&gt; All 3 primarily play guard for the Nuggets.  Frank Kaminsky is a F/C for the Suns and Mikal Bridges is a SF/SG for the suns. What you said is like saying losing Frank Kaminksy and Mikal Bridges would be losing two players in the same position because they are both ""forwards"". Comparing PG's with SG/SF Swingman and saying they play the same position because they both are guards is really dumb."
The Suns backcourt getting outplayed by Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson is the last thing I expected. Did pat bev really just score 1 on 1 on Mikal Bridges in the paint?
Sometimes I glance at Mikal Bridges and have to do a double-take because of how long his arms are.
Is there anyway to get Mikal bridges back to the sixers. Like its one long gotcha joke.     That shit haunts me.     Go suns
Mikal Bridges
I swear Mikal Bridges weighs like 90 lbs.
Bro. Cam Johnson+Mikal Bridges+Torrey Craig is some defensive guru shit.
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
Better wings and some actual guard depth. This team desperately needs a do it all wing (ex. An Andre Iguodala or Mikal Bridges type)
"I did. Which really adds to the point I was trying to make.  David West had a really good career. Was a 2x All Star and a big part of some of the most successful teams in New Orleans Pelicans (then Hornets) history, then was a big part of a couple runs to the ECF with Indiana, and then as an old guy still was able to contribute off the bench to two titles with GSW.  No one can guarantee me that any one of JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet will have a better career than David West, yet he never comes up when discussing 2003, to the point that I literally forgot to mention him."
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don’t think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
"It’s too early but it’s not crazy to think 2018 can be that caliber.  It’s not just Luka Trae Ayton it’s MPJ, JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, Robert Williams Kevin Huerter, even Bagley will probably still be very good. There’s also a lot of great role players as well throughout the draft that will likely have long careers.  Way too early to be comparing them to the all time great classes but they have an argument that they are on track to be in that convo"
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"It will be close. Obviously you take Ayton over Hakeem, Bagley and Bowie is a wash, you take Trae over MJ, and Mikal Bridges over John Stockton. Only weak point is Charles Barkley being better than his equivalent of Luka Doncic."
"2018 has SGA as well  they also have a lot of depth pieces in JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet"
"It’s insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I’m probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
"Also JJJ, Sexton, Gorgeous-Alexander, MP Jr and Mikal Bridges. That draft class is ridiculous. And the kings still managed to fuck it up with their #2 pick."
"2 future hofers in luka and trae already   SGA, Ayton, JJJ, Sexton, MPJ all look like future all stars  Mikal Bridges might be on a couple all defense teams   few more servicible role players too like Miles Bridges, Walker, Divincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Milton"
"Yeah the hypothetical 13 ppg on a contender is already Mikal Bridges too.  Sexton's putting up a fairly efficient 24 a game on a bad team, as well."
Ayton  Trae  Mikal Bridges
"I think Hunter's kinda overhyped at this point tbh lol. He played 23 games before getting hurt, 15/5/2, 48% FG, 33% 3FG, 60% TS. Then he came back and played 5 games in the playoffs before getting hurt again, 11/4/1, 40% FG, 37.5% 3FG, 52% TS.  I get that he's a great defensive wing, but at this point, he's been hurt almost a full year, and he's a quality contributor, but not lighting the world on fire even when he's played.   This isn't me saying he's average or anything, he's definitely a good player, but just like, him to Mikal Bridges for instance isn't particularly close imo, so the way people talk about him as though he's on some All-Star track is weird to me."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
That season at 33% is probably as much of an Outlier as Bridges’ 43% this season. Both are wild deviations from their career avg.   But if 4.4 attempts from Mikal is moving you that much…then by your logic wouldn’t 3-4 attempts from OG on consistently better percentages over his entire career and playoffs versus just 1 season make him a better shooter? LMAO
Mikal Bridges
Btw pop played his starters in the last game of the season at least 20 minutes and we sat everyone except for Mikal Bridges and you lost on a freakin game winner from our 3rd string PG LMFAOOOOOOOO
"Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton"
Playoff Pee tonight:  1-8 from three💀💀💀 Cooked by Cam Payne😭😭😭 3 Turnovers😂😂😂 50% FT%🤦🏿🤦🏿🤦🏿 Chocked the GW FT🤡🤡🤡  Mikal Bridges is surely better!
"I like Ayton, I like CP3, I respect Book, I love Mikal Bridges, I like Saric, I fucking hate Jae Crowder so yep I hate the Suns"
"When it first came out many of us kept telling ourselves well this guy has been around so much winning basketball maybe he'll know how to do it here.   After some rough patches, like his assuming they were trading for Dillon Brooks (and somehow coming out of it with swagger master Oubre), Jones has done exactly that, he just seems to get it. And he has been ever flexible not trying to get players just for talent but identifying exactly what Book and DA need around them.  He was apparently the reason they picked Mikal Bridges too. Mcdonough wanted Gilgeous-Alexander which may not have been too shabby but I like the cp3 guy we ended up with nonetheless."
"&gt;How many teams use a pf as the primary ball handler in the nba?   Barnes doesn’t have to be a primary ball handler on an NBA team, virtually every team in his projected draft range already has franchise guards or starting level guards to play though. He’s projected to be a high level Secondary playmaker, transition playmaker and Short roll playmaker.   &gt;How many teams want a defender that can’t stretch the floor as top 2 star on their team  No team is drafting Barnes to be a star. They’re drafting him because they believe he’ll develop into a high impact player dude to his defensive impact, defensive versatility, and playmaking. Anything other than that is a bonus. It’s similar to when Phoenix drafted Mikal Bridges, Atlanta drafting DeAndre Hunter, and Atlanta taking Okongwu. They’re drafting for their floor.   &gt;(I am thinking of the comparison from thunders needs, I will admit. We need a second “star”.)  If the thunder want a guy whose projected to be a star now they shouldn’t even think about drafting in the range they’re in now, y’all have assets to move up to Cleveland or Toronto’s spot it just depends how much pretsi is willing to give up"
"That’s not what the guy was saying though.  He said that CP3 came in and changed the culture — that, essentially, Paul is the only reason the Suns play the way they do.   I argue that he came in because of the culture being formed by Monty Williams and James Jones, who changed the trajectory starting last year. CP3 was the final puzzle piece because he was shaped by Monty’s philosophy back in New Orleans.   Culture isn’t a team’s record, but a team’s record is built by a coach shaping how they play the game, and the kind of players the GM brings in.   Kelly Oubre, for example, was great, but Monty’s system is built around trust, quick passing, and decision-making that seeks the best possible shot. (That’s why Mikal Bridges shot that three near the end of the fourth — he’s shooting over 40% from that spot, and his teammates trust him.) Oubre is a black hole, and the ball stops with him.  This Suns team is better than last year because CP3, absolutely, but also because this is an unselfish team that trusts one another to play hard and make good decisions. That’s on Monty and Jones more than anyone else."
"Jordan passed to Kerr from the wing on a designed play to get things moving first. Devin booker passed off Jae Crowder(who you 100% don’t want taking that shot) who then turned in to Mikal Bridges. Who has been anything but good shooting the ball from 3 lately.   I’m not saying he shouldn’t have passed the ball. I’m saying more should’ve been done previous to that. Deandre Ayton and Cam Johnson(who actually had the hotter shooting hand) go far side as booker comes to collect the ball. He slowly dribbles up, double teamed roughly 30 feet from the hoop. He flips the pass to Jae crowder the inbounded. Who then kicks a pass to the corner to a guy who’s been ice cold for the series and last 5 games.    You compare it to jordan and Kerr. But that was a designed play with lots of movement going on. There was absolutely zero movement on this one. And the suns got lucky that somehow the shorter guy going for the rebound knocked it out of bounds. Because if it goes off Ayton, that’s game, or if Ayton cleanly gets it where he’s at, he would’ve had less than two seconds to gather and put it back up.   But I think you missed my point. It’s not that he passed. Every legend has a big time game winning assist. But it’s that there was nothing smooth about that play. And booker didn’t even pass it to bridges anyways. Booker kicked it to Jae Crowder, the last man you want shooting when you absolutely need a bucket."
yes. But Mikal Bridges starts over MPJ. outplayed him the whole nuggets series.
Bev was talking so much trash when Booker passed the ball that eventually lead to Mikal Bridges' missed 3.
"Like I said, these are guys who have a theoretical argument for being better. There are guys on here I think are worse. Not a lot though, so I’d be interested in hearing who you think he’s definitively better than.   I don’t think it’s recency bias. I’ve been low on him for a while and was unsurprised by his play vs Atlanta. I think Embiid is incredible and had him as mvp before his injury so it’s not just anti-sixers bias either.  I also only went to 50 but arguments could be made for Klay and Gobert (one of whom should definitely be on there in place of Bogdan) as well as CJ, Lonzo, Mikal Bridges, Draymond, Randle, etc."
"Mikal Bridges owes Ayton a nice dinner.  Otherwise him missing that wide open 3, along with generally poor shooting this game would draw a lot of criticism."
"The impact of the 2018 draft class in this year’s playoffs are crazy. Ayton, Trae, Luka, MPJ, Kevin Huerter, Mikal Bridges.  Missing my boy Shai :("
Mikal Bridges is the difference maker. Process it.
"He's right behind Embiid at current. I just think the playoffs are more important than regular season. If they're close next year in the reg season, I'd put him right there tied. Biid is a better player at this point in his career but he's never healthy, always exhausted.  I always rank the best playoff performing young guys a lil bit higher than the perpetually bounced vets.   Same reason I think Mikal Bridges is ahead of Ingram as a top 5-7 SF behind KD, Kawhi, Tatum, PG13, Bron, Butler."
"Clippers up by one, PG is fouled but bricks both free throws. Mikal Bridges then misses a 3 but the suns still have it. There’s 0.8 secs left, Suns still down 1. Jae Crowder lob to DA on the inbound. Bang"
"y’all, not gonna lie I thought the Suns lost when they let Mikal shot the 3. They needed a god damn 2 but settled for a Mikal Bridges 3.  Good thing Pfizer P came in clutch tonight."
Why is mikal bridges taking the last shot
mikal bridges ain’t ready for the moment
"Clips dodged a bullet, Mikal Bridges in the corner is usually cash"
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges can’t hit shit today omg
Mikal Bridges vibes.
This has not been a good postseason for the Mikal bridges &gt;$100 mil extension campaign
I stan Mikal Bridges so hard I’d consider getting a suns jersey
Mikal Bridges super underrated. Love his game.
Is Davion Mitchell more like Mikal Bridges or Michael Kidd-Gilchrist?
And so many others. They could have Mikal Bridges too.
"You’re trying to build around the front court rather than Trae. AD is the better player for Trae, younger, more compatible, and covers his defensive weaknesses while being a streaky yet lethal offensive player. You trade away Collins at that point for a guard or wing whose value is similar, like a Malcolm Brogdon or Mikal Bridges"
MIKAL BRIDGES
All true but it was 20 mins exactly and I just dont think he quite deserved it yet...Mikal Bridges more mins and just as good.
"G - Jamal Murray  G - Mikal Bridges  F - Bojan Bogdanovic  F - Ben Simmons  C - Klieber  Bench:  F - Covington  G - Hardaway Jr  C - Gasol  Everyone on this team are good 3 point shooter and do not require the ball to be effective.  Murray and Bogdan are capable of getting their own shots and play-making.  Simmons would be the main ball handler as well as the main screener and roller.    Defensively, this group can switch 1-5.  Switch Kleiber or Bog with Covington for an even more elite defensive unit depending on the matchup,  Switch Gasol in when facing embid, jokic etc"
That's a pretty interesting take. I would replace SGA with Mikal Bridges as the Klay here.
"PG - Jamal Murray  SG - Mikal Bridges  SF - Michael Porter Jr  PF - Jae Crowder  C - Ben Simmons  If he's gonna be shit at shooting even free throws, small-ball 5 it is for Ben."
Damn Mikal Bridges was perfect for our team even from hindsight
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Cam Payne are 24, 22, 24, 25, and 26.  So five of their eight top rotation guys are 26 or younger lol"
"Yeah, and the Suns are a much better team. That's my point. Chris Paul got a MVP votes because voters thought the Suns' best player deserved them. Same reason Rudy Golbert got votes. Chris Paul getting 5th in MVP voting in no way means that anyone serious thinks that he is the 5th best player in the NBA. Suns got better because of Chris Paul, and also because Ayton wasn't suspended for half the year, they got a new coach, Mikal Bridges got better, and they signed Jae Crowder."
"Mikal bridges perfect mix, if only the sixers somehow got him"
Or you could have just drafted Mikal Bridges.
#MIKAL BRIDGES WHO THEY TRADED FOR NOTHING!!!!! PLEASE START BRINGING THIS UP. IT WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE DECISION.
"Mikal Bridges is the best player in the 2018 draft, with Deandre Ayton being a close second"
"Cam Reddish will be a solid 3 and D wing with elite defense, he could be Mikal Bridges or Paul George 2.0."
Very similar in all honesty. A great ball dominant scorer in Booker  next to CP3. A fantastic rim running center in Ayton who can switch out and guard wings and guards effectively. Solid 3 and D weapons in Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder. Tho I must say the difference very much lies in those 3 and D wings. Bridges and Crowder are much more versatile than 0-12 and Tuck.
Remember when he was Mikal “Teammate” Bridges?
"Well a lot of it is because coming in they weren't those level of player or at least weren't considered that level of player by the league/media. Payne went to China and back. People laughed at the Suns reaching for Cam Johnson. Suns traded away ""the most valuable trade asset in the league"" in the unprotected Miami pick for Mikal Bridges, and even Ayton as the #1 pick has been dogged his whole career because he isn't a 6'7 Euro Point God. Plus Jae Crowder just carries a chip on his shoulder everywhere, he is a living Jordan meme."
Who's better - Mikal Bridges or Miles BridgeS?????!?
naw. Mikal Bridges for finals MVP
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges is actually born and raised in Philly and Philly actually drafted him. Then immediately trading him to Phoenix for Zaire Smith  If I’m remembering correctly , Bridges’ mom is part of the Philly staff"
Mikal Bridges
"I hope I never see another post ragging on Deandre Ayton for not living up the to the number one overall pick hype.  That man, has been the ULTIMATE 3rd year player.   Mans seriously just had his worst game of the playoffs yet, and STILL put up:  10 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, 2 blocks, 0 turnovers whilst being the best defensive player on his team.  In a win by 10 points in the NBA finals.  Ps. Mikal Bridges."
"Trae over booker is whatever I think they are close enough it's tough but I won't take that against you but hunter over bridges just no, also Ayton exists so does cam who both are amazing, Ayton is a top 10 center in the league and looking like he will be a top 5 soon if he isn't already (even if center is the smallest position so its less meaningful) and cam would be a starter on basically any non playoff team (with some exceptions) and is only not starting because we have mikal bridges and crowder.  I would mention jalen but he isn't worth bringing up, also depends on if you count cam Payne as young as he is pretty young (albeit not super young) and if you count cam Payne that is another starter caliber player.  Sun's have a starter caliber team just with players under 26 and a team that could be almost a playoff team, or an actual playoff team if they all progress."
I still don't understand why the sixers traded away mikal bridges
Mikal Bridges
If you really think about it you can compare each roster to each other. Especially that Mikal Bridges kawhi comparison 😏
Nobody ever expects Mikal Bridges.
I can’t hate anything about giannis. This game was truly incredible. Coming off the injury and singlehandedly keeping his team in with a dominant performance. He just didn’t get any help tonight. CP3 and Ayton struggled but mikal bridges stepped up big time. And book was book
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is Mikal Bridges but pick 32 could be anyone. It could even be Mikal Bridges!
Mikal Bridges
They got the Suns draft pick this year tho! Maybe pick number 32 can be ... mikal bridges
Mikal. Bridges.
Mikal Bridges
Giannis nearly pulled off a LeBron-esque solo comeback. If only they could stop Mikal Bridges from nearly dropping 30 on them smh

Somehow Mikal Bridges as the leading scorer feels wrong and epic
"Jimmy Butler has 2 of the best 3 NBA Finals game scores, so should probably include him.  Mikal Bridges is a sneaky one. He wins a championship on average every 2 years and does it by letting other players shine on offense, scoring efficiently when he gets his chance, and playing defense."
 why did sixers traded mikal bridges?
Not a top 10 role player in the league  his teammate Mikal Bridges probably is tho
"i love Mikal Bridges, man"
"If mikal Bridges becomes the #1 option on a team in a couple years, I could totally see a Kawhi trajectory"
Mikal Bridges is pushing the pace and it's working really well for the Suns.
I know you didn’t call Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson “random role players”
Suns but only bc I’m a giant Mikal Bridges fan
"Ok then, how about guys like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges? And literally dozens of other guys that come into this league at 19 or 20 based on their immense talent?  There were literally only 12 guys attempting 5+ mid-range FG per game this season. Compared to 32 just seven years ago.  What's the difference? Teams thinking that the analytics tell them to shoot mid-range LESS. Because they strip all context of WHY teams shoot mid-range.  Hopefully, Chris Paul and others will keep eating in the mid-range and forces teams to have some wake-up calls."
Mikal Bridges is quite likeable.
"See my other post about correlation to victory. It doesn't ""work"" as well as LMR+C3. Which for the Suns means that Cameron Johnson (and even Mikal Bridges) has actually been the more valuable player in terms of keeping offensive structrual integrity."
"2 wouldn't hurt but 1 I think would suffice unless they hit more bad luck, i.e. Terrence Mann going for 40. Wouldn't even need to be a 3&amp;D but just a guy thats D and you can't leave completely open all the time. Maybe someone like Kelly Oubre. But Mikal Bridges would be ideal."
Mikal Bridges maybe
"So a thing people don't realize about the Suns. In the bubble they had to play literally perfect just to have a shot to make the playoffs. So they basically had 8 straight elimination games.  It's not a perfect equivalent to the playoffs, but a lot of the guys talked about how that gave them experience in high leverage games.  Also look at guys like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges, they played at Villanova and North Carolina for 4 years, they made deep tournament runs, Mikal won an NCAA championship.  Again, not exactly playoff experience, but experience in high stakes games."
I played against Mikal Bridges in high school and didn’t realize it til this year
Somebody please give Mikal Bridges a max offer sheet. We need this team to get expensive or else they’re gonna continue to be a problem
He always had random head injuries he could never heal from. He was always a beast offensively but his off ball defense was so abysmal he'd give up just as much as he scored. Once we got rid of PJ Tucker we were in a tough pickle on replacing his wing defense production and tried to draft Josh Jackson and sign Trevor Ariza and trade for Kelly Oubre to plug that hole and nothing really worked until we gave Mikal Bridges the minutes he deserved.
paul george level player? you mean an all nba wing? cmon now bruh   and to answer your question mikal bridges but i don’t like naming him the “worst player in the league you can add to a team”
"He is, but he's a tad overrated because he has a ""star factor"" that some other top perimeter defenders (OG, Mikal Bridges) don't have.  He doesn't bring a lot to the table that OG doesn't defensively. As another user pointed out, OG tops BBall Index's metrics for versatility and guarding the hardest matchups, and he also contests significantly more shots than Ben while generating a similar number of charges, steals, and deflections."
"Funny enough, one of those picks ended up as Mikal Bridges"
"Devin Booker, Kelly Oubre, and Monty Williams changed the whole c u l t u r e to be about the   #VALLEY BOIZ   And after the Bubble gave the team a lot of hope for Mikal Bridges, and Cameron Payne earned a spot on a roster, it was time to trade for another star and become a playoff team, so they traded for Chris Paul and played good team basketball to make it to the finals 2 years after just going 19-63"
Giving us TJ Warren so Mikal Bridges can shine
"Okay so they now have defensive coaching, as I assumed against from the out of context stats. I thought Nate was the coach for the entire year, so my bad. Back to my original point. John Collins is a part of this defensive improvement right? Or is he slowing it down? Does he not have the potential to be a better perimeter defender with the better coaching staff over time? Or is that all just a highlight reel thing im doing and watching him block a shot or two with no real basis for that assumption?  I assume you’ve hooped too so you know that getting blown by sometimes isn’t bad defense? And all the other little nuances of good defensive games? Again, all under the impression you know better than I do, and i’ll go about this discussion with that assumption. How is my original statement not valid of him being a big that — CAN POSSIBLY defend the perimeter (better than most other big men) with EVEN LESS, BUT POSSIBLY MORE (again, he is not great at this, but has better potential and has shown more flashes of) playmaking ability with an EASILY IMPROVABLE (meaning something that is not perfect, but a part of his game enough that it is a threat) jumper that can tie into all this improvement within the next year. I got some stats wrong, but he is in fact improved as a defender over time has he not? And can he not further improve given his athletic ability and the fact he is only in his 3rd year?  Im a laker fan that lives in phoenix and spend a majority of my time watching those teams. His defense, like Kuzma’s, has improved over a few years. I watched this seasons hawks games after some of the injuries died down and saw a lot of young-player flashes of potential from Collins, and when i say that i mean all he lacks is consistency pure isolation d. And he fouled a lil bit too much here and there before but this season seems to be better. Pure athleticism is my argument for him being able to guard out and help defense, not one on one staying in front of the ball on an iso. There are HARDLY any great iso defenders with the likes of Kawhi, Mikal Bridges, Avery Bradley, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy and others like them. Those defenders are rare, and often are the best players in the league. I think my comment got mistaken given the definitive relativity of “average” in my own head.   I was wrong about the stats, but im basing a lot of what I said on the ABILITY he has rather than the CONSISTENCY he has done it with. And hes done some of these things more than once so its not crazy to think he’ll be a better defender and better shooter as time goes on. I think Nate can give him the ball and let him work more once next season rolls around and create deliberate passing actions off of that ability. Like i said, it doesn’t take much with a player of his standard to make good passes as defenses will have to collapse on him and trae, and especially with having trae, bogdan, hunter, and huerter on offense he’ll have a much easier time doing those things and it is worth keeping him for those reasons. He has a reasonable ceiling."
"Two Villanova guys, him and Mikal Bridges."
I present to you: Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson
Mikal Bridges misses a 14-foot jumper along the left baseline
And cuter. You see mikal bridges smile?
"Mikal ""I'm not related to Miles Bridges"" Bridges"
It’s a Mikal Bridges kind of quarter huh
Every team needs a mikal Bridges
Holy shit that Giannis block was insane. Mikal Bridges is going to have nightmares from that.
Mikal bridges is what we thought Covington was
Mikal Bridges is my slender man candidate
Mikal Bridges &gt; Your favorite player
Mikal Bridges is so beautiful
"people like to think that Dennis did that all on his own, but really what happened is that after Davis went down, the Suns could shift their defense so that Bridges went from guarding Lebron to guarding Schroeder. Mikal is elite at defending the point of attack, which is Schroeders role, so he made life hell for the guy. Add in a few bricked open shots and that's how you end up with that stat line."
"Again, how many of them were the main focus of the opposing defenses?  I know you're not comparing Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges experiences to Randles for example lol"
"I used to feel the same way about him before the bubble, I really wanted him to succeed. He actually didn't play in the bubble, and that was what damned him for me. He sat on the bench while Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson balled out with the Suns going 8-0 and I thought the Suns might be better without him so our other young wings would have a chance to develop more, and the rest is history"
"It's also funny that Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson took huge steps forward playing the same position as him on a finals team. He's solid if he'd accept a 6th man/back up role, but if Kelly is the first option on a team, that team is probably the worst team in the NBA lol"
"Depends on the prospect, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson have constantly improved since they were drafted as older lottery picks"
Lebron was healthy during that 2020 run. But was hurt the year before when you missed the playoffs. Was hurt this whole year essentially. I think hes at the point where his body is catching up to him and if you deny that you're not being realistic.   And Malik Monk is not better than Mikal Bridges and if you think that you're high
"I love that Brett Brown was made the executive of the 76ers 2 weeks before the draft, and he traded away Mikal Bridges for Zharie Smith and a the 2021 Miami 1st round pick (which was traded for Tobias Harris)"
"Not totally related, but I mixed up Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges for the longest time because they were in the same draft"
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
"Suns’ 2021-22 rotation:  Starters = Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton  Second Unit = Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, JaVale McGee  Phoenix made the NBA Finals and upgraded their roster."
Ayton is getting the max. We might have some leverage with Mikal Bridges though.
Especially when 2/3 of your young core (Bridges and Ayton) basically needs to be spoonfed their offense. Like yes Mikal has some middy shot creating ability showing up but I believe he only made one unassisted 3 all playoffs and both of those guys would likely feel the impacts without CP3’s elite playmaking.
Trae - Luka - Mikal Bridges - Jaren Jackson Jr - Ayton  Sexton - SGA - MPJ - Miles Bridges - Mitchell Robinson  These two 5s are from the 2018 draft. So many great players and none of them have hit their prime yet. Imo it will go down as one of the best ever.
"That Nash trade sucked for us. The pick you're talking about eventually conveyed to the Sixers and was traded to the Suns who drafted Mikal Bridges. I believe we would have had a shot at drafting either Bridges (Mikal/Miles), MPJ, or SGA if we would have had the pick. Really hurt us."
"Other names that come to mind beside OG are Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Robert Covington  OG shot 39% from 3 on 6 attempts a game.   Bridges shot 42% on 4 attempts a game.   Dort shot 34% on 6 attempts a game.   Covington shot 38% on 5 attempts a game.   So Bridges had the highest percentage. OG shot the best on more attempts.  Defense is subjective, some metrics favor OG, some I assume would favor Dort or Bridges.   I think based on the numbers it's really a toss-up between OG and Bridges right now, as pure 3nD players."
"It wasnt Brand, same way Brett Brown isn’t the brains behind trading Zhaire Smith+1st for Mikal Bridges trade.  Philly has a brain trust in place that was making roster decisions after Hinkie and before Morey."
Turned Mikal Bridges into Tobias Harris.  Wildly incompetent set of moves.
"Al Horford, waited until Jah and Nerlens had negative value to trade them, maxed out Tobias Harris, never once brought in a starting caliber point guard, traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith on draft night after embarrassing his mom on national TV, sold second round picks for cash annually  For starters"
"Supposedly, he is working out this summer with Mikal Bridges. Maybe we make a run at Iggy this off-season for some more veteran leadership and playoff experience. Not sure what he is hoping to make/what we could pay him though."
I think cam Johnson can add onto his good playoff run and start attacking the basket more and upping his ppg. Also the same for mikal bridges
"Mikal Bridges has that Kawhi Leonard potential, he just needs to develop his offense and he could a perennial all star in a few years"
Mattisse getting onto the defensive team over Mikal Bridges will always piss me off. I like Mattisse and he’s an absolute savage defender but having two other Sixers already made it feel like overkill
"Oh, I'm not trying to say that at all, I'm saying that Clippers squad without Kawhi was better than the Lakers without AD. Although I think a healthy Clippers squad would have been harder to beat than a healthy Lakers squad last year.  I can see the point with Ayton, I dont know that the Suns will ask him to be much more than he is right now while Paul is still there and giving him the max still scares me. But he does provide more offense than Gobert so he can't be exactly played off the court with a small ball lineup because he can punish them on the glass and as a rim roller.  I'm just higher on Mikal Bridges than you are. Maybe that's being a homer but 3 &amp; D players are still extremely valuable in the NBA today and if he doesnt improve at all, Bridges will still be a really good 3 &amp; D player. He has a developing mid range game and has been better at attacking closeouts so I think he can get to a Khris Middleton level which I think teams would gladly take at $25M a year (I'm not sure I see him getting $25M a year on this contract, that seems on the high end, but somewhere between 20-25 million yes, and I think he's worth it)."
"&gt; The 2018 draft where we traded Bridges for instance, no one knows who was calling the shots.  I thought it recently came out that Brett Brown was the acting GM for that draft and was the one who [made the call](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/08/former-sixers-coach-brett-brown-apologized-to-mikal-bridges-mom-over-trade/)."
"All of this at this point is irrelevant talk.  That's honestly what the Mikal Bridges trade made me realize.  You can ""win the trade"" and ""not give up that much value""  or ""get so much value"" but it's all irrelevant if you fuck up the talent evaluation. Irrelevant  The value means something but not very much"
"Mikal Bridges' release is soooo slow, but it goes in at an acceptable rate."
Is this Mikal Bridges?
"I think the trouble would be what you ask Siakam vs. Bridges to do defensively. Mikal guards the other team's best guard which is not something I think Pascal can do consistently. But, Pascal is a better wing defender than Mikal is because he has more physicality and is just stronger, which is ideally why you wouldn't want to give up Mikal for Pascal, because they'd be such a great defensive tandem. But if you're not giving up Bridges, you're giving up Ayton, which again, hurts the defense."
"*deep sigh*  It’s not just missing out on Mikal, it’s also picking Knox over SGA, Miles Bridges, and Michael Porter Jr."
Apparently it was Fraudzdale that convinced the FO to go with Knox ovee Mikal Bridges. Tragic.
Mikal Bridges and it's not even close  https://images.app.goo.gl/6yS6f81EvnR4NbZY9
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
He’s a way better shooter than Mikal Bridges was at 19. Don’t forget he did three years of college. Moses is way ahead of where he was at this stage
mikal bridges &gt; jayson tatum and it’s not even close
"There we go, fucking love Springer. Philly has knack for having guys I really like fall to them. If only they hadn't traded Mikal Bridges."
"THIS IS THE DRAFT PICK THAT THE MIAMI HEAT SENT TO THE PHOENIX SUNS FOR GORAN DRAGIC BACK IN 2015  IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS TO CONVEY  Trade Deadline 2015 - Suns trade Goran Dragic to Miami for 2021 Miami 1st  Draft Day 2018 - Suns trade 2021 Miami 1st and Zhaire Smith to Philly for Mikal Bridges  All Star 2019 - Philly trades 2021 Miami 1st and other assets to Clippers for Tobias Harris  Summer 2019 - Clippers trade 2021 Miami 1st, SGA and a million other picks to Thunder for PG13  2021 - The Miami pick conveys as the 18th Overall Draft Pick and is held by OKC"
"Not a great creator. Good off the catch, can drive and shoot. However, you’re almost never going to see him go to a second move. Think Mikal Bridges esk, can drive/cut/pull up but isn’t exactly creating. However, he’s not as good of a shooter as Mikal, and certainly isn’t the defender."
Where the Sixers at to trade him for Mikal Bridges
My sources tell me Morey also requested the raptors trade for and aquire mikal bridges to be swapped as part of the deal.
"Mikal Bridges. The length would be wild. And even if he can be a streaky scorer, odds are one or several of the 15 clones will be hot as shit."
on the other hand that thing with mikal bridges mom was extremely funny
Philly drafted Mikal Bridges then turned around a traded him to the suns for Zaire Smith.
"I don't think anyone's writing him off, but you have to remember that NBA teams don't really have players, they have contracts (at least from the team building perspective, which is what we're talking about here).  Reddish is on a rookie deal now where his pay exceeds his production and is likely to continue to do so, but he has immense athletic potential, which is why he was drafted where he was despite being terrible at Duke.  He's going to be up for an extension soon, likely before he even gets a chance to meet his potential (injuries, which you use as an excuse, are a red flag... hurt for 3 years?).  Reddish's next contract will likely exceed his production because guys with his pedigree tend to get overpaid - Harrison Barnes, Andrew Wiggins, Markelle Fultz, etc... - and therefore he's a good candidate to continue to be a bad contract.  Atlanta has a lot of dudes about to get paid, and they have to have some value contracts.  Value contracts tend to be market distortions from superstars (max salary) and rookies that make positive contributions on rookie deals (salary scale).  The Hawks don't need to jump on any offer, but they'd be smart to gauge his value and get some current/future picks that have a chance to turn into contributors on rookie deals like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges or Halliburton or similarly lower upside guys who can help a team that has its stars.  Another team in a different position might value Reddish's potential more."
All defensive teams are a popularity contest seeing as how guys like Mikal Bridges and OG didn't make the team   However even though Matisse is a good defender he doesn't start and plays like 20 minutes a game so idk how he made it over those 2
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
Mikal Bridges should get more than $20 million a year.
Mikal bridges
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
Eh I think it takes away from players on draft night. Don’t you remember that whole Mikal Bridges fiasco that could’ve been avoided if the NBA just announced trades mid-draft?
"Give me Dray at C, Miles Bridges at PF, Mikal at SF, Shai at SG, LaMelo at PG"
"Don't forget the mighty #3 we used on lead-foot Okafor. Or trading Mikal Bridges (a kid from Philly, who went to Nova, and whose Mom worked at the Sixers) for a guy who got his career derailed by sesame."
I’m going to come out and say it… that pick ended up being Collin Sexton with 2 of the next 3 picks being Mikal Bridges and SGA himself. Really wasn’t a bad trade package with a decent amount of salary filler to make a deal work
"The difference is that Suns already had Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, and more importantly - they have shown to the management that they are capable of winning before going all in with CP3 and Crowder. Suns were good enough to be 5/6th in the West with Rubio, but it was CP3 who pushed them into contender status.  In Pelican's case, they have a core of two players who still have to learn to play together and show they can win. Adding a 35-year-old Lowry makes them barely a playoff team with no much room to grow. By year 3, Lowry will be 38 and they'll find themselves without young prospects and not enough meat to make some serious noise.  EDIT: they did get  Valanciunas, and that is a huge plus."
"I’m sure the 76ers could have thought that when they traded Mikal Bridges.. we don’t need a rookie rn, let’s trade down and get a future first for another deal, a win now guy  Or the nuggets may have thought to not draft Michael Porter Jr... or the clippers could have not got Shai at #11, I guess you don’t need that.   I’d take shai over naw and that’s essentially what this trade down could do"
"I don't think pure talent evaluation in terms of drafting is the issue. Like a lot of these are just mid-1sts and 2nds underwhelming or washing out, that happens to pretty much every team.   I do think the Bucks have left a lot on the table in terms of value/roster-building and these are the main points:  1) Getting nothing out of their #2 pick. Out of everything you listed this is the most damaging one. There was never really a great time to trade Jabari that fans would have accepted, but he still had value even after the 1st ACL tear. Never really made an impact on the court in a meaningful way then ended up walking to the Bulls.  2) They made a shrewd move by selling high on Brandon Knight, then fucked it up by taking back MCW instead of the Lakers 1st that went out in the same exact trade and became Mikal Bridges with Shai and Miles Bridges on the board as well. MCW became Tony Snell.  3) The Bledsoe/Brogdon crossroads. I think Brogdon is one of the most overrated players in the NBA and was never going to be the PG on a team next to Giannis that wins a ring, but as an asset had way more value which really came to a head this past offseason when they had Bledsoe as a boat anchor and a thin backcourt.  These things plus some mediocre drafting is all what culminated in a roster around Giannis that has been thin on assets at times when stars/better help may have been available.  That said, Horst of course deserves a ton of credit for the things he did do right especially since they culminated in a championship. The Bucks had the raw ingredients to win a title the past two years, they weren't considered contenders for nothing. A combination of bad luck, inexperience, suspect coaching, and certain players actively weighing them down in the postseason is what doomed them. He was exactly as reactionary as he needed to be after the bubble last year and it paid off."
"If your star player is still so young and your team has no shot at contending yet, it seems like the perfect time to absorb some meh contracts. Plus you get a better chance at finding you star player an ""impact role player"" at #10 from #17. Moving up 7 spots from #30 to #23 has much less value than moving up 7 spots from #17 to #10.  (For reference: #10 could get you Mikal Bridges instead of Divicenzo in the 2018 draft. A team could see value in getting that slightly better championship quality role player.)"
"Anyone else think Mikal Bridges is straight up beautiful? No, just me?"
"I'd like to see a backcourt of Luka and Marcus Smart. Then rounding up his starting five, maybe Mikal Bridges, PJ Washington, and Myles Turner."
"As a Koby Altman apologist I had to look into the data to understand why his ranking is so low, especially since he's a rather new GM so I would say it's still too early to evaluate most of his picks.  I was surprised by how low Sexton's pick was rated - I understand missing Shai, but the metric seems to love Mikal Bridges too - that's interesting. I also don't quite understand why Garland is rated as a bad pick as well."
Miles or mikal bridges aswell
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De’Andre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De’Andre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)   Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"
"Get a mix of stars and high level role players on it. Guys like Bam, Butler, Lowry, Paul George, etc. are worth their weight in gold because they can slide into those lesser roles while still bringing star level scoring when the game presents itself. Even on the more stacked 2008-2012 teams, guys like LeBron and Wade were just better at locking down into a defensive and playmaking role than what we’re seeing now.  This team has too many offensive focal point players in Beal*, Lavine, Booker, and Lillard that don’t bring much to the team outside of scoring and a lot of them aren’t as talented as off ball scorers as guys like Klay, Curry, and Kyrie are.   Not sure exactly who you all take going forward, but getting guys like Mikal Bridges onto this roster moving forward is important. I would rather have guys like that than Lavine, Beal, or Booker as my role players."
"Pop is officially senile  He obviously has no clue how to construct a roster that will excel at offense  The 15 all stars formula is a recipe for disaster because there is NO ALPHA  The only way 15 all stars works if its the 15 best players \[dream teams\] and they overwhelm you with talent but this current assortment is as shitty as possible.  Where are the Mikal Bridges, Duncan Robinson, Danny Green, Covington????  Where are the Rim Protector? The Stretch 5??? The post up scorer  WHERE ARE THESE ROLE PLAYERS  The current team is soooo Ass they would have been better off sending the Sacramento Kings entire team. At least they would have had some camaraderie"
"Middleton is good as he's a 2 way player. Lavine I like his outside shooting and athleticism. Lillard is one of the best and most clutch offensive players in the world, idk what happened today. I'd rather have Booker's teammate, Mikal Bridges, than him as he bring the energy and hustle and play defense."
Mikal Bridges can be a 2-3 time all star in his prime. Cam Johnson will be a great starter on an elite team.
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges big time, dude is a walking meme"
It’s kinda weird how bad he often is in advanced metrics. I get some of them but Sometimes I just think they are way off for him for some reason. Maybe I’m a just a biased homer but for the regular season many advanced stats had him closer to frank kaminsky offensively than mikal bridges (mikal being better). I find that hard to believe
"&gt; some dirty work  Mikal Bridges, Danny Green, PJ Tucker and Robert Covington entered the chatroom"
"now that u made ur dogshit list these are the players that arent better at all  jrue, bogi, collins, robinson, levert(lmfao russ bitched the pacers 4 times what was levert doing), brogdon(same thing lost 4 times including twice without beal), sabonis(same thing), lamelo(no a guy that the team was better without isn't&gt;russ), rozier, fvv, grant, conley, ayton, mikal, mpj, cj, nurk, roco, jjj, draymond, bi, lonzo, wood  now im jot saying I wouldn't rather have a bunch of these players over russ like bridges or ayton or brogdon if im philly but that doesn't mean they better it means russ has a huge contract and isn't a good fit with those teams and I told you not to name those tye of players just admit u were wrong and say u don't want him idgaf but just stop capping about shit you din't believ urself"
" Ok here’s your homework you moron, so he’s in the 50-55 range of best players.   Embiid, Simmons, Beal, harden, Kyrie, KD, Jrue, Giannis, Middleton, Randle, Trae, Bogi, Collins, Tatum, Brown, Butler, Bam, Duncan Robinson, LeVine, Brogdon, Sabonis, LaMelo, Hayward, Rozier, FVV, Siakam, Jerami Grant, Mitchell, Conley, CP3, Ayton, Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Kawhi, PG, Luka, Dame, CJ, Nurk, RoCo, AD, Lebron, Ja, JJJ, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Derozan, Zion, BI, Lonzo, Fox, KAT,  SGA, Christian Wood."
"Pretty sure James jones will make sure that we keep Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Cam on the roster no matter what. Sarvers has said that CP3 is worth every penny and that he will pay him in a second. And despite being cheap and bad he has supposedly learned from his past mistakes. Thats still to be confirmed though. Think he's probably made the decision to eat the massive salery L until CP3's next contract is over. Then its likely there will be no replacement for cp3 when he leaves.   Mikal and ayton are up for contract extentions this summer but are still on their rookie deals next year. Cam Johnson is on his rookie deal for 2 years. Meaning that there will be 1 year where its bad and 1 year that its extremely bad before CP3 is gone. all of this is assuming CP3 opts out and takes a 3 year extension.   The side pieces may be broken up/reschuffled some it seems like we are all in for the next 2-3 years. Then well figure out where we are at and what has to happen when CP3 is gone."
"Yeah, the Suns wont extend Mikal Bridges, right...?"
"Ayton and bridges will get their extensions, there really isn’t a question there. The only worst possible scenario with the young guys is that bridges turns down an extension to test the market and someone tries to max him or something crazy, but that’s very unlikely. He will get og anunoby money and we will pay it.  CP3 could leave, but it would be surprising considering he requested a trade here last year knowing the situation he was coming into, and then overperformed by everyone’s estimation. Could he take the vet min and go to the lakers? Sure, but I think it’s extremely unlikely.   Sarver has been cheap, but his net worth did increase significantly during the pandemic, he did dump a bunch of money into our practice facility and arena, and he did say during the playoffs that paying to bring back Chris if he opts out is an easy decision.   The ayton and bridges contracts do hurt our long term flexibility, but that’s going to manifest as us not being able to extend guys like cam Johnson or re-sign cam Payne, spend money on good free agents etc. mikal bridges is not walking lol. Nobody is asking this if we don’t make it to the finals, it’s just the extra spotlight on us because of that. Which is funny, because having a run like we did makes it more likely we keep this group together, but because it puts us in the media spotlight there’s more discussion like this."
"Teams have to fit around Westbrook because he's not someone you can just plug and play and he's not good enough to warrant that type of team building. Even disregarding contracts, I'd figure GMs would rather add Mikal Bridges to their team rather than Westbrook if given an option between the two."
"MVP: Tatum, MIP: Mikal Bridges, ROTY: Jalen Green, COTY: Ty Lue, 6MOTY: Brunson, NBA Champ: Nets in 6 verses Suns"
Mikal Bridges or Cam Johnson either could take a leap
"I really like what I see out of KJ in the Olympics and think he will develop into a very good starting player.  Derrick White is a very solid player.  DeJounte Murray looks like he can become an all star player based on his improvements every year. Will it happen? Who knows for sure but there is reason to believe it can with his talent. His defense is so good.  Lonnie Walker is promising, Poetl is VERY underrated great Rim protector.  The 12th pick is not a spot where you are likely to add a game changer even in this pretty deep draft. The Suns for example added Mikal Bridges around this pick when they were rebuilding and he has helped them improve. Then all it took was CP3 coming \[and Booker/Ayton developing\] to turn them into a huge winner.  Spurs if they drafted Duarte he can be really good then imagine this team:  Murray PG White SG Duarte G/F Keldon F Poetl C  Vassell, Walker, Samanic, Eubanks \[young but solid\]  that team will win 30-35 games in the West and be in lottery. In East would have made play in games and push for 8th seed.  Maybe you get better luck and win lottery? Maybe you package a bunch of good players for 1 great player? Maybe you finally sign a big time free agent in 2022 by paying the most? Spurs will have the most cap room that summer.  I don't think this is the year to go crazy. I say draft Duarte, let the Vets walk, get into the lottery and plan to start signing players in summer 2022. This is probably Pop last season he needs like 25 wins to be most all time so celebrate that and then rebuild next season with a new coach and go looking for a superstar."
Mikal Bridges is not worth 2 lottery picks bruh
"Since trading away Mikal Bridges, Dario Saric and letting Jimmy Butler walked, all 3 players have made the NBA finals while the Sixers still have not gotten out of the second round"
"He takes about 5 3PA per 36 averaged over his last four seasons. That's certainly reasonable volume - in fact that's comparable attempts per 36 to guys like Kawhi, Mikal Bridges, etc. He's got like 900 attempts total for his career, so it's enough to say something about what kind of shooter he is."
If you think Mikal Bridges is a process guy…
Blocked by antetokounmpo!   Also those mikal bridges blocks are so eerily similar
Process legend Mikal Bridges.
"The Sixers also traded Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric, 2 members of the process, and Jimmy Butler who left them and those made the finals while the 76ers still can't get out of the 2nd round"
\&gt; I'd rather have Miles Bridges   Mikal -- just saying for clarity
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson  Future is sunny"
"It's so painful to watch, like the ""watch Jae Crowder flop"" post.  But clearly you see him get raked across the face,  in the video showing the flop. Like the people. How is everyone so blind. Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean you are right.  Every single post about a flop I have seen, clearly there was contact and it wasn't a flop.  I am almost tempted to post a few videos the other way where no one fouls Giannis and yet he gets freethrows.  Like also, where the fuck was the foul on Giannis on Mikal Bridges first play of the game? He literally takes out Bridges while also getting the block, it was  the play of the day.... yet in all 20 angles and slow-motion replays, it's clearly shown to be a foul."
"Suns trade Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges &amp; three 1st round picks for Dame Lillard"
"Asking Robert Sarver to pay CP3 is going to opt out for extension. DeAndre Ayton and Mikal Bridges are eligible for rookie extension, and 2024 is UFA for Super Max contract."
Mikal Bridges was on ball vs Holiday too and I thought he did a really nice job defensively.
"Disagree completely.  Booker and Ayton are headed into their peak (in a few years). This team needs only a little bit more to win (Backup big is the biggest concern). I expect they'll dominate the West for years to come.  Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are nothing to sneeze at either.  I might look for a PF upgrade, although Crowder was fantastic last game. And obviously, at some point, we'll need a PG.  But the truth is, the thing this team needed was experience. A team whose best player is 24 and had never been in the playoffs shouldn't be expected to win. If he had, we would have seriously need to really consider Booker's greatness because that's just something no superstar has done.   He needed to experience the heartbreak and playoffs. At times last night, it really did look like a few kids who couldn't handle the moment vs a team that had already experienced heartbreak and the playoffs. Well, now they have.  I actually think we're going to be seeing MKE vs. Suns a lot in the upcoming years."
"I got a fuck ton of respect for Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Crowder, the Cams, and Booker. They’ll be back, no doubt."
"I wouldn't say massive leap, but he was a fan of Mikal Bridges when he was at Villanova"
It's pretty much identical to Mikal Bridges' numbers. Pretty crazy that Giannis did that almost entirely on his own (Thanasis had 3 rebounds).
I feel bad for Mikal Bridges and Cam Payne. I like them both a lot.
"This sucks. It sucks a lot. It felt like we had so much going for us as far as a sort of Cinderella story: The amazing character and story of Monty Williams, the great comeback of Cam Payne from washout China player to key role player, Book's whole career of slander as an ""empty stats guy"", CP3's whole career of being great and coming up short. It felt like destiny and it really sucks that we didn't get a storybook ending. I'm glad Monty is going to be the guy talking to our guys after this one because this one hurts for me as a fan and gotta be killer for our guys in that locker room.     However there's a lot of hope for us:   **Big rotation minute guys for us:**     Devin Booker: 24 Y/O   Mikal Bridges: 24 Y/O   Deandre Ayton: 22 Y/O   Cam Johnson: 25 Y/O   Cam Payne: 26 Y/O     **Consensus top 3 players of all time:**     MJ when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   LeBron when he won his first title: 27 Y/O   Kareem when he won his first title: 23 Y/O (didn't win another till he was 32)   I wanted to win this one bad. But this is the first time we've made the playoffs in over a decade and we were pretty damn close to winning it all. Even the greatest players ever took some time to win the dance.       **We were a laughingstock just a couple years ago:**     We had 6 coaches in a 5 year span until we got Monty.   I thought Josh Jackson was gonna be part of our big 3 just a few years ago.    We started Tyler Ulis for an entire year at point guard in 17-18.     We have a ton of talent, they're young, and they got some incredible playoff experience off one run that tons of guys don't get in 3 playoff trips.     Round 1 people were saying we weren't going anywhere because it wasn't our time yet. The best thing about that statement is that it acknowledges we have a ton of time left. I look forward to cheering our guys on next year."
Mikal Bridges looks like the fish from shark tale
"If Mikal Bridges won FMVP this year because he had a great finals, would you take him over Cade Cunningham for the future?"
"Well that’s just bad reasoning. I could easily say Ant is inefficient, Lamelo is injury prone, and Mikal Bridges can’t shot create but that’s just dumb logic. They’re young guys and in Wiseman and Kuminga’s case, long term projects."
"this past season was pretty vindicating for a lot booker, ayton, mikal bridges, cam johnson takes that i've had.   booker especially, it was infuriating to see people disregard him for team success when he's been doing this for years."
"Idk what they are saying about only having 3 people for the suns lol we have  Cam johnson - 25 (Idk if 25 counts or not)  Mikal Bridges - 24  Devin Booker - 24  Landry Shamet - 24  Tyshon Alexander - 23 (2-way player, maybe actually on the roster this year)  Deandre Ayton - 23  Jalen Smith - 21  That’s 7 players, half our team 25 and under"
"In the playoffs, would you rather have Ben Simmons or Mikal Bridges?"
Gonna do Current only  PG - Steph Curry  SG - Donte Divincenzo  F - Mikal Bridges   F - Luka Doncic  C - Joel Embiid
1. Dejounte Murray 2. Mikal Bridges 3. Khris Middleton 4. The spectrum of Wiggins + playoff DeMar 5. Peak Siakam? 6. Blake would’ve just been Blake lol
"Mikal Bridges, love the 3 &amp; D archtype. Perfect complimentary piece for stars and a winning player on both ends of the floor."
And then sometimes it's Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges.  Not everyone is going to be a terrible matchup for a large stretch 4 (who is being used in a floor spacing exterior spot up shooter role).
"Not totally related, but I confused Miles Bridges and Mikal Bridges for the longest time  Also back in the day I always confused between Sean May, Randy Foye, and Rudy Gay"
"Shit, even Mikal Bridges has a shot. Lol"
"Mikal Bridges and Clint Capela. Both finished in the top 13 in WAR ahead of stars like Lebron, Harden, KD, Beal, and Tatum. Bridges shot 43% from three and 65% from two🔥"
Jae crowds Officer Booker arresting Cam for indecent Johnson exposure while standing on Mikal Bridges. It's going to be a Payne to get the Suns back in order.
"Mikal bridges deserves it very well. He can creat off the dribble a lil, great 3&amp;D player, and does all the little things. He’s like a baby kawhi or a jaylen brown. There’s not many of those players in the league currently."
I guess... but they did sign Mikal Bridges for 90 mil so maybe they just hate centers who can't shoot.
"dude lmao.   at the end of the day, mj hit some jumpers, played solid defense, not even good from three. yeah, gimme mikal bridges"
"Nah, Mikal Bridges is like ""is JJJ $15m better than me?"" Ayton is asking for way more money, so he shouldn't even care about that."
"I agree $20 Million per year seems like a lot, but I just can’t see it being any less. Potential is expensive, and $20 Million is just about the going rate for an average starter. I’m not even basing this on his improved play at the end of the season. I’m basing it on his overall season stats.   ## Here are some comps from this off-season:   ### Jarrett Allen  Jarrett Allen just got $20 Million per year, and Miles plays a more valuable position, defends better than him, and shoots 40% from 3.   ### Lonzo Ball   Miles matches up pretty well with Lonzo, who also got  $20 Million per year. Lonzo is the better playmaker, but Miles is the more versatile defender and *much* better at finishing around the rim. Miles shot a better percentage from 3, but Lonzo shoots more 3’s per game, so that’s a bit of a wash.   ### Duncan Robinson  The deal Robinson signed this off-season averages $18 Million per year. Robinson is obviously a better shooter than Bridges, but Bridges is better at every other NBA skill, and still a good shooter. Bridges is also 4 years younger than Robinson, which is why he’d get at least $2 more per year.   ### Mikal Bridges  Mikal Bridges just signed a 4 year $90 Million dollar deal (~$22 per year). Miles put up basically the same numbers as Mikal last season. Mikal scored slightly less than a point more than Miles. He did it on a little better efficiency too, but he also has the better supporting cast. They’re both good defenders, but in my opinion, Miles flashed a little more offensive creation than Mikal. Miles is also 2 years younger than Mikal, which is worth a decent amount.   $20 Million may seem like a lot, but it’s basically the going rate. NBA fans just aren’t used to the new Cap numbers yet. What’s wild is that the cap is gonna explode even more in a few years, when the new TV deal gets negotiated. Being an NBA player is so much more lucrative than being an NFL player since there are only 5 guys on the court at a time."
"I agree and I don't really know why you're getting downvoted.   Bey is a solid role player but he gets the vast majority of his offense on assisted open stand still jumpers.   Green has more development to do but a higher ceiling due to his age and athleticism.   From a drafting philosophy it generally makes sense to draft for ceiling over ""likelihood of being a rotation player"" because you can always get rotation players in free agency and they come fully formed with no developmental waste.   You want to draft and develop guys who aren't available in free agency. So that's guys with star potential or players with elite skill profiles (like Mikal Bridges, can't find 6'7 shooting guards with elite defense and high level shooting).   So it makes sense to take green given his high end athleticism, age, and how scouts had him as the best lateral movement guy in the draft vs a guy who projects as a solid 7th or 8th man on a good team."
"Some interesting things in these tweets   On Bey vs Green &gt; Its too early to tell, this is not a knock on S Bey at all but the All Rookie teams historically have been roughly sorted by ""minutes played as a rookie""  What’s the main thing you’ve learnt being inside a team vs outside? Did you underestimate how hard it is? &gt; How Machiavellian and cut throat ppl were while attempting to advance.  On Mavs  &gt; A few ppl in the org enjoyed telling players that I was considering trading them, thinking it would do me harm without really considering the implications it would have on the actual player.   &gt; I was never the GM nor Shadow GM. I never discussed trades with other teams.   &gt; Mavs had a GM and an an owner who generally made the final decision.   &gt; I was just one of many voices albeit at times a very influential one.   &gt; Ones that got away chronologically;  &gt; * Mikal Bridges * Duncan Robinson  * R Covington * Mattise Thybulle * Alex Caruso * Christian Wood * Tyrese Haliburton.   &gt; There were a few that likely would not have worked out too  Q. What do you mean by ones that got away  &gt; Either couldn't pull of a deal - or couldn't convince the powers that be to make the deal."
"Was talking about this in a discord recently (Who would you have - Bridges vs Mikal) and it seemed to be pretty split. They are both incredibly similar players. I think OG is probably a slightly better defender and has the size advantage, and Bridges is a noticeably better shooter. Both seem to have an *ok* handle and drive game also. Neither have ever really been asked to spend significant time on the ball, I'll be interested to see if either of them are able to get better in that area. They both seem to be 1 jump away from consistent all star appearances.   It's really splitting hairs though, they are both great players."
The 76ers traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith when his mom worked for the team if you wanna talk about cringe
"OG’s creation is primarily summed up by baseline drives. He’s not much of a ball handler based off of last season, all his 3s come from the catch and shoot, he doesn’t take many mid rangers, etc. He does these things more than Mikal but he still doesn’t do them that much. He’s primarily an off ball player. I’ve seen a fuck ton of raps games as a local Canadian, and all the stats back this stuff up too.  OG is not at all the most versatile defender. That would go to bam, or Draymond, or giannis. And yes defence is a slight edge. This is how you can tell you have home team bias. Bridges is nothing short of an all defensive caliber wing. He was the best defender on the suns (who were a great defensive team btw) until the playoffs when Ayton took his game to another level. I also don’t see how he got at all worse defensively in the playoffs. He was the primary defender against Michael Porter Jr who struggled immensely. He played Paul George well, PG just had an absurd series cause he’s a borderline top ten player. Against the bucks too more often than not he did a great job on Middleton. Middleton was stupidly inconsistent. And again off ball defence, one of the most important areas of defence, is an edge Mikal has.   Being younger has 0 affect  on who’s better.  At the moment they’re both functionally elite 3 and D players. Neither stand out in any other area and both are on the same level as shooters and defenders. To act like there’s some big gap is complete nonsense."
"Not sure what you mean.  Prime Klay can take it to the rim. Mikal Bridges can do 3, D, and that as well."
I mean it’s not supposed to be a completely accurate comparison. Somewhere between him and Mikal Bridges but either way I personally wouldn’t give a max to that player if it’s along that spectrum.
So a more developed version of current Mikal Bridges? That's probably getting you close to the max.
"This sounds like what Mikal Bridges projects to be, but with worse shooting.  That is not a max player. Bridges literally signed today for 4 years $90M.  This guy is quite solid but probably a $20M guy at best."
This feels like a Mikal Bridges post...
"Good deal to lock up Mikal for the next 4 years on a good price for both team and player.   As for DA, lots of predictions as to whether or not DA gets his deal tomorrow. I really hope this isn't the case because i'd rather DA gets his deal too, but I think the Suns are more comfortable having DA go to restricted free agency because they know that where they are now in terms of negotiations (DA negotiating max, Suns negotiating for slightly less than a max or offering a max but with no incentive based pay on the contract) and the potential deal DA gets (potentially a sure max deal from someone via offer sheet or from the Suns) after this season, there is less risk to assume because they know the high-end DA gets is not much more than where they are negotiating now.  Bridges was a different case because a further break-out season from Mikal would have perhaps led to $30m offers which the Suns may have found harder to match, while DA's bottom-end of a new deal and top-end of a new deal are close enough.  Not trying to defend Sarver here because we all know his history, but there is basketball reasons as to why the Suns might be more comfortable in letting DA hit restricted free agency. Of course again i'd rather not get it to that point and potentially letting the relationship sour further."
"Definitely - ESPECIALLY IF HE PLAYS IN YOUR FUCKING ARENA!!!! And it's not like he was some obvious Hansbrough type that dominated the kinds of guys he'd never face at the next level. Bridges had incredibly projectible skills that made it almost a guarantee he'd be a solid role player on a good team. This good, this quick was a surprise and credit to Mikal, but it was pretty goddamn clear that he'd at least be a slightly smaller Trevor Ariza."
"Every game Mikal Bridges has 2 or 3 plays that just blow my f***ing mind. He's a really special player and glue guy, and an underrated way to keep the defense honest. This deal is already really good for the Suns, but if he keeps improving his game, it will be one of the best contracts in the league in the next 2 or 3 years."
I used to want to trade JC for Mikal.  Ignoring fit I'd probably still do it.  I think they're the same value player and this deal make sense to me.  OG being underpaid doesn't mean Bridges is worth less.
Mikal bridges is a 25 year old who has played 3 full seasons in the nba and has never flashed the ability to play elite offensive basketball.  Mpj in his first full season of basketball at 23 put up near historic stats off ball.  But yeah it’s the same thing
"Mikal bridges, cam Johnson (basically any 3 and d forward"
Mikal bridges
"Patty Mills, Mikal Bridges, Iggy?"
Mikal Bridges
"OG, like Bridges, is going to be a role player until they can reliably create their own shot imo. And there are rumors of both developing that over this past offseason. But that's just my interpretation.  And let's not be too quick to call OG better already lol. Mikal has been in the league one less year and is in a different stratosphere of efficiency."
So a great to elite role player? Like a Mikal Bridges?
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
Mikal Bridges is my favorite role player
I knew Mikal Bridges would be a stud for whoever he ended up with
We could’ve had Mikal Bridges but two will suffice
"i don't assume anything.  I'm just saying the ""process"" was to accumulate assets, maximize your chance at championship level franchise players in the draft and develop role players along the way.     They had 4 extra 1's, had RoCo, Grant, Holmes, TJ all in the mix as role players and years until Embiid/Ben were up for max extensions.  Ben actually wasn't even drafted yet, but we were coming in for a landing on that pick.  2 max slots, and didn't get dick out of it.   Okafor was picked to put up stats and move along, same as MCW.  MCW got us the pick that eventually became Mikal Bridges and was used in the Fultz trade up(didn't convey until later).  Okafor was traded for the pick that became Jaylen Brown according to reports at that trade deadline.  Jerry Colangelo nixed the deal as the front office was tired of Hinkie trading the young faces of the franchise."
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
Luka Doncic  CJ McCollum  Mikal Bridges  Miles Bridges  Clint Capela
"I went back and logged every CP3 pick and roll involving Jokic for the first two games of that series just for you.  Game 1  1 - Jokic sauced by a CP3 slip pass for Ayton dunk  2 - Jokic stays in front and forces a long Ayton pull up  3 - Blitzed booker screen and forced pass out, stopped CP3 penetration on aggressive drop with the POA defender recovering, AG fell asleep on the strong side though for a 3  4 -  Hedged, got a pass out from CP3  5 - Aggressive Drop, CP3 reset it to the perimeter  6 - Aggressive Drop and quick recovery to Ayton, MPJ with a tag on Ayton and forced a Bridges turnover   7 - Solid positioning in drop, MPJ way out of position on weakside for open Bridges 3  8 - Gets the switch on to CP3 and shadows him as he tries to snake, no open look and has to reset   9 - Green falls behind CP3, Jokic keeps CP3 and Ayton in front and forced a kick out to a bad corner shot  10 - Rivers falls behind CP3 forcing a commit from Jokic. Not wanting to allow the switch, Rivers tried to stick with Paul forcing Green to sag off weak side to tag Ayton, CP3 finds a nice skip pass to Crowder  11 - Campazzo eaten up and switch forced, Jokic gets his hand in CP3’s face as he sizes up his midrange, misses  12 - AG way behind the screen, no hustle getting back to Paul as he snakes across the lane. Jokic does a nice job sticking as close he can to CP3 while preventing the opening for an Ayton lob but with AG’s lack of hustle + not calling out a switch CP3 is able to sink a baseline middy.  So legit only one misplayed pick and roll against CP3 in game 1. This is all from synergy so I’m not missing any plays aside from ones where the action had to reset (i.e. the offense wasn’t successful)   Game 2  1 - Good hedge, offball screen on Rivers generates Crowder a subpar look over AG  2 - Jokic solid hedge at elbow screen, terrible misplay by MPJ forced a strong side tag from Rivers who fell down, allowing Suns to swing it to the corner for an open look  3 - Jokic gets switched on to Mikal right before he sets a screen on CP3 because MPJ is playing way too low and Ayton’s at the top of the key. MPJ doesn’t properly tag Ayton (who didn’t even set the screen) so he’s literally guarding no one, easy slip pass from Paul  4 - Nice hedge and recover on a Saric pick and pop, CP3 laced a really nice behind the back pass though for a moderately contested look  5 - Good hedge and recover, Rivers recovery off the tag on Ayton allowed Mikal to blow by him after getting the pass. Jokic called for a dubious blocking foul on the Bridges layup (can’t tell if his heel is in restricted circle or not)  6 - Low drop, campazzo can’t get back. Caught in no man’s land for an easy Ayton lob.  7 - Low drop, lands the bear swipe on the ball but CP3 recovers quickly. Campazzo way overhelps from the weakside and MPJ doesn’t fill behind for an open corner look  8 - Double screen leads to Morris getting sealed by Ayton, forces Campazzo to help off strong side as Jokic contains Paul’s drive. Open kickout to corner  9 - Phoenix goes right back to the double screen. Crowder screens Campazzo at the same time Ayton seals off Green. Jokic forced to switch on to CP3 above the break, Facu is recovering but Green switches off Ayton prematurely, before Jokic is able to leave CP3 with Facu, and Ayton gets an open look  10 - Jokic sauced by in and out dribble  11 - Hedge and recover, uninvolved  12 - Good two-man defense by Facu/Jokic on a snake, CP3 a midrange sniper though  13 - Low drop in transition, Rivers with amazing defense though and blocks CP3’s jumper  14 - Low drop and a weak stunt at CP3, bad play leading to open middy (although the alternative was leaving Facu on Ayton so you’ve got to hope for some dirty trickery if you help harder)   So like two or three misplays in the second game. Defending the pick and roll is very much a team effort, especially so with Jokic. It can and has been executed quite well but not with the virtually 0 help he got from the guards and wings he was left with at that point in the season."
"The real under-the-radar one for the Suns is Mikal Bridges, who is the same draft class as Ayton. He looks poised to really step into a secondary perimeter creation role, which he's been good at in when called upon in the past. If his off the bounce game takes off, he's going to be wayyyyyy more expensive next summer."
This is why people say nerds are ruining the sport. How in the hell can you consider what the Bulls did to be bad offseasons?  I understand the analytics community hates Westbrook (honestly I'm not a huge fan either) but he carried that wizards team last year to the play in. Replacing him with say Mikal Bridges and the wizards are worse off
"The last 538 player tier thingy or whatever had KD as a ""borderline all star"" and Mikal Bridges as a ""borderline all star"". I love Mikal but he isn't even our 3rd best player and they had him in the same tier for us as CP3 who got some MVP votes last year, it's a pretty terrible metric IMO."
"What we should have done was loan out Mikal Bridges to the Blazers for games they had v the Nuggets that did not coincide with Suns-Lakers games so that the Blazers would maybe have the defense they needed to beat the supposedly injury-torn Nuggets, and thus the Suns would play a team that wasn't supposedly injury-torn in the 2nd round and still come away sweeping or at worst winning in 5.  Same with the Jazz and Clippers next round."
Pls mention it as Miles Bridges. I was thinking when the f*k did Mikal became antivax
Mikal Bridges is going to be so damn good.
Our owner is notoriously cheap but that's not necessarily what is happening right now. Ayton is going to be a restricted free agent so one reasonable school of thought is that it's just prudent business to see what the market actually thinks he's worth before throwing the bag at him and possibly overpaying (although it is almost an absolute certainty that *someone* will offer him the max). But it is a tightrope as you don't want to piss off an integral part of the team and potentially bring the whole house of cards down. We also have to look ahead at extensions for Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson. Getting Ayton at a discount might be the only way we're willing to extend Bridges or the tax bill is going to be enormous.
"You can’t count Mikal Bridges, he was basically Phoenix’s pick. It’s just that trades aren’t official until after the pick, but Philly had nothing to do with that selection. They were taking whoever Phoenix wanted in the trade.  It’s like crediting Denver for “technically” drafting Donavan Mitchell."
"That was obviously lip service from the front office to make the trade more palatable for sixer fans. On no draft board were Bridges and Zhaire 'equal value', so to claim they were equal on their own draft board after the fact is almost certainly disingenuous. Mikal was a hometown guy who was most importantly NBA ready with his shooting and defense and ready to step into the rotation day 1, while Zhaire was years aways from being ready as all he had to rely on at an elite level day 1 was his athletic ability.     This was just another example of a front office outsmarting itself to feel like they hit a home run, when going for the most obvious play would have been the right one."
In my unbiased opinion MVP: Devon Booker MIP: Mikal Bridges DPOY: Deandre Ayton 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Jalen Green
"I really loved Grant's time in Phoenix from 2007-2010. Low key my favorite player besides Nash during that time. Mikal Bridges reminds me a lot of him, not necessarily in terms of play but just in their role for the team."
"Chris Paul, DeAndre Ayton and Mikal Bridges aren’t walking through that door. He has a significantly worse coach and significantly worse supporting cast"
"honestly thats kind of a false choice.   Sure ayton is one of the best centers in the league, no denying that, but the center position in general has the lowest VORP across the league by quite a far margin. You arent really raising your ceiling by THAAAT much with ayton, whereas with other max contracts that will be coming up, aka mikal bridges, you have more opportunity to actually reach a ceiling that is high enough to win a championship.   If sarver was willing to pay both ayton and bridges their money, then this is a non issue, you take both, but if im the suns, in the future I would rather have book, bridges, cp3 in his last legs, and fill out good rotational pieces plus a functional center than book cp3 ayton, and trying to fill out a small forward that has close to the same replacement value as bridges can potentially have."
"Here’s a story I remember from a couple seasons ago. So at the time of the draft, Luka wasn’t available for workouts because his team was playing. The Suns could’ve sent some scouts to Real Madrids practice facility or the coaches could’ve gone there themselves. But apparently Sarver just didn’t want to go.   So the Suns never actually even worked out with Luka even though it was possible had they really wanted. Also that same draft, the Suns had a deal to move up to take SGA but Sarver said no. Instead they got a call from Philly who offered Bridges and Sarver accepted.   Ayton and Mikal are amazing young players and yet Suns could’ve had one of Luka and SGA. Imagine SGA and Ayton or Luka and Bridges. That’s always been Sarvers issue. He cares but gets in the way too much."
I mean bridges would be much worse if they had luka as he wouldn't devolp as much.  He took a massive leap this year under cp3 and even before he was able to grow because they didn't have any expections so he had a longer leesh.  With luka on the team mikal would have a much shorter leash and luka is undeniably the worse mentor than cp3 (which isn't a bad thing cp3 is arguably the best mentor in the league)
"Mikal Bridges is that borderline all star player imo. Will never make it Bc the all star game is pure stat based, but he’s such a difference maker"
Luka Doncic  Devin Booker   Mikal Bridges   Jae Crowder  Clint Capela
"&gt; Ayton will get a max from someone this summer and Mikal will get 20ish million will show which one is more valued around the league  That's just speculation. You could just as easily speculate that Bridges would get paid more next offseason, as some analysts have done."
"Ayton had a small sample size of good games vs favorable opponents &amp; is still very dependent on scoring off easy touches, but he's still &gt;&gt; Mikal because Bridges is a pretty dimensional 3&amp;D player.   3&amp;D players like Mikal are insanely valuable, but their impact can only be so impactful.... As a versatile 7 foot Center that can switch 3-5, protect the rim and guard the P&amp;R on defense alone (and is still growing his offensive game), Ayton is better.  Mikal's probably hit his ceiling in terms of impact he can provide, but Ayton still has a lot of room to grow; whether or not he takes that next step is up in the air, but even right now he's better."
"Honestly for me it comes down to who else is a free agent, and who can be acquired in a trade. Both occupy a somewhat rarefied space right now; Ayton is a very good C and you need those to compete at a high level, Bridges is one of the best wing defenders in the league and shoots 3's at a high level.   If there's a C available in the Brook Lopez/Steven Adams/Nurkic range of ability that you're confident you can get then keep Mikal. If you can't get a decent replacement in, then Ayton has to stay."
Throw two wing defenders that can shoot next to them and you have the 2020 dynasty.  like say a Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder.
"Capela would fit them perfectly as well.  Defense, rim pressure, rebounding.    That's a championship foundation if you end up get Mikal Bridges still."
Mikal Bridges is 25
You know what bothers me a lot about the 76ers? Trading away Mikal Bridges on draft night. A lot of other bad moves at least had some flawed logic behind them.
Mikal Bridges comes to mind. Jaylen Brown has some great cuts as well
mikal bridges is very good.
"Lakers with ‘16 Klay is frightening. I think you could do worse though, what about like Mikal Bridges?"
I think Mikal Bridges has another level to him
I'd watch Mikal Bridges to estimate relative value. Look at his next deal (when he gets it) compared to what OG has and you'll understand.  This considers that I feel OG is the better player of the two.

"I assume you’re talking the Raptors and Heat series the Nets at no point successfully walled him off, even in game 2 which was the one shitty game he had.  Are you sure you’ve seen a basketball before? You’re definitely talking about the right sport here? The Brooklyn Nets, with I guess KD, Nicholas Claxton and the corpses of Blake Griffin and LMA, are more suited to defend Giannis than the Phoenix Suns with Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder (who was Giannis’ primary defender on the 2020 Heat, a series you clearly remember well)? This is what I’m talking about, there’s skepticism and there’s delusion."

"If they had real wings like Mikal Bridges, Anunoby, Ariza, Covington, Crowder, Hardaway, etc instead of a vastly overpaid Solomon Hill and Nikola Mirotic (who was great for them but is redundant w a healthy Boogie) they’d be contending today and or have a real chance to dominate last playoffs"
Joe Johnson is a 7 time all star.  East All Star appearances don't equate to being a superstar level player.  The gap between Ben Simmons and OG isn't so great defensively that I'd trade OG and someone else for Ben Simmons.  Especially because OG is a lower usage player who can defend multiple positions like Ben Simmons except he has no ego and can shoot 3s.  If it was OG for Ben Simmons straight up the Sixers win that trade because OG while a worse player is a much better fit.  In fact most players are a better fit than Simmons.  Mikal Bridges is a better fit.  Gordon Hayward is a better fit.  When you have Embiid fit is more important than talent when talent isn't available to be acquired.  But NBA front offices know this already and that's why these Simmons deals wont fet done.  You won't see Brogdan and Warren for Ben because everyone knows those 2 for Ben makes Philly a better team and therefore it is giving too much up for Ben.  So yeah Ben is a 3 time all star.  But he's arguable the worse multiple time all star in his prime in the NBA.  So those appearances mean nothing.
Mikal Bridges
"It's gotta be a good feeling to have Mikal Bridges on there to. He is shaping up to be a premium 3nD guy, still on his rookie contract.   Its rare to see a young core with almost perfect complementary cohesiveness as the Suns."
I'm guessing Mikal Bridges ain't gonna get the extension he wants either if they're this hung up on Ayton.
"Yes, Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges had the exact same influence as DA this season. If you combine both into one player, that is."
&gt; But what if a team offers him a max?   Then you match and hope you can keep Mikal Bridges at a reasonable number because your cap is gone until CP3 retires.
"&gt;he was the 2nd best player on the court for the Hawks last year  It's 17 games after a terrible rookie season then he got hurt, people just decide they think only the 17 games matter since its more recent and the terrible rookie season has no predictive value going forward. It's not how it really works.   &gt;proven he can carry an offense if Trae isn't feeling it.   He cant pass and 3/4 of his shots are assisted. His ""shot generation"" is taking some wide open 17 footers vs drop coverage, attacking close outs and some slashes to the rim. What are we even doing here. It shows how low the bar was for Hunter after a bad rookie season this is considered ""carrying an offense"". OG Anunoby can do all of this stuff and is frankly even somewhat better at it. Hunter's a little more developed in the half court than Mikal Bridges, Mikal is a better shooter and better in transition. He's not a better offensive player than either."
"Hunter, Mikal, OG  Why are yall bringing up Hunter's rookie year when last year before getting hurt he was arguably Atlanta's second best player.   Bridges does what OG does, but better imo. Offensively and defensively.  No slight towards OG, I just think these two are better at this time."
"Anunoby   Bridges   Hunter    OG is just such a versatile defensive stopper that any team would love to have.  Mikal is closer to the prototypical 3&amp;D wing, I just more highly value OG’s ability to guard and lockdown threats, whereas Hunter is very good but not as polished as the other two, who are rock solid in any rotation."
"CP3's contract is 4 years. Last year is non guaranteed and third year is partially guaranteed, so potentially he's only demanding that pay for 2 years, but before than Mikal Bridges will be due a new contract and if Ayton on a max is a no brainer then Mikal's going to want the same deal."
I don’t think this bodes well for a Mikal Bridges extension either
Allen got an extension of $100m over 5 years and Vuc had a deal of $100m over 4 years although it was set to be declining every season (his last season is next year and he gets $22m). It's not nearly the same case with Ayton who is looking at an extension of like $170-180m over 5 years and Suns are paying Booker and CP3 while expecting a big deal for Mikal Bridges.
"Can they afford to keep him on a max, though? CP3 and Booker are gonna be about 70-80 mil together, and I think this is the last year before Mikal Bridges gets a new contract as well who's one of the best 3&amp;D wings in the game."
"Jae Crowder, nic batum, idk… mikal Bridges? Definitely Jae crowder tho, great 3 and D wing with decent passing and iq as well"
mikal bridges or OG Anunoby are the two best answers in my opinion. Elite 3 &amp; D guys with length and size can be inserted into almost any starting lineup and contribute. I also think a healthy serge ibaka could be a candidate.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"I agree the other team is better, but I feel like it’s worth mentioning that Mikal Bridges is nice, though."
"Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby are the right candidates for this -- versatile wings who can play multiple positions, space the floor, and defend all over the place. I don't know which team has a better 2, 3, *and* 4 than either of those guys."
Mikal Bridges
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
"This is pretty wild      The 10th overall pick from those years for comparison     CJ McCollum, Elfrid Payton, Thon Maker, Zach Collins, Justise Winslow, Mikal Bridges.     I would take team 27th in a heartbeat.    What's wilder is that I had to go all the way down to the 5th overall pick to find a group I would take above them (Trae+Fox), which even then is less consistent overall."
"Mikal Bridges is older than Booker, while Cam Johnson is older than both of them."
Mikal bridges shoots like Ben Simmons but it goes in.
That's true - with advances in sports medicine these guys' careers are lasting longer. It's easy to see them both still top 10-caliber in the next 3 years.   Coincidentally(or actually not so much) I also had Mikal Bridges at $2 in the last scenario and he was the most popular pick. Here's that thread if you want to check it out: https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pzionx/build_a_team_that_can_consistently_be_a/
"There is no crystal ball for the future, better to go for a chip sooner rather than later, load the dice to favor the guarantee of current level of quality play.  Ultimately I think both will still be top 10 players for the next ~3 years, which is the better half of the window, and while you can bet on a young guy developing, plenty of older guys manage to surprisingly extend their primes these days- not hard to look at Curry having a near MVP season and see Dame likely won’t fall off a cliff, being the closest equivalent in range and game.    OG is absolutely mispriced, it’s like having Mikal Bridges be super cheap, those 3&amp;D guys are coveted and versatile wings who complement any roster are in high demand.  You could bump him up very easily and he’d still be worth it."
"point guard that can run the offense himself but can play offball and hit 3s off the catch, shooters, and a center that can protect the rim without killing spacing. maybe something like  steph/dame/brogdon (if you want ben as focus)  danny green  mikal bridges  ben  myles turner  seems really solid"
"More assets not listed here like the rights to LA's 1st, a lotto pick which became Mikal Bridges, which he acquired for MCW lmao.   Another thing worth mentioning is that one of those picks swaps = getting pick #3 in 2017(which became Jayson Tatum of course). Given that it was a swap, the management that replaced him did nothing to get that pick. Pick #3 in 2017 should effectively be specified and added to this.   Not an ""asset"" necessarily, but it's also important to note that Hinkie had the Sixers in position to have multiple max FA slots as well."
"You forgot TJ McConnell and the Lakers future 1st that became #10 in 2018 (the one they took Mikal Bridges with then immediately traded him)  And it was exactly 12 second rounders from 2016-2019. They also had 2 max slots.  All of that, and the only players on the roster that Colangelo/Brand have any direct responsibility for are Harris, Thybulle, Milton, and Korkmaz"
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
"Shai 4  AE 3  Mikal Bridges 2  Tatum 4  Turner 2  Rebkunding with this lineup is a concern but it has excellent scoring and defence.  Alternatively swap AE with Lamelo and go Gobert. I wasn't sure which would be better. Gobert is better than turner but I think AE will be aoy better than Lamelo. Ayotn is also intriguing as he still has a lot of potential.  So I guess a gamblers lineup might be more like this  Shai, Lamelo, Mikal, Tatum, Ayton."
"steph/bridges/tatum/morris/gobert  gives me great spacing on offense, throw in gobert’s screening and efficiency at the rim and that side of the ball should be elite. defensively i might’ve made them too big, but i trust our wings to handle things anyway, and all are at least solid, with mikal and tatum being pretty great. gobert obviously locks down the paint and has way more help on the perimeter than he did this year"
That's Garland. They need Okoro to become a Mikal Bridges type 3&amp;D player.
These guys floors are starters. Kuminga’s already shown defense and driving to the rim. Wiseman may take time but at worst he’ll be a Deandre Jordan type lob threat and shot blocker. Moody is a safe pick with a floor around a poor man’s Mikal Bridges. We drafted very well.
Miles Bridges is going to get Mikal Bridges money
"I think you/they didn't count draft day trades? Suns have Smith, Cam Johnson, Dbook, Mikal Bridges but they only have 3"
"The Clippers certainly did. Not “any chance they got” but enough for it to be notable. It wasn’t just my eye test either. It got explicitly mentioned in the article from the athletic previewing the bucks/Suns finals:  &gt; Who’s guarding Khris Middleton? No matter who it is — Mikal Bridges likely — the Bucks would be smart to hunt Booker like the Clippers did. Marcus Morris Sr. was cooking in the mid-post against Booker. The Clippers shot 51 of 96 when Booker was defending. That 53.1 percent shooting was 6.2 percent higher than their collective average. No Suns player defended more Clippers attempts than Booker, by design."
"Ah yes the league is rigged against the Sixers  They purposely gave them those top 2 picks knowing they'd waste them on Okafor and Fultz, then made them trade Mikal Bridges. Galaxy brain sabotage"
"If you’re the worst defender among Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton, that doesn’t really say a ton tbh, you could range from pretty good to atrocious. Booker is closer to the pretty good end."
"I wouldn't. MPJ is obviously the superior talent on offense, but the gap between him and Bridges on offense isn't as huge as the gap is on defense. On top of that, Mikal comes cheaper and has literally not missed a game since high school, whereas MPJ is actually made of glass."
"Rubio was with Phoenix that whole season, and during that season they got the 10th seed with a 34-39 record. He's a good enough player but it feels tenuous to attribute their improvement to him when his replacement - one of the greatest ever - helped them to far more success instantly upon arriving. That Phoenix team which made the finals had really good players across the board. Even a young player like Mikal Bridges is one of the best in the league at his role. I think you're being very reductive trying to make this a culture thing. Minnesota need better players/coaching/planning... And even if it is all about veterans and culture, isn't Beverley exactly that guy?"
"…have you ever watched Ayton play? He’s by far our most reliable defender not named Mikal Bridges. Excellent anchor, extremely versatile and can guard guys on the perimeter for stretches. Maybe doesnt have the sexy block numbers but he’s very valuable on the defensive end"
"Yes.   I think it shows than Book is improving as a combo guard and can definitely see him plays PG in some rotations.   Like a tweet said, these stats also says a lot about the guys receiving the pass. If you take a look [at this video](https://twitter.com/KellanOlson/status/1458121246533509120?t=HJS816mcmmW7umpJEAk2GQ&amp;s=19) showing Booker to Mikal assists in transition, they easily find each other and Bridges improved greatly his offense and finish which obviously helps boost Book's stats."

"Ah gotcha, total RAPTOR has Mikal Bridges at 2 though and Rose at 3. Surprised to see Devonte Graham, Aaron Gordon and Whiteside in the top 10."
Mikal Bridges hasn't missed a game since high school
"&gt;This comparison doesn’t make much sense.  Igoudala, Jrue and Vucevic were let go as part of one very specific rebuild strategy.  Mikal Bridges was a draft day trade.  Jimmy and Horford were one year FA signings.  You’re just talking about a team that has had a lot of movement.  The Sixers have also retained talent and been competitive.  Eh by this logic, there isn’t a team in the league who can’t retain talent. Because the Pels can also make half-assed excuses."

Horford? Butler? They played there for like one season when they were already in their prime? Mikal Bridges never played for the team and Holiday was already an all star for Philly.  The only one fitting is Vucevic and even then he wasn’t considered a high potential prospect or anything.
"I mean the 76ers aren’t particularly great at retaining talent either. Off the top of my head.   Andre Igoudala, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, Mikal Bridges, Al Horford, Ben Simmons (soon)  None of these guys are as criminal as AD and CP3, but you can conceivably make a deep playoff run with these guys alone."
I think it has to be a smaller name that fans get over attached to. Tyrese Haliburton for Mikal Bridges type beat

Mikal Bridges is fucking amazing.
What if the Sixers didnt trade Mikal Bridges for a project athlete who they tried to kill with nuts
"Serious attempt an an answer - I don't know. You need a true stretch-5 (i.e. KAT) along with 3 other great 3&amp;D players. That's a hard sell, and I don't even know if that's enough given Westbrook's playstyle.  i.e. Westbrook, Mikal Bridges, Paul George, Robert Covington, KAT"
"Haven't seen a single Spur named yet, and they have 3 guys easily in that discussion in Vassell, Murray, and White. Mikal Bridges also getting overlooked. Okogie is a pretty good defender too but is just ass on offense so he gets overlooked. There's some damn good defenders in the league rn"
i see r/nba doesn't know about mikal bridges.
Mikal Bridges has to be on there
"True we have done well there. But that only paints half the picture- we also have had some bad misses: Markelle Fultz ahead of Tatum, trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith, drafting Mikal ahead of SGA in the first place, letting Jimmy go to keep the ball in Ben's hands. This just off the top of my head"
"Just heard that Mikal Bridges played some COD last night too, crazy fucking news this week."
i mean i love GP2 and he’s always been an underrated player and great defender but not even Kawhi?? or like Mikal Bridges or Matisse or something lol
"They've all spent their entire careers being the primary rebounder on their teams. They can't just change the way they play overnight.  You don't see Westbrook moving off the ball for easy buckets like Mikal Bridges  either, because those aren't the habits he's developed over his entire career."
"Its fine, you can believe that I haven't. It's not like you're providing any type of argument as to why you believe Booker has been better. Just saying ""I watched and you didn't"" does absolutely nothing.   Mikal Bridges is also playing out of his mind on both ends so far (could argue he's been the best player because of how consistent he has been) but we just wanna prop up only Booker on this team"
"&gt; No, man. You just brush off all of the issues Jamal had as a player. He couldn't string together 3 games of solid play, idgaf who was scouting him or what he was doing behind the scenes. His inconsistency went way beyond the domain of just being a young player.  It was not beyond the domain or just being a young player. Since box scores are the only thing that is connecting with you then here:  In his 2nd year and 1st as a starter, the 20 year old Jamal Murray had 27 games of 20 or more, including 7 over 30 5 of those over 58%, 3 over 60%, 2 over 70%. Of all the games he had under 10 points the majority of them were in wins. He had more games over 16 points than under 16 point.  In his 3rd year he had 29 games of over 20 or more, including 7 over 30 and 2 over 40 (48 and 46) which were both over 60% from the floor and misses 7 1/2 games to injury. OBPM goes up, BPM goes up just like it did the year before. TRB% goes up, AST% goes up, TOV% goes down while USG% goes up.  As a 21 year old, and I cannot stress this enough a 21 year old in his first playoffs he averages 21/4/5/1. Massively weight down by one very poor game. He has more games over 23 points than under and has two 34 point games to boot. Is also a + in two of the Nuggets losses and has the highest TS% among all non-bigs on the Nuggets, and a higher TS% than CJ and Dame.  His efficiency scoring went down in the regular season a bit but he was also given much more responsibility and allowed to take more shots. Generally speaking the efficiency goes down when that happens until a player is able to get used to it. If they are able to. Obviously they felt strongly that he would.  He did this on a playoff team that was winning games. A successful team. One where he wasn't the main option every night or could decide his fate all the time. That means it wasn't the situation where a player is putting up empty stats on a bad team (Sexton) and on paper looks much better than they are. Inconsistency aside he was playing winning basketball, had winning effort, and on top of that had made it clear that if he has a bad game in the first 3 quarters he comes out in the 4th ready to kill. He proved this many, many times.  That is a 100% of the time maxed player by the team they are playing for. A super young guy who can struggle for an entire game but then tap in and become a closer in the 4th, and seeks that, is significantly more intriguing and interesting for teams than someone who comes out and gives you 14-18 a night reliably in the system--i.e. Mikal Bridges. There is no question that Jamal had consistency issues, he would go for 20+ 4 games in a row and then come out with a 14 pointer and a 15 pointer the next two. But what he wasn't was mentally inconsistent. He was checked in and wanted the moments, even if he was missing shots. This wasn't a situation where he was fading away or getting in his head and avoiding the  responsibility. That is massive and overweighs a 15-25 point rollercoaster ride given his age.  Before he turned 22 years old Murray had shown improvement every single year. Clear, visual, in game, improvement. Added and refined skills. Was becoming extremely good in the PnR with Jokic, so much so that even at that age with this up and coming team he and Jokic LEAD THE LEAGUE IN ASSISTS BETWEEN TWO TEAMMATES and were considered a deadly late game system by themselves. He showed it in the regular season and showed it as the #2 guy in his first playoffs, again, as a 21 year old.   Sexton is 23 years old right now, has been putting up empty stats on a perennially bad team as -the- guy with the system built to help him succeed, and taking pretty much as many shots as he wants. Shoot Murray even if his scoring was off could turn into the offensive facilitator and would actively go for rebounds. He more than doubles Sexton in each category by the time he turned 21. He also proved he knew how to play off ball as a cutter or shooter, and was very good at keeping the ball secure and not having turnovers or getting into situations that could force a turnover. These are extremely valuable things that aren't going to show up on the box score. That is extremely uncommon maturity and poise for a 21 year old.  His weaknesses were inconsistency with scoring (as a 19, 20, 21 year old on a competitive team I will provide you with countless examples of inconsistency at that age including players like Carmelo and LeBron) and defense. Unless you come into the league as a defensive player, and a very good one like Davion Mitchell or GP2, NBA defense takes a while to get used to and learn. Not just whatever scheme you're playing as a team that you have likely never played in, but the size and speed of grown ass men with years of NBA training and the significantly heightened skill level of scorers. People doing things you've never had to guard before. Every young player gets slack on learning defense when they come in, because 99% of them need 2-3+ years to become a tolerable defender for a playoff caliber team. If not more.   Seriously. You have a 21 year old who has proven to you he can string together 20 point games since he was 19. He can have back to back 30 point game sin the playoffs. He has a fantastic mechanics/footwork for someone his age, and a shot form that will translate to better and better shooting as he himself gets better. He's already adept at being the main ball handler, an extraordinarily good PnR guard who can score from all 3 levels out of it (there are some all-stars who struggle with this in their late 20s!), can confidently play off ball as a spot up shooter or slasher and make the right offensive reads to facilitate success (being a good look), who is an extremely hard worker, improves his level of play in bigger or higher leverage situations, and does not shy away from it.   All of that is far, far, far, far greater than the negatives of inconsistent shooting and poor defense. Those are the reasons that Tim Connelly and Coach Malone never once considered trading him, said he was off limits since year 2, believed in him and gave him more and more responsibility despite having a budding superstar in Jokic who could be option 1 and 2, constantly and publicly praised him while also treating him with the responsibility level of a vet after year 2, and signed him to that max extension.   As any single team with a brain would have done. It is an absolute no doubt decision for all 30 teams. He is a special player and it was clear to see what was in there half way through year 2.   &gt; Was the Sixers front office full of donkeys when they gave Simmons the max?  By the time Philly signed Ben Simmons to his max he had been the Rookie of the Year, an All-Star twice, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Defensive 1st team, lead the league in steals, was a pivotal member of a team 1 game away from the finals, and was cruising to 16/8/8/2 a night on high 50s from the floor. He had all the tools and wherewithal to be an incredible slashing threat too if Philly had a better passer. There is no team at any point in the history of basketball who wouldn't have maxed him. His issue is entirely mental, and sad, and there was no predicting that.  &gt;  Was the Knicks front office full of redditors when they gave Porzingis the max?  Are we talking about the Kristaps who put up 23/7 with 2.5 blocks a night while being 7'3"" and shooting 40% from 3 and made the All-Star game? The guy who had made a massive jump each year in the league and was playing incredible before completely blowing apart his leg? If you're asking me if it was unwise for a team to max a 22 year old 7'3"" unicorn who could fly for huge dunks, shoot 3s better than many guards, and protect the paint and rim at an elite level I'd ask if you're joking. That's a no brainer. Now the issue if there was one is that it is a direct gamble to give a contract to any big man coming off an injury like that. Especially one as athleticism reliant as Porzingis. Regardless all 30 teams if they are in that position are giving him the max, you have to assume he comes back near that and if that's as good as he gets  for his career he's a better Brook Lopez and gets maxed into his 30s.  &gt; They were better players than Jamal as well.  Which is why they were no doubt decisions. Zero doubt. Zero hesitation. Zero questioning of the decision from those teams. Then both of those contracts presently look iffy because of completely uncontrollable circumstances. You can't guess if a player explodes his leg, and you can't guess if a player runs into one of the worst mental blocks in the history of the sport out of nowhere. That has zero to do with the front office's decision making.  &gt;  For every player who pans out and ends up being worth it there's a player that ends up overpaid.   Here are the players on a rookie max currently: Ben Simmons, SGA, Trae, MPJ, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Tatum, KAT, Booker, Murray, Wiggins, Embiid, Siakam. The only questionable signing in this whole bunch is Siakam. When Wiggins was maxed that was as much Minnesota not being able to afford any semblance of a good player leaving them. Otherwise which of these players do you think isn't gonna be worth the contract? You implied 50% of them and considering all of them except for 8 games of MPJ and Siakam have been worth it, who is going to have a massive regression out of nowhere?  &gt;  Waiting a year doesn't cost them, simply.   Yes it does. This isn't 2K. The human element plays a massive part in this. Waiting a year tells a player ""eh, we dunno if we believe in you yet. let's see another year"", while all of their peers in the same situation are getting maxed. It also opens up really dumb FA possibilities which teams do not want to deal with even removing the fact they are burning part of the bridge with what could be a cornerstone player + their team."
Mikal Bridges
"I can't keep going back and forth with you. It is so very apparent that you can only assess players by box scores and basketball reference stuff. That's not how actual real world evaluation works. You are completely and totally on your own with this evaluation because you can't or won't assess anything except for box scores with players.   Everthing is a gamble. The Lakers trading very good players for Kobe Bryant who never played a game outside of high school was  gamble. The Wolves taking KG 1st overall out of high school when he didn't play in a huge bball talent pool is a gamble. Philly taking Embiid despite him only playing basketball for like 4 or 5 years and having a foot issue already is a gamble.   They are all calculated risks, calculated risks are gambles. But they aren't blind shots in the dark.   Once again, there is a reason why every front office would have given Jamal the contract he got to keep him and was a no brainer for the Nuggets, and why Sexton will absolutely not be getting it.   There's a reason that despite Mikal Bridges averaging 14/4/2/1/1 on 54/43/84 as a 24 year old got him 100m instead of the 180m super max. Those numbers are insane if scaled up even a little tiny bit, so why didn't he get a max?   Because you have to watch him play to actually understand that. Just like you have to watch Sexton playing to understand he isn't actually a better offensive player than Jamal Murray at all, and doesn't have near the ceiling. You have to watch the games. You have to watch the players playing. Rudy Gobert scores 16 points on 65% from the floor. He is nowhere near the scorer nor does he have the potential as Evan Mobley -right now- who is scoring 13 on 49%.   All stats aren't equal and it is painfully obvious you didn't watch Jamal Murray carefully enough and you may have not watched a single Sexton game ever.   By all means keep telling saying that the best evaluation and talent growing front office of the past 5 years, who work to make the proper basketball and financial decisions for a multi-billion dollar corporation, were wrong to give Jamal the max. Clearly they didn't know what they were doing and somehow they just lucked into Jamal becoming exactly what the coach and front office said about him being able to become since his second year in the league.   That massive 9 figure, franchise changing, decision made by the people who have proven to make those decisions the best was a silly unnecessary gamble that they made stupidly. They couldn't have possible seen Jamal's progression coming, or had any idea what his time behind the scenes was showing them. With the trainers, with the coaches, in practices, on his own.  No, it is you, redditor, who knows how to evaluate talent and assign potential and a dollar value on it better than the people who have a career doing it. Not the people who are around this person every day to understand his personality and work ethic. Who are watching him in practices, in the gym, in games, concentrating on him with the knowledge that can only come from being a career long basketball player, coach, scout, executive.   No, they didn't make this decision accounting for everything you're looking at on basketball reference, everything they saw in games, and the metric ton of things they see that you can't see not to mention wouldn't be able to see.   It's you, basketball fan, who understands what's an unnecessary risk and gamble. Not these people who have spent their entire life around basketball in order to have a literal career doing that very thing; and the fact that they were completely correct in their decision, oh, it can only be a fluke. It couldn't possibly be that your ability to assess players is faulty and lacking. It's definitely the entire team of professionals, ex-players, and coaches who were wrong.  Incredible."
"I don't think the problem is with the point guard position, I really think it's with constructing a lineup around two big wings who are not very good at running an offense or distributing the ball. There are obvious benefits of having multiple two way wings on your team, but the reality is that if they are both mainly finishers then your offense almost inevitably will be focused around just trying to set them up to take a shot, rather than in them both being really incorporated into the offense in a cohesive way for your five players out there. It's almost doomed to result in a lot of ""my turn, your turn.""  Brown and Tatum are each too good to just be a 3&amp;D wing, who plays good defense and just sets up in the corner and waits for an open 3. They are more heliocentric because they are also very good at creating a shot for themselves (which is what separates them from someone like say, Mikal Bridges). But while they're good iso scorers, neither is adept at stuff like running a pick and roll, or figuring out a defense to set up their teammates. They sometimes will set up a teammate due to their own gravity (like passing out of a double team), but rarely is it because of their playmaking.   Even if you were to put someone like say, Chris Paul on the Celtics, what would that look like? Ideally Paul works best when he has 3&amp;D guys like Bridges to kick it to, but just using Tatum or Brown like that would be a bit of a waste. Right now the best play is probably when Brown or Tatum have the ball in their hands, just because of how good they are, but it's really not a great pairing for an overall well run offense. Other than trading one of them, I don't know what they do. Maybe really try to turn one of them into a point forward, kind of like the Clippers were doing with Kawhi?"
"FVV, Mikal Bridges, RJ Barrett, Jaylen Brown are all some realistic one for one offers"
he just need Mikal Bridges type money
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
Mikal bridges aka The Warden   Cam Payne is known as the haboob for his off the bench frenetic play speed.   For reference of what a haboob is https://propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.lexblogplatformtwo.com/files/image/Haboob.jpg  And here  https://twitter.com/notryanmcd/status/1404570875358232577?s=21
"Mikal bridges aka ""the warden"" and ""the man of steel"" hasnt missed a game in a hot minute. He has played every game in his 3 gears in college and hasn't missed an NBA game either. We suns fans make his name trend quite often and all we do is tweet mikal bridges nothing else lol."
"he's shooting 50%+ from the field &amp; 40%+ from 3 and looks like he's continuing the trajectory from the leap we saw him make last year, so he's going to get PAID.  I could see a Mikal Bridges/Jaylen Brown tier contract for him, but certainly no lower than that.  He's going to need to ball TF out to get the Luka/Trae designated player extension I think..."
"You cut out the best part  &gt;""Chris Paul and Devin Booker are All-Stars, but Deandre Ayton is a quality center, Jae Crowder is an experienced, quality stretch-four man that’s tough, Cam Johnson is nice and **Mikal Bridges is my favorite small forward in the league.""**"
Yeah it should be someone like Mikal Bridges this year
"Jaylen Brown and Robert Williams for Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton. Aytons value is a bit lower now with the whole contract negotiation, and Williams/Ayton's defense is comparable"

"All those guys are standing around on d, particularly LeBron, for the first 3 quarters of every game. Mikal Bridges had so many open layups back cutting LeBron in the phx game.    I am concerned that this team might not be as good as us Lakers fans were hoping but it's also kinda hard to judge since they dgaf about these early games yet."
Mikal Bridges has never missed a game in college or the NBA. Played 116 straight at Villanova and now 232 straight in the NBA. I could see him making a run at the record.
Why would you have Mikal Bridges on a fantasy team  He could have a string of 10 games without taking more than four shots and it would not be surprising
New to watching the Suns and have Mikal Bridges on my team. Is he normally this passive? Dude looks a little lost out there.
If we could revisit Philly's choices...  Don't trade for Fultz.  Keep Jimmy.   Keep Mikal Bridges. Draft Brunson in the second round.  So many....
"As a raptor fan, I think franz and scottie are very similar, both 2 way high ball iq physical profile wings with progressive shots ( scottie midrange, franz more of the 3 ball). The only diff is scottie is even more physically/athletically gifted but franz is still athletic like mikal bridges. Theres not better comparison for franz and scottie atm. Both seem like theyll be stars and overtake those 'physical profile wings with progressive shot"" prospects and set the tone as also high ball iq phys profile wings with progressive shots. They should eclipse players like tatum brown etc"
"Franz wagner is playing like year 4 mikal bridges at Age 20 in year 1, crazy. Hes reminds me of lesser physical profile scottie barnes but still athletic 2 way wing with high ball iq with a progressive shot. Both of them are going to be stars"
"I said for an impact player, not a superstar. Comparative to like Mikal Bridges and Aaron Gordon for example, OG is making substantially less and outperforming them on the floor."
Gonna come down to Miles Bridges vs Mikal Bridges
You're list is missing Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges. Maybe you should get more scrutiny in making posts.
"mikal bridges, cam johnson, booker, and ayton seems like a good haul over 5 years of drafting. no team can hit every draft pick. as a suns fan, i am happy with those 4 as a core going forward"
15 - 20 on good efficiency and defense is like Mikal Bridges 90+ million kinds player.  What has Langford shown to make that seem realistic?

Mikal Bridges never missed a Game  since HS
ok now ur talking outta ur ass saying dumb shit to act smart theres no way you'd rather have mikal bridges over an efficient 24 ppg scorer
He’s more in the range of Mikal Bridges money imo. I would even rather have Mikal on my team as my 3rd or 4th best player.
Reminds me a lot of Mikal Bridges in the sense that he just knows his role and makes timely shots.
Mikal Bridges is also older than Devin Booker
"Zion, Kuzma, Chris Boucher, Coby White &amp; Mikal Bridges are +5000 each to win the 2022 MIP award."
Mikal bridges doesn’t get talked about enough for MIP imo
"Nuggets fans told me it was just Mikal Bridges putting him in prison, seems like the whole league is putting him in prison lmao. Man got his 200M and said fuck it"
"because its 4 games into the season and the media only cares about lebron add that to the fact that la is a huge market, the attention is overbearing.  as for what's been bad for the suns? its been four games and the suns have been shooting horribly. chris paul has shot 40% from the field, so has d-book, aytons averaging 13 ppg. the only guy whos had a hot start to the year is mikal bridges and hes shooting 47% from three and 50% from the ft line, its four games. we can have more serious conversations once we're like 20-30 games in."
"Mikal Bridges is way, way better than Dort."
4th hopefully. Basically like how Mikal Bridges would be if the Suns won the championship last year. Vital but not one of the key difference makers.

"&gt; Mikal Bridges  ""It's gonna be completely nuts, but it's also gonna be awesome,"" Monty Williams said. ""The whole city's gonna be behind us. We're gonna be on SportsCenter every night. If we lose, it's gonna be the end of the world. If we win, it's gonna be wild. But no matter what, it's gonna be fun.""  And so, Williams went outside and sat by the desert while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, we got Mikal Bridges on our team,'"" he said. ""'The best defensive player in the world is a Phoenix Sun.'"""

"Goddamn. Just, what a game. It wasn’t the game we expected with Booker having to exit early, but this was the most electric game of the season hands down. Everyone stepped up and played their role as well as we could possibly ask. Tying the franchise’s longest winstreak while simultaneously taking the first seed AND beating the team that held it all at once? I’m so damn proud of this team tonight.   Mikal Bridges is a DPOY candidate. He’s doing this every night and isn’t getting the attention he deserves. Hopefully this game changes that. He was everywhere and was a huge reason why Curry had such a poor outing. Ayton was the force on both ends that he needed to be. CP3 did CP3 things. Jae, Cam, Cam, and Shammet hit shots when they needed to. It was beautiful.   GG Golden State. If this is a preview of what to expect in the playoffs, I may have a heart attack. Hopefully we get a matchup this season with Klay and Booker healthy. Until then though, enjoy the pasta."

Mikal 'Greatest Of All Time' Bridges.  MVP year in the works.
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"Dejounte Murray, Tyler hero , Harrison Barnes, Og, DeAndre ayton.   Bench. Jonas, Mikal bridges, lonzo, MO bamba, Cole Anthony."
"Ja Morant  Lou Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby  Myles Turner  Bench - Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Lonzo, LaMelo, Ayton.  Starting lineup emphasizes defense.  Dort, Bridges and OG are all elite defender and can guard 1-4.  Turner is an elite rim protector and capable 3 point shooter.   Offense emphasizes a spread 3 point attack, led by Ja attacking the paint/mismatches and either scoring or passing out.  LaMelo is the secondary play maker off the bench while everyone else are catch and shoot or catch and drive players."
"Morant, Dejounte Murray, OG, Tobias Harris, Turner.  Bench: Herro, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, John Collins, Ayton.  I don't know if that's a contender but I think that's about as balanced as I can get on offense and defense."
Mikal Bridges binging on bean Crunchwrap Supremes before tonight
"Ayton is like not even close to being a dark horse selection this year. Like, he’s not even entered into the race. Dude doesn’t even own a horse right now. If there’s a third Sun who is a dark horse, it is Mikal Bridges."
"There's a timeline where the 76ers are rolling out a starting lineup of Simmons, Mikal Bridges, Bulter, Tatum, and Embiid."
Mikal Bridges forced him into retirement
"Sure if you’re trying to be all smart and moneyball analytics, go for Mikal.   But you know you’re heart says MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO!!!  https://youtu.be/c8beWTSft8o"
Mikal bridges hasn’t missed a game yet and he’s in his 4th year. He also never missed a game in his 3 year college career or in high school.
"That’s a tough question. My first instinct is Mikal because his midrange jumper along with all of his other skills gives him superstar potential in my eyes.  But Miles Bridges isolation game has become really good.  Lastly, people shouldn’t forget how good Mikal is as a finisher around the hoop."
"My only disagreement here is that NBA basketball isn't that match-up dependent.  Especially on a team like the Blazers, where we lack any elite 1-on-1 or perimeter defenders, the scheme is designed around switching and drop defense.  Any player can force a switch onto the defender they want.  That's why teams target Dame and CJ a lot of the time, or quick players target someone like Nurkic to pull him to the perimeter.  Norm doesn't just get to match-up against a 3 because he's in our line-up.  He switches defensively pretty much 1-4, 1-5 and is supposed to lead his guy into the help, where both RoCo and Nurkic are expected to help.    Norm is just fine on any 3, as far as any player/defender would be up to the elite defenders.  Obviously, if you have a healthy Kawhi, or someone like Mikal Bridges or Ben Simmons, they're game changers for on-ball defense.  Outside the top tier guys, though, he's about the same as anyone.  Players like LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi offensively are going to be a mismatch for anybody.  He does as well as you could hope.   If he played the 2, he would likely be guarding the same people because of switching."
"If my team needs defense I want Mikal.   If I want the one with more potential, Miles.   But overall I never wanna burn any bridges in my life."

"Finally someone said it, I remember seeing MB for Mikal Bridges as if there isn’t multiple people in the league with those initials (Miles Bridges, Malcolm Brogdon, Marvin Bagley, ETC)"
Well tbh it was less to do with the clippers starting good this game More the sun's starting bad Sun's vs clippers has to be the funniest matchup  You have the team that sucks 2nd half Vs the team that sucks 1st half Sun's always kinda play worse in the first half but at the 2nd half they play like the best team in the league Whereas the clippers start games playing like the best team in the league but end it playing iso ball  The matchup was entertaining and it will be cool to see our teams compete again hopefully next time out future mvp mikal bridges doesn't shoot like kawahi haha
"these are players who are better than Bagley in 2018 draf's top 15:   ayton,  doncic  young  wendell carter jr  sexton  mikal bridges  SGA  michael porter jr"
"Cam probably is better now and going forward, but coaches are weird about vets or ""their guys"". Clippers had a similar issue last year with Harrel and Zubac. I like watching the suns so ill be keeping an eye on their development, plus CP3 is one of my all-time favorite players. Mikal Bridges is also so good at defense I love his development."
He put 31 vs Mikal Bridges
When’s mikal bridges gonna start playing?
Mikal Bridges MVP
Mikal Bridges is certainly a better player than Bagley
The team that has mikal bridges wins
"Mikal bridges is ""the warden"". he is also called ""the Man of steal"" sometimes by our announcers."
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
"Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges make it intriguing for me"
Just ask Mikal Bridges how to stop him.   Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Mikal Bridges.
"CP3 has been great, but he's not the only reason for our early success.   We also made some shrewd depth signings in addition to CP3 and Crowder, such as signing Galloway who has been a sniper from the bench, and the continued growth of Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges.   Not only that, but Cam Payne has been crucial for our bench. When Booker and CP3 go off the court, we don't have many playmakers or ballhandlers but Payne has given us great minutes from the bench."
"Oubre was a part of some of our best lineups (which also happened to be some of the best lineups in the league).  It was not addition by subtraction.  What happened in the bubble was Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson both expanded their games and filled the offensive void that was left when Oubre was injured.  Also, Cameron Payne was brought in and immediately added an offensive threat at PG that could distribute and play aggressive defense.  Add Dario Saric coming in to form and basically being a walking double/double off the bench and it all just kind of came together.  No, Oubre was fine for us.  He wasn't perfect, but he was a plus player on the court."
Mikal Bridges is shooting 53/50/100 on 6 3PT attempts per game.  But I don't expect him or KD to finish with 50/50/90. Maintaining a 50% 3PT for an entire season is unheard of.
"Idk, Luka gets locked up by Mikal Bridges every time we play the Mavericks. Luka ain't Jordan"
"Also SGA and JJJ looking like studs, could be potential future all stars. When you’re the 2nd pick and two future MVP candidates and two more future all stars are drafted after you...   Also Mikal Bridges is looking really good. I’ll ignore Mitchell Robinson because everyone whiffed on him the first time, but there look to be a half dozen MVP level to really good starter quality players drafted after him. Little early to tell with Michael Porter Jr. but his ceiling is higher, and Donte Divencinzo is good too."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges in addition to the names mentioned

Mikal Bridges looking GOOD!
Seeing how Mikal Bridges is playing just makes me sad. Thanks Brett Brown for trading him away minutes after we drafted him...

"Mikal Bridges was like Andre Roberson... such an elite defensive player that he makes the team much better when he is on the court but Mikal also has been shooting really well recently like he did in college. Also, he hasn't missed a single game yet. Mikal has been like Andre Roberson with elite 3% and durable (knock on wood) so far this year."
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.

Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
"Hes been good but the reason we are 5-1 is because of mikal bridges, cam johnson, and cam payne."
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"What culture? The fashion and memes? The culture changed when Suns started playing defense in the bubble and actually winning games. If anyone should get credit for the culture change, it's Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter for setting the tone defensively."
"Oh shoot, forgot to mention that Dario Saric was out for the Nuggets game.   I wasn’t too surprised by the Jazz win. Donovan is having a slow start to the season, Mikal Bridges is a fantastic defender. I didn’t expect to hold Bojan to 3 points though."
Mikal Bridges
How's Mikal Bridges doing? Looking at stats he seems improved but can i get a quick summary of his overall game/potential?
"He still building chemistry with CP3 but more than that, every time he rolls it creates a lot of attention leaving wide open shots for others. Guys like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges have greatly benefited. Still gotta try and get him the ball more but if there was a stat that would show what I mentioned, he’d be among the top in the league for sure."
Today I was arguing with someone on the comments of an Instagram post. He claimed DeAndre Jordan is better than Mikal Bridges and I disagreed. Then he said DeAndre is also a better defender than Bridges and I stopped entertaining that argument because... really dude?
Wish we drafted Mikal Bridges man
Mikal Bridges.
I would die for Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges is carrying my fantasy team lmao.
"Technically, Mikal Bridges had a breakout last year in the bubble. He was a big part of that 8-0 run."
Mikal ‘long arm of the law’ Bridges
Mikal Bridges
But have you considered Mikal Bridges?
"It's actually [this pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9qunc/is_the_unprotected_2021_miami_heat_draft_pick_the/)  From another link but this breaks down where the pick traveled succinctly.  &gt;The Heat first dealt it in 2015 to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragic. Three years later, the Suns sent the pick to the 76ers for the right to move up and select Mikal Bridges on draft night 2018. The 76ers then shipped it to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a package for Tobias Harris. The Clippers, of course, traded it to OKC as one of five first-rounders in the Paul George deal."
The only purpose of this post is to show that Mikal Bridges has been really good and is trending upwards. Don’t over think it.
I’d go Mikal Bridges or Christian Wood right now. I thought Jaylen made a great jump last year I don’t think it’s him
"No the Clippers and Lakers are built to beat the Suns. They are response to the greatness of Mikal Bridges, not the other way around. But they will fail to stop Mikal."
"Giannis, AD, Rudy, Jrue, Simmons, Bam, and Smart are probably in that realm but you're all wrong  It's Mikal Bridges"
Ducking Mikal Bridges
Left off Mikal Bridges

OG &amp; Mikal Bridges
1.	Cam Payne 2.	Devin booker 3.	Chris Paul 4.	deandre ayton 5.	Mikal bridges 6.	Jae crowder 7.	frank kaminsky 8.	cam Johnson 9.	Dario saric 10. Lebron James
They got mikal bridges for KD I guess
"I can’t name one, but I’ve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
"This will make me sound like a homer of course, but the sun's have the most balance.  They had the best record in the NBA against teams that made the playoffs this year.  They have a center who can guard all five positions unlike Gobert.  In addition Ayton is much more versatile on offense.  Sun's also added Torrey Craig late in the season who is a very undervalued pickup especially against a team like the nets who have wings for days, which is what Craig is good at defending.    The sun's probably have the best player in the league when it comes to attempting to defend harden and Durant in Mikal Bridges.  I also don't know what the nets are going to do to defend deandre ayton."
"Agreed. Especially since the player that Mcdonough wanted to trade up for was SGA who's a good player, but let's be honest. Bridges is exactly who you want next to booker at SF.    A lot of the best players in the league are either a SF or a Guard. Mikal is quick enough and long enough to guard 1-3 position comfortably while using his length to help get blocks on PFs with his help defense. It's within reason with the way Jones built this team (fit/need) in comparison to what Mcdonough had been drafting in his tenure (potential), that Jones influenced the Ayton/Bridges picks."
Mikal Bridges.   Dude does it all. The perfect glue guy for today’s NBA. If he can put some weight on his frame he could legitimately have a Kahwi type trajectory.
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
I’ve been a Mikal Bridges stan since the bubble
Mikal “The Warden” Bridges
"Damn I’m nuglife but very surprised at all the nuggets predictions. I can only see nuggets having a shot if AG clamps Booker for 7 games. As great as MPJ is, Mikal Bridges is on a tier above Powell. And Ayton is prolly a better post defender than Nurkic.  I really wish we played the Lakers instead."
"Mikal Bridges is a phenomenal defender with a 7’1 wingspan on the wing. What do you mean by that? It’s going to be a battle. There’s not going to be an easy bucket for Porter Jr, he’s gonna have to fight for sure."
Idk Mikal Bridges and Crowder (plus Ayton and Cam Payne at least this series) looked amazing.
Mikal Bridges and Michael Porter Jr key matchup
"Can we give Mikal Bridges an honorable mention? TBF I think of him as third best on the team; even on a good day. But man what a great wing defender he has turned out to be. And somehow the dude is the perfect 3 and D on the other end.   With the way he cuts to the rim and shakes up defenses, it doesn’t even seem fair to call him a 3 and D."
At least you didn’t draft Jahlil Okafor over him. Thank god we at least were smart enough to draft Mikal Bridges a few years later.
"Mikal Bridges is actually just limbs. He has no torso or groin, he's just an intersection of 4 feet long arms and legs"
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges?? Jae Crowder??
"I think he’s a really great player, but having him and Dame on the court at the same time doesn’t make sense. Ship him out and get a wing with some decent size. Thybulle, Butler, Wiggins, or Mikal Bridges would be better fits imo- especially if they keep Norm."
Mikal Bridges looks like pacman
Mikal Bridges so sweet
How is Mikal Bridges outplaying one of Lakers Big 3?
Mikal bridges winning player
"And Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo all won a championship together at Villanova. What a loaded team."
"Wiggins was not an elite defender and knock down 3 point shooter coming off his rookie contract. He’s a bad comparison, Mikal is like the anti wiggins. Wiggins has only just recently improved into a non negative player. Mikal is a perfect all around player with a great iq an incredible attitude and work ethic. Also this specifically said near max not max. Bridges is absolutely worth it and if you don’t think so you likely haven’t seen his improvement this year."
"It was hyped, especially the top picks. I remember praying that the Suns would get a top 2 pick because I wanted Luka or Ayton so badly. The rest of the top prospects were seen as really good as well, I was stoked when we got Mikal Bridges in that trade"
"I see you forgot Mikal Bridges, so allow me.  Mikal Bridges."
"2018 could go down as one of the greatest drafts of all time. Doncic and Young are almost certainly Hall of Famers if they stay healthy. Ayton, SGA, and MPJ also have a strong change if they continue their current trajectory.     And that doesn't include guys like Sexton, Jaren Jackson, Mikal Bridges, etc. Absolutely loaded draft class."
Or the Jazz can take mikal bridges off the suns hands to help cp3 fleece the suns.
Imagine if they just kept Mikal Bridges
If Mikal Bridges is getting 20 million then OG Anunoby needs to leave Klutch Sports Lmao. Rich Paul is a terrible negotiator.
"Ayton is one of the better centers in the league Heck one of the best when you consider how small the center market is, mikal is one of the better 3 and d players who can also drive to the basket at a decent level.  That trio can absolutely get to the playoffs especially seeing as they almost did last year with Ayton missing 25 games and with Ayton and bridges being worse than this year"
Really took Kevin Knox instead of Mikal Bridges smh
&gt;So lucky to have Mikal bridges  Yeah we usually play really well against the Mavs and a lot of it has to do with Bridges  I love how James Jones constructed this roster because we really don't have many weaknesses. Even if we don't have a superstar we have solid guys everywhere who are buying into their role and playing it well
Suns are if cp3 stays somewhat healthy. So lucky to have Mikal bridges
"Ayton, Trae, Luka, MPJ, and SGA are all guys who can be making All-NBA teams either currently or in the future. Luka and Trae are potential MVPs  Sexton and JJJ might be able to sneak in couple all-star appearances. and Mikal Bridges is going to be the premier 3 and D guy in the league."
OG or Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges is not a role player, just FYI for everyone."
"Mikal bridges, tj warren, Terrance Ross, serge ibaka, pj tucker, tony ""100 percent free throw shooter"" Snell."
"Mikal Bridges was a 43% three-point shooter and Cam Payne was 44% lol, they are both right at their season averages.  Lakers fans saying this kind of stuff definitely didn't watch the Suns this year and it shows."
Mikal Bridges
"I like this list and I would add Mikal Bridges, Joe Harris, Monte Morris, and PJ Washington"
"AD really only looked MVP worthy like 2015-2018. He actually had the highest PER in the league in 2015. Since he's joined the Lakers he's been just alright, not as amazing, he was great in the playoffs last year. This year he was REALLY mailing it in during the regular season and then when playoffs came around he has been hit or miss. He just doesn't really seem capable of having MVP type impact because he isn't really a great passer and he isn't someone like Giannis that can give 30 a night in 30 minutes EVERY NIGHT if they wanted to. His rebounding has always been good but he has been getting less boards on the Lakers. Now that he isn't the #1 option on a team his individual stats just don't scream ""MVP"" anymore.   What gives AD his biggest advantage is his athletic ability, size, just overall dominance and with injuries it becomes REALLY hard for physically dominant players to win MVP ever as opposed to players that have really worked on their skills when it comes to shooting and having insane court vision (Curry, Durant, Harden, LeBron, Jokic). The game is becoming more cerebral and skill oriented and physical dominance is no longer the MASSIVE advantage is used to be. I mean it's great and you can see it really make a difference. A guy like Mikal Bridges is insanely good because he makes smart plays but he's enabled to make those plays by having those crazy long arms. But basically guys like Curry and Harden show that being physically dominant isn't a requirement and really the the future is BBIQ oriented players."
"Tyrese Haliburton, OG Anunoby, Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Dejounte Murray"
"Yeah Suns best lineup that year was a rookie Deandre Ayton, a rookie Mikal Bridges, a rookie De’Anthony Melton, Devin Booker and a chronically hurt TJ Warran. We were giving JIMMER FREDETTE minutes that year lmao"
"One thing i havent seen mentioned on here, the AD injury allowed mikal bridges to guard schroder for the majority of the game. I dont think its a coincidence that this was his worst game"
"Game 4 he also shot poorly. Since AD went down, Bridges has moved onto to guarding him. Schroeder is in Mikal Jail until they find a way to adjust."
"I get that this is a shit on Schroeder thread but the real answer is Mikal Bridges.   Mikal has had to guard Lebron up to this point in the series but with AD out, Crowder takes that assignment and Mikal slides over guard Schroeder and that’s a nightmare matchup for him"
Mikal Bridges

So happy we traded mikal bridges and passed on Mpj for zhaire smith
Dude met Mikal Bridges tonight
Mikal Bridges doesn't want this guy paid lol

Damn Mikal bridges robbin fools on and off the court

Mikal bridges baby
I reiterate:  Mikal Bridges

1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
Mikal Bridges is criminally underrated
"Off topic, anyone know what shoes Mikal Bridges is wearing?"
Mikal Bridges
Shai Mikal and MPJ are great players also in that lottery. Miles bridges looks a lot better too
Wow. More deflections than Mikal Bridges
"Lol what. Ayton is an elite defensive anchor who's p switcheable. Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and Torrey Craig are some of the best defenders to throw at Lebron."
"1) You clearly don't take his high ankle sprain seriously, and you should  2) THE SUNS ARE REALLY GOOD ON DEFENSE. Give my boys some credit! Jeez.   Go watch the film. Ayton made his life a living hell.  And btw, LeBron drove to the rim more times than any other game this season in game 4 per Zach Lowe...so...you're going to just need to give the Suns and Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder and Torrey Craig some credit.   LeBron has been killing Cam Johnson though. You can have that."
I think Mikal Bridges and Crowder is pretty good personnel for PG and Kawhi
"Jae Crowded shuts down KD, Mikal Bridges length can slow down Harden and CP3 is a former all defensive player for Kyrie /s"
"Man, if Thybulle gets a Marcus Smart or Mikal Bridges type of role, I swear... this guy will be DPOY multiple years. I see HOF potential with this guy."
He had a play where he undercut Mikal Bridges this preseason too.
"suns have mikal bridges, jae crowder, cam johnson, Torrey Craig to throw at him. all those guys are long and good defenders. plus there is ayton on the help rotation. the suns defense is really good. its a lot to handle. even for lebron."
Mikal Bridges instead of trading him to Phoenix.  I really wish the Colangelos didn't trade up for Fultz and we got Tatum.
"Crazy that that draft class produced so many great players like JJJ, Ayton, Trae, and even a player who is already a superstar, Mikal Bridges."
Utah has some dogs on defense + Gobert who is a certified stopper. Also if the suns do move past the lakers (who knows rn) Mikal Bridges is an elite defender and Ayton has shown out to be an elite defender as well.
Mikal Bridges
Mikal “should be a Sixer” Bridges with a clutch 3
Mikal Bridges makes the correct life choice and gets out of the way
Every Mikal Bridges 3 stings as a reminder that he would've been a perfect story for the 6ers god damn
That should've been an And 1 on Mikal 'LeBron James Jr' Bridges wtf refs get it together
Imagine trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges
"I’m loving that our team are the bad guys in this sub right now lmao we’re going against the defending champions who get every other call going their way, Schroeder was being a little shit the entire night and even hit Book in the nuts before the shove but of course you won’t see shit about that on here. AD kicked Crowder in the nuts this game, Harrell barreled towards Cam Payne game one and gave him a fuckin black eye, Lebron pushed Mikal Bridges in mid air during a PRESEASON game this year and it wasn’t even a blip on the league’s radar. Fuck outta here you whiners."
Mikal Bridges*
"Someone just needs to inspire confidence. I feel like if crowder or Mikal get going everyone else will too. Crowder, Bridges, Johnson all just have a lid on the rim."
"looking at it now. Clint Capela #10, Fred VanVleet #17 (above Beal), Mikal Bridges #19 (the highest Sun), Jakob Poeltl #21 (one above CP3)... needs some work"
I was thinking about that recently. Mikal Bridges was drafted with one of the picks that we had to send over in the Steve Nash trade. MPJ and SGA also would have been available right there.
MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo  6MOY: Jalen Brunson  MIP: Mikal Bridges  DPOY: Ben Simmons  COY: Mike Budenholzer  Finals MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo
Three games in and Mikal Bridges has been almost a complete non-factor on offense for the Suns. Needless to say it's been hugely frustrating to watch.
"Mikal ""Payne"" Bridges"
thats mikal bridges
That’s mikal bridges not payne
"It is weird that Phoenix is almost looking like the inverted purple side of the Lakers purple and gold, especially because Mikal Bridges is wearing gold shoes."
I love Mikal bridges
"I'm telling you right now. I'm a Mavs fan but I watched a lot of Suns games since Ayton got drafted (same year as Luka ofc) and I also was a big fan of Tsunami Papi (guy fell off a cliff since knee injury). Mikal Bridges is my second favorite player in the league behind Luka. On god I cannot stop praising this guy to all my friends and anyone that cares to listen. Literally almost the perfect basketball player. Dude formed a hitch in his shot, FIXED IT, now shooting over 40% like come on man. Defense? ELITE. Deadass one of THE best on ball defenders in the league. Also he almost never fucking turns over the ball and ALWAYS makes the right play on offense. Seriously I don't think I've ever seen a player who's nothing but a positive on the court. Fucking perfect.   My love letter to Mikal Bridges."
CP3 with Zions youth and Mikal Bridges health.  Same with D Rose.
Would be easy to just name superstars so let's make this interesting.  Player: Talen Horton-Tucker with Ingles shooting and Mikal Bridges defense.
"He obviously wasn't perfect--especially in the draft  But he built the foundation of a rising team capable of making the 2nd round with a treasure trove of assets to be used to build on it  Those assets were used to trade up from 3 to 1 to pick Fultz, acquire Tobias and max him, acquire Jimmy and let him walk after a year to sign Al Horford, move back from Mikal Bridges to get Zhaire Smith and a whole bunch of awful moves that could have built a dynasty--or more likely considering Hinkie had his share of mistakes at least a competent contender that doesn't lose to the effing Hawks"
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn’t convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn’t perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn’t a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn’t fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"Of the assets that Hinkie acquired:  Covington, Saric, Jerami Grant, 2018 1st (from MCW trade, Mikal Bridges), 2018 1st (from Elfrid Payton trade, Shamet), 2019 1st (from Nik Stauskas trade)  were in part turned into  Butler (gone)  Harris (who was then given a max deal)  Maxey (who ironically enough the Sixers traded the pick earlier for some euro guy who never panned out and only got it back in the Fultz dump)  Mike Muscala (who helped them get the pick that turned into Maxey by making a game winning shot while he was with OKC)  Also, I think technically the pick the Sixers gained from the Bridges-for-Zhaire Smith trade was in the Tobias Harris trade, and LAC traded it to OKC in the PG13 trade."
"His scoring and rebounding went up on a per game basis, while his assists stayed the same and his turnovers were down. His shooting was slightly less efficient but still close to 40/50/90 considering the small sample size. The issue was not Tobi.  Calling the Zhaire and Tobi trades bad trades also doesn't apply context to the situation. The Zhaire trade happened the off-season before they went all in on the Butler and Harris trades. Having a rookie Mikal Bridges on that team instead of Tobi would have made much less sense. And we still don't know what could've been with Zhaire if he didn't almost die."
"Huerter because he keeps his cool in the last two minutes, does not look rushed and has more upside than Herro. Hurther seems to have a lower ceiling than Bridges. For Herro, I really don't think he can be a starter or even 6-8 in a playoff team.  I really think very highly of both Huerter and Mikal Bridges."
"Mikal Bridges is about to sign a max rookie extension, is Zhaire even with you guys any more? It's not even comparable"
What kind of bridge is Mikal Bridges?
"Well, at least Mikal Bridges worked out."
THEY TRADED AWAY MIKAL BRIDGES FOR A GUY WHO'S NOT EVEN IN THE LEAGUE.
"Nobody is debating that he’s better on offense. But he’s not a more versatile defender than the 3 time DPOY what are you talking about. I didn’t say he was the 2nd option on offense, I said he’s the 2nd best player. And ayton is third because he feeds off other players on his team, he gets lobs and dump offs. Mikal Bridges is a better offensive player than deandre ayton"
"Philly did a great job of accumulating draft picks. But they drafted Jahill Okafor when they already had Noel &amp; Embiid. They drafted Mikal Bridges but then traded him for Zhaire Smith.  And of course, the Fultz disaster.   Draft picks are only as good as what you do with them."
#HOMEGROWN MIKAL BRIDGES
"Jaylen brown, taTum, Middleton, lavine, butler, hayward,klay, demar, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal murray, cj mcollum Are all better than him easily. Powell, Anthony Edwards, hield, mikal bridges, etc are arguably better."
Underrated terrible draft pick Zhaire Smith (who they traded Mikal Bridges to acquire). Bridges would have been a great fit on this Sixers team.
How the fuck is this considered an excuse? Its on them to scout better. Mikal Bridges is another one
"I know I'm late here and no one is going to see this, but imagine the 76ers don't trade the rights to Mikal Bridges."
What sucks even more is how we traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith(who’s basically out of the NBA) and that protected first round pick from Miami that was massively overvalued. Everyone knows the Heat never tank.
"Doing it by year:   2016: no one 2017: Donovan Mitchell 2018: SGA, Miles or Mikal Bridges, MPJ and 2nd round Mitch Rob or Gary Trent Jr 2019: RJ Barrett 2020: Tyrese Haliburton, Quickley"
"Fifth best is generous for Bagley lol. I’d take the other too 5 guys and then Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ and Huerter over him at the very least."
Mikal “the warden” bridges
"It’s a really, really good class. Ayton, Luka, Trae, Jaren Jackson, MPJ, Mitchell Robinson, Lonnie Walker, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson are all at the very least quality rotational players, at most superstars. That’s just off the top of my head, there’s probably more."
"I'm sure you can do this for pretty much every team, but here are the players they missed out on during the Process era:  2013: Giannis  2015: Booker  2016: Jaylen Brown  2017: Jayson Tatum  2018: SGA, or keep Mikal Bridges"
"Hey, you stop slandering their beloved Process. That same Process got me Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith and a late pick. I trust their process completely"
"Yeah speaking of which, mikal bridges wouldn’t help this team at all or anything"
Ben Simmons &lt; Mikal Bridges
This guy made it over mikal bridges
"Eh.. bit of a revisionist history there. At the time, they already have a Mikal Bridges, who just had a 1st team All Defensisve season with 37% 3pt shooting in Robert Covington. Their biggest need at the time was a replacement down the line for expiring JJ Redick so they traded for a SG. Admittedly, trading for Zhaire was a bad trade, but no one couldve predicted the freak accident he had, and even if he was healthy, he might not be a great fit. If they had traded for a better shooting prospect like Huerter or DiVincenzo, it wouldnt be as bad of a trade."
"Still, Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges was steal of the year"
"Reposting what I posted a week ago about this topic:  &gt; Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  &gt; Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  &gt; James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  &gt; If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  &gt; 1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  &gt; But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF.  And now we're 3 wins away from the finals."

Mikal Bridges better
"JVG: ""Hey siri, who's the best cutter in the NBA? Answer: Mikal Bridges"""
"Thybulle is awesome, I'm not sure who he should be in over but Bridges definitely should have been all defense. Mikal is the man"
shoutout mikal bridges and Ayton for stepping the fuck up
"Devin Booker is obviously a bad man, but Mikal Bridges is such a stud.   2 blocks on PG, 1 in the last 10 seconds with a 4-point difference, poking the ball loose at the end to prevent any deep Clippers 3s, the lob!  Pheonix should be sending fruit baskets to the 76ers for giving him away"
Mikal Bridges.
"I love Mikal Bridges man, he was so good in the 4th"
"In the playoffs, yes, at least until Simmons can reliably shoot 50% from the FT line.    Same for Mikal Bridges."
Mikal Bridges was made in a lab with Stacey Augmon and Bruce Bowen’s DNA
Also Mikal Bridges is amazing
Mikal Bridges with the clutch block!
Philly is going to lose this championship because of that Mikal Bridges trade. And Phoenix might win because of that.
lol Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges
"Name a more likeable player than Mikal Bridges, I'll wait"
Is that a Mikal Bridges 7-2 run in the 4th quarter of a conference finals game? Nowhere is safe for Sixers fans.
MY GOODNESS MIKAL BRIDGES
Fucking Mikal Bridges!
"I did and he has his upside.  But ultimately he’s not worth a max contract imo, I’d take a mikal bridges or like any day over kyrie"
I wonder if Mikal Bridges came out the womb with those yellow shoes on
"IIRC the sequence of events was:  We didn’t know if Embiid would ever play though (he missed his first two seasons), and Jah could have been flipped for a decent price after his first season. Colangelo refused to sell when he still had value, and I sincerely hope those Celtics trade rumors are not true for my own sanity.  The Process itself was fairly successful. It got a core Embiid, Simmons, Covington, Fultz (lol kill me) and picks (could have been Mikal Bridges). It was the mismanagement of assets by Colangelo and Brand that ruined it. Tobias trade, Butler trade, failing to trade Jah for anything, Fultz trade and selection, Horford...the list goes on!   If Fultz pans out many of the trades probably don’t happen, our timeline isn’t rushed, and the lineup is probably like Simmons Fultz Covington Mikal Embiid, and Saric maybe still on the bench. Jesus Christ I made myself sad again"
Mikal Bridges underrated.

Terrance Mann vs Mikal Bridges  The battle of the decade
The issue with Utah is that they have subpar defenders at nearly every position other than C.  We will see if Mikal Bridges and Jae make the difference vs the Clips.
"Mikal Bridges is gonna get a max contract offer? I absolutely love the guy but I didn't realize he was that good. I like lanky 3 and D guys, does he really have that much value? Can he create his own shot at all?  Not trying to argue I'm genuinely curious if you think he is deserving of it because obviously you would know more about him than me."
It’s been confirmed by multiple people close to Chris Paul. Most athletes don’t just come out and say anything. But he volunteered at a mass vaccination site with Mikal Bridges and Frank Kaminsky back in February. You have to get vaccinated to do that in AZ. He also received Pfizer.
"I agree, linear progression does not always happen.  But we’ve been witnessing it with Mikal Bridges and Ayton for 2-3 years now.   I’ll believe they’ve peaked when they stop improving, but hasn’t happened yet."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Mikal Bridges. He doesn’t get enough love. Hoping he can turn some heads with his defense on PG.
I dunno about that. Did you see Mikal Bridges fourth quarter and OT domination game?
Suns perimeter defenders won’t just allow Reggie Jackson to drive past them at will so no. Mikal Bridges is basketball Jesus suns in 3
"IMO they don’t need to do much. They need better wings. Bojan, Ingles, Clarkson while being great shooters absolutely let Gobert get exposed by being beat off the dribble every possesion and when rudy went into the paint to help, their rotations were nonexistent. Even Mitchell was guilty of this but Hes good enough offensively to where hes still a plus on the floor. IMO they need to better 3&amp;D players if they want to keep Mitchell &amp; Gobert together. They cant rely on bad on ball defenders funneling their man towards Rudy AND have dog shit rotations. They need more players like Royce and less like Ingles, Bojan. Someone like Mikal Bridges on the suns would be perfect for this team or maybe a Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig type.   We’ll see if I’m right next series though. Maybe the Suns get exposed in the same fashion."
Mikal Bridges.
Mikal Bridges is a better defender than anyone on the Jazz for Paul George. Ayton was the x-factor in round 1 and 2. Mikal is the x-factor in round 3.
Mikal Bridges  My hometown hero
Robert Covington and Mikal Bridges
People forget about Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson also
"It very well could be. Depends on how highly the team thinks of a particular prospect. If a team really highly values a particular guy and they can get him at 10 but not 16, that can be incredibly valuable. Look back at any draft and see the difference a few picks can make.   For example, look at the Sixers-Suns trade a few years ago. The Suns traded up from 16 to 10. The Suns got Mikal Bridges and the Sixers got Zhaire Smith. That’s a HUGE difference in player quality with just a handful of picks."
"they also traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith, incredible draft acumen down in Philly"
Fox  Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Mikal Bridges  Tobias Harris  Ayton
Trading away Mikal Bridges for nothing.
"Meh thats cap. Harris is a very one dimensional role player; all he really does is run around and shoot 3s.  Guys like Mikal Bridges, Dillon brooks, Royce o neale are multi-dimensional role players. They can get boards, play defense, and score. Regardless of whether their shot is falling, they are very important to the squad."
"Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart, Thybulle, O.G. Anouby, Bam, Gobert, Royce O'Neale, Draymond Green, Dort, AD, Paul George, Giannis, Simmons, Embiid, Isaac are some players that come to my mind right now that are currently on my favorite defensive players to watch.  I appreciate defense, especially isolation defense as you said.   Peak Kawhi, Josh Smith, Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, Bryant, KG, are some of my favorite defenders back in the days to watch.   Man, it's almost criminal to this day that Duncan's never ever won DPOY...."

"Mikal Bridges will average 14/4/2 while ""holding"" Giannis to 28/11/6 on 55 TS% and win FMVP. Iguodala 2.0."
"&gt;there are usually more than 4 solid three point shooters in the lottery lol.  Well, there are 5 this year. Let's check the past few drafts.   2020: Toppin(low volume), Smith(low volume), Vassell, Haliburton, Lewis, Nesmith.  2019: Morant, Hunter(low volume), Garland, Johnson, Washington(low volume)  2018: Young, JJJ(low volume), Bagley(low volume), WCJ(low volume), SGA(low volume), Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Robinson  There are usually about 3-4 actual proven shooters in the lottery of each class, not counting guys with solid percentages that only have like 2 attempts per game.   ------------  &gt;and no chance in hell those guys guard 3 positions at an average level.  Name which one of them couldn't guard 3 or more(not counting McBride who I already said)."
"yeah your starting five is easily among the best in the league  no weak points at all, when mikal bridges and jae crowder are your worst starters you are in a damn good spot"
"Idc what anyone says I wanted Mikal Bridges at the time of the draft and I still would draft him now, even over MPJ"

"By a total of two points split across both games. I'm not someone saying it's a Bucks win, but those regular season games aren't much to base the playoffs on - decided by a single point each time, one off the back of contentious FTs with 1 second to go, while nightmare man Mikal Bridges went 8-10 from 3 and Cameron fkin Johnson had 6 3's."
"1. Mikal Bridges 2. KJ 3. Hunter\* 4. Cam Reddish  &gt;Who might have the highest ceiling  I think Hunter and Reddish both have the highest, although Hunter may become something special man. I'm still not convinced Bridges or Johnson cannot add more parts to their game to become more fully rounded."
"Mikal Bridges - I already have him slotted in for a Jimmy Butler-like leap, but since he has massive physical advantages compared to Butler, it might look more like a Curry leap."
"Matchups  PG: CP3 vs Jrue, I'll take CP3.  SG: Booker vs Middleton, I'll take Booker.   SF: PJ Tucker vs Mikal Bridges, Wash  PF: Giannis vs Crowder, I'll take Giannis  C: Lopez vs Ayton, I'll take Ayton  Bench: I'll take the Suns bench  I'm a Suns fan but I don't see an easy series for either team. I think it's going 7, and anything can happen that game. But I can see why the Suns have a slight edge."
"&gt; But Ben never tells his viewers that Wilt’s 1962 ranks in the TOP 4 ALL TIME in WS, OWS, and PER.  ...Who cares? These stats are trash. Mikal Bridges collected more offensive Win Shares than Luka Doncic this season"

"Exactly that's the only reason why I kept Mikal Bridges in the starting lineup. He doesn't need the ball to be effective, he's a good cutter and he plays great defense.  JJJ would be a huge boost off the bench."
"I think Mikal bridges is pretty likeable too.  I definitely understand why opposing fans don't like Book, CP3 and Jae though"
"I like how people are trying to completely denigrate the Suns, even though they have a star who was loyal and didn't force a trade, they have a coach who is one of the nicest guys in the League and Ayton who is another completely genuine and humble guy... All because of CP3 lol.  Like the Suns as a whole are pretty likable, don't like CP3 that's fine but there are plenty of guys/stories on the Suns that make them more likeable.  Booker sticking with Phoenix, Cam Paynes revival, Mikal Bridges &amp; Ayton being super humble humans, Monty, etc...  That said I don't think the bucks are the most likable team in this finals."
Being guarded by Mikal Bridges is gonna be quite different than being guarded by Huerter.
"And we traded away Jerami Grant for Ilyasova for no reason other than to win 3 more games in a non contending season. Fultz, Zhaire Smith, and Ersan an could’ve very easily been Tatum, Mikal Bridges, and Jerami Grant. We hit on just one of those and it could’ve been the difference in a championship run."
"i mean that's because they're usually considered to be stars, while role players are literally role players. Obviously you'll be more mad if Zach Lavine has a bad game vs Mikal Bridges having an off shooting night"
"I don't think we can declare the Process a success or a failure until the Joel Embiid (and possibly Ben Simmons, or whatever assets we get for Simmons) era is over and we have or have not won a championship.  The ultimate goal of the Process was to accumulate as many assets as possible for talent accumulation because Hinkie knew that it wasn't possible to hit on every single draft pick.  It was okay that he missed on Noel and Okafor because they weren't his only chances.  Hinkie had some wins (draft + trade of MCW, drafting Embiid, drafting Saric - including the trade he swung to acquire a pick with Saric, drafting Simmons, signing Covington, Grant, McConnell), and he had some misses (Noel, Okafor, having zero competent point guards on the roster during the 1-30 start), but a large part of why the Process is perceived as a failure is due to the squandering of the treasure chest of assets post-Hinkie.  Yes, it's impossible to know what Hinkie would have done with those assets, but due to Adam Silver's meddling, we'll never know.  Hate on what Hinkie did all you want, but he played within the rules of the game and when the other owners got butthurt, he paid the price.  Look at all of the assets we used to acquire Butler (Covington and Saric), and Harris (Shamet, Miami 2021 pick - which was acquired in the Mikal Bridges trade).  The pick that was used to select Bridges came from the MCW trade.  It was stupid to choose Brett Brown over Butler, only to fire Brown one year later, but that wasn't Hinkie's doing.  Hinkie accumulated the assets that made it possible to acquire Butler and Harris.  Despite being down to the last remnants of the Process (Embiid and Simmons), Philly still has an opportunity to win a championship.  We haven't won one since 1983, and haven't even made the conference finals since 2001.  If we can win a championship with either Embiid and/or Simmons (or the Simmons assets), the Process will 100% be a success.  For everyone who says ""oh, but you suffered through all of the tanking years"".  I would 100% ""suffer"" through four years of losing basketball rather than be stuck in 7-10 seed purgatory for a decade.  I LOVED those early Process years.  There were zero expectations and it was refreshing watching all of those young guys try to find their place in the league.  Watching TJ McConnell, one of the original Processors hit that buzzer beating winner against the Knicks has been one of my top Sixer highlights.  tl dr; If Philly wins a title with Embiid and/or Simmons, the Process is a success.  If not, it's a failure."
"The moves were made with assets gained during the process.   If the Sixers trade for Butler, for example, they have spent their assets well. Then when they piss away Butler for Josh Richardson, then their account value goes negative.   No one ever said every move was bad by the the post process regime, but the pissing away a 2017 Top 3 pick, the ultimate role player in Mikal Bridges, and trading Butler for Josh Richardson all contribute majorly to the degradation of the team’s asset portfolio value."
"The goal was to win the championship, or more accurately to build a team that could win the championship. Embiid played MVP caliber this year and Butler led a team to the finals last year, there is no doubt that should be a big time championship contender every year, especially with the extra two Top 50 caliber players they had to add to their two All NBA guys.  The process is a success in that it built them a championship roster, even with the blunders of the Colangelo/Brown years, which are a series of pissing away all the wealth gathered during the process. From getting rid of a draft pick to move up 2 picks in the draft, wasting a No. 1 pick on Fultz, trading Mikal Bridges, and then losing Jimmy Butler because you decided you should build around guys that played worse than him in the 2019 playoffs.  The failure of the Sixers is from what happened after The Process / Hinkie. The Tobias Harris trade is generally marked as the end of the process as that’s when the Sixers had cashed in all their major trade chips, but the decay was already there with the 2017 and 2018 draft blunders.   The process is such a success that they were so asset rich that they are still a fringe contender after pissing away an All NBA player."
"The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time. The process was a resounding success. That was even after burning assets like Mikal Bridges and the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft.  Getting rid of Butler is the big mistake (in addition to the Fultz pick), but that happened post process. If they kept Butler, you have Butler, Harris, and Embiid which is a great big 3, and could have used Ben Simmons in trades more aggressively."
"You’re correct that Ingram mostly shoots 3s above the break both this year and last.  But Ingram took 1.5 more catch and shoot 3s per game than pull up 3s and shot 43.2% on them. And while he attempted less than he had the previous year, he was still making only .4 per game fewer than last year.   He averages more made catch and shoot 3s than Huerter, Gallinari, Ingles, Reggie Jackson and Seth Curry and the same as Gary Trent Jr, Mikal Bridges, and Norman Powell."
I think that was mikal bridges that got traded for zhaire smith. Or maybe my timeline is off lol
"No. Jaylen Brown, contrary to what some people think, has been a great defender in the postseason. Last postseason for example, he had more total defensive win shares (4th in the league behind Tatum, Lebron, AD) than Butler or Bam despite playing 4 less games.   His d-bpm was 1.1. Guys who had lower ones last playoffs include Dort, PG, Gobert, and Embiid. In this playoffs, that includes Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, and PG.  He had a plus 3 d-raptor, tied with Tatum. Guys with lower ones last year included Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This postseason, the following guys have a plus 2.5 at most: Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG."
"Yeah Moody seems to have a huge variance in where he’s going. 6’6” doesn’t seem undersized to me though. Same height as Klay, Danny Green and Mikal Bridges who are the prototypical 3&amp;D players you want him to end up being."
"Jaylen’s an underrated defender by this point. He struggled this season (like everyone on the Celtics but advanced stats still mostly had him as neutral or a slight negative defensively) and some cherry picked clips that could be found on almost any player made people focus on his offball defense, often criticizing him for a defensive lapse that I’d later see an actual analyst fault someone else for.  He’s still a great on ball defender - while he’s in the top sixth of the league for shots attempted against him, opponents shoot 2.2% worse than their average when he defends them. That’s better than Ayton, RJ, OG, PG, Lonzo, Capela, Jrue, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges and a lot of others. There are some defensive advanced stats that put him above Tatum though I think Tatum’s definitely better.   He’d consistently raised his defense in the postseason and was fantastic last year while also also averaging 22 ppg on 58.6% ts. He tied Tatum in defensive raptor with +3  above guys like Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This year, guys with at least a .5 lower d-raptor include Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG. He also had a 1.1 dbpm which was better than Dort, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Danny Green and more last year and this year would be more than players like Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, PG. Most impressively, he had the 4th most total defensive win shares with 1.1 only after Tatum, Lebron, and AD. Part of that is him getting to the ecf but Butler and Bam got to the finals and still have fewer defensive win shares."
"If the Bucks pull through, this is going to be the most conflicting Finals I've watched in 15 years less the Raptors run as a Canadian.  I want Giannis to get one, I want Brook to get one, I want Jrue to get one, I want PJ to get one, but Devin Booker is my favorite SG in the game right now other than DeMar, CP is one of my favorite PGs, Mikal Bridges was huge in me winning fantasy (he also has the most Brandon Roy voice ever), and I'm a huge fan of DA.  Gonna be a good one."
"Mikal bridges will get it or very close one day, the 5x5"
***This*** is the type of content you're here for? Lazy predictions about who won't be an all star? Then you're gonna *love* this:  * James Wiseman will never be an all star  * Mikal Bridges will never be an star  * Miles Bridges will never be an all star  * Evan Mobley will never be an all star  * Mike Conley will never be a two time all star  Enjoy! I have hundreds more
"He was absolutely garbage at drafting. TJ Warren, Devin Booker &amp; DeAndre Ayton are the only ones he hit on  Len is very meh for a top-5 pick, but tbh the 2013 draft was a shitshow for most of the lottery anyway.  Then he drafted Dragan Bender with the 4th pick in 2016, as if that wasn't enough went and took Papagiannis &amp; Labissiere as well. So thats 3 useless 7-foot bums in 1 draft. He then packaged Bogdanovic/Papagiannis/Labissiere for Chriss  Blew top another top-5 pick in 2017, this time for Josh Jackson who was the prototypical uber-athletic knucklehead wing. Jackson lasted only 2 years before he was dumped to Memphis  And I'm pretty sure the only good trades he ever made was trading Scola for Gerald Green (who was a valuable part of that 48-win team in 2014) &amp; trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges"
"He literally overruled a trade and forced them to take bridges, Mikal is literally his guy, he’s not gonna trade him for Jack shit."
"Do you think that’s some magical revelation? Really, you’d rather watch KD and Bron duel than Kris Middleton and Mikal Bridges??? No way!!! Some people just like watching basketball, what’s the point in trying to act like some smug dweeb because you don’t wanna watch the games but other people do? No one cares."
Mikal Bridges also said on the JJ Redick podcast that Chris Paul is equally willing to take criticism and that's also what makes it work. Everybody knows it's to make the team better and doesn't get upset about it
I want Mikal Bridges and Donte DiVincenzo to both win a title somehow.  I would prefer Bridges foe obvious reasons.
Three fouls on their first two possessions. I’m still not sure how that Mikal Bridges block on Paul George wasn’t overturned.
think it’s saying mikal bridges is pippen and not ayton
Look up what LeBron did to mikal bridges in a freaking preseason game. Comparable to what he did to embiid. Sweeps the leg and pushed him in the air. Made him pretty much land on his head
Mikal Bridges gonna win fmvp and starts his Kawhi Leonard transformation trajectory arc.
Mikal Bridges for FMVP
I can see why people have issues with some of our other players…but I definitely feel the need to defend Mikal Bridges here. He was kind of quiet this series but I’ve always thought he’s a genuinely likable guy.
Mikal Bridges: IS A TEAMMATE
"We had the choice of Michael Porter, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, and Kevin Knox. And we chose Kevin fucking Knox. A full time bench warmer by his 3rd season. This draft will haunt me forever."
Mikal Bridges as well.
"Mikal ""Juan "" Steph curry's teamamate"" Toscano-Anderson"" Bridges"
I feel like if anything it should be Mikal Bridges dances with teammate
Mikal “Teammate” Bridges
Westbrook walked so Mikal Bridges could run.
"Okay so the experience is evened out. With things how they are, I still think the Bucks could put up a fight. If Holiday can lock CP down, right away they’ve cut the head off the snake. If he can’t operate at will, they’re gonna struggle to get open looks. Middleton may not be a world beater, but he’s no slouch. On both sides of the ball. If Lopez plays hard and smart, he can force Ayton to work. Especially if he’s knocking 3s down, forcing Ayton outta the paint and opening offensive rebounds. The rest of the bucks are essentially wild cards, but the same could be said about the Suns. Apart from maybe Mikal Bridges. It’d be a Suns dub probably, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a long series"
Its not even some bench scrub its Mikal Bridges lol
"Mikal Bridges lol ""teammate"""
whats with Mikal Bridges going full Ben Simmons on his jumpshot as of late.   &amp;#x200B;  Does not seem to want to shoot AT ALL!
Mikal Bridges looks like he can’t close his mouth
Mikal Bridges looks like one of the fishes on Shark Tales
Does Mikal Bridges look like a black Pete Davidson or did I take too many edibles.
Craig on PG is the key. Bridges has been having trouble on defense this series and if he's missing shots he can be a liability.  I expect to at least see more action/movement from Mikal in the second half
Mikal Bridges has been soft &amp; underwhelming this series imo
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"I couldn’t be less emotional man lmao you’re the one trying to convince yourself you didnt play a crippled and injured team to get a cakewalk to the conference finals.   Literally look at the nuggets spacing after the Jamal injury and before dozier and Barton’s injury to get your answer, it was far better than what we saw in the playoffs but you only watch Phoenix so ok.   a broken nose is nowhere near as bad of an injury as other stars have been dealing with and you still move the exact same.   Mikal played good d but MPJ was obviously moving stiff which backs up the reports that came out, it’s not either or.  It kind of does because having Murray and a healthy Barton actually forces Booker and CP3 to defend instead of sagging off Facu and Rivers, we see how that makes them play worse now that they’re forced to defend against the clippers.   Dozier is also the nuggets best guard defender and can actually stay in front of book and CP3 unlike Facu and Rivers so that helps too.   Like imagine whoever you consider the suns 2nd best player out of CP3 and Book out of the series, Ayton playing with back problems, bridges back for game 2 on a minutes restriction and cam Payne out for the entire series playing a fully healthy nuggets. You’d consider it a lucky ass matchup for the nuggets."
"-Locks: Trae, Ayton Luka -Wouldn’t surprise me: JJJ, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ -Not max but big deals: Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Kevin Huerter, Lonnie Walker"
I just have a feeling Mikal Bridges' jumper would be fucked if he ended up on the Sixers. There was a lot of pre-draft noise about his shot being janky and having a hitch (and it still kinda does) so if he ended up in Philly he would've been cursed
"You did it without your 2nd best player, who is a bigger and better version of Mikal Bridges and would've been perfect for Middleton.    Given that Bogi was a shell of himself, you guys essentially did it without 3 of your best 6 players (I might have an inflated opinion of Reddish)."
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"Mikal Bridges can develop all three levels of scoring - spot up, pull up and at the rim, in a really short time : my opinion it will happen in next two seasons. And another: Poetl will become better at defending in space and become dpoy level impact defender (already elite rim protector, but struggle in defending space aka pnr) And another one: Ntilikina is nba  level player and he should play as shooting guard #FREENTILIKINA Michael Porter Junior will be next Kevin Durant Houston will be contenders(i hope they draft Mobley) nex season, Kenyon Martin Jr will be in the race for Most improved player and Khyri Thomas is nba level player his defense is insane. Utah need better defenders to be the true contenders- Gobert cant hold whole defense on his own and Utah failure is not his fault Raptors will be back stronger than ever and B mis season be title favorites"
"Unfortunately, Chris Paul is not a great 2nd option for a championship contender. Devin Booker also isn't a great 1st option for a championship contender at this point until he develops his handles and offensive repertoire more. Then you got Ayton who plays too soft for some reason at times and Mikal Bridges who's nowhere to be found on offense.  The postseason is all about half-court offense, and I thought the Suns were good at that, but the problem is that Chris Paul is not good enough to beat great playoff defenses that are athletic and can switch. He only had his great series in the 2nd round for a reason...because he could feast on bigs and slow wings all day. Now, he's got a lot more athletic and aggressive defenders on him.  The Suns have to figure out what they can get for Chris Paul in the offseason. I would not sign him to a huge contract if he limits your ceiling this much (can't imagine how badly he would struggle against the Bucks, Nets, or Sixers). He's just not worth 2nd-option-star money."
Mikal Bridges level lmfao   This might be the most homerism filled post I’ve seen today
"He should’ve known we couldn’t do the Bucks scheme with a washed Eric Bledsoe who was one of the worst defenders in the league, Steven Adams who moves like a snail and blocks under 1 shot per game, and forwards who are still learning on defense. And that scheme only works for the Bucks because they have a 6’11 DPOY at PF, a C who is a great shot blocker, and all defense level guards and wings.  And BI has the length to be a great defender, or maybe I should’ve used the word good. I think if he actually put effort into defense consistently he could get to around Mikal Bridges levels in his prime."
UNANIMOUS  Luka  Trae  Shai  PERCHANCE   MPJ  Ayton  NO  Mikal Bridges
"On the maybes...  I think JJJ gets it if he proves he's healthy.  Sexton... yikes.  I can see it happening but that's a bad max.  Mikal Bridges seems like a solid no right now.  Would really need to leap forward next year.  Seems like an obvious extension candidate this offseason anyway, so max very unlikely.  SGA is a yes.  MPJ is health dependent.  His play is there but it's not worth having an unreliable 3rd star."
"Yeah but with the benefit of hindsight, they could be in a better position if they didn't commit to building a contender concurrently with Jaylen/Jayson's first couple years in the league.  Sexton would be a great complement for them, and SGA and Mikal Bridges were two of the following three picks too, so they really could have a loaded young team if they had just hung onto the pick. They also probably wouldn't have wound up making the Kemba signing, which didn't really work out."
"I think it’s not that simple. Think about how many Clippers have seen &amp; really been through some shit in this league. Suns have CP &amp; Crowder. That’s it. They’re pretty green. Cam Johnson has great instincts on offense, almost always committing dumb fouls on the other end. You forgot Mikal Bridges was even out there tonight. Booker getting humiliated by Morris &amp; they just kept letting him do it. I remember another play in the 4th where Paul had the ball near the left block and got doubled. He tried to pass out, but everyone was frozen. It took way too long for someone to break free and cut. So many plays like this. Hesitant, struggling to match LA’s physically without fouling. And what’s the deal with Ayton?! No game plan at all. You can’t get him the ball some more when he’s your main advantage against their small lineup? You can’t counter the Clippers gang rebounding tactics? This was a tough game to sit through."
1. stay relatively healthy throughout the regular season  2. play injured teams in the playoffs  3. Monty Williams and CP3 connection  4. drafting/developing Ayton and Booker  5. steal Mikal Bridges and steal Jae Crowder (who was contemplating signing with my Mavs)
"According to 76ers fans, trading for Mikal Bridges."
"Literally no one in the thread you keep linking talked about mikal, the one comment was I understand Ayton getting paid but bridges? And it had 150 upvotes. No one is thinking this"
Bruh no one was advocating for Mikal fucking Bridges to get a max
Patrick Beverly being a better offensive player than either Jae Crowder or Mikal Bridges this series is funny af to me
"Mikal ""Max Contract"" Bridges with a clean 5 points"
Random as hell but does anyone know what shoes Mikal Bridges wears?  I also love the contrast of the pastel purple of Book's shoes and the bright yellow of Bridges'.
Y'all I might be high but Mikal Bridges looks like a titan from Attack on Titan to me.
Only suns player with a positive +/- ??? Mikal Bridges. Simply a marvel
Mikal bridges has such a friendly face
"McDaniels has the potential to be a lot better then Simmons. He has a strong shooting foundation, and has Simmons type defensive potential. He is a 6'10"" Mikal Bridges."
"Regardless what happens, Mikal Bridges is the most likable player out there"
He’s going to have nightmares of DeAndre Ayton and Mikal Bridges
Mikal bridges did the same thing as Bobby
mikal bridges a mix of doug christie + steve smith
"""fuck"" -Mikal Bridges"
So this is weird but Mikal Bridges’ face looks like a wax figure to me. Anyone else?
The “block” on mikal bridges
Mikal Bridges is having a great game so far. His defense on Jrue is making a huge impact. I like the aggressive trapping of Middleton on the pnr too.
Give it up for the guy doing everything he can on to grind this out for the Suns. It’s our guy!    #Mikal Bridges
"Mikal Bridges arrested, charged, booked, and cuffed Jrue Holiday his damn self"
"Kings would have moved up to pick Mills Bridges, only to realise afterwards they missed out on Mikal and accidently selected some Euro prospect."
everyone on the court looks ripped and like they've trained for years and mikal bridges looks like the suns walked through milwaukee looking for a ringer just before the game lmao
Okay here's my take:  Mikal Bridges is more like a Khris Middleton and the Suns are fucking up using him like he's Trevor Ariza
Mikal “Giannis” Bridges
I feel like everyone got a soft spot for Mikal Bridges
Cam Payne and Mikal Bridges seem to be the only ones on the Suns rn who know that this is an elimination game.
"i mean people act like cp3's offense has been the problem, its been his defense, (shame since he was a really good defender in his prime, but, y'know, father time).     like for example his ortg is still 118, its his drtg thats gone to 124, (which btw, booker has been at 123 for drtg and 111 ortg the series).  even in the last two games, while he sucked in game 4, (73 ortg, yikes) his game 5 he had a 153 ortg, but had 139 drtg.  furthermore, in game 5, his vorp was a team high 5.9, with a 7.9 obpm, also, the dbpm gave him -2.0 dbpm, while booker had -3.0 and even deandre ayton (who is one of the better defenders on phoenix) had -1.9.  another issue the suns have, is you cant play winning basketball when your top player has +40% usg rate, which he had 43% in game 5 and game 4, they aren't playing balanced basketball.   my overall point being, rather than cp3 being a scapegoat, maybe the suns have a lot of different issues that re causing them to lose, these include:  \- defensive guard play, booker and cp3 have been terrible on the defensive end.  \- non diverse offense, booker has a way too high a usg rate, in milwaukee, their top 3 players have atleast 20% usg rate, going 30/27/22 for antetokounmpo, middleton and holiday, compared to 35/25/16 (you cant give mikal bridges the same amount of touches as deandre ayton.  tl:dr, cp3 not bad, booker need less ball, booker and cp3 cant defend anything and ayton needs more touches"
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
"&gt; but If you’re drafting Kispert to be a role player shooter why not target a vet who knows his role and plays it well over an unproven guy?  Duncan Robinson will command 15 - 20 M for 3/4 years. Around $80M dollars.  Mikal Bridges makes around 4.5 M a year. His rookie contract is 4 year / $17,630,685 drafted at 10th overall. Corey Kispert's range is anywhere from Kings at 9, Pelicans at 10, Warriors 14, etc.   Cap space bro. This ain't Manchester City. You just saved yourself over $60 million."
"($5) Luka, ($2) Mikal Bridges, ($1) Gary Trent Jr, ($4) Tatum, ($3) Ayton  &amp;#x200B;  So, I'll begin on how I made this team. I started with... Ayton. Yep. Not Luka. Initially, I wanted Giannis, but he's already too old. Then, I was thinking of getting Jokic. The thing is, Jokic's defensive liabilities are really worrying. I'd have to build an extremely specific roster to fix that, and that took flexibility I don't have in this challenge. I scouted for other C's and found Ayton at 3, fairly priced. Immediately taking him.  Then, obviously, Luka came next. Now that I know that I won't get Jokic, I can get a heliocentric player in Luka. I mean, it's Luka, isn't it obvious? He's already insanely good. The offense would be centered around him.  Then, I got Tatum. You want to have atleast 4 shooters on your team, and with Ayton, that's a neccecity. I could get KAT at 4 but he's not laterally quick enough to keep up with wings and his defensive limitations make it risky. Zion is too limited and everyone else is too old. That leaves Tatum. A young, athletic, massive 2 way player with elite scoring. His shooting would compliment Ayton fantastically.  Last 2 were Bridges and GTJ. I just wanted shooting and solid defense. They're roleplayers, they can do their jobs well. They don't have massive offensive or defensive deficiencies and they can space the floor.  &amp;#x200B;  Immediately, this team is 2 way powerhouse because of how massive it is. Luka is 6'7 with a 7'0 wingspan (Estimate), Bridges is 6'6 with a 7'2 wingspan, Trent is 6'5 with a 6'7 wingspan, Tatum is 6'8 with a 6'11 wingspan and Ayton is 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan. That is.... Insane. Literally insane. The ONLY flaw of this team is the fact that there isn't an elite perimeter defender, but when your average height on the team is 6'8 and the average wingspan is over 6'9, it'll be fine. Perimeter defense is about schemes, not individuals or steals or blocks anyways.  This length and height allows them to clog the lanes on defense and protect the rim at an incredible rate. Any good coach would be able to force ANY offensive player to take the worst shots because of how well this team can contest shots and force players to not even take the shot. The fact that you have multiple rim protectors is insane. This would easily be the best defensive team in the league, and one of the best in this simulation. I cannot understate how important this aspect is on defense.  This also allows the team to be the best rebounding team out of any team. They'd literally crash the boards and dominate with that. We saw how effective that was with the Bucks in the finals. Rebounding can save a team when shots aren't falling.  The height and length doesn't just help on defense. It allows the team to constantly be creating mismatches on offense. If you run a screen heavy motion offense, there will ALWAYS be 2 or so mismatches on the court. Mismatches are what basketball is all about.  With said mismatches comes the pure scoring ability of this team. Players 1-4 are all elite shooters (Luka is usually good in the playoffs) and that pairs amazingly with Ayton, a dominant inside force. Spacing is everything in this league and this team has it in spades.   Finally, Luka and Tatum are 2 dominant scorers in the playoffs, both are clutch and can close at an elite level.  Finally, the team is extremely young. A veteran bench would be needed but it will only get better."

"Ball Handler: Doncic   ($5) 1 or 1A best combination of youth and skill in the list. Age 22. This lineup would give him the ability to run any set he wants. The rest of the team would allow his defense weaknesses to be covered up (assuming the $1 guy buys in). If you're into traditional positions, he'd be PG.  Wings   Gary Trent Jr ($1)  Excellent shooter who would probably get a lot of room to shoot thanks to Tatum and Doncic. Has defensive skills - if he can be convinced to channel them.  On this team, likely to feast on all the open shots that Doncic/Tatum/Ayton will be providing.  Age 22. Traditional position: SG  Mikal Bridges ($2) All around glue guy.  Age 25.  Does multiple things well, could serve as clean-up both offensively and defensively, setting screens or providing help. Traditional set position: SF  Jayson Tatum ($4) 1 or 1a best combination of youth or skill. The best all-around player in this lineup. Age 23. Traditional position: PF  Big  Deandre Ayton ($3) Best young big on this list. Age 23. Can play in and out, switchable all around. Traditional position: C  Defensively switchable enough to help protect Doncic, offensively could pull off a lot of multiple sets with Doncic and Tatum capable of handling the ball as faciliator. Imagine the pick and roll in different combinations with these guys.  And probably most significantly, the youth of this team gives it both a high floor and a really high ceiling."
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Myles Turner, Mikal Bridges, Lonzo Ball"
"$5 KD $4 Booker, $3 Ayton $2 Mikal Bridges $1 Lonzo Ball.   I might be biased, but the youth, defense, scoring and passing in that team is insane. Passing is probably the weakest though, which is why I took Lonzo"
Lonzo Ball  Devin Booker  Mikal Bridges   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Deandre Ayton
"Curry, Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Morris, Josh Richardson.   I’m putting Giannis at the 5 spot since defensively, that’s how he functions anyway. Giannis can also serve as the secondary ball handler and playmaker. Curry’s gravity will leave all the other 3 and d guys open. Mikal is also a capable playmaker so you have 3 options in the half court in terms of playmaking. Defense will be above average to say the least. Steph along with of PGs will be a weak spot on D.  Banking on Steph’s game to age gracefull in his late 30’s. Giannis will still improve his game up till his early 30s."
"Lonzo Ball, Luka Doncic, Mikal Bridges, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Myles Turner"
"I mean…  PG: Doncic   SG: Mikal Bridges  SF: Bojan   PF: Covington   C: Jokic   Should compete for 5 years year in and year out.  You have two healthy young superstars who can be dynamic at all levels on offense. No team will have better ball movement between their 2 best players. They should have good chemistry.   While they struggle on D a bit, this adds Bridges and Covington, while also adding another shooter in Bojan. Most of the lineup can shoot. And Bridges/Covington help a bit with the defensive issues."

Hold up how did he not get good value for MCW? He traded him at his peak value for a pick that ended up being Mikal Bridges. Not his fault the next regime fucked that pick up. Now meanwhile MCW is a 3rd string point guard on one of the worst teams in the league.       And the whole point of drafting is to find your cornerstone. Teams like Sacramento would’ve killed to miss on all their picks but end up with Embiid. Could’ve been way worse for Philly.
"I think we are already but to really push the envelope, Someone just a bit better than barton. Jrue holiday or jalylen brown definitely but even mikal bridges here would be huge"
"I know it's just in the context of the current anti vacc opinion he appears to have, but Miles Bridges is still a better player than Mikal Bridges.  Just fewer people have actually seen him play.   Yeah Mikal is the ideal 3 &amp; D wing for the modern era, but Miles is an ascending 2-way scorer that's beginning to become an elite shooter and finisher. Once his handles get as good as the rest of his offensive game (and it's coming) he could be a 20+ ppg guy."
"My favourite way of remembering this is to remember that Mikal Bridges plays for the Suns, and Miles Bridges plays for the Hornets."
Cleveland has reported to been shopping him and Jackson has big injury issues.  John Collins and Jarrett Allen didn’t get maxes.  Mikal bridges won’t get the max either
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
"You have no idea what you are talking about.    year 1, they traded for Bynum that off season when Iggy left and Brand basically retired.   the intention was to add a star big man in his 20's to pair with Jrue and Thad.       That obviously ended horribly for them, but it wasn't a tank move.  That was swinging for the fences.   Even gave up a future 1 and a young big in Vucivic to make the deal happen.   Then yes, they dumped Jrue and picked up an injured Nerlens, drafted MCW and got a future pick.  That was the beginning of the ""tanking"" years.   Then the next year they draft Embiid who was supposed to miss an entire season, took Dario who was overseas and picked that 1st up that they had orginally sent for Bynum.  Turned into Shamet.  Year 2 of the tank saw them pick up a ton of future assets including the pick that became Mikal Bridges years later.    Somewhere in there we got a future unprotected Sac pick and two pick swaps; plus future 1's from OKC and Miami.   Process saw Jerami Grant, Roco, TJ, Holmes all become NBA players who have all signed multiple contracts since then.    Then Embiid's scan didn't look right and he was forced into a second foot surgery.   Hinkie takes Jah instead of a wing in the most anti Hinkie pick ever and it all unravels that fall.   That was year 3.   Hinkie resigns end of season.   BC comes in and immediately him and is minions burn through a treasure trove of assets and have nothing to show.  But he did sign vets and trade for them trying to win that 5th year."

"The best role players are plus defenders and can shoot the three when fed by the stars. Tucker did that with Harden at an insanely high level for years in Houston. Even at his current age, I am still putting him on my list. Mikal bridges looks to be one of the up and coming 3nD studs. Marcus smart is an elite defender, and honestly I’ll take his questionable shot selection because his defense simply makes up for it. Robert Covington needs to re-find his shot, but he is also the right archetype. Finally, I’m going to cheat a little and say OG Anunoby. Idk how much longer we will consider him a role player, but he is about as good as it gets for 3nD."

"&gt;win a championship   &gt;   &gt;Simmons, markannen, vooch, lonzo, Mikal bridges  bro what"
"Ben Simmons for Mikal Bridges, who says no? /s"
"That sounds like a fun hypothetical. What’s the worst 4 teammates that would still allow a Ben simmons built team to win a championship  Simmons, markannen, vooch, lonzo, Mikal bridges"
Frank-Dennis Smith  Knox-Mikal Bridges  RJ-De'Andre Hunter  Obi-Deni Avdija  Wash on 2017. Both guys underpreform as Knicks  Bridges&gt;&gt;Knox RJ&gt;Hunter Obi&gt;Deni  So about the same.
"Philly makes out like a bandit if you include all their picks.  Ben Simmons --&gt; Ingram,  Korkmaz --&gt; Siakam, Fultz --&gt; Ball, Matthias Lessort ---&gt; Monte Morris, Mikal Bridges ----&gt;  Shai Gilgeous , Shamet ---&gt; Time Lord.  Like... LOL  PG: Shai/Morris  SG: Ball  SF: Ingram  PF: Siakam  C: Embiid/Time Lord"
"Going back a bit further, here's some more  * what if the league didn't force Hinkie out early, would he have drafted Fultz * what if Coangelo wasn't put in place to destroy the Sixers process and waste most of the collected assets * what if LeBron actually chose Philly over LA, for basketball reasons * what if we didn't trade away Mikal Bridges for Zhaire who ended up being a bust * what if we re-signed Nerlens on the cheap to back-up Embiid when Klutch was ignoring our GM's inquiries (which they are now being sued over) * what if we never traded Jrue Holiday away, would he be as good as he is now * what if we didn't trade away so many assets for Bynum who never played for us, would the process have ever even happened"
He scores more when jokic is on the bench. He's just a nightmare to guard and a mismatch to everyone.  Only Mikal Bridges gave him trouble and partly because of a bad back. He was shooting 3s in LeBron's face
"Lonzo is not a real point guard and he won't make the Bulls better as much as people think. DeMar will wind up being the main facilitator on that team.  Ja Morant will be better than Westbrook and Wall ever were.  OG Anunoby is the 2nd best one on one defender in the league.  Mikal Bridges is not as good of a 3pt shooter as people think and once he's no longer sharing the court with Chris Paul, this will become very evident. Miles is better.  SGA is the second best guard under 25 and the 2nd best player from the 2018 draft."
Cam Johnson will be better long term than Mikal Bridges.
"I dont blame Ben for wanting out at all, the 76ers front office has been awful since he got drafted. Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges and Markelle Fultz are 3 players that are perfect for the team but they traded RoCo and other trade pieces for 1 year of Jimmy Butler (who eventually turned into Seth Curry who i love but id prefer RoCo if i had the choice). Mikal Bridges move completely baffled me and the Fultz situation disgusted me by how the front office acted.   Add all of that ontop of the fact that both their coaches have been subpar (Brett Brown seemed like a nice guy but had some severe mental lapses as a coach) and Doc Rivers... it just seems like he doesnt have people skills, what he said at that interview and the interviews after that is just a joke, and if thats what is being said publicly, whats being said behind closed doors and at practice. I dont blame Ben for not shooting or being aggressive if that's how little confidence his coach has in him.  AND add all the trade rumors hes been dealing with and its all a disaster waiting to happen.  Now saying all that im not saying Ben is blameless, if he ever wants to be a Super Star player he has to change his mind set, he has to hold himself accountable and take initiative. He has all the skills but he doesnt have the mentality to be great, at least not yet. But the amount of criticism he gets is completely disproportionate to the amount of blame he holds."
"Yeah, he turned 25 on September 7. Ben Simmons and Mikal Bridges have also turned 25 since the end of the season and, like the article notes, Brown and Booker will both turn 25 in October."
Cam Johnson is better than Mikal Bridges.   (Actually doesn't adhere to post rules because Cam Johnson is old.)
Mikal Bridges
"The only difference is, Mikal Bridges is actually good."
"I mean, yeah….  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who’s serviceable on the court, who won’t win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
Mikal Bridges
Mikal Bridges.  Known as the warden for his defense.
"Tatum for Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, and Jalen Smith? Money works. Suns pair Booker and Tatum for the foreseeable future.   CP3/Booker/Tatum/Crowder/McGee would be really good  Brown/Bridges/Ayton as a young core fits a lot better than Brown/Tatum"
Mikal Bridges a strong contender for DPOY
I know it’s still early in his career but Mikal bridges hasn’t missed a game yet which is insane to me.
Yep moving well without the ball is an insanely underrated skill set on the offense end. Just doesn't show up in box score because the player may only put up ten points or so but it makes for timely buckets and confuses the defense which can lead to a better shot for a different player. Mikal Bridges is outstanding for us in that regard.
I would like to ask Mikal Bridges the same question
[Suns are literally the 2nd best defensive team in the league](https://i.redd.it/46oayhy3bv181.jpg).  Mikal Bridges is our best defender.  Let that sink in.
I hope we find out after Tuesday that the answer is Mikal Bridges.
Steph turned into Mikal Bridges this game
I mean yeah I doubt that Mikal Bridges figures it out when the whole league hasn't been able to for a decade
Maybe Mikal Bridges is just the best defender in the league.
Fun fact. Mikal Bridges was picked by the 76s with a pick they got from the suns that the suns got from the lakers in the trade for Nash. He was then traded on draft night by the 76s to the suns.  Thank you Jim buss

He over performed last year b/c he was playing for that final bag. Now he has nothing left to prove. Also Mikal Bridges turned into an actual bridge. No disrespect, but I'd be surprised if they manage to get the 8 seed. /s"

"If what you said about not needing CJ in the clutch was true they would have won a lot more series in the past. They have multiple series that were mostly lost because Dame got swallowed up on defense. CJ is definitely helpful (way more so than Simons and Powell) for series when they face a Jrue, Klay, Caruso, etc and Dame is forced to get off the ball at important times in the clutch. If you think Powell is more equipped for that role than CJ I think you’re severely underrating CJ. Every series they’ve won he’s been great in and he’s outplayed Dame in more than one series win. If they trade him it has to be for a near star player or an INSANE 3andD player, like Caruso, Deandre Hunter, Mikal Bridges level. If not the team will undoubtedly be worse."
"He did, but we primarily squandered those picks. One crazy thing about it is that the last pick we got from the Lakers got traded around and ended up being Phillys in 2018 which they ended up taking Mikal Bridges and then immediately trading them to the Suns, so kinda?"
"if you never knew, desmond bane’s arms are shorter than average, basically a reverse mikal bridges but he still finds success on memphis somehow. he’s put a lot of time and effort into that shooting form"
Top 10 All Time Mikal Bridges
"Shooting. We could really use a third wing who can space the floor at an elite level while not being a huge defensive liability— a 3&amp;D player like Mikal Bridges would be awesome, but even a Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, or Bogdan Bogdanovic type would be fine with our other defensive pieces. People have been overstating our need for playmaking, we've got a bunch of really solid passers (Smart, Schroder, Al, even Tatum when he wants to be) and we'd be averaging more assists if we had guys who could consistently knock down open shots."
"Booker just needed some help. He got it with Ayton.   Then the team became an attractive free agent team. Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are also not anything to sneeze at. And McGee is a great addition.   They are such a well constructed team. And the core (outside of CP3) are so young that, should they stay together, means Phoenix will be good for a while."
No they really did give up future HOFer and Philly hometown hero Mikal Bridges for Zaire smith. Puts a smile on my face every time I watch mikal ball out
Mikal Bridges
Don’t forget the player we traded Mikal Bridges for almost died from a previously unknown sesame seed allergy
"If someone on the Suns is in the DPOY convo, it is Mikal Bridges, not Ayton. Bridges has like three absolutely stunning, bonkers defense highlights per game."
Mikal Bridges better     (Draymond is gonna win)
"Mikal Bridges is a way better defender than Ayton, it's not particularly close in my opinion. Bridges is close to elite, Ayton is good"
"Unless you live in the desert of Phoenix, Arizona where the only bridges we have go over bone dry ""rivers"" and Mikal is the most famous Bridge(s) by far in the whole region."
"Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Kevin Johnson, Mikal Bridges, Dan Majerle, Devin Booker, Walter Davis, Shawn Marion, Amar’e Stoudamire, Charles Barkley, Vince Carter + Shaq"
I put money on M Bridges for ROY and only realised half way into the season I'd put it on Mikal and not Miles. RIP
"Still can't believe Sixers traded Mikal bridges for Zhaire Smith and that pick. Mikal was an excellent fit at the time, and everything seemed a fairytale (mom even working there) until he was traded. Unfortunately that trade was a dud (poor Zhaire with the sesame seeds reaction) but at least suns are enjoying an elite role player."
"The issue is the odds of him coming back to 100 percent are basically 0 so we can't look at it from his last season without expecting a drop.  His defence will be worse, his off ball movement will be worse, the shooting will be worse because he will get less open looks due to worse off ball movement in majority of cases.  Unless he magically is 100 percent he will be a worse player and its just about finding out how much worse and if that means he is more like mikal bridges without the finishing ability the warriors are likely fine, but if it means he comes back as a strictly catch and shoot player who's efficiency is worse than they could he fucked playing him.  It's impossible to know for sure"
"Mikal bridges is a supreme role player, klay is a tier above that when healthy tho but yeah after rather injuries he will probably be a worse mikal bridges"
Knicks passed on Mikal Bridges and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and drafted Kevin Knox instead.
"Depends on the deal, if it was like Crowder+2023 first rounder (league rules mean they can't trade the 2022 first rounder due to trading their 1st rounder in this year's draft) with top 10 protection, sure. If it involved Cam Johnson and/or Mikal Bridges, no way."
Mikal Bridges
"It amounted to us trading both our picks in that draft for Tobias Harris.  At the time we made the Harris trade, Landry Shamet was looking like he'd turn out better than Mikal Bridges, and we were still holding out hope on Zhaire.  Things change. Most players improve. Some don't. It's really hard to predict who's going to make a jump.  I will say, at the time of the draft, Mikal was billed as a ""high floor, low ceiling"" guy, mostly because he had played 3 years already, and I for sure called bullshit on that. A good player is a good player, it's tough to say who's going to improve, but it's impossible to say ""oh yeah, this guy's good, but he won't improve"""
Mi”es Bridges and Mikal Bridges I always get the names confused. Same with the Plumlees..”am I looking at mason or miles”
I did not know Mikal bridges cusses.
Mikal Bridges.
"One of their top draft picks straight up got the yips and another was nearly poisoned to death by team trainers. Hinkie set up The Process to succeed and Colangelo et al flushed it down the toilet  Worst part about the Zhaire Smith pick was they originally drafted Mikal Bridges, a philly kid whose mom literally worked for the team."
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
Mikal Bridges my b
No it’s a dyslexic spelling of Mikal Bridges
My guess is that it’s Malik Monk and he got his Hornets/ex-Hornets confused? I don’t think it’s Miles Bridges since Miles is having a great season and don’t think it’s Mikal Bridges since at least Malik and Miles share the Hornets connection
Mikal Bridges and Lou Dort will be playing until they are 37
"Mikal Bridges but honestly, I feel like he can be an all star in the future"
Mikal Bridges is the GOAT and it’s not even close
in order of importance  1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Deandre Ayton  5. JaVale McGee  6. Cam Johnson  7. Cam Payne  8. Jae Crowder (Dario Saric if he was healthy)
"How many fouls are called in a game? The logic you’re proposing is that any foul is subject to being punched in the face.  I don’t think that’s what you’re trying to say but it is somehow what you’re saying.  Lebron is twice his age and has been playing physical and played physical by other players his whole career, it’s literally his game.   Was Stew’s rib shot in the act of play? Yes of course. Does it mean it wasn’t a foul? No it doesn’t. But is punching him justified? In no freaking league on earth is Lebron’s action acceptable.  Next you’ll defend Lebron two hand shoving Embiid to the ground while he was in the air for a dunk. Or nearly breaking Mikal Bridges neck in a fucking preseason game.  It’s classless behavior and play and any objective person would say the same."
Now that I’ve seen what this man did to Mikal Bridges mid-air... smdh
* Devin Booker * CP3 * Deandre Ayton * Jae Crowder * Mikal Bridges * Cam Payne * Cam Johnson * Javale Mcgee
"A lot more.  And they have to be unquestionably dirty, not subject to interpretation.    First video, nothing there is intentional or unquestionable.  All were doing in the moment, chasing guys around with your adrenaline pumping, you sometimes get tangled up, it happens.    It only looks bad because Livingston was going so fast, that push happens in every game and is a common foul at best.  Bron didn't push Embiid, he prevented him from jumping into him by putting his hands up and preventing the body from making contact.  It just so happens Embiid was already too committed and didn't have one leg back for balance.  Plus it came really fast, Lebron looked like he was going to jump for it but decided not to and his hands were already up.  I don't disagree with the flagrant though, you have to punish these things based on the outcome and not the intention.  Slide tackle you already said wasn't dirty, moving on.  Knee to Steph's balls was dirty and intentional.  Elbow to Iggy's balls, not dirty and not intentional.  Standard basketball move to drive with the off arm protecting the body.  You see how low Lebron was when he was driving?  Normally guys would be standing straighter and that elbow would be in the chest area, but Lebron was going fast and low and Iggy just happened to be in the wrong spot.  Kick to Iggy's balls, not dirty or intentional.  Guys do this a dozen times a game, it only makes the news when it connects.  Reggie Miller made a career out of doing this and getting fouls.  Should be a foul on the shooter though, they need to control that, but its not a dirty play.  Mikal Bridges looks bad, but 90% of the time guys will go for a forward-facing dunk and the little push will result in the ball being bobbled.  Its only bad luck that he went for the reverse so the push made him land on his back.  If you look at the exact moment when he goes up with the ball, he and Lebron are facing the same way.  Bridges changes in mid-air, so that's not Lebron's fault.    Payne...slap?  That wasn't even a push, at most Lebron slap him on the thigh, not dirty.  The Ayton push is open to interpretation.  Its a push, a small one on the mid-upper back area.  It feels more like a defeated resignation than a cheap shot.  Lebron haters can have this one since its not clear its unintentional.  The Ayton hit is obviously a harder hit than what we're used to seeing, which is a standard screen.  He didn't have to put so much force into it, and in that way you can say it was dirty.  However, in another way, a harder than usual hit doesn't make something dirty necessarily, I doubt Lebron was trying to hurt him.  A dirty move should either be intended to injure, or so reckless that injury is all but certain.  This was neither, it was a hard hit, but within the realm of legal hits.  If I were Barkely saying it on TNT, people would be praising me for being ""old-school"".  This is exactly the kind of stuff he and Shaq would totally support.  Its a hard hit, but completely legal, not intended to injure, and not dirty.  So by my count, with the first link having 7 unintentional or non-dirty hits, that's 17 moves, only 1 was absolutely a dirty move, 2 were intentional and possibly reckless (push to Ayton's back, and shoulder screen on Ayton) but within the realm of gameplay, and the rest were accidents, people moving too quickly, unintentional, or just common plays that happen all the time.  Like I said, actual dirty plays should be intended to injure, or so reckless as to have a high chance of causing injury.  Something like [Bruce Bowen's kick to Wally Szczerbiak's face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edb6bz_C9ms) is dirty because its intentional.  Metta's [elbow to Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnayIPA0Yfk) is dirty because its totally reckless and overboard.  Rodman [intentionally getting in Malone's way constantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdUT3GPlGwU) and then tripping him is dirty.  Kelly Olynyk [pulling down on Kevin Love's arm is dirty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ31539Cg04).  And clearly Andrew Bynum [hitting JJ Barea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIWSKssJP2E) is unquestionably dirty.  All of those were intentional motions, and Metta's was severely reckless as well.  But there's a lot of other moves that are bad looking but not dirty, because they don't fit the criteria above.  Last year, Chris Paul [pushed Giannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eezPRN6wAgg) at the closing seconds of game 5 when Giannis was going in for an alley oop.  While I agree it was completely intentional, given the stakes, I don't think Chris intended it to be as bad as it looks, it was just a desperation push to try and save a championship, you have to take nerves and the situation into account.  It was a bit reckless, and if it was anyone other than Giannis it might have turned out badly, but not enough for me to say ""Yeah he intended to hurt him with recklessness"".    Another non-dirty play was when Wade [broke Kobe's nose during the 2012 All-Star game with a missed grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yO8ukhIehQ).  We've all seen plays like this before, guy goes up for the dunk and the other guy tries to grab him around the arms and shoulders so he can't go up.  Only this time Wade missed and hit Kobe's nose instead.  Looks bad, but not dirty.  And then there's this classic from the 2002 WCF between the Lakers and Kings.  Kobe [elbows Bibby's nose while trying to get free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbWgWZjo1nI).  Again, its a move we've seen a thousand times before if you've watched any amount of basketball.  Guy tries to get free, moves his arm through.  Only this time it caught Bibby's nose.  Lakers haters will say Kobe did it intentionally and its up for interpretation.  But what is NOT up for interpretation is that this move happens all the time.  1 out of a thousand times it'll hit someone in the face, but its not dirty.  Its well within the range of normal gameplay.    Doesn't matter if a Lakers fan is saying this, I've included plenty of non-Lakers examples.  Plus, I don't care if people think Lebron is dirty, his legacy is made by how many championships he wins, not how many guys he hits.  I'll defend him, CP3, and Wade as well in those examples.  Dirty has to be more than a few bumps and pushes during gameplay."
That mikal Bridges one is actually insane.... wtf man he didn’t even look at him
the Mikal bridges one looked worse than Embiids
"NBA rules clearly state you need to allow landing space for any player in the air who is actively shooting the ball. LeBron not only doesn't do that, but is actively still pushing on Mikal Bridges' side while he is in the air."
He did something extremely similar to Mikal Bridges in a preseason game last year too
Here’s Lebron elbowing and knocking over a smaller Mikal Bridges: https://youtu.be/EtO1hpZx4aU     Here’s Lebron shoving Embiid mid air causing him to fall on his back. Embiid has been known for having back issues and this landing did not help. Lebron was too much of a chump to take the poster he went soft:   https://youtu.be/Qd7Rn5U4VzY    Don’t get me started on the copious amount of times hes quit and walked out in his teams.
"The Embiid shove happened this calendar year, are we already forgetting it?  What about Mikal Bridges’ scary fall in 2019?  He’s barely even flopped, man, get your Stan ass out of here…"
"So Mikal Bridges scary fall didn’t happen?  The Embiid shove didn’t happen?  In 6 months, are you going to say Stewart didn’t happen as well?"
"Gasol fucking saved Embiid's year, if he wasn't here to redirect some of the force JoJo could've been hurt bad.     Also ask Mikal Bridges in last preaseason, Livingston and Curry back when lequeen was in the cavs and I am sure many others I do not remember anymore"
He took out Mikal Bridges last year in a preseason game
Mikal Bridges.

"Mikal Bridges. He can shoot the lights out, is a fantastic finisher who likes to run on the break, he shows signs of being pretty good at creating offense although he gets little opportunity to do so because CP3 and Booker are on his team, and he can also defend multiple positions and is very good at doing so. Reminds me of Kawhi at his age"
"Sticking with the PG13, Kawhi, and Butler two-way player archetypes I'll guess one of Mikal Bridges, Lu  Dort, or OG Anunoby"
Mikal Bridges is the next Kawhi
"Mikal Bridges, who improves every season will shock everyone with how the Suns fleeced him with such a bargain deal this off-season. He only makes 95 Mil over the next 5 years and when that's said and done, he's all NBA first team defence, DPOY candidate, becomes the second scoring option to Booker and is seen as an essential piece in what will be many consecutive finals runs.  He was a number 10 pick, sneaky athletic, long boi, 6'6"", over 40% 3pt shooter who has developed a little inside game. This guy sneaks his way over 20ppg on ultra high efficiency while being a great defensive player and everyone spend a few seasons being like ""how tf this man not being paid the max""."
"Per is kinda iffy as it prefers bigs, loom at the sun's all 3 centers are there over mikal bridges"
Patrick Williams is like Anunoby with more midrange. I like Mikal Bridges for the same reason but he’s smaller than both
"This is me, but with Mikal Bridges. The guy seems to do everything right and flies under the radar."
"Mikal Bridges. I feel like he is what people hoped OG Anunoby would be (still love OG). It’s just Mikal’s midrange game, 3 ball, and finishing is so damn good. He’s smaller than OG tho"
"If we are talking players who might surprise mikal bridges, of we are talking low pick that probably won't but become a star but has some flashes, cam Johnson (totally not biased at all"

"That's a very good point, but what do you think about Mikal Bridges?"
Mikal Bridges might be one of the most underrated players in the league. He's a swiss army knife that can get you 15-20 efficiently and guard the best players in the world.
Yes but have you considered Mikal Bridges?
"Ah Mikal Bridges, another winner, unlike Luka."
Ik this is bait but just so you’re aware beating 3 injured teams and then getting fucking smacked 4 straight games in the finals does not qualify you to be a “winner”. Never in Lukas life will he lose his bag to a Mikal Bridges level player😂😂

MIKAL BRIDGES 7/7

"Cp3 is far from washed on defence, he just isn't taking the hardest option bec the team has ayton and bridges and they cover all 5 positions (as in when you combine them not saying that ayton or mikal on their own guard 1 to 5)  Cp3 still is a great defender essentially shutting down teams dribbles forcing them to break plays up just due to his quick hands"
Miles Bridges will have a better season than Mikal.
"Our core is set pretty much, the consensus is we're missing a 3 and D wing ala Mikal Bridges/Cam Reddish. We're hoping Okoro develops into one."
"Yeah no popovich is a very vocal coach and very demanding, Monty Williams would make more sense with Simmons (not that the sun's want him as we have cp3 and mikal bridges)  But you want a very player friendly coach who is good at managing egos which popovich isn't good at managing egos"
"If there is a thread about Mikal Bridges, you can bet your ass there's gonna be a comment about OG"
"To a point, I agree with you. I also don't want the 6ers to get fked because of Simmons' dumb ass. But if you're getting offered elite role players like Mikal Bridges, Lonzo, Herro, Tim Hardaway Jr types (obviously not just 1), then I think it might be worth consideration"
I see your counter-point and I'd like to add something. mikal bridges.
"hm, but have you ever considered mikal bridges?"
"Mikal Bridges is such an elite defender I feel like I watched shut down every Mavs player at some point in the game. That play denying KP the ball in the post towards the end frustrated me because I knew that man was gonna knock it away. No need to post up KP on Bridges, he has enough length to not really be considered too small to guard KP."
counterpoint: mikal bridges
Mikal Bridges absolutely tortured Kristaps at the end there
"Mikal bridges. That's it, that's the comment"

"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert’s Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can’t guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let’s start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you’d expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That’s less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."
"well tbf, their other two guys are CP3 and Mikal Bridges instead of Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis so their 3 pts are still probably way better than us (which isn't saying much though lol)."
Mikal bridges iirc
