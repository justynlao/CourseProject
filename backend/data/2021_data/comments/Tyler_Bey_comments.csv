Think Philly would accept Josh Richardson and Tyler Bey for Seth Curry?  That would certainly help.
"Tyler Bey and Jaden McDaniels  Tyler's going to be catching Luka lobs all day once he cracks the rotation, and Jaden is too much of a longboi to fail"
tyler bey coming to crush his dreams
"Why couldn't it be Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, and Tyler Bey"
"2020 draft looks sneaky nice so far Wiseman,Lamelo,Ant,Haliburton look good already   Pritchard,Precious,Avidja,Bey,Bane,Williams have been solid and have good upside  and lastly Killian,Stewart,skinny lanky OKC guy,Quickly,Cole Anthony,whoever the spurs draft,Tyler""shooter""Terry are all project guys and I feel like a few might hit"
"I really think both teams won honestly. It's rare but I think it worked out perfectly for both. Mavs needed a 3 and D starter, and 76ers needed a elite 3 point shooter/secondary ball handler.   Mavs get the best shot at resigning Richardson and Seth is locked into a great contract. Plus mavs got a good defensive prospect Tyler Bey."
I wanted Achiuwa or Tyler Bey with our 19th pick. And so far achiuwa is doing really well. Already looking like a steal
How the FO offered him a contract and put Tyler Bey on a two way is beyond me.
tyler bey will outrebound all of your centers bby!
Let's see how Tyler Bey turns out before we judge just yet.
"He actually is 15th in USG% on the team lol idk if that's where OP got ""15th option"" from.  But obviously USG% doesn't account for number of games/minutes played and doesn't have much context at all behind it. For example, this guy Tyler Bey has a higher USG% but has played only 33 minutes this season. USG% also depends on who you share the floor with, since it shows the % of FGA/FTA/TO you have out of the total FGA/FTA/TO your team has when you're on the floor.  In terms of top 10 guys in minutes played, DFS ranks 9th in USG%, ahead of only Kleber."
"That's actually Tyler Cook, a player just signed to a 2nd 10 day contract. Bey threw up an 0/8 because he's a bit streaky at times. He got it back together tonight though. also got racked in the nuts by Deni, but he's okay."
"Speaking of Beys, does anyone know how Tyler Bey (no relation, I'm pretty sure) is doing?"
"For some perspective on just how good NBA guys are compare to college, here is what the roster of the Salt Lake City Stars, a team that is currently 2nd to last in the G-League with a 4-11 record consists of:  Tyler Bey: 1st Team All Pac-12  Trevon Bluiett: Consensus all-American, 1st team all-Big East  Jarrell Brantley: First team all-CAA  Yogi Ferrell: First team all-B1G,   Trent Forrest: 2nd team all-ACC  Romaro Gill: Big East DPOY  Elijah Hughes: 1st team all-ACC  Malcolm Miller: 2nd team all-Patriot League  Trevon Scott: 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  And again, these guys have all improved since they earned these college accolades yet they combined are still the 2nd worst team in the G-League. Now imagine what the best teams in the G-League have. And now imagine what NBA teams have. No college team is coming close to beating an actual NBA team."
Nate Hinton and Tyler Bey.
"Nets lost 1/3 of their roster between the Harden trade, Dinwiddie‚Äôs injury, and then Aldridge retired after filling a massive hole.    Brooklyn had 3 empty roster spots mid season to fill and got lucky in the buyout market to a degree or else their roster would be much worse since the only options would be players the NBA didn‚Äôt see as roster worthy. Really they just got Griffin since Aldridge retired.    Still barely understand the Bey for Shamet trade. Bey filled a bigger need than Shamet who brought roughly what Tyler Johnson brought to the team. Dude had like 2 great games and the rest is either Eh or a total bust."
Tyler Bey is mad slept on üëÄ
"we might see tyler bey tonight, boys"
Josh Green and Tyler Bey
"okay since ur spamming this comment lemme just clear it up.   Game 2 atlanta vs dallas  people out for atlanta: D. Hunter, Bogi, Dunn, Rondo  people out for dallas : Tyler Bey, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry (all in g league)  Dallas wins by 1 point  game 1: Atl: Hunter Bogi Dunn Onyeka Dal: Tyler and Nate  dallas wins by 6.  &amp;#x200B;  Hawks are just injury depleted and those games dont really mean anything as bogis clearly been the second best player on the hawks since the ASB and hunter was averaging 17 before he got hurt. Dallas just has had the luxury of health. Also hawks had their old, trash coach."
&gt;Remember this was essentially a 1:1 swap.  Everyone sleeping on...(checks notes) Tyler Bey.
We keep:  - Luka - Brunson - DFS - Kleber - Josh Green - I guess KP - Tyler Bey - Bobi ‚ù§Ô∏è  Obviously we'd want THJ too but he's a free agent
"There have been some high risk high reward plays Marks has made that haven‚Äôt panned out like giving offer sheets to Tyler Johnson, Allen Crabbe and Otto Porter Jr. he also got criticized for trading the pick that became Sadie Bey for Landry Shamet but I think he‚Äôs done a great job filling out this roster. I also think that if he had known what the June roster would look like he would‚Äôve tried to add another big in addition to Lopez and Clax (not gonna mention DeAndre)"
yea the Mavs are one of the worst drafting teams in basketball   a miracle happened in 2018   Josh Green could be good... he has zero offense to speak of though... Terry was really raw coming into the draft and was dealing with personal issues... Tyler Bey had a great G-League performance but he‚Äôs not ready yet
"According to the internet Mavs also got the 36th pick, which was Tyler Bey. Tbh idk who that is"
"&gt; As a side note who was the pick, Tyrell Terry or Tyler Bey?  Tyler Bey. Tyrell Terry is a 2nd round pick from GSW."
Tyler Bey is older than Luka Doncic btw
Tyler Bey
"True but the reason they lost to the Clippers so far has been poor defense both containing the drives and rim protection. Not sure Seth would change that. It was still a massive steal for the sixers though. As a side note who was the pick, Tyrell Terry or Tyler Bey?"
"Mavs only have Luka. Maybe one of Josh Green, Tyrell Terry, or Tyler Bey becomes good, I mean they turn into beasts in 2K and we all know how accurate that is üëÄ"
"kinda disrespectful to Tyler Bey, but ok."
"Charlotte should sign Lonzo and somehow acquire Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, and Bol Bol.   Then their lineup could be:   Ball/Ball  Bey/Bey  Bol Bol"

"You're missing the point. Ain't nobody criticizing Tyler Bey more than Paul George. Tyler Bey scored 18 points this season. You never heard of him. Paul George would crush him in 1 on 1.   But guess what? We talk about the best players more. The better you play without winning a championship, the more you will be criticized. That is the way it has always been. And, if you want to make it worse all you have to do is ball out in the regular season and play like a chump in the playoffs (big stage.)  TL;DR: The best players get criticized the most. Players who ball in reg season and stink in playoffs get criticized even worse. (See Ben Simmons)"
Josh Richardson and Tyler Bey.
They still have two unknown quantities in Tyler Bey and Tyrell Terry thanks to that trade iirc. Trade should still sting for the Mavs but one of those two (or both) panning out will ease the pain.
Tyler Bey
Oh shit. Yeah. That's makes more sense. In my initial post I was talking about Sardis bey. But then the second one triggered something. Mavs fans were sad that we let Tyler bey go. My bad
"I wasn't super high on Tyler bey. Dude looked absolutely raw and lost on offense. Even in the  g league. We just don't have the minutes and reps to be giving to him to develop. We are trying to contend now. And honestly. Between josh green and Tyrell terry, terry might get more minutes because he the better shooter. Dude was an absolute  sharpshooter in college."
isn‚Äôt tyler bey on the mavs? why is he playing for the bulls in summer league?
*Give me Tyler Bey*
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
"Eh.  I dont think Dragic at 20 million is much of an asset, even if it is only one year.   Best case is probably a 2nd, or recent 2nd like Herb Jones or Tyler Bey."
Send Tyler Bey home!
I remember watching this guy for the draft last year and just being so mad about like all of his film because he looked awful and McKinley Wright looked like the real draft prospect while getting no recognition for it. Like every good Tyler Bey play was set up by a better McKinley Wright play. Not surprised to see him in this position so soon.
Tyler Bey was the 36th pick in the 2020 draft and didn't get much playing time.  Daishen Nix played on the Ignite last year.
"The Mavs Trading away Seth Curry to the Sixers for Josh Richardson and the No. 36 pick which turned out to be Tyler Bey, Seth became his brother (Steph) in the 2021 Playoffs against Atlanta (Even tho they loss the series, Seth is still Valuable for the team) will Richardson only played for 1 season for the Mavs, he just disappeared against the Clippers in 2021 Playoffs  &amp;#x200B;  Overall The Sixers won the trade and the Mavs got robbed"
Chuma Okeke should be back soon and than JI should be back by Dec.  I would have signed Nate Hinton or Tyler Bey but I guess he is a 27 who can fill in if needed.
"After the draft I was convinced that Tyrell Terry &gt; Tyler Bey &gt; Josh Green. I think it was KOC who had given such glowing reports about how Terry was a mid first rounder who fell because of some reasons. Of all the sharpshooters signed in that draft, he is the only one who hardly played.   I kept seeing his DNP last season even when we barely had any players but I guess that personal reason must be big enough to prevent him from playing even when we were shorthanded. Part of the blame kept going on Rick Carlisle as he doesn't trust 'rookies' especially those that were drafted late.   Now I hope that at least Green turns out OK as otherwise that would be two consecutive zeroes after hitting the jackpot in 2018."
"Looking at [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beyty01.html) Tyler Bey also signed a contract with the Rockets on August 24, 2022"
When you try to be funny at least get the players right. We got Tyler Bey from that Jrich trade. Has nothing to do with Tyrell Terry
He was not a part of the trade. Tyler Bey was and he got waived by the Rockets after he was not retained by the Mavs at the end of the year
[Looks like Tyler Bey](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Feigen/status/1448477026210418694) got waived per Jonathan Feigen
&gt;This means either Tyler Bey or Anthony Lamb will be cut from one of the two-way contract spots.   We all know who will be the sacrificial Lamb
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9‚Äô0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn‚Äôt as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6‚Äô1.25 H, 8‚Äô1 SR), Keon Johnson (6‚Äô3.5 height, 8‚Äô1 SR), Jericho Simms (6‚Äô9 H, 8‚Äô10 SR), Jalen Harris (6‚Äô2.75 H - 8‚Äô1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6‚Äô10 H, 9‚Äô1 SR), Tyler Bey(6‚Äô6 H, 8‚Äô9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
"Here‚Äôs a count of people who have been called potential  all stars in this thread: Duarte, Cole Anthony, Tyler Herro, Malik Bridges, Halliburton, Eric Paschall, Saddiq Bey, Cade Cunningham, Mattisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane."
"It's not all about the quality of players.  Salary and years are more important to teams.  Prioritizing salary and years allows you to take big swings in free agency where you can, theoretically (but not in Dallas), get something big for nothing in return.    Even if the Mavs kept Seth instead of trading him for Richardson, they would have just traded Seth before this season because they needed the cap space to pursue Lowry (and because they didn't want to attach a 1st to Powell to get off his salary, plus they value Maxi too much to dump him for a free agency gamble).  The Mavs expected Richardson to play well enough to opt out of his contract for this season, thus clearing enough space to sign Lowry.  Instead, Richardson opted in and they got Moses Brown back.  So the Mavs chose Tyler Bey, Moses Brown, and a non-zero chance at Kyle Lowry over Seth Curry and no chance at Kyle Lowry.  That's a neutral trade and certainly not one of the worst trades in the last decade."
