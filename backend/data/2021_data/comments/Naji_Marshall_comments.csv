"Pels bros, who's the dude on your bench lookin' 40 years old? Is that Naji Marshall?"
"Man the team was really starting to click before the injuries, and now we’re whatever this is.  There was a lineup in the 4th that was IT/Naji Marshall/Iwundu/Johnson/Hernangomez and literally only 1 of those players was a full time Pelican 3 weeks ago, and he was riding the bench"
They should sign Naji Marshall in the future as the sole US player and call it the Marshall Plan to make it a true European rebuild.
"No BI or Zion, i wouldn’t mind winning this game tbh just to get the team’s morale back up + we’ve got some wiggle room ahead of Magic &amp; Pistons. I don’t know who Naji Marshall is but I’m glad he’s about to have a breakout game and put up 5 threes at the minimum"

Pels have been the #1 defense in the entire league for the past ~20 games actually if you can believe it. Mainly has to do with Eric Bledsoe finally giving a modicum of effort that reflects his all-defensive reputation and Naji Marshall being given major minutes instead of being chained to the bench like he had been for most of the year.

Naji Marshall #MVP Marvel's Valuable Player    Expecting Zion &amp; Curry to both end up having ridiculous games. Hoping Zion has his first 40 bomb and that we can hold Curry to below 60.
First the Saints get hit with the Nick game then the Pels with the Marvel one.   I hope Naji Marshall wins the equivalent of the Nickelodeon Valuable Player.
Naji Marshall easy
"The guy that was 2-8 from 3? An open shot isnt always a good shot.  I'd rather Zion force something at the hoop then kick it out to a guy who was atrocious from 3 being only down 2 with 1 minute to go.  "" pelicans needed a 3, so it makes no sense to go to Zion cause he can't shoot ""..."" Zion also gets the ball on the very last possession and loses it out of bounds. ""  Thats contradictive...They needed a 3 to tie...So they dont go to him when they needed a 3 with 21 seconds but then a full court heave with 2 seconds on the clock to tie they do?  If you think Naji Marshall is the best option with a minute to go then I dont know what to tell you. Dont really care if hes open...Its not like Zion wasnt getting doubled the entire game."
"The Naji Marshall miss at 1:09 was a pass from zion after he got doubled and naji was wide open.  The misses and makes at 21 and 17 were also wide open 3s on a designed ATO play when the pelicans needed a 3, so it makes no sense to go to Zion cause he can't shoot. Then BI was getting fouled before he could get a shot off and the pelicans still needed 3. So the only arguable one was the BI miss at 46, and that shot literally was half in and half out. Adams gets the oboard on that play.  This complaint doesn't really make sense when the pelicans score on almost every possession. Zion also gets the ball on the very last possession and loses it out of bounds."
"The last Zion shot (or Free Throw) was 1:49 left in the game....Made the score 124-122..This is not what you want to see down the stretch:  1:09 Naji Marshall miss 3  -124-122  46.1 BI miss 3 - 126-122  44.3 Adams makes 1 Free throw - 126-123  21.6 Naji Marshall Misses 3 - 128-123  17.1 Kira Lewis makes 3 128-126  11.4 BI makes both Free throws - 129-128  Feel like you gotta live and die by your best player on the court. I watched the entire game. Kyrie killed it in the last minute, meanwhile the Pelicans didnt feed their best guy."

How is that semantics?  My point is Lonzo has minimal impact on the game and is easily replaceable.  Naji Marshall just had 16/11/6 in his last game replacing Lonzo.  That would be considered a good game from Lonzo and Naji was called up from the G league and has only been with the team a couple of weeks.
"I'd rather start Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart, and even Naji Marshall our two-way player over Bledsoe."

Who the hell do you think Naji Marshall is. That’s Bledsoe
"well lately all of our guards are injured so he doesn’t have much of a choice, unfortunately. It’s basically just him, Kira Lewis Jr. (a rookie), and Naji Marshall (an undrafted rookie on a 2-way contract who has been playing pretty well)"
"Shoutout Naji Marshall, he was very good"
Zion Williamson / Naji Marshall
Why isn’t Naji Marshall talked about as a top 200 MVP candidate?
Naji Marshall. But I really like putting both of them around Zion.

I genuinely think Naji Marshall is going to be better than Josh Hart by the end of next year so I’m totally fine with us letting Hart walk away
"PG: Sexton or Lonzo, Kira  SG: NAW, Korkmaz, Didi Louzada  SF: BI, Naji Marshall, Bullock in free agency or Prince in a trade with CLE  PF: Zion, James Johnson, Wenyen Gabriel  C: Adams, Jax   Spots 14 and 15: prob 2 of our 4 second round picks   1. I’ve really been digging the Sexton trade talk. A young guard who plays passionately and scores with great efficiency and actively gives a shit on defense; I’ll take that all day every day. I’d do Bledsoe, 10 and whatever else Cleveland wants that’s not the young core.   2. I’m ready for Nickeil as a full time starter. Between his 15-20 starts last year and where he looked legit great next to Zion and BI (better than ANY other guard on our roster) along with his play in the FIBA Qualifiers for Canada.   3. I’m looking forward to Willie Green turning Zion and BI into a dynamic duo together rather than a dynamic duo apart (if that makes sense; I think Pels fans can speak to that) + raising defensive intensity   4. Need James Johnson back, he was solid for us and gave us great minutes after the deadline  5. Adams and Jax will be a top 5 Center rotation in the league next season, bet on it.   6. If we re-sign Lonzo, I’m cool with it too. I truly don’t see him getting the contract everyone’s been talking him up for. I also think Lonzo and Sexton could play together, but that’s expensive for at least one season before Sexton hits RFA."
So glad we got James Johnson and Naji Marshall for jj redick and this guy
"Kira Lewis Jr. earned minutes as the season progressed. Used his speed solidly throughout the season and I thought he played his best next to Nickeil, Zion (duh), and Jax. He almost looks like a vet out there with the composure he showed. I’d like to see improvement shooting the ball and using his speed to turn the corner more on defenders and be more aggressive when attacking the basket.  Naji Marshall is probably the reason Josh Hart won’t be returning to the Pels. This guy literally “just plays hard as fuck.” He’s the best on ball defender on our team and makes winning plays.   Lastly, Didi came over late from the NBL, but he showed signs of being a pesky defender. One of his first assignments was Luka Doncic, and he frustrated Luka a bit. Offense is a work in progress."
"&gt;	Presumably, the Pelicans would understand that you have to give to get, and as such would have Brandon Ingram available as a potential centerpiece for the Blazers, along with another legit young player. New Orleans has a couple that fit the bill — perhaps a Naji Marshall or a Kira Lewis.  Who would you guys prefer? Simmons or Ingram"
Naji Marshall snubbed
Naji Marshall
Naji Marshall with the Draymond statline.
Naji Marshall is my favorite player.   I like it when he shoots. I like it when he rebounds.  He is cool.
"Ah, better than Bledsoe I guess. Adams also wasn't great defensively, but that may have been due to injuries and the aforementioned issue of always being left 2 on 1. Is say the teams best defenders by the end of last season were Jaxon Hayes and Naji Marshall.  Maybe he does start being more physical now, it would open up a lot of his game. But I'm skeptical to say the least. I certainly wouldn't pay him under the assumption that he will with no signs of it showing as of yet in his career."
Naji Marshall signed for the minimum with a team option this summer and I’d maybe rather have him than Hart
"Hart, Naji Marshall, and now Herb Jones. We are about to have the hardest hustling team in the NBA. We may win some games just because we collapsed the other teams’ lungs."
"Can't watch the game right now, I hope Naji Marshall does well."
"Naji Marshall leads the pelicans to a chip averaging 100 points 20 assists 20 rebounds 20 blocks and 20 turnovers, the first ever penta-double."
"Not one mention of Naji Marshall, Tre Jones, or Aaron Nesmith in the article. All 3 have been absolutely amazing so far."
If there is no Naji Marshall I send it back
Naji Marshall and Josh Hart have proven to be better defenders IMO
"To be honest, I'd start Naji Marshall for defense and bring Devonte' off the bench as a sixth-man scorer.  But if he ends up as the Pels' top offseason acquisition, they'll probably want him to start."
my boy Naji Marshall
WHERE'S MY BOY NAJI MARSHALL
"The Great:   -The Davis trade after a really ugly second half to the 18-19 season and basically dealing with NOLA vs the world   -Helping shape a development staff with Gentry to help BI and Zo blossom.   -Naji Marshall UDFA —&gt; contract extension  -The Jrue trade; did right by Jrue and secured a bag of future picks and swaps. To all those people saying they won’t mean shit in five years: LMA and Bosh were all stars five years ago.   -Maxing BI    The good:   -Offloading Solomon Hill’s contract and signing JJ Redick   -Trading second round picks for Derrick Favors at the time   -With Trajan and Swin as well, seems to hit the draft pretty well. Jax, despite recent news (let’s also not mail in the rest of his life for this shit either), Nickeil, Kira, and Naji have all shown signs of a whole bunch of promise and legit talent. Jax was fantastic the second half of last season. Pels probably make the play in if Nickeil starts over Bledsoe. Naji was a fuckin Diamond in the rough.   -Willing to not let open wounds fester and immediately identifies and fixes own mistakes; something a deadbeat VP would not do.   -trading Redick and Melli for James Johnson, Wes Iwundu and a second rounder. Redick and Melli became unplayable and we saved some money for this offseason by offing Melli.       The bad:  -Choosing Melli and Jah over C Wood. Granted there was definitely some behind the scenes stuff with Wood’s attitude, but man Wood would have killed it with Zion.   -SVG  -Way too many guards on the 2019-2020 roster.   -Not enough shooters and defense on this last seasons team.  -Not extending Josh Hart BEFORE last year (this is more TBD/me nitpicking)    The Ugly:   Being the VP of a team who’s best player’s step father is already wanting his son off the team."
"If the Pelicans only got rid of Eric Bledsoe they'd win this easily. They also made a much needed upgrade at center with Jonas Valanciunas over Steven Adams. Have 6 different young players who will show growth in Zion, BI, Jaxson Hayes, NAW, Kira, and Naji Marshall and drafted players who can play d and showed out in summer league Trey Murphy (all summer league) and Herb Jones. Also Murphy looks like a sniper which is much needed."
find you someone that hypes your every move like naji marshall does BI and you’re set for life I promise
Pels fan would rave about how Griffin discovered undrafted gem Naji Marshall and finessed GSW with Alen Smailagic
KAT doesn't know who Naji marshall is? Confirmed casual
"This is one of the most hilarious comments I’ve ever seen.   People fucking ridicule Griff in our sub and there’s plenty of Lonzo love in there.   You say we don’t understand what we’re watching, but then go on to say Zo was our best defender last year. That’s absolute comedy. Naji was SIGNIFICANTLY better at defending than Lonzo was. But you probably haven’t watched the pelicans to even know who Naji Marshall is.   Keep our names out of your ignorant mouth."
"The defense mostly got better once bi and zion were injured and guys like naji marshall, naw and james johnson started games."
"&gt; NAW, Hayes, and Naji Marshall will take a big leap this year  It's hilarious to me how confident so many fans are that their young players will all significantly improve every year when it's way more likely they don't"
"Our team is a lot better now though. We added more scoring threats with Graham and rookie Trey Murphy III. NAW, Hayes, and Naji Marshall will take a big leap this year. Plus we have a coach players want to play hard for….not to mention Mike D’antoni as a offensive consultant. This whole squad will surprise the casuals."
Naji “only played during garbage time” Marshall
"It's definitely the right attitude, but Lonzo hasn't taken a ton of heaves: 11 in 4+ seasons.  Ingram and Steven Adams took more heaves on the Pelicans last year, and Lonzo took as many as Naji Marshall."
"the lineup numbers for the Pelicans starters have been incredible. Any time JV, Devonte, Josh Hart, and NAW have shared the court the Pelicans have been very good, their issues this season have come when they've had to play Kira Lewis Jr. and Naji Marshall real minutes."
I think it’s time we just say fuck it and let Naji Marshall run the Pelicans
Mikal’s performance is being overshadowed. He was tremendous and absolutely torturing Naji Marshall. Don’t think I’ve ever seen him go at someone like that.
Are Herb Jones and Naji Marshall always this good or is Phoenix just shitting the bed so bad that they look great for some reason?
"Naji Marshall makes some good plays. Seems like he knows how to move around on the court.  I was typing this comment right before he got that pick-6 dunk! That’s for proving me right, Naji!"
