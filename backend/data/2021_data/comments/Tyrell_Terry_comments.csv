"&gt;	Im curious about the mavs guard situation. I thought Brunson was supposed to be the guy that gave Luka a break, but it seems like mavs fans are still desperate for that second ball handler. Whats going on with Terry? Does rhe offense just stop when Luka sits?  So brunson being that guy may have been the plan but the reality is that he just can’t run the offense well, imo. He seems to be a much better scorer than playmaker and trying to give him playmaking duties just isn’t going well. The reality is that Brunson actually plays much better *with* Luka, which is great, but in terms of getting Luka rest, it obviously isn’t ideal. The best secondary playmaker is JRich by a long shot and him working with Luka is ideal.  Carlisle usually goes with Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke when Luka is sitting, but both those guys face the same issue of being better scorers than passers. This lineup also runs with KP as the main offensive creator and Jesus Christ is that not doing so hot rn, so then it falls on Tim to hit shots and if they aren’t falling, offense stagnates. Not to mention with Burke and Brunson, defense takes a big hit. All of this culminates into a meh offense that gets lead disappearing quick until Luka and the starting unit come back and try to fix it.  As for Terry, are you talking about Tyrell Terry, our rookie? I personally wish he’d get minutes but Rick doesn’t really play rookies, especially now with a healthy lineup. It’s a shame because Terry has shown flashes, and his development will go a long way for us in the future."
We're just an awful team. Covid fucked us. Injuries fucked us. Shit 3 point shooting fucked us. Fuck us. Let's just throw Tyrell Terry out there at this point to bomb 3's cause it's like everybody has noodles for arms and can't throw the fucking ball into the hoop.
I wanted Tyrell Terry. Haven’t heard his name since draft night and can’t even remember what team he’s on
"Buying- De'Andre Hunter, has been great for the hawks 17/5/2 on 52/36/87 splits. love watching him play.  Selling- Donte Divincenzo, had a good start but has slowed down quite a bit. 9/4/2 on 42/30/83 starting to get salty about the Bogdan trade not working.  Hold- Tyrell Terry. my favorite prospect going into the draft. Hasn't really gotten any playing time since he's behind luka, Brunson and burke."
I thought he was a second rounder tbh. I also thought Theo Maledon and Tyrell Terry were locks for round 1
"Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of:   &amp;#x200B;  C: Willie Caulie Stein  PF: Wes Iwundu  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Green  PG: Luka Dončić  with a bench of Boban, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, James Johnson  &amp;#x200B;  Porziņģis came back a few games ago but is still rusty and until last night we had been missing 3-4 starters. We were 6-4 before COVID hit, keep in mind that was also without Porziņģis. We have not played a single game with our projected starting lineup.   If you watch our games you will see that Luka is the only reason we are near 0.500. We've been garbage without him on the court. This is also coming from a huge Luka critic. I can't deny the impact he's had on our team. His 3PT shooting has been bad, but he's also had no spacing, and defenders are not respecting our shooters, so the lanes are clogged and teams are able to triple team Luka and leave Iwundu, Green and WCS wide open. Iwundu and Green are shooting 14.3 and 9.1% respectively from 3 and they've been two of our starters the past month.   If Dallas is still treading water when the COVID guys are back and get their conditioning back, and Porziņģis is in his groove, then sure, there are some valid concerns, but as it stands now, Luka has kept us in the playoff race despite being down our 2nd-6th best players for over half the season."
"It's an expiring deal now, so slightly more valuable than 10 months ago.   Cavs should be able to get back matching money and a player on a rookie contract.  The worse money they take back, the better player they can get.  For example if they are willing to take back Dwight Powell's contract (and James Johnson's expiring), I'm sure the Mavs would be willing to give them Tyrell Terry.  Dotson is decent, but at 26 and a free agent in 2022, I don't see him as part of their future."
Tyrell Terry also sucks.
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
Just put in Tyrell Terry jesus
"Maybe this is the game for Tyrell Terry, Mavs need some 3 point shooting and he might get hot from downtown."
It's tyrell terry time
Tyrell Terry is Poor man's Seth Curry. Josh Green is really poor man's josh richardson.
[SERIOUS] Does Tyrell Terry have a shot at mvp?
When I saw Tyrell Terry getting meaningful minutes I felt the same way.
JOSH GREEN AND TYRELL TERRY SEASON

"Bruh I can’t believe I thought Tyrell Terry was better lol, thought Boston messed up by passing on him."
Is KOC good at the whole draft scouting thing?   In the past 3 drafts he’s had:  **Hayes** *#1*  **Tyrell Terry** *#8* (Really not impressed by what he’s shown so far in Dallas)   **Culver** *#3*  **Grant Williams** *#8*  **Mo Bamba** *#3*
"Oh we love him and I love him....now. But, at the time of the draft 99% hated it.   Most of us wanted Tyrell Terry. I wanted the pick to be traded and was fuming when we got Payton Pritchard instead of Terry or a veteran, as the 28th pick got the Lakers Schroder"
"Terrible draft pick , we could’ve had tyrell terry instead .../s"
Tyrell Terry has 2 points in 14 minutes this season. If we drafted him over PP we’d be fucked
"I wanted Tyrell Terry for backup PG and we got Payton Pritchard instead. Terry can't get minutes on Dallas, and Pritchard has been an excellent backup so far and is 3rd among rookies in minutes played. I liked Pritchard immediately as soon as the season started."
Tyrell Terry lol
His top 10 selection Tyrell Terry whom we drafted 31st also looks like a traffic cone who's at least two years away  before we even know if he's any good or not. He's that rough around the edges.
KOC also had Tyrell Terry in his top 10.  Terry looks like he'd have a tough time in G League.
Tyrell Terry (only saying this because im a mavs fan)
"Nance Jr. and eating Cedi's contract for James Johnson's expiring, Josh Green or Tyrell Terry and one or two 2nds."
76ers traded Richardson and Tyrell Terry for Curry. Bey was drafted by the Mavs.
"No, A Tyrell Terry"
THE Tyrell Terry?
Tyrell Terry
"unless Tyrell Terry becomes, well unironically the next Seth curry, this Mavs jrich Seth trade looking worse everyday"
Second-round 2020 NBA draft pick Tyrell Terry had a nice game for the Memphis Hustle. 19 points on 8/17 shooting.
Young Players: Tyrell Terry like what?  You mean Jalen Brunson?
We’d obviously need to add more but could be an option.  I also think Dallas could look seriously at swapping Powell + 2nds and maybe a guy like Tyrell Terry for Horford.
KOC also had Tyrell Terry in the lottery.
"Rick also said that our draft this year is amazing , Josh Green is ready to be in the rotation and Tyrell Terry can shoot the hell out of the ball.I still believe in those guys but  Honestly I don't really give much importance to what the coaches say when they draft a player. They always try to hype up their draft selection .  JB is a stud though  he has really worked hard on his game and has improved so much from the day he was drafted. I hope we can resign him this off-season at a reasonable contract."
Gordon for josh Green and Tyrell terry?
TYRELL TERRY TIME BABY!
"I will gladly dickride you guys losing after the nonsense you idiots were spouting when the trade happened. If it weren't for KP the Mavs would probably be my fav team tho tbh. Good coach, up and coming superstar, and I'm a big fan of Tyrell Terry."
Oh man don’t get my started on Tyrell Terry lol. I wanted him so bad and like with Hayes maybe he will get it going
I still have faith Tyrell Terry (#8 on KOC's board) can be better than Tyrese Haliburton (#9)!
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
Yo Tyrell Terry people were asking about you bro.
That was pick 25. Who judges picks at that range so harshly?   The only players I see that were available at that point who were hyped by media is Tyrell Terry and Desmond Bane and I wouldn't fault teams for passing on them.
"You are VASTLY overstimating how much those picks are worth. 31st pick int he draft:  2020 Tyrell Terry, Stanford - Dallas Mavericks   2019 Nicolas Claxton, Georgia – Brooklyn Nets   2018 Elie Okobo, France – Phoenix Suns   2017 Frank Jackson, Duke – Charlotte Hornets   2016 Deyonta Davis, Michigan State – Boston Celtics   2015 Cedi Osman, Anadolu Efes – Minnesota Timberwolves   2014 Damien Inglis, France – Milwaukee Bucks   2013 Allen Crabbe, California – Cleveland Cavaliers   2012 Jeff Taylor, Vanderbilt – Charlotte Bobcats"
No that’s Tyrell Terry.
That’s Tyrell Terry
Do y’all want fellow Canadian Dwight Powell??? or a lightly used Josh Green or Tyrell Terry???
Tyrell Terry please tweet or something we're worried about you
"okay since ur spamming this comment lemme just clear it up.   Game 2 atlanta vs dallas  people out for atlanta: D. Hunter, Bogi, Dunn, Rondo  people out for dallas : Tyler Bey, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry (all in g league)  Dallas wins by 1 point  game 1: Atl: Hunter Bogi Dunn Onyeka Dal: Tyler and Nate  dallas wins by 6.  &amp;#x200B;  Hawks are just injury depleted and those games dont really mean anything as bogis clearly been the second best player on the hawks since the ASB and hunter was averaging 17 before he got hurt. Dallas just has had the luxury of health. Also hawks had their old, trash coach."
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
"Well, in Moneyball, Billy Beane overruled the scouts to acquire high-OBP players who he felt were undervalued and wound up contributing greatly to the regular-season success of the A's. In this situation, Bob overruled all the scouts to draft Josh Green and Tyrell Terry."
Mavs scouting department probably didn't want Tyrell Terry.   Pretty sure that Voulgaris guy used to be on The Ringer and they were very high on Terry. They had him as high as 8th on their big board.
"Multiple league and team sources point to the 2020 draft as a particularly egregious example of Voulgaris’ power, an evening one source described as “embarrassing.” Most members of the scouting department joined the team’s war room remotely through Zoom and were surprised when Voulgaris, attending in person, didn’t consult them for either of the team’s first two selections (Josh Green and Tyrell Terry) despite disagreements they held with at least one of the players he picked.  “What did (he) sell to Mark to make him believe (he) can do this?” asks one source with an intimate knowledge of the situation. “Nobody knows.”  It marked another throughline of Voulgaris’ tenure with the Mavericks: that his personality and decision making has steadily irritated and exasperated the team’s front office employees and players with both his decision making and personality over the course of the three seasons he’s been employed. “He doesn’t know how to talk to people,” that same source says.  That’s best exemplified by Dallas’ franchise player disliking him. Doncic’s strained relationship with Voulgaris predated their incident in February, multiple sources say. It wasn’t the only incident, either. This season, Voulgaris attended his first game in mid January, frequently appearing courtside at home and also traveling with them on the road in the months that followed. In mid-April, during the final minute of a home defeat to the New York Knicks, Voulgaris was seen on the game’s broadcast footage standing up and leaving with about 45 seconds remaining. While the Mavericks were trailing by 10 points at the time, they cut the deficit to six and extended the game seven more possessions before eventually losing."

"Doncic/Finney-Smith/Josh Green/THJ/Kleber/Brunson/Powell/KP?  Who knows how the FO REALLY feels about Porzingis but not protecting him is a free way to get out of his contract, even though it's a huge negative at this point a needy team will give us something in return for him. If they don't protect KP then probably Tyrell Terry considering they picked him over some more NBA ready contributors last year.  If the mavs give up KP then an expansion team is definitely taking him but I would wager Josh Richardson is the one that gets snagged."
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
I initially mis-read your comment as just player they had drafted. It seems like a weird thing to criticize DAL over as they had just drafted those players before ATL did. Meaning they had been on rookie scale contracts but they just expired.   Luka Doncic  Josh Green  Tyrell Terry  Jalen Brunson  and then DFS is making 4 mil a year for the next 3 years or so
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
Tyrell Terry is not going to be a good NBA player for at least another 4-5 years.
"I maintain that Tyrell Terry can be a huge piece for the Mavs, if he sees the floor. IIRC, Carlisle just wasn’t playing him earlier this year, then he had some personal issues and took a leave of absence from the team."
"&gt; As a side note who was the pick, Tyrell Terry or Tyler Bey?  Tyler Bey. Tyrell Terry is a 2nd round pick from GSW."
"True but the reason they lost to the Clippers so far has been poor defense both containing the drives and rim protection. Not sure Seth would change that. It was still a massive steal for the sixers though. As a side note who was the pick, Tyrell Terry or Tyler Bey?"
Y'all had to give up /r/nba_draft darling Tyrell Terry though
"how about Porzingis, Brunson, and Josh Green to OKC for Al Horford, 2022 FRP, 2023 2nd, Pokusevski, &amp; Isaiah Roby? Or another scenario where you send him to IND along with J-Rich, Tyrell Terry a 1st and Brunson for Brogdon and Turner?"
"Mavs only have Luka. Maybe one of Josh Green, Tyrell Terry, or Tyler Bey becomes good, I mean they turn into beasts in 2K and we all know how accurate that is 👀"
"Rick is guard whisperer. Brunson high value rn, and watching Tyrell Terry highlights on loop, he's too good to not panned out."
Right:      Saddiq Bey: didn’t expect him to be this good of a shooter so fast but knew he would eventually be a plus shooter and solid defender      Halliburton: again didn’t know it would be this soon but felt like he had the highest floor of the draft. Looks like his ceiling is much higher too.      Wrong:       Payton Pritchard: knew he was a good shooter but didn’t think he was going to make it in the league.       Tyrell Terry: thought he would be a sniper. Barely played but results weren’t promising.
"Hoping Tyrell Terry has some juice. Seems like he had a lost year due to some personal issues, so I’m hopeful he’ll he able to come in next season and show us what he can do"
Tyrell Terry. He didnt even really play much so idk if he was underwhelming but I think he can show some real flashes next season
"This time his father wasn't that loud so kinda nothing.  I had a good feeling about jayson tatum just because of his name.  Luka in favour because of real Madrid.  For some reason I usually am not in favour of small guards like trea, vanvleet (like the fact that he goes from undrafted to starter, underdog shizz).  Didn't like when we got Tyrell Terry with 31.  I want teams to draft bigs or fast players in 2nd round.safer bet compared to guards I think."
"Tyrell Terry, he… he HARDLY EVEN PLAYED THIS YEAR!  Sorry, man, but that is ONE prediction I can’t see coming true - though I’d love to see that (or Josh Green, aka Luka’s Second Son, aka the Thunda’ from down Unda’, aka Ice in His Veins)!"
"If Tyrell Terry wins MIP, that will be the biggest 1 year turnaround in history"
"Or Tyrell Terry. We barely saw him play this season, but he definitely didn't look like a lottery pick (like KOC claimed)."
"I would take him getting targeted on defense any day for his 3s. Maybe Mavs lose quicker to Clippers because they don't have good-great defense teammates around him on the floor. I was in same large boat thinking J Rich was gonna make the Mavs' Defense somewhat better, but fans should've learn right off the bat he tricked the Sixers and now the Mavs. Now Mavs fans just got to wait how Tyrell Terry pans out."
They still have two unknown quantities in Tyler Bey and Tyrell Terry thanks to that trade iirc. Trade should still sting for the Mavs but one of those two (or both) panning out will ease the pain.
That's the same as wishing Josh Green and Tyrell Terry turning into Dray and Klay next season
1 Tyrell Terry for them
"This is a dumb logic. You are saying you are OK with another year of not having second player maker and ball handler next to Luka and having another mediocre season, just because Tyrell Terry and Josh Green are too valuable. Like I said those are not some premium assets. The only reason we even talk about them is because how little assets the Mavs have."
Mavs holding out for a buyout.....   Dude we don't even want your shitty prospects: Josh Green and Tyrell Terry stinks
Tyrese Haliburton. Saddiq Bey. Devin Vassell. Keldon Johnson.   Hopefully KZ &amp; Tyrell Terry too!
"Tyrell Terry,  What's wrong with Weezer?"
Thanks Tyrell Terry
"Tyrell Terry  He could be Trae levels of good in a few years, or he could be outta the league 🤷🏼‍♂️"
Ur getting ej onu Tyrell Terry and Moses brown  Plz watch the mixtape btw
"No, because he doesn't move the needle and we need to gain control of our future 1sts to have available for trades for players who actually are difference makers down the road. I think it's more likely Dallas would offer someone like Tyrell Terry.   I think Josh Green and any future 1sts are completely off the table."
"Lol, not even close. Raps would bite on that. If it's what the Mavs fans on here seem to think is fair it's Powell and Tyrell Terry. That's not just a nothing trade, it's actually a net negative for the Raps to take those players on."
They like him but they aren’t stupid. They just don’t want to give up Tyrell Terry and Josh Green. They’d have to give up all their young assets
&gt;Tyler Terry   Whitewashed Tyrell Terry 😂
"&gt; Defensively, are guards dying on picks or are they staying with the play?  I knew Tyrell Terry was a *project* in last year's summer league when he got taken completely out of the play with a screen multiple times. Might have even been back to back possessions. He might still turn out but he 100% wasn't NBA ready"
get asked out by a bitch named terry   she got no shot just like tyrell terry
Tyrell Terry
"Sure, Dwight Powell, Trey Burke and Tyrell Terry."
tyrell terry apparently lmao
"Powell is beloved by people in that org. Tyrell Terry was a borderline first round pick and although a late first, it’s still a first. You’re not getting all that. Lmao  Just like rap fans thought they were getting Maxey, Thybulle and 2 firsts at the deadline for Kyle. Shit was hilarious."
"I wasn't super high on Tyler bey. Dude looked absolutely raw and lost on offense. Even in the  g league. We just don't have the minutes and reps to be giving to him to develop. We are trying to contend now. And honestly. Between josh green and Tyrell terry, terry might get more minutes because he the better shooter. Dude was an absolute  sharpshooter in college."
Tyrell Terry would like a word
"Yeah he literally said Dallas isn’t interested in trading any assets for him on a Greenroom the other day. Seems like Toronto wants Josh Green/Tyrell Terry and Dallas isn’t budging, which is the right move. They can sign Dragic next summer."
"EJ Onu, Feron Hunt, Tyrell Terry, Nate Hinton"
"Tyrell Terry basically missed most of his rookie season last year cause of personal reasons so I’m excited to see him play again, especially cause his skill set would be extremely useful for us if he pans out. Basically our Seth Curry replacement hopefully lol.  Also signed UDFA EJ Onu who’s 6’11 with a 7’9 wingspan and I so desperately want him to be good because I like long bois."
"I mean they supposedly want Powell, WCS AND one of Green or Tyrell Terry  Good on Nico for holding ground"
One of either Josh Green or Tyrell Terry is my guess
Josh Green and Tyrell Terry are the prospects.
Tyrell Terry will be a good backup for the Fujian Strurgeon
"Wouldn't hate it, but I also want to see how Tyrell Terry does as a backup SG he never had a chance yet"
"I'm going to go with two guys who I loved going into the draft, but had somewhat disappointing seasons partly due to some stuff not entirely within their control: Deni Avdija and Tyrell Terry."
"sure. but he leaned about as heavily into his killian hayes take as i've ever seen any analyst on any platform, ever.  combine that with the rest of his board... he was very high on devin vassell, very low on patrick williams, wildly high on tyrell terry... all of his bold takes look like total misses so far. you're right that it's too early to judge, though.  and again, i actually think he's worth paying attention to regardless. everyone misses. not everyone is bold enough to have an independent take."
"Great fit behind Trae, him sliding does remind me of this sub losing it over Tyrell Terry last year."
"He's really tiny  Last year people had Tyrell Terry in their top 10, how much time did he get for the Mavs this year?"
"Yea, they always say that about Jaylen Brown to be fair though.  Last year it was Tyrell Terry (“broke the iq test!!!”)"
I wanna see tyrell terry actually get a chance to play
Tyrell Terry on my Mavs. He was AWOL for personal reasons and when he wasnt he looked absolutely terrified whenever he was on the court. Also took zero threes which is his only NBA-level skill.
Tyrell “personal reasons” Terry is rested and ready
Tyrell Terry is a good counterexample . I think a team will fall in love with his passing and pick and roll ability in the 18-25 range and pick him. I think Cooper has a lot more pro ready skills than Terry who seemed to just have a 3 point shot that might translate.
"Good point, I’ve been following scouts but haven’t been looking at many mock drafts so I’m kind of surprised to see these mocks all have him in the 1st round. From what I’ve heard, teams are worried about his size and lack of shot, but they like his shiftiness.     Mocks tend to be pretty inaccurate outside the lottery and there’s always a handful of prospects that mock drafts rate highly but actual scouts and teams don’t. Tyrell Terry was an example of this last year and I have a feeling Sharife is one of those prospects this year. I’m betting he goes early second round but we’ll see."
"The only idea I've seen is potentially Dallas. The idea is they'd want to get off KP's money a year earlier and give Luka another ball handler.  I could see KP + Powell + either Tyrell Terry or Josh Green for Wall + Danuel House  The issue is I think even though Wall is a miserable contract, Houston is aware that such a deal would be because Dallas wants to get off their money earlier and I think that Dallas would need to attach an asset (i.e. a player or pick) as compensation."

"John Wall to Raptors, Dragic to Mavs, Trey Burke and Tyrell Terry to Houston"
Yep! I dont mean to entirely discredit this mans shooting ability but Ive played some NAIA and some D3 and for me the difference is the overall body type and athlete at NAIA was commonly worse. I had more trouble finishing after the transfer and I remember thinking everyone was longer and faster.   NAIA occasionally gets the diamond in the rough style prospect but normally is undersized skilled guys who couldnt make a NCAA roster.   He probably shot over and was defended by ppl his size whereas Tyrell Terry or Seth Curry had to shoot over NBA prospects and D1 athletes
Tyrell Terry
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
Doesn't mean the 76ers didn't select him. Now explain the tyrell Terry.
"No he wasn't, he was traded to the mavs for seth curry. Tyrell terry was actually selected by the mavs wtf are you smoking?"
Yes he was. You're thinking also of Tyrell Terry though.
Tyrell Terry .
At least he nailed Tyrell Terry. Steal of last year's draft.
Fortunately for the Mavericks Tyrell Terry is not driving the value of that group
"That seems like a meaningless distinction to make, though, and it completely ignores that the point of having young players is to accrue stars, not role players.   The group of Luka, Moses brown, Tyrell Terry, Jalen brunson, Frank and Josh green is likely to see way more success over the next 5 years than the OKC group.   The OKC group is only a better core if your goal is to have a bunch of good players and turn into the Pacers and be a fun team to watch with 0 playoff equity."
"&gt; Tyrell Terry getting waived  TBH, this one shook me. I thought he was going to be a steal."
Tyrell Terry getting waived and now this! KOC not having a good week.
"I searched the Reddit and this was the only thread that came up from 7 years ago.  So figured it would be worth revisiting I kind of fell down a Wiki hole after reading some Tyrell Terry getting cut article about his ""record breaking"" basketball IQ tests   So I was curious what people think the best 2nd round draft class was? For me it seems it is 2012 by a wide margin.  2012: Crowder, Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Mike Scott, Tomas Satoranksy, even guys like Kyle O'Quinn or Robert Sacre got a few years.   Is there a draft class that even comes close?"
Goes to show how dumb post draft grades are.   CBS gave the Quickley pick a D+ and Tyrell Terry a B.
i was initially pissed when we didn’t draft Tyrell Terry and drafted Quickley
"After the draft I was convinced that Tyrell Terry &gt; Tyler Bey &gt; Josh Green. I think it was KOC who had given such glowing reports about how Terry was a mid first rounder who fell because of some reasons. Of all the sharpshooters signed in that draft, he is the only one who hardly played.   I kept seeing his DNP last season even when we barely had any players but I guess that personal reason must be big enough to prevent him from playing even when we were shorthanded. Part of the blame kept going on Rick Carlisle as he doesn't trust 'rookies' especially those that were drafted late.   Now I hope that at least Green turns out OK as otherwise that would be two consecutive zeroes after hitting the jackpot in 2018."
When you try to be funny at least get the players right. We got Tyler Bey from that Jrich trade. Has nothing to do with Tyrell Terry
[Mavs just waived Tyrell Terry](https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1449199656806895617)
There goes the Tyrell Terry rookie card value
Kevin O’Connor convinced me Tyrell Terry was Trae Young lite
"Bruh just talk to your video department, Tyrell Terry."
Mavs shouldn’t be on this list if you’re gonna count Tyrell Terry. He’s not getting minutes anytime soon
"Reports are saying Josh Green is looking awesome. I haven't heard as much about him, but I'm still hoping Tyrell Terry can develop into a Buddy Hield/JJ Redick type as our Seth Curry replacement. That trade still hurts so much."
This Jones cat has already shown more NBA talent than Tyrell Terry ever will. Sadge.
"Kevin ""Tyrell Terry should be in the lottery"" O'Connor"
"Man speaking of Mannion, when I saw Seth have some success I thought the league would trend towards shooting being a premium (even if it’s not a guy of great stature) and that guys recently drafted such as Tyrell Terry, Mannion, and Kyle Guy would have productive NBA careers (albeit maybe not right away).  Looking back on that now is funny, Terry a FA, I think Nico is overseas, and Guy is in the G League. Looks like they all gonna have to get it out the mud Seth Curry style if they wanna make it."
"Yeah, the pipeline has been insane in the last 10 years or so for high level college guys with a lot of draft picks thrown in.  You’ve had Tyus, Tre, and Gary Trent out of Apple valley, Rashad Vaughn, Daniel Oturu, Matthew Hurt (super highly rated prospect but left duke early and is stuck in the G league), Zeke Nnaji, Holmgren and Suggs out of v, JP Macura who was a stud at Xavier, Freddie Gillespie and Kendall Brown out of east ridge, Tyrell Terry, Royce White (who flamed out), McKinley Wright, Jericho Sims. Minnesota has had a 5 star I think every year for the last 10 years.    Lot of good woman players as well most notably Page Beuckers who’s at UConn now"
Hilarious part is we had the opportunity to draft boffum and went with Josh green and tyrell terry 😭
I assumed it was because the Mavs FO thought that Tyrell Terry could eventually replace Seth Curry.
ah shit. i thought you were the real Tyrell Terry. apologies
Surprised a Mavericks fan would vouch for a guy that had Tyrell Terry that high on his board lol
I don’t think Tyrell Terry has any value at all right now either though.
"If the Mavs really wanted Dragic, they backed themselves into a corner by keeping a guy who functionally can't get traded to Toronto over Tyrell Terry"
Not good. We had a similar situation with Tyrell Terry and ended up cutting him. Mental health is no joke
Sounds similar to the Tyrell Terry situation.
Raps fans were literally begging Masai to draft this dude in the draft game thread (although they were pining for Tyrell Terry too. Lol.)
