"That's not how all star selections work though. ""Frontcourt"" players get 6 slots, and the potential for 2 more with wildcards. Grant isn't just competing with small forwards. He's competing with power forwards and centers.   That's KD, Giannis, Butler, Tatum, maybe Jaylen, Middleton, Hayward, Sabonis, Embiid, Adebayo, Vucevic, and guys more on the fringe like julius Randle, siakam, OG, Jared Allen, tobias Harris, hell even Drummond maybe.   That's a lot of guys competing for MAX 8 spots, more likely 7 or even 6, and even now he's behind at least 7 of them. Considering there are 12-15 guards fighting for 4 spots plus the wild cards, it's a solid bet guards get both wildcards, leaving only 6 frontcourt spots.   So you're saying grant is currently a lock over KD, giannis, Tatum, Embiid, Middleton, vucevic, adebayo, and Sabonis, who are all really good bets to get in? All former all stars, all off to good starts?"

"You mean the season he had 59 game of jimmy butler or the one where he had 10?  Yeah the 2018-19 season he had a cool 48 games with roco that was fun. Jared bayless started a few games for us back then because Rose and tyus was hurt. Keita bates diop and Cam Reynalds also played a shit ton of rotational minutes for us. All this time Andrew Wiggins was his co star, the warriors are 16-15 with Wiggins as curry’s co star and way better roster talent than what ever Kat has had"

"Are you serious? Those guys are teammates. Here’s another random collection of college players I would coalesce into one team: Davion Mitchell, Jared Butler, MaCio Teague, Mark Vital, Flo Thamba. Jeez, imagine those 5 together! They might even be able to beat this guy’s group!"
"Alperen Sengun is a probable lotto pick no one has heard of, but he could a beast in this league. Usman Garuba could go in the lotto too, and he’s been amazing in Spain.    Daishen Nix, Jared Butler, Scottie Barnes and Chris Duarte will be the steals of this draft. But it’s filled with talent from top to bottom."
Great on ball defender/passer/slasher. Jared butler is still better IMO.
Jimmy butler got ejected two years ago against the nets because Jared Dudley shoved embiid so Jimmy shoved Dudley
It's very top heavy and super super thin at the Center position. Last year's draft class probably had better depth of talent. Though i do think some very good guard prospects are being severely underrated (Jared Butler/Miles McBride/Davion Mitchell)
"* Helped: Johnny Juzang, Jared Butler, Davion Mitchell, Ethan Thompson, Max Abmas, Kevin Obanor,   * Hurt: Corey Kispert, Ayo Dosunmu, Duane Washington, basically the entire Texas team"
Are Jimmy Butler and Jared Butler related?

Davion Mitchell   MaCio Teague     Jared Butler    Flo Thamba    Mark Vital       This team sweeps all of them lol
"I love me some Suggs but he’s solidly 4th for me after Green and Mobley.  Why would the raptors take davion mitchell?  Jared Butler at 25 is disrespectful, though he would be perfect on the sixers.  Kessler stays disrespected as well."
Would really hope that Hawks take the opportunity here to draft Jared Butler instead of Thomas.

"Totally agree. Jared Butler is better in every regard except on ball defense, in addition Butler is bigger and a good bit younger."
"I’m leaning towards that. They seem to tune him out.  Tatum’s inconsistent effort makes me want to trade him but the fact is that at 22, he has put up some impressive numbers... and he could end up being a top 10 player.  Trading Jaylen probably wouldn’t be a good idea either as he’s only 23 and shoots with great efficiency and he plays hard and plays good D.  We need a coach who lights a fire under these guys and we need to get a player with enough potential to push Tatum to playing harder.  Ziaire Williams, Jared butler, Ayo dosunmu or josh cristopher - could one of these guys excel enough to push the Celtics above mediocrity?  The celts are so predictable on offense and need another guy who can create their own shot.  I’m sick of this shit!"
"I’m a Baylor alum who watched every second these past two seasons, I’d take Butler first. Davion was obviously great and I’d love to have him on my team but this year was like AB with JuJu, Jared Butler’s gravity and offensive skill was the engine to Baylor’s offense that allowed Davion and everyone to shine."

"Chris or Jared Dudley? Jimmy Butler and Detroit-era Hill have very similar games. I would give the edge to Hill on offense but Butler on defense. Plus, Hill did have an old but still efficient Joe Dumars on those Pistons squads."
Lou Williams looked atrocious tonight too. We need to get someone like Jared Butler in the draft
"I think it’s possible because there’s a possibility that Jared butler or davion Mitchell could be top 150 players in the nba in their rookie year, and there are like 400 players in the nba or something like that"
"Depends. If you're looking for upside it's Kai, but honestly with Mitchell Robinson this seems kinda not that sexy. Jared Butler would be a better pick than Cooper if you're looking for immediate impact, which fits what the Knicks need now. Cooper's shooting is a very hazy mystery."

"this sounds like a potential cardiac condition, or genetic one  &gt;The Athletic reported that Butler was referred to the panel in June and there was a chance that his NBA career was over before it ever started.  &gt;The panel consists of three physicians that determine if players are allowed to be medically cleared to play in the NBA. It's unclear why Butler was referred to the panel, but nonetheless, he will hear his name be called on draft day.   &gt;The panel was created in 2017 and deals with potentially life-threatening situations. Specifically, cardiac illnesses and conditions as well as blood clots and other blood conditions and disorders. It was initially created for former Heat forward Chris Bosh when his career was essentially ended by a condition he developed caused by blood clots he suffered from.   https://www.si.com/nba/2021/07/17/jared-butler-cleared-fitness-to-play-panel-nba-draft"

"Not a pick lower than 18 because the protections fade over time, and seriously, think about this like Jalen Green + Alperen Sengun + Jared Butler for Cade or something like that. What people are missing on this sub is how frequently prospects defy expectations after the draft, for all the talk you don't really know how a prospect will pan out. I hope rockets don't trade if it takes one of those kinds of packages and I think if a trade is made it's going to surprise 99% of people on this sub.

"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
"They should throw a college kid or 2 in there like the old days, for when they go up like 124-58 on Angola.  Get Luka Garza and Jared Butler on the team"
They desperately need wing shooting/scoring.  They can always find a quality bench PG end of the draft like taking a flyer on Jared Butler if he falls due to medicals.
Kind of ice cold for Jay Bilas to say Davion Mitchell has a huge heart when his college teammate Jared Butler might not be allowed to play in the NBA because of the literal size of his heart.
"For anyone curious, Jared Butler has had a heart issue and that has been known by him and by Baylor for years and years. Baylor basketball is known for having the resources to monitor these heart-related issues (former player King McClure dealt with a similar issue). There were always questions about if he would be allowed to be in the league…sadly, it looks like the NBA has enough concerns to make this statement, but he could very well clear protocol and be fine. As a Baylor fan, I hope he can go, even though it means we wouldn’t have him another year."
"Suggs had 22 pts against, tied with Jared Butler for the game high… he also shot better than Butler overall in the game. I don’t know what you’re talking about."
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Who said it wasn’t?  Why have a message board if we can’t speculate?  Every decision has risks.  Some decisions are less risky than others like say drafting Jared butler over ziaire Williams, for example."
"How is that nitpicking? I just listed how many guys are NBA players, a lot of good college teams will have a guy who dominated in college. A lot will have a couple guys who made the NBA for a year or 2 and wash out. And a lot will have guys that stick.  So if the G-League teams are deeper with good players from mostly smaller schools what does that really matter when the depth on the Ignite is even better?  Is Stauskas and Yuta really that much better than Davion Mitchell, and Jared Butler? Does it really matter if player 4-10 are good players from small schools who are a couple years older?"
"Also, I’m sad that the Celtics don’t have their first rounder this season.  I was looking forward to a pg or center of the future to be picked.  Looks like they got their center of the future.  Ngl I really wanted Jaden springer, Jared butler or sharife cooper in the draft."
You're thinking of Jared Butler.

"I’m hoping Jared Butler is healthy, I’d love to see him get some run with the Jazz"
jared butler for no reason (40th pick this draft)
"Theo Maledon and Jared Butler have professional scorer/sixth man of the year potential, Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams type guy. Michael Porter Jr. is a future MVP in the league"
"It's pretty much what every evaluator said about him. He's decent at everything, but doesn't have any facet of the game he's a standout at. It's why some people wish we would've gone for a guy like Sharife Cooper (elite passer, but small and can't shoot) or Jared Butler (solid scorer, but below average athlete and turnover prone). But both of those guys have much higher bust potential too.   Ayo will likely just be... fine."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

Jared Butler? They *were* teammates...
"Mike Conley, good thing Utah got a steal in Jared Butler"
"Well, at least you have a young prospect in Jared Butler, which is something"
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
"A lot of people were surprised he went undrafted this year. His contributions to the 2021 Baylor national team were overlooked since he wasplaying alongside Davion Mitchell and Jared Butler, but his shooting always provided a spark when our offense was cold. I'm hoping he can find a roster spot somewhere."
"The Jazz have two sixth man of the year finalists, Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Jared Butler."
And stole Jared Butler in the draft. The Jazz have a very solid lineup now
Jared Butler still gets to play with D Mitchell pretty cool
They bring back the same team but replaced Niang with Rudy Gay and drafted Jared Butler who I’m pretty high on as an immediate rotation guy. Plus Mitchell could take another step forward.
"The Jazz have to be up there, went from paying Favors 9M to paying Whiteside the vet min and IMO is an upgrade, I think Hassan is a better player today.  Rudy Gay is an upgrade over Niang  Jared Butler was a steal  Ryan Smith has shown he’s willing to be a tax payer"
"The Jazz would also be asking for one or two of Paschall, Moody, or Looney in a trade, it wouldn't be a straight-up sign and trade for Ingles.  FWIW, i think the jazz are *really* high on Jared Butler and i expect him to play backup PG to run the second unit for us and to maybe even start while Mike is out, so the lack of ingles playmaking is not a death knell to our second unit in their eyes, but i agree that losing him would really sting."
"As shocking as it may sound, Gay is now one of our best perimeter defenders. Now we just need to find a smaller, more athletic player to defend the Morants and Murrays of the world, unless if Jared Butler becomes that."
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
"Well we still have 5 roster spots to fill, 4 since Jared Butler will likely get a contract more in line with a late first round pick.  With an MLE left to sign and a couple vet minimums I expect we’ll end up closer to $15-$18M into the tax."
That Jared Butler turns out to be so good that he's getting a starting spot for the playoffs to defend other team's best players
"Brandon Boston is wrong, Ziaire Williams is wrong, Isaiah Todd is wrong, Miles McBride is wrong, JT Thor is wrong, Jared Butler is wrong, Greg Brown is wrong, Balsa Kopravica is wrong. I don't think there are many accurate teams on his list lol."
"&gt;He was the best player on the best team in college.  Crazy how Jared Butler was the Most Outstanding Player for the NCAA Tournament and consensus All-American and led the team in scoring while still making All-Defense then, huh? All while being 2 years younger."
I think Jared Butler is gonna ball out
Galaxy brain move by Justin Zanik betting on Jared Butler falling to number 40
Jared Butler for freaking sure.   If it wasn't for his medicals he should've been a lottery pick.
Jared butler and cooper
Holy shit Jared butler got drafted in the second round. I was just watching law abiding citizen just yesterday.
"I'm having such a hard time keeping track of what player is actually going where in this round?  The reddit thread says Jared Butler went to Memphis, nba.com says Butler went to the Pelicans, google says Jared Butler went to the Jazz??  Who is right lmao"
Jared Butler will be the steal of this draft. No idea how he's in 40. Donovan Mitchell 2.0
"Ayo is a two way guard, sure, but he’s definitely more PG than SG, at least at Illinois. If we are taking BPA, that would be Jared Butler."
Ayo over Jared Butler? What? Why? Huh?
y is jared butler falling so far?
Wow how is Jared Butler (Baylor) still on the board? Kid is a NBA-ready 6th man tomorrow
Wish we could trade into the 2nd round and take Jared Butler. He can fucking ball.
Jared Butler tho
Are Jared Butler and Ayo Dosunmu in a satanic cult or some shit
Jared Butler to _______?
"Funny story, Jared Butler winds up being a better NBA player than Davion Mitchell, who went to Baylor for the record"
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
We could've had Jared Butler....
Take Jared Butler you cowards
Damn poor Jared Butler
Now they just need to master the element of College Basketball Twitter by taking Jared Butler to become a fully fledged Avatar.
Wow Jared Butler has fallen far. I wonder if his medical screening was more concerned than we thought
Wow Jared Butler has fallen far. I wonder if his medical screening was more concerned than we thought
Jared Butler was right there…
The fuck is this draft lmao. Steal city for Sharife Cooper and Jared Butler
Sharife Cooper and/or Jared Butler this year if they don't go in the next 2 picks lol
Jared Butler fucking sucks. NO ONE should draft him^please
Jared butler is a steal at this point
I’ll take 1 Jared butler please
How has Jared Butler fallen this far?
I'll take Cam Thomas or Jared Butler please
Jared butler really bout to be one of the biggest steals of recent memory.
I wanted Jared Butler
Jared Butler would be a great pickup for Brooklyn
someone draft jared butler
Have any team picked Jared Butler yet? It will be funny if he ends up being the 30th pick like Jimmy Butler was!
"Well, Jared Butler just fell into Nuggets' lap"
Noooo I was jared butler pleaseee
Really satisified with the Rockets' picks so far. I want them to get Jared Butler from Baylor next but I'm biased.
Ok we got the 25th at least. I wanted Jared Butler at 19 so if we still get him plus the picks in later year I happy
Knicks better take Jared Butler. He's a perfect fit for us
Gimme Jared Butler at 21 babbyyy
Jared butler will be the steal of the draft. Knicks need to take him
Someone draft my guy Jared Butler
Jared Butler was right there
"Kai Jones, Keon Johnson, J.T. Thor, Jaden Springer, Sharieff Cooper, Jared Butler, etc… are all still on the board. We have options"
Knicks if y'all steal Jared Butler from us I swear...
Knicks should take Jared butler. Straight hooper
Watch them take Jared Butler or some shit.
Any chance Jared Butler drops to 19 lol. Not too many teams left that need a PG
"Bold Predictions:  - Jared Butler will be a border line all-star  - Bouknight is a bust  - Bones Hyland, Trey Murphy III, JT Thor, Neemias Queta, Isiah Livers are the 2nd round steals"
Draft Jared Butler
This would be pretty huge for the Lakers  If they can grab Isaiah Jackson or Jared Butler  at 22 it would be amazing for them

"Then don't say nonsense like Jared Butler sounds like a third stringer, all you're doing is showing your foolish ignorance to the world"
Just admit you don't know shit about Jared Butler
Jared Butler is gonna be a star
"Jared Butler is the obvious one. He’s the NCAA tournament MVP and literally better than Davion Mitchell while being 2 years younger.   I hope he’s able to go to a bad (or okay) team so he gets starting minutes off the jump n prove his worth. If he’s able to get minutes, he’s a lock for an all rookie team. I’d love him on the Knicks for example, he could start from day 1"
Wait until Hield underperforms and doesn’t meet the ridiculous expectations set on him by sports media. We’ll enjoy Moses Moody and Jared Butler
"Bro -   A: you think the 22nd pick will be garbage?? This draft is really deep in mid-tier prospects who could have a lot of upside! I've seen guys like Jared Butler, Ziarre Williams, etc mocked there. Sure, not anything we can get Lillard for, but those are the kinds of upside swings which have a chance at producing high-level players that a rebuilding team should be stocking up on. Didn't ya'll just pull Keldon Johnson from that deep two years ago?  B: who, that has real trade assets better than that first + a young-ish player who still has some upside, is going to trade for Derozan this offseason?"
Jared Butler
they don’t have similar physical profiles either tho. jared butler is 6’3 with a 6’4 wingspan and skinny. GTJ is 6’5 with a 6’9 wingspan and pretty well built   i think he’ll go back and forth between playing on and off the ball
jared butler is much more of a point guard-type than GTJ is. he’s going to be a pick and roll ball handler that scores and playmakes off screens. GTJ is primarily a shooter who can attack close outs but not initiate offense. GTJ is also a much more physical defensive player than Butler is   the only real similarity is that they’re both good shooters off the catch
"That’s the impression I got for both of them. It’s not so much that Baylor played better than Gonzaga, they just didn’t belong on the same court. I assumed Butler was older but nah, he’s the same age as guys like Bouknight and only a year older than the top 4 guys.  Here’s some wild perspective  Player A  22.1/6.3/4.4 (pts/ast/reb) 2.6/0.5 (stl/blk)  .524/.416/.780 splits  Player B  22.8/3.9/7.0   1.8/0.9  .438/.400/.846 splits  Player A is Jared Butler.  Player B? Cade fucking Cunningham. And he’s only a year older.  Obviously he’s not as good as Cade, I’m not even suggesting he goes in the lottery. But he had a fantastic season at Butler and there’s every reason to believe it will translate to the NBA"
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6.

I want Franz Wagner and Jared Butler. It might not be worth drafting them with picks 7 and 14  but I love their games.
"Exactly, Mitchell is not the type of player that's hard to find in this year's draft. I'm just hoping Jared Butler or Springer is available at 26."
I’ve been saying it makes no sense why Davion Mitchell is rated higher than Jared Butler. think Butler and Bones Hyland will be the biggest surprises in terms of surprise rookie seasons come next year
We’d have to hope Jared Butler is *really* good
"Jazz got too many old farts on the team that Quin loves to give heavy minutes to. Jared Butler will be a quality back up when old man Conley and his hamstring eventually goes down. Now look to Celtics and watch Juwan Morgan prosper away from Quin sippin on his haterade . As for Terrance Mann, he used up all his juice for one playoff game and will be out of the league in 2 years."
Jared Butler
Y’all would lose Jared Butler 9/10 times in this scenario.
"Jared Butler has looked great, already getting minutes on a contender, defense has really translated too, of the health problems don't end up being a problem that was highway robbery"
He hasn’t had much playing time in the regular season yet but Jared Butler looks to be a steal at pick 40
"Jared Butler was a big star for Baylor. NCAA champion, Final Four MOP, first-team All-American. He played 2 minutes for us last night and got pulled because he was messing up the offense."
Poor Jared Butler hardly gets minutes.
"that’s a wild understatement. in two seasons, a bunch of 2nd rounders are gonna blossom. deuce mcbride, jared butler, sharife, jericho sims, and on and on. it’s only getting started."
But Jared Butler was the MOP for the Final Four…  Either way I’m excited for both guys
Dort couldn’t lock up Jared Butler so it’s all good.
Jared Butler
"Say what you want about the wisdom of the Warriors having so many projects on a team with 33 year old Steph Curry, they do not have a worse young core than the Lakers. And it's kinda weird how they can give someone like Jared Butler credit for maybe being a steal based on preseason but not factor in how Jordan Poole looked in preseason at all and say it's to be determined.  EDIT: Are they claiming that Zubac is a better prospect than Ayton?"
"What in the flying fuck is this list? I get it’s based on WAR, but maybe review it to make sure it’s even worthwhile to write up a list based on WAR before publishing it. The whole thing is BONKERS.   The Warriors, with Wiseman, Poole, Kuminga, and Moody, are at 28, behind teams like Utah who have… Jared Butler? And the Nets who have Nick Claxton.  The Suns, with DeAndre Ayton are low on the list because they have few young players under 25… but they’re just behind the Clippers whose best player is Zubac.   They also have the Philadelphia 76ers whose best young players are Thybulle and Maxey at 15, ahead of teams like Houston, OKC, and a Miami Heat team that still includes Bam as under 25.   Seriously, it’s just… so fucking bad."
"Poor Jared Butler, had an incredible preseason all the last few weeks, then tonight had like, a 1 rebound, 1 assist game with 0 points and got dunked on lmao."
"That's wild. When Klay and Wiseman come back, the Warriors have those lottery picks as their 13th and 14th men until they show out and demand more time. Meanwhile, we (the Jazz) have no injuries to start the season and potentially have Jared Butler, our early second round pick, as our 4th guard, which makes him our 10th man (depending on where he fits around the Oni/Hughes/Paschall/Azubuike group). In some fairness, Butler is already playing quite well, but still, the Warriors roster is deep."
"Jared Butler  1st seed race  If Quin sticks with the Rudy-Conley rotation Gobert could make a run at the single season +/- record, which would be cool"
"I’m not sure it’ll be enough to get to the finals, but we essentially swapped Favors and Niang for Hassan Whiteside and Rudy Gay while also adding Eric Paschall and Jared Butler. I think the changes are a better fit for our roster and what we’re trying to do but we’ll have to see how it plays out obviously. I certainly don’t think the roster is any worse than last year. Almost all of the guys playing significant minutes are back."
"Quin Snyder only rolls with a 9-man rotation. So:  * Conley, Mitchell, O'Neale, Bogdanovic, Gobert * Clarkson, Ingles, Gay, Whiteside  Jared Butler and Eric Paschall will get run when players rest or are hurt (or if Whiteside can't play in Paschall's case)."
Jared Butler becomes the Jimmy Butler pick of the draft
"i disagree. i think he’s already a front runner.    cade, jalen green, scottie barnes, giddey, bouknight, duarte, trey murphy, sengun, jared butler, davion, bones. i don’t see anyone else getting enough minutes to qualify for the discussion. suggs looks like he’s a little more of a project than anticipated."
"Jared Butler (pick 40) - 18 PPG, 1.33 RPG, 4.33 APG on 48.9/33.3/66.7 splits in 3 games/ 24 Min"
Jared Butler was a steal in the draft. I really hope he can become a key player with the organization
Hoping more minutes for Jared Butler
"Mostly the same team this year, so it should be a good time for the most part.  Jared Butler is a fun young rookie."
Jared Butler is a steal.
"Damn I didn't know Jalen Suggs was only averaging 5 lmao, he's gonna be great though. Also wtf Jared Butler??"
"So, you're telling me Jared Butler is gonna lead the league in scoring?"
Jared butler has played well this preseason. Showed off his handles and pretty step back.

Dang Jared Butler is already that good? Glad we got him at 40
So it's an offensive foul when Jared butler pushes off in game 4 of the preseason but not when MJ does it in game 6 of the finals?   /s
I’m buying shares of Jared Butler on Prediction Strike. His stock is only $1.00/share. That’s free money
"If Jared Butler stock was $1.00 a share, how many would you buy?"
Sharife Cooper or Jared Butler probably
Jared Butler
No no no no and Hell NO I’m not letting this shit slide lol  He was brought in to bring in championship culture  and a hard working mindset to the team. Let’s get the first thing out the win that Doc Rivers as a head coach only had 1 more regular season win in his tenure with lob city (57-25) 2013-14 Vinny Del Negro who at the previous season went (56-26)2012-13. The team already showed it could win regular season games the goal was to get over the hump to the WCF at minimum.  Reggie Bullock was hit with injuries so playing him was going to be difficult but Doc never went out of his way to play him.  Some ways through year two and Reggie is gone and thankfully found a lane in the league.  The Eric Bledsoe trade was botched in a few ways considering the hype and trade value Bledsoe had at the time. In hindsight the clippers never deal with Phoenix  and use Caron Butler to get JJ who was a S&amp;T and Butler ended up going to Bucks anyway  weeks later to return home. In the moment I’m still confused why Jared Dudley was a core piece in a Bledsoe trade.   Trading Dudley after 1 Year in a salary dump basically made no since at all. This move began the habit of wasting first round picks to just remove players from the team Doc didn’t like rather that using 1st to create stability on rookie contracts or add legitimate upgrades to the roster.  Jeff Green DID NOT play a big role for the team. Doc hated Lance Stephenson and wanted to play Austin Rivers more minutes (the one young player that was almost out of the league). Jeff Green joined the team and this was peak Mr. Inconsistent but he was a former Celtic so Doc loved him. By the playoffs Jeff Green went from starting 10 of 27 games to being benched and only saw his minutes kick up because Blake and Chris went down. You know what Jeff Green did after the season that we spent a 2019 first own? He left in free agency and another wasted clippers pick.  2018 was about a retool but likely rebuild. Chris Paul we going to leave and was fed up with Doc and issues with Blake. Doc did his best work with a rebuilding situation but even then let egos get in the way of the championship situation HARRELL
"Jared ""Michael Jordan"" Butler"
the only one ive watched at all is jared butler  and he looks pretty good
And maybe Jared Butler can give them some more help off the bench.
"Jared Butler is a VERY nice surprise.  IF he can stay healthy, he's gonna have to get some playing time"
Jared Butler looks like a good role player
"We absolutely refuse to use 2nd round picks, and just keep trading them forward or selling them for cash. We had #33 this draft, and there was a fuck ton of talent left on the board and we traded it for a 2026 2nd and cash. We also waste our two-way spots on random dudes that have basically 0 upside. We could have had Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Jared Butler, the list goes on.  A few years ago we had some 30 yr old unathletic undersized PG with no NBA experience, and wasn't even that good in the GLeague take up a two-way spot for the entire season."
I was hoping he’d fall to 30 so bad. I’m loving Jared butler but I was wanting bones for a long time
Jared Butler
"Jared Butler had a heart condition, that was more of a reason for his drop lol"
"I already said it before, but JARED BUTLER is the steal of the draft.  Only reason he got picked at 40 was due to his heart condition.   He's got no weakness skill-wise. The only thing you can knock him on is his average physical attributes."
Jared Butler will be better than Davion Mitchell

"Fun game.  Still can't believe we got Jared Butler at 40, dude plays like he's been here."
anyone got a replay of that Jared Butler dime?
is jared butler the goat?
That’s a weird way to spell Jared Butler from my Utah Jazz.
"I’m hype for my Spurs but goddamn I’m so happy for Jared Butler. I don’t think people know how good that guy is, but he’s the real fucking deal."
"i'm really hoping this will turn into, ""Drafted Jared Butler"""
"lmao you're so mad.  Why go out of your way to make the post if you weren't mad about it?  Or are you going to be like ""I wasn't mad, I was annoyed!""  Whatever, you made a big deal out of nothing, and now you're scrambling to justify it.  And you're definitely wrong about your point.  Lots of non-Jazz fans interacted positively with this post.  Jared Butler was a highly touted prospect who didn't get to play in Summer League, and this was our first look at him playing with NBA players, even if it is during a basic scrimmage.  Honestly, the only reason I'm still replying right now is because you seem like a dude who hates being wrong, and you're doing everything in your power to not look wrong, and I think that's funny."
Cam and Jared Butler are the 2 steals in the draft
"Obviously this is speculative based on the fact that two of these guys are new and it's contingent on a rookie cracking the rotation, but i'm really looking forward to a Butler / Conley / Ingles / Gay / Gobert lineup.  Three premier pnr play makers, lots of shooting, similar to our bench lineups from last year and gives Jared Butler a lot of opportunities to play on and off ball and learn to play off of other play making guards in the Jazz system so he doesn't step on Mitchell's feet too much or take the ball out of his hands until they both develop some chemistry / a two man game.  I'm super high on Butler and reports out of training camp make it seem like the Jazz are *super* high on him, plus he was a pretty solid lottery or almost lottery candidate before his health issues, so i'm really excited to watch him play."
"Rudy gay, Hassan Whiteside, Jordan Clarkson, Jared Butler, Joe Ingles. Oh wait. That's the Jazz's 2nd team... Damn we're deep"
My favourite player comps are the elusive black draft prospect being compared to a famous white player. Like Jared Butler getting the Dragic comp
"I agree, not much sense forbthr Jazz, they even just got Jared Butler which I love!  Chet, or even Paolo or Jabari, who I personally prefer because of fit!!! As I said exactly, we have a shot at high ranked big men next draft so I would rather draft them!"
"I wanted the Jazz to draft Herb Jones real bad once I saw someone suggest him in a mock draft at our original draft spot (before we traded back). I'm iffy on Jared Butler (mostly for team fit reasons, because we already have Mitchell and Clarkson who are kind of similar in role and size) and having Herb Jones would have been such a luxury for our team. Imagine having a lineup of Conley, Mitchell, O'Neale, Herb Jones, and Gobert and we can swap either Conley/Mitchell out for Ingles if we need more size (like during Conley/Gobert bench lineups). Still a potent offense, but also pretty lockdown too. And we knew he'd be a great defender coming out of college!"
"He was really bad at Kentucky in a lot of ways, but no-one thought he drop *that* far. This was a really weird draft in that respect, when guys dropped they *really* dropped.  Jared Butler, Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Keon Johnson, Cam Thomas all absolutely dropped and managed to find themselves of high caliber playoff teams which is pretty wild considering their talent level. If they went lottery/top 10 in another (weaker) draft it wouldn't have surprised me."
"This already exists. Fitness to play panel. Jared Butler went through one. One NBA doctor, one NBPA doctor, one recommended by those two doctors.   AFAIK Simmons hasn't 'officially' said that he couldn't play, he's just holding out with PR."
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."

"nah, i was thinking of this guy, he got drafted at #40 by utah  https://www.si.com/nba/2021/07/17/jared-butler-cleared-fitness-to-play-panel-nba-draft  looks like he only gets to play in garbage time, though  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4395695/jared-butler  but i think they've sent him to the gleague, too"
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
I thought it was gonna be Hassan whiteside and I’m surprised to say if I have to pick one it’s Jared Butler so far (who I also give a very long leash for being a rookie trying to figure it out)
Why Jared Butler is not your Backup PG? He looked great against us in the preseason .
"Jazz added a bunch of pieces and I think Jared Butler has the talent to become a legit 2-way backup. Basically swapped Niang and an underperforming Faves (2 worst playoff performers) for Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Whiteside who's filling his role very well."
"Jazz injury report:  Donovan Mitchell,  Royce O'Neale  Hassan Whiteside  Rudy Gay  Jared butler   :/ feelsbadman"
"think of all the players who haven’t seen much action: cade, bouknight, kuminga, cam, deuce, sharife, jared butler, quentin grimes, primo, moody, jalen johnson.   some of those guys are gonna be big contributors in 2 seasons."
Hoping that UTA's Jared Butler can make the top 30 at some point
"whiteside lookin nice, hope he keeps the effort all season. stoked to see rudy gay come back and see what he brings. eric paschall is been pretty decent in his minutes also, seems like he has more intensity on the defensive end than what i saw from him on the warriors.  jared butler is in his own head right now i think, he has potential and looked like he'd be nba ready. by mid season i could see him finally showing his true potential and be a key rotation for the rest of the regular season to keep conley rested"
"For sure.   Jared Butler is looking interesting though, the Jazz are already setting him up to be the packup PG."
Jared Butler would be if he wasn’t behind so many guards on the Jazz. He looked so good in the preseason
"EP brings something the Jazz last year didnt had, they could adress a backup veteran PG, cause Jared Butler looks raw yet and he'll develop through the season, don't know if it's possible though, just a thought I had"
Jared Butler and Davion Mitchell is proof that there is a parallel universe
"So? A player is wide open every single time and you can double someone on defense every single time.  We are talking about the best college team vs the worst NBA team (which probably also has bad chemistry). The talent difference isn’t as big as you think it is. Team USA has gotten beat by teams in France, Australia, and Nigeria who are clearly way less talented in 5 v 5. And here I’m talking about OKC without Shai…and the college team here has 6 players vs 5 on the Thunder.   You also do realize the Thunder without Shai were playing guys who besides Lu Dort are ALL worse than Davion Mitchell and possibly Jared Butler too  right? Maybe Poku has some upside, but Davion Mitchell could literally already be better than every single Thunder player who was playing at the end of the season except Dort. Just look at the names and ages on that Thunder team at the end of the season…  I feel like literally everyone who always says the NBA team can beat the college team (5 v 6) never played basketball before. Anyone who’s played basketball and ran any sort of 5 v 4 drills or 3 v 2 drills (where you have 1 fewer player on defense) would tell you how much easier it is to score when you have 1 extra player. The whole point of that drill is for the defensive players to suffer since they can’t move on until they get a stop."
"Last year definitely looks to be a great draft class, but I think the overall level of players in this years draft is better than last years. You have players like Tre Mann, Ziaire Williams, and Jared Butler mocked in the twenties right now. I guess we'll find out in a couple of years."
