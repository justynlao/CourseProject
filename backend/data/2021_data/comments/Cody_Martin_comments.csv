Cody Martin
"I wanna say caleb and cody martin, but i refuse to believe anyone outside our team knows who these bums are"
"Congratulations, you're now a mod on r/CharlotteHornets!   None of us understood it, it was very frustrating. Last season Cody Martin showed some promise as a hustle/defense guy, but he's been awful this season. And Caleb has mostly just been awful. I can appreciate the hustle they bring to the locker room or something, but they're so offensively limited that it completely offsets. Part of the reason we gave up a big run at the start of the 4th was because of Caleb's presence on the floor."
because borrego didn't play him for the first 17 games for caleb and cody martin for god knows why. 99% of hornets fans wanted him to absorb all their minutes.
We all knew Monk was a microwave player. The question is why the hell this was coming off the bench behind Cody Martin
You mean Cody Zeller and Caleb Martin?   I‚Äôm in!!
Add the Cody and Caleb Martin for max confusion  Would that team win the championship thru gamebreaking exploits?
"I agree he was making lazy passes yesterday maybe some arguably because Cody zeller was in his first game back and had no chemistry with him but like I said it‚Äôs not even benching melo alone, it‚Äôs giving all his minutes to a player who shouldn‚Äôt even be getting significant minutes on any team. Caleb Martin literally checked in at 4:53 in the 3rd and checked out at 3:18 in the 4th. He played for over 13 minutes straight as a hustle player who provides almost nothing offensively or defensively."
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin.
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
Cody Martin is a competent defender and facilitator. They both need to work on their confidence.   They have to physical tools to be very good.
The Martin twins on the hornets do not need to be in the league. They don‚Äôt take good shots nor do they add any value on the court. I mean Cody Martin just got beat off the dribble by JJ Reddick.  JJ Reddick just blew by Cody. JJ Reddick. These two idiots are just bad at basketball!!!
With all due respect nobody cares about caleb and cody martin üòÇ

"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
"So like, if any player, from Lebron to Cody Martin, scores a 30 point game, we are generally satisfied and even impressed with nothing to complain about. Steph scored twice that tonight. Am I the only one amazed by that?"
After Cody martin*.
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
And CODY MARTIN
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin?
Cody Martin got mauled like twice and nothing. Wiggins got an FT for PJ being near him. Oubre the same.
"1 on 1, but it scrubs vs former MVPs  Like Cody Martin vs Micheal Jordan  Or Alex Len vs Shaq  Or Dennis smith jr vs Steve nash"
"LaMelo Ball / Cody Martin / Caleb Martin / Jalen McDaniels / Bismack Biyombo  It's our own death, but still"
GIVE ME CODY MARTIN. HE‚ÄôLL BE A STARTER HERE
"You can't compare Caleb to Cody Martin, they're completely different players and even wear different colored shoes so you can tell them apart. /s"
tbf I saw the Martin twins play for the Swarm last year and McDaniels and Cody both would put up like 30 a night with ease
"somehow this is the only way i used to be able to tell the Martin twins apart aside from their jersey numbers, then Cody got a big tat on his arm. Apparently their hair is a little different but you can't really tell on the court."
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
"Right those guys you listed are helped tremendously, guys like Kuzma, Cody Martin, Pat Connaughton, Lonzo Ball, and etc would get less. Maxes help the players which is why PA votes for them, no maxes hurt them. I wasn‚Äôt arguing with OP just agreeing with him with more info"

"ehhh, I don't know about that. I was thinking:     Cody Martin + 2nd rounder for LeBron  Caleb Martin + 2nd rounder for Steph"
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin.
"Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, Kelan Martin, KJ Martin, Martin Lawrence"
Our coach staff confused Cody Zeller with Cody Martin and Cody Martin with Caleb Martin.  Our entire game plan got thrown out the window.
Cody Martin*
It was actually Caleb Martin who got drafted in the second round. Cody was an undrafted FA
"Lamelo Ball has generational vision and playmaking, throw him 2 of the greatest off ball players who can ignite for 50 when they want too along with a great scorer in Lamelo and it doesn‚Äôt get better. Lamelo also fits the shooting the warriors love and his passing is infectious. Adding him to this offense would be too perfect. Especially considering the warriors are wasting a year of prime Curry with klay out. Defensively you do an ‚Äúon‚Äù ‚Äúoff‚Äù in crunch time, like how the hornets do with Cody Martin and lamelo. Warriors whiffed the pick"
Cody and Caleb Martin
"Hmm.  - Bridges was a good pick in the business sense, since we got two extra second-rounders which were then packaged in another deal... to move back all of one spot. It's blurrier in the basketball sense, since in the long run that trade helped lay the groundwork for Paul George to LA. We sort of facilitated the Clips getting their guy in SGA, and SGA is really good.  I suppose the final judgement is going to come down to how much you as an observer hate things working out for the Clippers.  - PJ has been more of a good pick than an amazing one.  - LaMelo, well, yeah.  - Graham, well, yeah. Anytime you get an actual NBA player out of the second round.   - I'd quibble a bit with the description of Cody Martin as 'good'. Longterm for second rounders I'll be rather more interested in Jalen McDaniels or one of the bigs we drafted this past draft.  - People had jokes about the Terry contract, and it did take a while for Terry to actually start being good on the regular. His raw numbers were definitely masking a guy with a legitimately lethal jumper, and part of why he's been so improved is cutting back on the things he's not so hot at (in addition to simply getting better at some of them). Likewise jokes about Heyward, but signing a guy with All-Star type of talent to Charlotte is generally going to require a lot of money."
"&gt;Cody Martin, good player  Lol"
"Tbh Cody Martin has shown more than McDaniels at this point. Not saying he is better or will be better, but as it stands now.."
How do they mention Cody Martin but not Jalen McDaniels?
Cody/Caleb Martin in shambles
"want to go on tour with my hardcore band Dynamic Rot, named by anagramming Cody Martin?"
"Fuck the salary cap, we're trading Cody Martin for all three of them.   Kemba/LaMelo/Hayward/Simmons/Zingbat   Graham/Rozier/Monk/Bridges/Washington"
Cody Martin and Biz.
"Yea dawg theres an insane amount of context there though. That only became true because of our end of year skid where Bridges got Covid, Graham had a hamstring injury, PJ had a knee injury, Rozier hurt his wrist, Hayward was out, Cody Martin was out, Monk was out.  Wolves fans just love to use random bullet point arguments and ignore that Edwards was the most negatively impacful player in the nba for like 2 months."
"We were the 4th seed when he got hurt lol.   Those stats are also pretty skewed because  when he came back Miles got Covid, Hayward was out, Cody Martin was out, PJ  missed games, Graham missed games and he was left with a pretty awful roster and playing through a healing wrist that he said didnt have all his flexibility."
Caleb and Cody Martin please
"Hornets protect:  Ball, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, Monk (RFA rights), Graham (RFA rights), McDaniels, Hayward*  Hornets leave unprotected:  Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin  UFAs unable to be claimed:  Biyombo, Zeller, Wanamaker, Riller, Darling  --  * I would honestly consider leaving Hayward unprotected- I really don't think an expansion team would want him taking up so much cap room given they operate under a reduced cap for the first couple years, it would be incredibly restrictive. But I do think that Hayward does have some amount of trade value,  so we shouldn't risk it just to save Vernon Carey, who would definitely get snatched up by an expansion team."
don‚Äôt forget the co mvp season from Caleb and Cody Martin
If the hornets had to pick Caleb Martin or Cody Martin who would they choose
the sight of Cody Martin attempting to take anybody off the dribble  the sight of Caleb Martin being on the court  literally every time Gordon Hayward falls down  honorable mention- those god damn Biyombo floaters....
Caleb and Cody Martin are also brothers but they're not better than anyone here
"""You're just lucky I don't play the Martin twins, Zach and Cody, 48mpg each. That would be the sweet life.""  -Borrego"
We're only missing Hayward and Cody Martin at this point  But the way we choke away games is a whole other issue
stat looks busted.  no analytic worth its' salt can argue Cody Martin is more impactful than LaMelo Ball
"He took a little bit of getting used to, especially coming off Steve Martin who was the classic PBP guy.   But after his first season, he really grew on me. He genuinely seems excited when things happen. His dynamic with Dell Curry is also great - Dell is a fantastic straight man to EC‚Äôs enthusiasm.   The pair also does a great job being fans of the Hornets while not being homers - a couple games ago, Cody Zeller took an elbow to the face that resulted in 5 stitches in his mouth. A lot of announcing teams would have been FLAGRANT TWO THROW HIM OUT but EC and DC were like ‚Äúnope, basketball play, keep it moving‚Äù.   Also, EC (and I‚Äôm sure his producers) most underrated thing: he will find some random historical facts related to somebody on the opposing team and how it relates to the hornets/Charlotte/NC and they are almost always fascinating. It‚Äôs usually random stuff like ‚Äúso and so is the 5th leading scorer in North Carolina high school history‚Äù and then he will quiz Dell on the top 4.   It‚Äôs great."

"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
"Randle to Rose to RJ in the corner is fun to see, gotta feel good for RJ to be that trusted. And what a hilariously optimistic contest by Cody Martin, jumping at RJ from about 10 feet away."
Fun fact: Cody Martin and his twin brother lived in a high class Hilton-esq. hotel during their middle school years and on a boat school during their high school years
[https://streamable.com/64e9s8](https://streamable.com/64e9s8)  Cody Martin Dunk on CJ McCollum
"In case you were wondering, the 5 players drafted in 2019 were; Cody Martin (CHA), Terance Mann (LAC), Justin Wright-Foreman (UTH), Marial Shayok (PHI), and Dewan Hernandez (TOR)."
"This is pretty misleading.    The three second rounders were Grant Riller (PG), Vernon Carey Jr (C) and Nick Richards (C)   Riller has barely played any minutes and as one of the last picks in the draft he is likely very raw.  Graham, Rozier, Monk, Wanamaker and a Martin in front of him makes sense if the team is trying to be competitive. If it's garbage time the HC has gone with two-way player Nate Darling, whom I would assume is closer to being ready for minutes than Riller is.    The Martin problem: Cody Martin has been a decent bench guy throughout the season and has no reason to be replaced by Riller or Darling at any competitive moment of basketball.  There was an in-depth writeup on this on /r/CharlotteHornets the other day.    Caleb Martin, the UDFA Martin, is quite raw but has shown flashes.  He just came off a 15-10-3 game against the Lakers, one of the best teams in the NBA.  I could still see Caleb being significantly better than Darling/Riller at any competitive stages of basketball.    Bismack Biyombo may have stone hands but he is the only defensive player and true rim protector  the team has in the front court. If there's anyone on the roster that even has a chance to attempt to slow down the other team's best bigs it's going to be Biyombo.  Throwing out Vernon Carey (who I really believe in) or Nick Richards at this point will get them eaten alive on the defensive end in the paint, while still allowing the shooters to drop buckets from 3 as we've seen all season.    I do think we will see some of these players in the closing weeks, and really there is no point not to because the Hornets players are dropping fast, but to say that there's no reason why these second rounders haven't played is just inaccurate."
"Caruso came off the bench. We had McDaniels and Caleb Martin starting, who are recent G-Leaguers, and Biz who regularly gets DNPs now. Off the bench we had two more G-Leaguers playing significant minutes in Cody Martin and Wannamaker, who the Warriors paid us to take."

"You can't fault the metric for small sample size with Gay.  MCW, Dieng, WCS, and Cody Martin are all very good defenders in small roles such that they can go out while many superior defenders have to pace themselves for big minutes.  So if anything, that's a credit to RAPTOR!  [Set the minutes threshold to 1500 minutes](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) and the list looks fine except for Neto at 20."
"Using RAPTOR, which is a terribly flawed metric (also he was [3rd](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)). The same metric ranked MCW 14th and Rudy Gay 15th (depending on what you set the minutes minimum to). And last year it had Dieng 2nd, WCS 4th, and Cody Martin 6th."

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Caleb Martin maybe Cody Martin
Did Caleb Martin switch seats on the bench with Cody Martin? (2021 article)
"Obviously biased but the Hornets. Most of our young guys will get better (LaMelo, Bridges, Washington) and our depth has improved (Oubre over Cody Martin, Kai Jones over Biyombo, Bouknight over Monk). Hornets were a 4th seed until injuries derailed the whole season last year. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a top 4 seed but I think it‚Äôs realistic to say that they can grab the 5 or 6 seed at best."
"well it's gonna take like 5 players getting hot for any game to be close, so I had to pick a couple of ""not that bad"" players. Was gonna put Dwayne Bacon in there instead of either him or Cody Martin"
"Unpopular opinion: Hornets need to waive Cody Martin and pick up Gelo, and also trade Rozier to the Bulls for Lonzo Ball. Having all three of the Ball bros will definitely put bums in seats in what is not a well known or famous franchise. The Ball bros also know each others play styles so well and cover each others weaknesses so it'll be prime Chino Hills run and gun offence."
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
Cody Martin for finals MVP.
We have Cody Martin and his contract is guaranteed.   Our roster is full.
"""What we need to do is fire Cody Martin into the sun, and..."""
"He isn't.  There's this huge base of hornets fans that have seen Caleb Martin play and just put it onto his brother as well. Cody is actually a really solid defensive player, definitely worth a 9th or 10th spot on the bench. His perimeter defense is above average and he's known as the guy on the roster that dives for every single lose ball and puts crazy effort into every possession. Yes his brother sucks and yes he isn't the best on offense but for certain games, certain matchups, he's certainly playable.  I'd compare him to MCW without the high draft status which, if people were honest, is certainly a quality 9th or 10th man.   /rant"
&gt; What we need to do is fire Cody Martin into the sun   I get the feeling that this would have been your response even if Gelo was bad
He could be a Caleb/Cody Martin replacement right? Just hustle on D and hit a couple of 3s each game.
"What we need to do is fire Cody Martin into the sun and sign this man ASAP. The way he‚Äôs been shooting in summer league Gelo could easily replicate (and probably improve upon) Martin‚Äôs production off the bench. The benefits of having him on the roster far outweigh the downsides, and being Melo‚Äôs brother he‚Äôd be an instant fit both on the court and in the locker room. There is absolutely zero reason for us to keep Gelo off the roster at this point IMO."
Yeah I think Gelo is a legitimately solid shooter  I'm not sure what Cody Martin is solid or decent at lol
Honestly this guy is probably better than Cody Martin so why not let him on the squad
"Ball Rozier Hayward Bridges Plumlee  Ish Bouk Oubre PJ and then one of Cody Martin, McDaniels, Kai Jones"
"Edit, some of these only have 2 brothers but still cool: Or the McDaniels, the Zellers, Morrises, the Martins, Curry's, the late gasols, Rush's ect..  I challenge anyone to find more nba siblings on a roster than the hornets past two years  Last year 20-21 5 siblings : Cody, LaMelo, both martin twins, Jalen McDaniel  5 again 21-22: This year we lost Zeller and a martin but gained a plumlee and possibly liangelo"
"Once again, Charlotte literally had Cody and Caleb Martin, IDENTICAL TWINS, on their roster last year. Both nameplates were simply ‚ÄúMartin‚Äù."
"Don't you mean Caleb Martin? Cody was starting for you guys at the end of the year, while due to injury he does play his role well. Good defender.  Caleb doesn't play as much so I've assumed he is worse."
Let‚Äôs not pretend that Cody Martin can‚Äôt absolutely YAM the ball as well.
I'd rather have gelo than cody martin
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
"Those of you who think this is a bad move for us clearly have never watched the likes of:  Caleb Martin Cody Martin Marco Bellini MKG after the injuries Old ass Corey Maggette Adonal Foyal Lance Stephenson shooting 17% from 3 for a season.  Or whoever else we throw out when Hayward gets hurt, and Miles gets covid, and LaMelo is hurt, and PJ gets hurt, all at the same time.   We need legit depth on the wings."
"Even if he's buns we don't have a contract in his range so it's somewhat tradeable especially on the length  If anything he's better than Cody Martin, even though I probably would have rather just kept Cody and not got Oubre since Cody's deal is expiring antyway"
" I mean Cody Martin is a very good defender not gonna lie, but he doesn't have the shooting, ball handling and passing that Batum has, that's why he didn't play a lot last year"
After what happened with Batum I already know that Cody Martin would become the perfect 8 PPG roleplayer on the Warriors while playing clamps defense and making clutch blocks and steals to secure games in a WCF run. He'd probably shoot 40% from 3 and average 4 assists too.
"What makes his trades/FA moves uninspiring to you? I think he's been quite savvy.   I know we don't usually land the ""sexiest"" names, and we never will, but for us to even get Hayward (and him *wanting* to be here) is a huge positive for us, durability issues aside.   It's not like Mitch has overpaid for a Diop-contract, or Nic Batum. He's done a very solid job with our cap space, and he's gotten us legit trade chip assets.   Losing Monk and Devonte is tough, but Bouknight's potential + Oubre + NOs 1st + Ish Smith is an upgrade all around. And that's all we need right now, as opposed to pushing all in and capping ourselves out (like the Al Jefferson years).   We have flexibility down the roster now, so when Hayward gets hurt, we aren't relying on Cody Martin to fill in for him."
"Lol. No fkin‚Äô way. You have the worst center rotation in the league at Cody and Biyombo. You had to play Caleb Martin significant minutes. Graham was also trash all season.  If ya‚Äôll get Markknen, this may be your best roster in a long time."
"He didn‚Äôt play much because James Borrego has some of the worst rotations at any level of the sport, 3v3 pickup games included. There was no world where Caleb and Cody Martin deserved the minutes they got."
"CHA already does have Cody &amp; Caleb Martin ,  and Cody Zeller.  If they get Zo and sign Tyler Zeller as the 21st man off the bench they could have a record"
"Yes we have? Since Borrego became head coach and Mitch became GM we have drafted and developed: Bridges, PJ, Devonte', LaMelo. Malik got better, Cody Martin has had some stretches better than what he should be capable of. We haven't really missed in the draft/development side since we got this staff in. Idk why you're including the prior years considering there is no remaining staff from that time."
TJ warren is good. Dennis Smith JR is bad. Cody and Caleb Martin are okay.   All the other guys that made it didn't last more than a few games or a summer League or something.
"Cody martin is an decent bench perimeter defender, caleb martin is completely useless"
We also did a nepotism for Cody Martin's trash twin brother right after we drafted him in the 2nd round so it's not like there isn't a precedent. All Liangelo has to do is not be worse than Caleb Martin to get on the main roster
"Hornets protect LaMelo, Bridges, Washington, Hayward, Rozier, McDaniels, and the RFA rights on Graham and Monk. That means one of Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin is available to be selected. I don't like parting with Carey but ours is a pretty easy top 8."
Hey hey only we can make jokes about Gordon being fragile. Plus we upgraded our reserve so when he does go down he won‚Äôt be replaced in the lineup with Cody Martin lol
Yeah but where‚Äôs Cody Martin?
Cody Martin  Caleb Martin  Caleb Martin  Caleb Martin  Cody Martin  Caleb Martin
"He had his chances, and did nothing. We worship the savior Cody Martin now.  Edit: JFC, I can‚Äôt even imagine myself typing that like 2 years ago... what in the fuck is this timeline."
Cody Martin MVP campaign starting right here
Nope just Cody Martin is actually playing... well... so no need for him yet
I don't know man. Hornets don't win another game without Cody Martin.
"Would've said Cody Martin, but he's been a pleasant surprise this year.  Probably have to go with Thanasis"
cody martin looks more like evan fournier than evan fournier
Ish smith and Cody Martin ran the 4th quarter
Cody Martin is looking like he‚Äôs taking such a huuuuge leap! Like legit NBA starting calibre!
I may be a little biased but I fucking love this Hornets team. Cody Martin is even doing well. Cody. Martin. Lamelo is incredible. My hopes have never been higher. We may even make it to the playoffs. Fuck man we could potentially wait until the 2nd round to get swept.
It‚Äôd be worse if the Nets won a game because of Ish Smith and Cody Martin.
Led by Charlotte‚Äôs finest: Ish Smith and Cody Martin
That's due to the Hornets shut down defense led by Cody Martin
Cody Martin draining a step back 3 over KD washed away all my pain from the Panthers game. That was fucking cathartic.
nah bruh you just not seeing the vision  lamelo=KD Miles bridges=Westbrook  Cody Martin/Ish Smith= Harden
START CODY MARTIN
Finally a worthy sidekick for Cody Martin.
"Well yeah, they drafted Cody Martin. Are we surprised he led the team to this record?"
"That‚Äôs Cody ‚ÄúBen ‚ÄúGary Payton‚Äù Wallace‚Äù Martin to you, pal."
All the Ish love is warranted but what about Cody Martin? Dude looked like nothing but a 15th man first few seasons and is fuckin crushing it right now.  That 3 in KD‚Äôs face and the back to back charges drawn from Harden‚Ä¶Jesus fuck
Give Cody Martin the BAG üò§üò§üò§
Cody Martin ballin. Very unexpected but I‚Äôm here for it
Ish Smith and Cody Martin
MIP is going to Cody Martin
Cody Martin legit had an out-of-body experience in the 4th
"In fairness he has had to face Cody ""GOAT Defender"" Martin drawing tons of charges today"
*Cody Martin üòÇ
"""Trade me to charlotte where I can have some real teammates like ish smith and cody martin"""
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
"every time he had the ball I just assumed he would score, he was lights out today   unfortunately for him, harden got shut down by cody martin"
"and cody ""the clampmonster"" martin"
"He didn‚Äôt need to. Ish Smith and Cody Martin were playing darn well, and we have a back to back tomorrow"
"Lamelo playing ZERO MINUTES in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well Ish Smith and Cody Martin played tonight.  That sequence Cody Martin had where he generated 2 charges and hit all his shots pretty much ended the game too.  Miles Bridges scoring 32 after dropping 30 last game, sheesh we got a good one."
"That second half by Charlotte was great. They had the younger, more spry legs and played their butts off, especially Cody Martin. Great win and apparently this is the first time ever that Charlotte has started off 3-0. You love to see it."
"Lamelo playing ZERO MINUTES in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well Ish Smith and Cody Martin played tonight.  That sequence Cody Martin had where he generated 2 charges and hit all his shots pretty much ended the game too.  Miles Bridges scoring 32 after dropping 30 last game, sheesh we got a good one."
The Hornets star PG and forward just took over  ^^^Ish ^^^Smith ^^^and ^^^Cody ^^^Martin
"You get shredded that bad by Ish Smith and Cody Martin, I'd throw it in too."
Ish smith and Cody Martin&gt; KD and Harden
Cody Martin and Ish Smith &gt; James Harden
I really hope Nets fans never forget when Cody Martin hit an iso stepback 3 on KD to ice the game. Or when he drew two consecutive charges to get Harden out of the game.   Our two leading scorers in this game didn't even touch the floor in the 4th quarter lmao.
the nets really just lost a game because of ish smith and cody martin
"Cody Martin and Ish Smith carrying the Hornets to victory over the Nets, just as everyone predicted"
"I cannot believe in a game featuring KD and James harden, ish smith and cody Martin took over down the stretch."
Ish Smith Cody Martin and Miles Bridges the new Big 3
is Cody Martin the greatest player ever?
I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ Cody Martin?!
Cody Martin sizing up KD and swishing an ISO 3 is the most disrespectful thing Ive seen in a while
"KD is good, but he‚Äôs no Ish Smith or Cody Martin"
Imagine being a championship contender with 2 top 75 all time players and losing a 4th quarter to Ish Smith and Cody Martin
Not Brooklyn getting killed by Ish Smith and Cody Martin lmao Kyrie save them please
Where were you when Ish Smith and Cody Martin turned into Jordan and Pippen
&gt;Cody Martin has been surprisingly competent this season.  Was he bad last year?
wtf i love cody martin?
Damn all this talk about LaMelo and Bridges but it turns out Cody Martin was the franchise player the whole time
Cody Martin living in Harden's head rent free
Cody Martin has been surprisingly competent this season. To the point that I‚Äôm not even upset that Bouknight hasn‚Äôt gotten playing time yet.
"Cody Martin and Ish Smith are physically unable to produce offense.  PLAY THE FUCKING GUY YOU PICKED IN THE LOTTERY A FEW MONTHS AGO.  You‚Äôre the fucking Hornets. This isn‚Äôt like you‚Äôre the nets/lakers/bucks where you need to win every game because championship is the goal.  Develop your fucking lotto pick holy shit. You drafted him to handle, pass, and shoot. Let him do it!!!"
"Cody Martin has been surprisingly good and excels at defense, which is a big weakness for our team"
They're playing Oubre and Cody Martin over him. He's played one minute of garbage time all season.
Because Cody Martin FUCKS
"cody didn't even have a bad year last year, he just wasn't as good on defense as he was in his rookie season. our fanbase called him clamps martin for a reason"
"&gt;Cody Martin with two positive games in a row!   When i saw that he made roster i was laughing my ass off but he's played well, looked like an actual NBA player  After last season 100% thought he was gone"
That run where the Cavs were being careless af with the ball and we got 5 straight steals was hilarious   Cody Martin with two positive games in a row!
"That one minute of absolute swarming defence by Charlotte was amazing and helped the Hornets run away with this game.  (A 15-0 run in 2:14 at one stage)  - 9:47 left, Mason Plumlee steals, Cody Martin scores a 2.   - 9:19 left, LaMelo Ball steals, Gordon Hayward scores 2.   - 9:11 left, LaMelo Ball steals, Cody Martin scores a 2.   - 8:44 left,  LaMelo Ball steals, Gordon Hayward scores a 3"
Cody Martin looks like an actual NBA player u can't make this shit up
What pisses me off the most is that Cody Martin gets playing time over most of our young guys. Dudes straight up trash.
This Cody Martin guy is buns eh?
who do you think is a dark horse candidate for the rick bonnell? I think cody martin could pull the upset
"Nick Richards, Cody Martin, and Vernon Carey won roster spots over him, so draw your own conclusions."

"I've met a few before they were NBA players or after they had retired. Never met a current NBA player.  I met Kyrie when he came to my highschool while he was at Duke. Honestly don't know why he was there. He wasn't insane yet at this point. He was chill.  I met Dennis Smith JR, TJ Warren, Lorenzo brown (in and out the league), and Omer Yurtseven, Caleb and Cody Martin all at NC State when I was a student there. All were chill. Dennis Smith thought he was god on campus though lmao.   I met Sidney Lowe at a basketball camp NC State held when he was the coach when I was a kid. All I remember is he had monster size hands.   I think that's everyone."
Caleb Martin for Cody Martin
"I'm mildly worried about Vernon Carey not making the roster, he's hardly played in the preseason while bum ass Nick Richards plays.  I think I'd rather have an empty roster spot over Nick Richards or Wes Iwundu... maybe Cody Martin too, but I'm indifferent on him.   As long as our roster includes:   Ball/Smith   Rozier/Bouk   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels     Miles/PJ/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones  I don't really care who the end of the bench guys are."
"Missing a couple picks in the second round should be considered the norm, not the exception.   The fact Mitch has hit on Graham and McDaniels in the second round is frankly pretty impressive. Even Cody Martin is better than your average second round player. Personally, I‚Äôm really high on Thor too."

This is tough but   Shelvin Mack Caleb Martin Cody Martin Johnny O‚ÄôBryant  Miles Plumlee   It‚Äôd be some really awful ball lol
now switch Harden and KD with Cody Martin and Nick Richards
"Cody Martin has been a guard as of late, centers and rim protectors definitely not tho"
Ah your too kind but our defence was terrible tonight. We didn‚Äôt have Cody Martin who usually just clamps the best player
The refs tried their best to ruin the game for both fans smh    Also screw Zach lavine for going up for a dunk while up 14 with less than a minute left and it‚Äôs clear the game is dead. I am glad Kelly went up and clattered him. Shit play  Also Cody Martin please come back
"We really don't dislike anyone except Mason Plumlee, but I'm sure people could realize that.  On the opposite hand, we despised Cody Martin last year but he has grown so much and is an invaluble defensive anchor for our team. Went from the fanbase cringing when he went to scorer's table to us now feeling nervous when he's not on the floor in close games."
I think this front office is really trying to win a chip through good drafting tbh. I think there could possibly be a good trade for both teams somewhere where myles ends up in Charlotte but I honestly think that Mitch Kupchak wants one of our young guys to develop this year/ throughout the next few years and hope that works out. That‚Äôs just the way it seems to me. the reason we‚Äôre doing so well this year is largely because we have a couple guys coming off the bench that have taken really big leaps like cody martin and jalen mcdaniels who are now becoming genuinely great role players and for some reason it feels to me like the organization really just wants to keep running with the team we have now. idk maybe i‚Äôm crazy that‚Äôs just my theory on it
"Draft pundits were high on MKG (as high as people can be on any of the clearly inferior players taken after consensus #1 Davis). NBA-ready physically and already a ""pro-level"" defender. Easy to pan the pick now but that was at the time when people thought you could develop someone's shot (influenced by Kawhi's ""improvement"" from the previous draft).  Forgot Cody Zeller? Biyombo is high upside? I guess those two and Frank are good picks for a 90's team. I don't mind the Vonleh and Monk picks (there were better players taken after but no obvious higher upside prospect around that pick). I'm not saying they'd surely be better off now with that approach - after all, they'd have ended up with MPJ instead of Miles (and worse off) if they followed that. But I think that's your approach when you have a team that sucks, have no franchise player (no, Kemba wasn't one), and are missing on these ""safe picks"" anyway.  You're right about the picks having improved under Mitch. And developing low picks so you can trade them for value (Graham) or they play quality minutes (Martin) now means you can bring along the likes of Bouknight at a reasonable pace."
Only if warriors fans randomly decide to trash him again. He‚Äôs been pretty consistently average off the hornets bench this season. Solid defense and decent pint production. He has had maybe 1-2 bad games this season but the rest have been nothing the complain about. Him and Cody Martin provide a energetic spark off the bench for us right now
Kelly Oubre is good and Cody Martin
Cody Martin
EXTEND CODY MARTIN YOU COWARDS
cody martin god dam
Very interesting to see how close some brothers are on this graph -Jaden and Jalen McDaniels and Cody and Caleb Martin.
"Same here, any playoff run is icing on the cake, but just being able to see this team develop and go off is so exciting to watch. Melo lobs to bridges, tsunami going off at the 3, hell even Cody Martin doing his thing is so exciting to watch."
Gordon  Terry  LaMelo  Miles  PJ  Cody Martin  Bouknight  Kai   Honorable mentions to Jalen McDaniels and Nick Richards
He's no Cody Martin
"Basically ever since Kupchak came in the Hornets have rarely made a wrong move:  * Hired Borrego, who's done a great job of cultivating a strong culture and atmosphere around the team, and has helped develop a lot of our guys. He's got his flaws no doubt, but he's nevertheless done a solid job.  * Drafting. His first draft netted us Bridges and Graham, Bridges is a stud and Graham turned out to be good (just didn't have a role by the time his deal was up). His second draft got us PJ (who's solid when healthy), Cody Martin, and Jalen McDaniels (both of whom are among our better defenders). Then last year he drafted LaMelo along with Nick Richards, who out of nowhere has become probably our best center (as recently as preseason he looked like trash).   * The Kemba-Rozier swap looks better every day.   * Hayward's provided the perfect vet savvy for a young team, although I still hate that we stretched Batum to make the $ work."
"we need the previous sequence too, Bridges blew an alleyoop dunk, the Wiz got the rebound, but LaMelo just popped the ball out and Cody Martin came down with the loose ball to set this up."
"LaMelo, Bridges, Rozier, Hayward, Bouknight, Washington, Jones, and Cody Martin (who has been a legitimately solid rotation player this year, believe it or not)  I would expect any of Oubre/Richards/Jalen McDaniels to be snatched up by an expansion team, and don't like it, but Jones and Bouknight have too much upside to let go."
"The Hornets at times have excellent, almost Spursian or Warriorish ball movement, apart from Oubre and Terry. Miles, LaMelo, Cody Martin, and Plumlee all move the ball especially well for the position and it‚Äôs not uncommon to have five, six passes lead to a shot when we‚Äôre clicking.   I‚Äôve also been impressed that LaMelo doesn‚Äôt just try to pass into assists (like some stat-padding guys). He does what‚Äôs best to create for the offense and doesn‚Äôt seem hyper focused on stats."
"Cody Martin is just incapable of negative BPM minutes. God I hope we toss him a decent bag to keep him, I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs worth at least 5 mill a year. Probably more if he keeps shooting fucking 43% from 3 lol"
"The Martin Twins were kind of like that. Cody could D up, Caleb could score but both sucked when they were together. Cody has actually become fairly good this year, but now Caleb is with the Heat.  They wore 10 and 11"
Cody martin
"Cody Martin. Him and his brother were the worst guys in our rotation last year but now that we cut Caleb, Cody is absolutely shining. Lock down defender and he developed a pretty good handle and jumper."
The original Cody Martin stan is here!!
So do I  I would much prefer we keep our team and develop them since we our development team are very good as we turned devonte into a starting pg in the league and turned Cody Martin into an actual player who deserves minutes on a competitive team
"I get its Cody Martin, but this should be a lot higher and have more upvotes."
Cody Martin will likely be my favorite deep cut Hornets player when it's all said and done...
Need to watch that Cody Martin dunk over and over now too
"MILES BRIDGES HOW DO YOU DO?!?!?  Love Eric, that man can get you hyped for a Cody Martin two handed quick dunk. He‚Äôs also very quick witted he‚Äôs always got some folksy saying or joke."
"Look at Cody Martin, man. So inspirational üõ∏"
"Wizards making hornets bench look incredible defensively. Nick Richards, Cody Martin and Jalen McDaniels own the 3rd quarter tonight"
And might aswell include Cody Martin denial of trez
No replays of Harrell blocking Cody Martin? It was a nice one.
Wait for Cody Martin to clamp him up tonight and he goes 0-6 from the field
That‚Äôs Cody ‚ÄúClamps‚Äù Martin for you.
"The martin twins were verrry hit or miss last season. Just watching them play, you can tel that they both have the skills and intangibles to become key role players on contending teams, but Cody is further along than Caleb"
"there's gotta be a shooting coach savant somewhere on this coaching staff. Rozier going from the inefficient dude he was in Boston to the insane C&amp;S guy he's been in Charlotte is pretty incredible. Between Rozier, Miles, LaMelo, previously Devonte' Graham and Malik Monk, even McDaniels, Cody Martin... a lot of our team has improved their three-ball drastically after coming here."
That‚Äôs what happens when you play Cody Martin
That‚Äôs Cody Martin for ya
"Refs did all they could be between Terry beating Draymond for a jumpball and Cody Martin clamping Steph Curry, we refused to be denied this W"
give cody martin n¬∞23
"he didn‚Äôt cock it back on this one, Terry threw an awful lob. Which is what made it so spectacular.   Earlier in the game, LaMelo threw a transition lob to Cody Martin - put it *precisely* where Cody needed it to grab it and throw it down with authority.   Terry is more along the lines of ‚Äúimma throw it up in the clouds, Miles will go get it‚Äù. He had one like that vs clippers, it was so bad that I (along with Dell and EC) thought it was a really bad shot but Miles just comes out of nowhere and destroys it."
"Eric is great, he will just be chatting with Dell about some random fact he learned about some random bench guy, keeping it nice and calm, and then Miles or LaMelo does something or matinee Cody Martin decides to try to dunk on somebody he should not try to dunk on and EC goes from like a friendly 3 to a full on 11. No ramp up, nothing."
"He hasn't gotten any non garbage time minutes yet. I feel like at first, we were winning, so JB was like, we're not going to mess with this formula. Now we're losing and he's like, we're not experimenting with a rookie rn.   I think he just wants Bouk to get an opportunity to play more than 5 minutes in a blowout to ease him into it. I want him to play. We aren't deep on guards like last year. It's Melo and Rozier, cody martin off the bench (sort of positionless), and Ish Smith, but even he's barely been in the rotation recently."
Plumlee isn't even the main problem we just have no good defensive players other than Cody Martin and Washington who is hurt. This roster went all-in on offense and it hasn't payed off
Borrego feels way too comfortable sitting lamelo for extended periods. He checked in at like 6 mins left when we were up 7. We were up 11 a few mins earlier and thats not big enough of a lead to feel comfortable in todays nba. He should have been in the game at like the 8 or 9 min mark. Even in our win vs the nets he kept lamelo so long on the bench but luckily ish smish and cody martin went off to the pt where he didnt even need to check in but what happens if it didn't happen that way and kd and harden torched us. He's just way too comfortable with him resting.
Cody Martin
"If Cody Martin would've yammed that, my goodness"
Cody Martin
Cody Martin eats Gary for breakfast and defecates GPll
"not cody martin, he was a perfect 5/5"

Lmao Cody Martin blocking steph
Hum diddly Dee - anyone to make a dunk lol   The liver mush boys -ish smith and Cody Martin
Hayward? Dude was benched for Cody Martin the 4th quarter and suddenly a 17 point deficit turned into as close to 2 I think. The key is getting LaMelo to stop fouling so goddamn much in the 1st quarter and to find a way to stop every single opposing big man from cooking Plumlee in the 1st half so we stop having to climb out of all these huge deficits.
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I‚Äôm not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It‚Äôa a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he‚Äôs been with the Hornets he‚Äôs drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte‚Äô Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"Their development in recent years has certainly not been ideal imo, seems to be a pretty steep drop off after the top guys, while JB and co somehow make the hornets deeper every year by doing shit like turning Cody Martin into an NBA player, which considering where he was even last year is pretty nuts"
*Cody Martin* locked up Dame and blocked a step-back. Good lord.  Let's goooooooo
"Maybe 88 games played in 1 season by Walt Bellamy because there is no way that can ever happen again. The 3 birthday thing is pretty much guaranteed to never happen again but there is still a chance! (Cody and Caleb Martin share a birthday with Juan Hernangomez, so it could happen!)"
