Well he was clearly outplayed by Kevon Looney
"Can't wait for Kevon Looney and... who else? on the Warriors to play the 5. Draymond and Looney are not gonna get it done, and Wiseman is productive and on a rookie deal. No chance the Warriors take that trade, it would be stupid"
Homie is doing great for our second unit. Him and Frank have done wonders for us. But I think he’s referencing the need for a true backup to Ayton; there is no rim protection with our second unit.   Someone like a Kevon Looney or Javale McGee would be perfect for this team.
You should see Kevon Looney then.
"""getting minutes"" doesn't mean ""worthwhile""  6 years into their careers and out of 60 picks maybe 15 or 20 are even getting consistent bench minutes.  Are you disagreeing that 2015 was a garbage draft?  WCS and Kevon Looney?  Seriously?"
"The year Myers became GM, the team drafted Draymond Green, Festus Ezeli and Harrison Barnes. They had the 28-30th pick of the first round for five straight years and still ended up with two playoff level rotation players in Eric Paschall and Kevon Looney. The jury is still out on Poole, he's currently the G Leagues top scorer while taking time in the bubble. Smiley is trash and nobody can convince me otherwise.  Compared to someone like the Raptors, our GMs aren't great, but compared to teams like the Hornets or the Pistons, the Warriors FO is incredible."
Kevon looney: zero points and a +16 so far!
"Kevon looney has started 5 games out of the 21 he’s played in and averaged 14 MPG.  Wiseman plays more and has proven he has range from deep 2/even three. Draymond can’t shoot but I’d suspect they’d just use him on the screen and roll with harden every time.  Oubre is at 32% but it should go up after a horrible start, and it’s not like harden hasn’t played with guys shooting that poorly and still succeeded, see eric Gordon 31% for the 2020 season.  Wiggins is at 37% on 5 threes a game which is just fine. He does get guarded. Bazemore is at 43% and Lee is at 38%. You’re greatly exaggerating. These warriors minus steph are nothing harden can’t work with, he’s worked with worse before"
"&gt; Plus, Iverson was their starting shooting guard and leading scorer, but he was pretty much the worst shooter on the team.   You're assuming that other players on the team could have shot better, if given the same workload Iverson had.   DeAndre Jordan (76% TS) is a significantly more efficient shooter than Kevin Durant (65% TS). Does that mean KD is a worse shooter? Or does it reflect more on the fact that KD has to carry an offensive burden that DJ doesn't? Is Kevon Looney (66% TS) an equally good shooter as Steph (66% TS)? Or does Looney get much easier shots, because Steph draws all the defensive attention?   Iverson carrying the offensive workload allowed his teammates to focus on what their respective strengths were, just like KD and Steph allow their teammates to focus on other things besides creating their own offense.   If you watched the 2001 Sixers, a lot of times what would happen is Iverson would drive, draw multiple defenders, and basically just flip it up towards the rim for his teammates to get an easy offensive rebound and putback. On the stat sheet, that's a negative play for Iverson (0/1 FG). In reality, Iverson created that score by drawing the interior defenders to himself, which created the scoring opportunity for his teammates - it's as much as ""assist"" as Rudy Gobert setting a good screen, or Mark Jackson dribbling in place at the top of the key while Reggie Miller runs off 3 different screens.    In 2000-01, the Sixers were 5th in Offensive Rebounds, despite being only 19th in FGA. They were 2nd in OffReb%. That's in part due to defending bigs having to leave their man to help against Iverson.   In the 2001 Eastern playoffs, the Sixers were 7-2 when Iverson shot 30+ FGA. They were 4-5 when he shot fewer than 30 FGA. If Iverson were hurting his team by shooting, those W-L records should be reversed."
"If your talking about mvp convo, yes dame and steph are in same conversation. I could see why dame would be ranked higher for mvp than steph. In terms of better overall player, most will still see steph as better player overall today. Hes the ultimate defensive nightmare with all of his offball movement and demanding double to triple teams beyond the 3 line many times. He forcibly changes how opposing teams play defense when they face warriors. So many times this year, you see opposing teams double team him hard beyond 3 point line just to force the ball out of his hands. But his insane offball movement and the screens still allow him to get okay looks that he drains. Its actually crazy how effective and efficient steph is at scoring, considering opposing teams know they can abuse steph and trap him early since there is no klay.  They try so often to force the ball out of stephs hands, but he still scores, and scores a lot with sub par looks.   Steph has also historically torched dame and the blazers in the playoffs if we are considering head to head records.   In terms of playmaking, its not fair to compare the two, esp based on assist numbers. Dame has the ball in his hands way more and the offense is built for that. Steph moves offball many times and draws double teams nearly every time beyond 3 point line, in which he makes a pass to draymond and draymond passes to the open man for easy bucket. Many of stephs ""assist"" making comes from a 2nd pass because of his gravity rather than a direct pass from steph. In my opinion, it doesnt make sense to say dame is having much better playmaking season then steph, esp based on assist numbers. Steph does sooo much playmaking that is way beyond the statline and everyone knows that.   Also consider that steph has not played basketball for basically like a year and is still having this kind of season. Warriors also chnaged their entire squad. The only players that steph has experience playing with in recent years is draymond green and kevon looney. Their entire team changed so its inevitable that the warriors will not be as great offensively and defnesively this year since there are a ton of learning curves and experiences they have to go through.   Thats not to take away from Dame tho. The dude is beast and top 3 point guard no doubt. I could def understand and see dame winning mvp if he keeps this up and their record stays this strong. Ppl slept on dame too long. Its just so fun and great to witness these kinds of talents right now."
Jordan Poole Jacob Evens Damian Jones Kevon Looney  WHAT???
"From a little better than the 6-20 Wolves to in playoff contention is a pretty big leap. We should also consider that Wiseman has been a massive net negative thus far. He hasn't really helped the Warriors much because he's making a ton of mistakes on the floor, which is why Kerr elected to bench him. Kevon Looney is actually much better than him, but of course he is injured. Had Kerr started Looney to begin the year the Warriors record would be better on the season.  Draymond is someone that needs to be motivated to bring out his effort. Last year he wasn't motivated, quite lazy. This year he is motivated, great defensive effort. Maybe the best defender in the league this year. I think Curry is the differentiating factor there.    If we agree that Curry is the best ceiling raiser, that probably matters when grading players too. Considering that the goal is to build to win a championship. So even if he's a worse floor raiser than LeBron who is....you know...arguably the best player in league history, and Harden who is certainly among the best 1on1 scorers in league history as well as most productive creators ever, doesn't necessarily mean he's less valuable if you consider the other ways he can help an offense peak.  &gt;Harden would take this team to the 2nd round... Curry might not make it to the 1st round.  That s quite the assumption. In reality we don't know what Harden would do with this team compared to Curry. Some massive adjustments would need to be made as Kerr's approach to basketball doesn't involve running an offense through a singular creator, as it would ideally be through Harden. If this Warriors team is inconsistent now even with Steph playing at 2016 levels, then it speaks to an issue of the team construction itself rather than who they are led by."
Chris Paul in 2018 was impeccable and playing so good in the playoffs that he looked like the best player in a series with steph kd and harden  Chris Paul in 2019 was a shell of himself who could barely get by kevon looney and just straight up looked washed at points  Chris Paul not playing at the level of 2018 is the biggest reason we dont have a championship
Wiseman just got hurt. He was benched 3 weeks ago.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30779123/golden-state-warriors-shake-starting-lineup-bench-james-wiseman-kevon-looney
We’ve got this old man named Kevon Looney we’d like to talk to you about.
"you're right, that statistically speaking, and so i understand your hesitation to crown him a success just yet, but also think it's too early to call him a one year wonder like Bell. I think Kevon Looney is a good reason why we should have some hope in our young guys; Looney doesn't have much offensive skill but became a decent defender after a few years. We should give the young guys a leash; I know it's hard to watch guys develop in the middle of Steph's prime. However I think that Paschall fits a niche role in the current offense well, given the lack of the second unit to score at will; his iso game works since we don't have a true playmaker. you're right that if he doesn't pick up another skill he won't last very long, but you can say that just about any other player as well including lottery picks. things change fast in the NBA, and it's hard to predict how things will shake out. but you also have to consider that Paschall isn't being crowned as Steph's successor, so being a decent role guy isn't so bad (even if it isn't for 6 more years)"
"Ahhh yes Wiseman, a very raw prospect who has been negatively impacting the team so far, Oubre (nothing more to say here), and Draymond played most of last year and he was utteraly abysmal because of no Steph. Wiggins has been great but we know what happens when you put Wiggins on a team where he is the best player... he would backslide from his progression this year. So if Kevon Looney changes the idea that they wouldnt be at the bottom, good for you I guess."
"I mean, yeah, I've said that repeatedly Wiggins is shittier Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't have said that Barnes was some essential part of the Warriors plans going forward in 2015.   What I've said is that Wiggins is there to serve as a dual purpose of being able to play Harrison Barnes role on the court, but the real purpose of him is salary filler in a trade for a star. The Warriors hoped that they'd be able to improve his trade value, and honestly, they've succeeded so far in that aspect given the way everybody talks about him.   &gt; You can't run the death lineup for 34 minutes a game. This is the reason why. Kerr has said this himself.  I know that, but honestly what's wrong with Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss as your centers? I'd rather have Melo and play those guys as my 5s/upgrade the 5 position via free agency than draft Wiseman was my point. You can always find centers. Hell, our starting center for the last 1.5 years has been a guy we found abroad playing in Germany and he's been awesome for us."
"Who says they needed to trade Wiggins? Start Kevon Looney or Marquese Chriss at center. Draymond is STILL their best center anyways, he just can only play there for 10 mins/game.   You have:  Steph/Melo/Wiggins/Dray/Looney w/ a bench of Wanamaker/Lee/Bazemore/Paschall/Chriss  Then when Klay comes back, you have:  Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Looney w/ Wanamaker/Lee/Wiggins/Paschall/Chriss   OR you bring Melo off the bench:  Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney w/ Melo/Lee/Bazemore/Paschall/Chriss   And ultimately, because Draymond is still best at the 5, they would close with:  Steph/Melo/Klay/Wiggins/Dray"
isn’t Kevon Looney an above average defender? that’s what i seem to remember anyways. haven’t seen him play ina while
C'mon you're able to say this with the power of hindsight. I'm a huge CP3 fan and was one of the few ones who actually didn't want him traded away from the Rockets but even I felt that it wasn't such a bad decision at the time. He was atrocious during those playoffs and couldn't even iso Kevon Looney. It wasn't a ridiculous assumption to think that a 34yo pg with a long injury history was washed after those playoffs. No one could've predicted him to have his most healthy couple of seasons at age 35.
"That’s nice. Warriors are ten points better without him on the floor, even though the vast majority of his minutes are tied with Stephen Curry. Looney swapped with Wiseman in the S5 or any other high minute lineup turns it into a huge net positive - team is +12 with him on the floor.  Not a coincidence. Looney has been better than Wisemsn this year. It’s because he has a better understanding of the Warriors system, makes less mistakes, is a better defender and has chemistry with Steph. Draymond doesn’t have to scream at him every trip down the floor telling him what to do. Kerr made this decision understanding that Kevon was better, for damn sure not looking at per 36 estimates that do not describe his defensive nor offensive struggles on the season."
Old man face. Kevon Looney has looked 40 since we drafted him. Greg Oden is another good example.
Another Kevon Looney pan hands ass
That receiver had them Kevon Looney hands
"&gt; andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they  Jesus christ, if you think Oubre or Looney is at all comparable to the talent the Rockets had in 2015 you didn't watch that team. Green is great on defense, but I'm focusing on the offensive talent the Warriors lack. Wiggins is the only player that is comparable to the offensive talent Houston had."
"the fact that you ignored the warriors best players and used the guys at the end of the bench to prove your point kind of shows how dumb it is. andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they not exist? or are we going to pretend ariza 40 year old jason terry and corey brewer were way better for the sake of making curry look good"
Now imagine Rockets fans when we were getting torched by Kevon Looney and Shaun Livingston
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
"I mostly agree, he's hurting them out there even compared to the little Kevon Looney and Juan Tuscano-Anderson bring, but he's shown amazing catch radius and some handle and fluidity in the open court.  It's hugely discouraging that he's been getting worse, I agree there again, but he's shown some wild highlights too.  That said it's big time eye of the beholder what that package could get you.  Gotta at least put salary filler in there if you want to get a guy who isn't wildly underpaid."
"Steph, Dray at PF, and Kevon Looney have a 122 off rating and +15 net  an average center who is willing to do the little things would be fine  wiseman just fucking sucks man"
"Kevon Looney had KD comparisons before he had to get the hip surgery. So I’ll go with him, 2 KD’s woulda been nice, and then we’d still have at least one now."
"Yeah, every single championship team I can remember had solid defensive bigs. AD, Gasol, Ibaka, Duncan. Even teams that used a platoon of role players at the 5 chose run, jump, and dunk guys like Dwight, Javale, and Kevon Looney."
Right because starting kevon looney is a clearly better option 😂 The warriors even wanted to trade wiseman for “generational talent” which obviously they weren’t going to get. The warriors are trying to stay competitive now. They have a star whose window to win now may or may not be closing in the next few years.
"What if I told you that the value you can get in a trade with another team is also dependent on where the pick is in the draft, so the exact same problem applies?  Not only that, but we actually did trade some of them for a guy who you may have heard of named Andre Iguodala. Which is why it was only 4 picks in the dynasty years 2013-2018 instead of the 12 you normally get, none of which were higher then 28th overall and we did hit on one of those in Kevon Looney (Unless you're arguing that our picks the last 2 years were airballs which is dumb since they mostly look good given their age and experience, or you're talking about the Patrick McCaw and Jordan Bell picks which we essentially got for free)."
Kevon Looney is a decent center
"The warriors 4th best player that year was a washed up iggy and their 5th best was kevon looney, I’m not saying they shouldn’t have won it but it’s a bad look to get full on swept by that team   This year though dame is definitely carrying his team better than curry though"
You've got to be kidding me. 2019 CP3 was washed af I dont need a raptors fan to tell me this when I watched all of those games and saw the corpse of CP3 failing to get by Kevon Looney on drives. 2018 he was out 25+ games he was great in the postseason but you have to factor in both RS and postseason and Russ was better that season the difference was we had the MVP in James that season. CP3 would have seen another first or 2nd round exit if it werent for his trade to HOU.
"I'd say it's more of the fact that our teams are basically opposites in that the Blazers have better offense while we play better defense. Draymond and Kevon Looney aren't scoring threats, Wiseman is still young, Oubre is inconsistent, the bench is inconsistent, Wiggins is probably the most consistent offensively, and Steph gets trapped whole games because no one else is gonna beat you typically. Hard to lead a great offense when you're literally the only real threat out there."
"I’ve watched a lot of kids develop over the last 10 years. Wiseman has touch around the basket and he’s not injury history. He might be 24 by the time he gets /r/nba’s respect but...   They’ve won with a often injured Bogut, ZaZa Pachulia, JaVale McGee, Festus Ezeli, Mo Speights and Kevon Looney.  Festus was the only young guy with potential. Everyone else was washed Vets ring chasing.  They can take their time with him. If he pans out they’ll have their final piece of the exodia and essentially have a perfect basketball team."
Why isn't Kevon Looney in the MVP conversation?
It's either Draymond Green or Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney? Idk a lot of our players are properly rated
"I bet on the Warriors winning. Eric Paschall, Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss are at least real NBA players."
"Here's a better D-centric squad with a little spacing for the Nets:  * PG: Derrick Rose (Bulls), Lonzo Ball (Lakers), Raymond Felton (Thunder)  * SG: DeMar Derozan (Spurs), Pat Beverly (Clippers), Tony Allen (Grizzlies),  * SF: Bruce Bowen (Spurs), Andre Roberson (Thunder), Kyle Korver (Bucks)  * PF: Dennis Rodman (Pistons), Shawn Marion (Mavericks), Nicolas Batum (Hornets)  * C: Joakim Noah (Bulls), Kevon Looney (Warriors), Larry Sanders (Bucks)  Outside of Derozan the above team is utterly lockdown on defense."
"Kevon Looney has a brother named Kevin Looney. He is cousins with Swaggy P, who is cousins with Kendrick Lamar."
Wait'll you find out that Kevon Looney has a brother named Kevin
"**TEAM TRIMMED GOLDEN STATE**  Prized rookie James Wiseman heads down to the team bus, only to see it roll off without him. New coach Shoddy Collection has decided to roll with Kevon Looney and not look back, leaving Wiseman on the sidelines.  Right away, there appears to be a method to the madness. With Looney working as a garage man glue guy, Steph Curry is able to shine even more. Curry averages 33 points per game through midseason, earning some MVP buzz in the process. Wings Oubre and Wiggins have some good games here and there, but still show their inconsistency from time to time.  The Warriors end the regular season with the 5th seed out West, and some lingering hopes of a deep playoff run. However, that won't be easy in the Western Conference, as they draw Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in round one.  There, Looney and Draymond Green have a big test on their hands, as they try to cage up the Honey Bear. Jokic has a big series regardless, roaring to 25 points per game with 8 assists to boot. Curry does his part to fight back, scoring 37 points in Game 2 and 35 points in Game 4 to keep the series even at 2-2. Still, the lack of a signature and reliable second scorer leads to some gaps in their offense. The Warriors fall 4-2."
Pg: Stephen Curry Sg: Kelly Oubre Jr SF: Andrew Wiggins Pf: Draymond Green C: Kevon Looney
"T-Wolves won’t ever do that cause it’d be too embarrassing.   If KAT asks to be traded an offer of Kelly Oubre Jr, Kevon Looney, Wiseman, Minnie’s 2021 pick, and every future Warriors pick would probably be one of the offers they could get though"
Kevon Looney  He’s a great “beyond the stats” guy who’s been a reliable guy for the Dubs throughout their run. I still remember him being targeted by Harden possession after possession and holding his own.
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"&gt;  they literally have no centers unless you wanna count Kevon Looney.  Developing big men, and especially true centers that can anchor a defense, get boards, set good screens, and rim roll takes time. Could've gone for a center like market (trade or FA) instead of drafting one that's a project. Wiseman's far more of a project player than LaMelo, esp now looking at half a season's worth of games. Steph really needs another ball handler that can playmake, and Wanamaker ain't it. He's a ""PG"" that occasionally passes, but almost always drives to the rim for a layup or to draw a foul, shoots the 3 (poorly), and on the very rare occasion passes. His defense is solid, but the team doesn't seem to need more defense. Once Steph and Dray come out, the 2nd unit (w/ either Wiggins or Oubre in w/ them) revert back to non-Warrrior system ISO ball. Wanamaker doesn't want to pass so much to the extent Wiggins has to drive and kick and also look for ISO scoring opportunities.  The alarming thing about Wiseman is that he looks like he has very little ""feel"" for the game, and his skillset is mostly offense oriented. And he has stone hands problem, which is something bigs have trouble correcting throughout their careers. What the Warriors really needed was a big in the mold of KG - a defensive specialist that could make an impact on that part of the game quickly while working on offense.  And dude did not ""arguably"" have 2 bad games. Unless the opponent is rolling w/ a small ball lineup, he doesn't impact the game much unless Steph/Dray are feeding him (like they do w/ Oubre) in the 1st quarter or he's playing in garbage time.   Let's say his ceiling is really high (we don't know that, but for purposes of assumption). By the time he's ready to provide Steph/Dray/Klay w/ meaningful, winning basketball, especially in the playoffs, they'll probably be on their way to retirement. Bigs develop MUCH slower than other positions, esp true centers.  Always draft BPA, not fit. Look to fill fit needs in FA or trade deadline when you got a talent like LaMelo. (Of course, this is all in hindsight because of LaMelo playing overseas and Wiseman only playing 3 college games before being ruled ineligible, then pandemic happening.)"
"I wouldn't say he is ""so bad"" - dude had 2 arguably bad games out of his past 6 and that's coming off 11 missed games due to injury. I don't think it is necessarily fair to go off the +/- considering Steph had a few - the same games as Wiseman.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd argue that what they need is a player they can develop - I think that could certainly have applied to LaMelo as easily as Wiseman, but again, they literally have no centers unless you wanna count Kevon Looney."
"Warriors centers:  James Wiseman - Out with sprained wrist, at least 1 week  Kevon Looney - Out with sprained ankle, too soon to know how long  Marquese Chriss - Out with broken leg, rest of season  Alen Smailagić - [Out with meniscus tear,](https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/alen-smailagic-surgery-20210104) possibly back soon  Eric Paschall - Is 6'6""  Draymond Green - Is 6'6"""
Healthy Kevon Looney
These Kevon Looney screens are killing us right now lol
"According to my overall ranking, Kevon Looney  Most of the people being mentioned on here are pretty above average when considering all 500 players"
"He's super inexperienced and looks lost every time he touches the floor. He said in an interview himself that he doesn't know what he's doing. The Warriors's offense is designed on reading a lot of actions on the fly and reacting, and I personally think he is a bit overwhelmed by this style.  He's in a great environment to learn and develop, just look at Kevon Looney. The franchise puts no pressure on Smiley to be good right now. He has a great attitude from what I can gather and is well-liked.  If you want a personal take, he looks more like he could be a Nick Collison type of player at best and nothing more, talent-wise. Love him though."
you know Kevon Looney plays for us right
Kevon Looney is a 24 year old with old man game and old man looks.
"Kevon Looney. Dude is the ultimage hustler, can pass a bit and can stretch the floor if given the opportunity. With Wendell injured every damn season we need a solid big. More importantly he'd remove any and all of Shreks playing time."
Kevon Looney
"They can decline it. They just can't come back and offer him more than what the option would have been, plus he's an unrestricted free agent.  This happened with Kevon Looney.  Edit: unrestricted"
"&gt; Kevon Looney  What excuse do you think he needs? He's a solid role player.  Having said that, if you think he needs an excuse for not being a superstar you don't know his injury history.  &gt; Damion Jones  Again with the injury history.  &gt; Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell  Attitude.  &gt; Jacob Evans  Not a lot of potential?  But NONE of these players are lottery picks. So way to miss the point?"
"???? Why would you randomly bring up damion lee when there are so many other players from the warriors who have never really worked out? You act like GSW can develop everyone.   “These guys are only busting because the players suck.” So what’s the excuse for Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Jacob Evans, and Jordan Bell? All draft picks for the Warriors that never amounted to anything."
There's Kevin and Kevon Looney
"Draymond's closed as center for most of our important games, but it's worth noting that we closed with Kevon Looney for most of the 2019 playoffs post KD's injury, and Draymond largely retained his effectiveness -- he could still play that sort-of free safety role, and we could spam the Steph+Dray PnR vs. Houston and Portland. Obviously, as a center, Draymond could act like a fulcrum of the defense, but I think a larger part of playing Draymond as center was simply having our best 5 players on the field.  Looney's struggled with injuries subsequently, but I don't think it's too preposterous to suggest that we could be closing with Wiseman by next year provided he improves on the defensive end, playing a similar role to Kevon (though Wiseman also seems like he has a decent 3-pt jumper) in the right matchup."
"The cap spike isn't the reason they managed to get good production out of players like Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, and Kevon Looney, it was good coaching. They even turned around Javales career. The Warriors consistently made players better."
Who's acie law in this situation? Kevon Looney?
The era of Kevon looney
"Soooo, if the Warriors give up Wiseman, and 2 out of Wiggins, Oubre, and Draymond plus picks, what does that leave us with? Rockets probably would want Paschall.  Curry, Harden, one forward, Bazemore, and Looney starting. And our bench would literally have no backup bigs. How the hell are the Warriors gonna compete for a chip with Kevon Looney and whatever trash we sign off the street as our bigs and almost no depth?"
"For one season, maybe.   What happens when they extend Allen, and now for the foreseeable future their money is tied up in Curry, Klay, Wiggins, Green &amp; Allen  And don’t forget the fact Cleveland isn’t trading Allen for a Kevon Looney who can’t run, a second rounder &amp; money lol."
"Jordan Poole, Herro, Kevon Looney."
kevon looney a shocking -17 in 9 minutes
"Dudes in this thread really think Kevon Looney is better than Aldridge lol,  Also no, the warriors shouldn’t go for LA it makes no sense"
"Much easier without prime KD yeah. Who the hell else did GW have aside from those three? Kevon Looney? Rockets still had a pretty solid team, I’d say better than GW without KD. They had just the perfect opportunity to finally get the win....annnndddd they choked. Just like 2018 where they were literally about to beat them but then choked away 27 threes, don’t think you can blame the refs for that one. And yes I’m aware how funny all of this is coming from a raptors fan as yes yes, the raptors barely beat the warriors without KD AND Klay but that doesn’t change anything I said."
Kevon Looney looks like a Farengi from star trek
Warriors can do Kelly Oubre Jr and Kevon Looney for Oladipo cap wise. They also own their own picks.
"Without wiseman, the tallest player on the dubs is injury prone  6'9"" kevon Looney  I get that lamelo has been better than expected, but if they took him, they would get killed in the paint and on the boards, it doesn't matter how much you can score if you can't stop anyone"
Damion Lee and Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney locked his ass up in 2019. He looked bad man
"I don't see why we would trade Zach Lavine unless he wants out. If we're bad enough that Lavine doesn't stay, then trading him for James Harden or Bradley Beal probably just leads to them asking out now.  If we were going for a trade, I'd trade him for future draft assets. On that note, the Pelicans, Warriors, and Thunder become the instant trade partners to look at. I think the Warriors have the most prime draft asset with the Minnesota pick, so I'd go after that.  The most reasonable trade is probably something like Kelly Oubre, Kevon Looney, Damion Lee, the 2021 Minnesota pick, 2026 Golden State pick (converts to 2nd if it conveys to Memphis), and 2028 Golden State pick, and maybe a pick swap or two for good measure."
kevon “stone hands” looney
"He was also shitting on Kerr for playing Kevon Looney over Jordan Bell.  But personally, I like guys who actually go out on limbs. More entertaining."
Baynes makes Kevon Looney look like prime David Robinson
"Injuries are part of the game but what im saying is the Raptors win was way luckier than the Warriors over Cavs. What are you not getting? But since you wanna talk about the Warriors luck, let's also mentioned their misfortunes during their dynasty.  2016 1st Rd vs Rockets: unanimous MVP Curry sprains his knee in the 1st round, sidelining him for a few games.   2016 Finals vs Cavs: Andrew Bogut suffers a knee injury in game 5 and is ruled out for the rest of the series.   2019 DMC tore his left quad in game 2 vs clippers   2019 Rockets/Raptors: Kevin Durant has a calf injury vs the Rockets and is sidelined for a majority of the playoffs. After the Warriors go down 3-1, KD comes back to play game 5 and promptly tears his achilles and is declared out for an entire year.  2019 Kevon Looney fractures his collar bone in game 2.  He sat out game 3 but returned for game 4.  2019 Klay Thompson misses game 3(Raptors win) due to hamstring strain but returns for game 4  2019 Klay Thompson suffers an ACL tear midway through a very close game in game 6    SOOO tell me again who's finals win was the luckiest."
"Lol its not Kevin Looney, its Kevon. Who does that to their kid?"
SOMEONE CLIP KEVON LOONEY CATCHING THE BALL!
Yeah. Lot of revisionist history. He couldn’t get by Kevon Looney in 2019
"We had only 8 players for a good chunk of last season, but the specific game you're probably referring to was against the Suns. All their PGs were among the injured players and Kerr joked about making Kevon Looney ballhandle. (They did end up winning that game fwiw)"
Straight up.. Kevon Looney did the same moving screen that the very next play too hahaha take them breaks when they come
Kevon Looney has a brother named Kevin
Leave kevon alone... also why would you abbreviate kevon looney to KL
"Not only that but full, 100% recovery from a labrum tear in 6-9 months is very, very optimistic thinking. Re-tearing of the labrum is so common as well. Just look at Kevon Looney (GSW Center) and his injury history with a torn right labrum. It sidelined a very promising young career before he even got to really suit up."
"Damn, that sucks. The only players I know that suffered that injury are Kevon Looney and Isiaih Thomas.   One of them went from ""king of the fourth"" to struggling to get on a roster and Looney has been effective for the Warriors but he definitely doesn't get it done with quickness."
Kevon Looney
I think they'd try to move Oubre first.  Also could look to move Kevon Looney (~5m) if they fall out of playoff contention
"&gt; But the rebuild is gonna take longer than Steph has to wait.   There is no reason to trade Steph, or Klay, or Draymond.  None.  You rebuild with them on your team.  Why?  Look at the phoenix suns.  How did they go from a good, young nucleus of talent to translating that into wins?  There are other teams, like the Timberwolves, the Bulls, the Pelicans, and etc. that have good, young nucleuses that have not been able to translate that talent into wins and losses.  Why?    The biggest difference I see on the Suns is Chris Paul.  The Suns were a good story in the bubble, but they are a good team right now.  Bringing in Chris Paul, a guy who knows what to do and where to be to win close games, and who has played in and won many close games in his career, is having a big effect on the suns.    Young players need mentors, and not from coaches all the time.  Locker room leadership is a real thing.  The wolves have tons of talent, and they can't win.  Why?  The Bulls do, why?  There's no adult in the locker room.  The Bulls starting lineup is younger than the University of Wisconsin's starting lineup.  That doesn't work.    These young players keep going down this path, they will pick up bad habits that they will not be able to break out of even later in their careers.  At a point, a player's career hardens, and you are what you are.  For most normal people, that switch happens at age 24 (according to behavioral psychology).  It is absolutely crucial that you get good mentorship before the age of 24, or you're sunk.    Now, look at the Spurs.  They never had a plethora of top 10 draft picks.  After Duncan, Genobili and Parker, they had one top prospect for a period of about 20 years: Kawhi Leonard.  One top prospect was enough.  Why?  Because Kawhi had the fortune of starting his career in a place with absolutely the strongest locker room ever, he was surrounded by guys with championship rings.  He was a young rookie who learned to do it the right way.  The reason why the Spurs must rebuild now is because they've lost that locker room.    Having that veteran locker room, of players who have won rings in the past, can massively increase the probability that your draft picks pan out and become stars.    The best argument for NOT trading Curry, Thompson or Green is James Wiseman.  Do you want to give him the BEST chance to harness all of that freakish natural talent he has into becoming a generational talent?    Let him learn the RIGHT habits when he's 19 years old, from Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Kevon Looney.  Let him learn from 4 other players in the same locker room who have 11 championship rings between them.    You want to maximize the chances that those two top 20 overall selections in a loaded draft the warriors will have in the summer of 2021 pan out into terrific, foundational players?  Give them the right MENTORS early in their careers.    Most of us, in this life, never had a mentor when we were young, so our lives become a series of distractions and we spend much of our existence running in place, always trying hard, without ever getting anywhere.  That's due to our habits.  Young players learn by mimicking the habits of their older peers.  If you have a locker room full of young players who care about their social media standing and their brand, guess what those young players will pick up on?  If you have one dedicated to being unselfish and to winning, guess how those young players will grow up?    If the objective is to get the warriors back to contention as quickly as possible, trading Steph, Klay, and Draymond is about the worst thing you could do.    Meyers did the right thing in 2019, he kept the four foundational locker room players, and swapped out everyone else."
"OP is not paying attention.  What do you think Meyers did in the summer of 2019?  He blew it up.  They are in the process of rebuilding right now, that's why the team doesn't look that great, they're rebuilding.    Look at the summer of 2019 again, carefully.  Look at the all the players who were on the roster for the 2019 finals.  Do you know how many of them suited up for GS a few months later for the start of the 2019-20 season?    Four.  Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevon Looney.  That was the carry-over.  Meyers BLEW IT UP in the summer of 2019.  What OP is calling for, Meyers ALREADY DID."
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
If Klay didn’t get hurt there’s still a chance they could win the series. Also Demarcus Cousins and Kevon Looney.
Seems like a missed opportunity to not bring on Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney got himself a drink contract/tv commercial.  Hopefully JTA’s agent has as much hustle as JTA.
"How can you forget Kevon ""Durant"" Looney?"
"Clint Capela. His stats are good and he looks good but I watched him get absolutely sonned by Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney in the playoffs so for that reason, I’m out * Mr Wonderful Voice *"
"The tallest Warrior last night was Kevon Looney at 6”9. I love Kevon, but the Suns should’ve fed Ayton more and let his freaky Adonis body go to work. It’s so weird to me how little they use him on offense."
"Really didn’t think the Warriors would have a chance on the second night of a back to back against a full Suns squad. I really love how the Warriors use the Sun’s overplay against Steph against them, back door cuts, fake hand offs, lobs over defenders looking for Steph. Everybody growing up is always taught to keep an eye on the ball and an eye on your man, against the Warriors, you gotta keep an eye out for Steph as well. Damn proud of the Warriors. For the Suns: Devin Booker is a fucking problem, scores at will and near impossible to defend 1 on 1. CP3 did his usual thing too. And wtf, Cameron Payne was killing it too in his reserve minutes.  Only thing I thought sucked for the Suns was Deandre Ayton, I really thought he would punish small ball Warriors and Kevon Looney, but he didn’t really do shit"
"Aite, here's an unpopular idea. Kevon Looney. Defensive beast who is seemingly incapable of making a mistake."
"Stephen ""Can't Carry"" Curry is playing with:   * Draymond ""Unscorer"" Green * Andrew ""No Heart"" Wiggins * Kent ""Foul Trouble Vet-Min"" Bazemore * Kevon ""Oldest 25-Year-Old Ever"" Looney * a bunch of G-Leaguers  Even without two all-stars, the Jazz still have better depth than the Warriors, yet the Warriors won anyway."

"Yeah shows how far you can get in the NBA as long as you have good BBIQ, play within the system and hustle hard.  It's insane that there are 7 footers with crazy athleticism who don't grasp that. Kevon Looney is legitimately a better player than Andre Drummond, I wish I was joking."
Thank you Kevon Looney.
Rudy almost got that rebound damn. Kevon Looney incredibly clutch offensive rebound.
"Skill boost: Draymond Green. A 40% 3pt shooting from Green (with another jumpshot please) would do wonders for the team.  Athleticism boost: Kevon Looney. He's already a good defender. Give him verticality and speed, and you have a very good center again.  Size boost: Nico Mannion. A 6'6'' Mannion would be instantly more valuable. Giving it to Paschall would be cool as well."

Because of the double-doubles people had the perception he could be a Dwight Howard type player. In reality he's more close to a Kevon Looney or Javale Mcgee.
Kevon looney tunes
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now.

Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"I was way faster when I was 12 years old and 4'10. Now I'm 5'11 and move like a 70 year old Kevon Looney. My lack of physical fitness has nothing to do with it, all because I got taller"
He is out for this season I mean common you can't except Kevon looney to be a primary defender he is not even a lob threat
"Cool and all, but you also think that a key difference that keeps this team from being better is draymond's shooting...which is not what his role is in this offense. Honestly if Klay comes back and looks close to what he did pre-injury, with wiggins playing the barnes role and Kevon Looney playing the bogut role this team could look very close to the 14-15 team."
"Thats more fair. Still, there’s players like Jordan Poole or Kevon Looney getting decent minutes when they’re not really that good either."
"Kevon Looney. He plays basketball like how great bigs play 2k. Get to your spot on D and stand still and put your hands straight up. He's also hard to backdown, so you just gotta shoot right over him and hope it goes in.   He's gonna stop some great big from dominating in the playoffs (please let us make the playoffs...) Kinda saw it vs the Sixers, where Embid played well but didn't dominate and take over the game."
"ya, well you know first take and the average fan aren't interested in that. and I don't blame anyone -- why would we spend serious time talking about kevon looney. but I do agree with your statement, those things are always super overlooked."
"He was a highly regarded center prospect drafted #2 overall in the draft. Who should I compare him to, jakob poeltl? As far as his job being harder... How? Dude is playing next to Draymond Green who is a phenomenal defender capable of covering up mistakes and helping him on the court. He's playing on a great offense that can feed him easy looks. I think he's in a pretty good situation, one that has made plenty of other guys look great who weren't great. On his own team he's playing far far far worse than Kevon Looney. I would expect the #2 pick in the draft and #1 center taken to be at least as good as a replacement level big."
I thought I recall kevon looney stopping him and curry roasting the entire team just last week?
Yes nothing to do with Curry averaging 38ppg this month   Kevon Looney DPOY I guess
Seth Curry + Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney is such a below the rim player. He would be pretty damn good if he had some vertical athleticism
My life would look a lot different if I had the same determination and persistence as Kevon Looney lmao
"Kevon ""elite stat padder"" Looney"
Draymond Green and Kevon Looney.  Basically Jokic put together.  Slow yet reliable and good playmaking.  That’s what stopped him tonight lol
Kevon looney.
No.  Not like an mvp.  Like kevon looney.
Kevon looney is what Jokic thinks he is/s
They made Jokic look like Kevon Looney
They made Jokic look like Kevon Looney
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
Kevon Looney
"So Kelly oubre, Draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kevon looney, Jordan Poole and James wiseman are all suddenly g-leaguers? I'll give you Jordan pool, Kevon looney and James wiseman playing like dog shit but the other 3? C'mon.   And Andre Robertson is as g-leaguer as you can get. That season was 5v4 at all times because he literally can't shoot. He made it up with his defense but like....wow his offense sucked."
I am watching a Kevon Looney commercial.
I mean he's no Kevon Looney but he's till pretty good.
It'll be like a Slavic Kevin Looney and Kevon Looney.
"I watched Kevon Looney play his 1 year at UCLA.  I thought he was a lottery pick after that season.  Kevon Looney was a McDonald's All-American coming out of High School and a five star recruit.  He was one of the top 12 players in his High School class.    I remember watching the 2015 draft, the warriors are on the clock at pick #30, and honestly, I didn't even think about drafting Looney there.  Why?  I was certain he had been taken by someone at least 15 picks ago.  The warriors took him.    Then, we found out why he was available at the last pick of the first round: the medical evaluations had found hip issues.  He would probably need surgery.  He played a bit his rookie year, before having surgery and being shut down.    Hip issues followed him into year 2.  Kevon Looney was a bust.  A 30th overall pick who had barely played at all through 2 full seasons due to hip issues that meant he was never healthy.  If you look at pictures of him in year 2, he put on a lot of weight over that offseason; hip injuries, not being able to work, and adding weight due to bad eating habits.    He came into year 3, and people were calling for his head.  He looked well below average the first month of that third season, but he played some.  The warriors wanted him on the court to figure out if they would pick up his fourth year option.  They didn't see enough, and they declined the option.  It was worth $2.3 million.    Looney had a decent year 3, and he got better as the year wore on.  His defense and high basketball IQ proved pivotal in the WCF against Houston.  I remember thinking Looney was gone as a free agent that offseason, declining the option year was a bad move for the warriors.  Looney re-signed with the warriors, 1 year, $1.7 million.  The warriors declining his option saved them $600k.  I didn't understand why no one else offered him more.    After year 4, where he broke a bone in the NBA finals because Kawhi Leonrad rammed into him, missed 1 finals game, and then came back and played with a broken collarbone, I was impressed.  When the KD-Dlo sign-and-trade went through, I felt sure Looney would be lost in free agency as a result of the hard cap.  Surprising, he re-signed with the warriors again, at 3 years / $15 million.  I still didn't get it.    That's two times I thought he was gone, but that he came back.  Kevon Looney made one of the hardest mental leaps there is to make: he was a High School and college star, who transitioned into an NBA role player.  He also just turned 25 years old 2 months ago.  He has two championship rings in his career already, and he was a high level role player on the 2018 title squad.    In the playoffs, rotations shrink to a team's top 8 players, there's a lot to be said for knowing that Kevon Looney can be one of those 8 players on a title winning team.    It's also a cautionary tale for James Wiseman.  Wiseman's rookie year was much, much better than Looney's in the sense that Wiseman actually played as a rookie.  Most of Looney's first two and a half seasons were wiped out by injuries.  The warriors stood by him, and never gave up on him, and when he could have left as a free agent, more than once, he always came back.  Wiseman might not get it together right away, and it might take some time, but he is immensely talented.  People on reddit were calling for Looney's roster spot literally for years, and now, he's a foundational part of the organization.  He's so damned useful that re-signing him has to be the top free agent priority for the dubs this offseason.  You lose Kevon Looney and the instant you do, you begin the search for someone else just like him.    Don't give up on young players so fast.  When it comes to players on rookie scale deals, I'd rather give up a year too late, than a year too early."
"To this day, ill never understand why kevon looney took such a below market deal with barely any AAV or years to stay with us than get his true value or even get overpaid by some desperate team on the free market."
"Defended by ***just*** Kevon Looney though?  It seemed like he was aggressively double-teamed every single time he touched the ball.  Embiid did his best to pass out but without Tobias Harris and Simmons he had force some offense of his own that he normally wouldn't, and the players around him weren't quite in sync in terms of getting to the right spots when the double team came."
"larry hughes got hurt and played 30 games, calling Z an all-star in the center depleted eastern conference is just malpractice, Brad Miller was an all star that year too, eric snow was 34 years old in 2006 averaging 4.0(!) ppg as a starter, and drew gooden is the epitome of replacement level big   THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN, oubre who just scored 20 a game last year, eric paschal who was first team rookie last year, and kevon looney has minutes as a starter in the NBA finals  really, Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.   warriors have other guys averaging 18.5, 15.2, 1..7, and 10.2    Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   curry really isn’t even close"
Exactly! When was the last time GS actually drafted an impact player? Was it Kevon Looney?

Your superstar was owned by fucking Kevon Looney. Timelord should have no problem against him.
"Tonight's games and performances from Embiid, Curry, and Jokic drastically hinder Embiid's MVP chances imo.  All we've been hearing from Embiid these past few weeks is how he should be MVP due to his consistent dominance and the Sixers being top seed in the east.  Tonight, the short-handed Sixers played the short-handed Warriors and Steph out-MVP'd Embiid.  Joel disappeared down the stretch because he had trouble with double teams and getting into his spots.  Embiid also did an interview on ESPN with Stephan A before the game tonight and said he should be MVP because ""When Shaq won MVP in 2000 he averaged 29 and 11 and those are my numbers right now"".  Well Shaq averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebs, and 3.4 blocks against Dikembe Mutombo in the 2001 NBA finals.  In the 1995 Finals against Hakeem he averaged 28 points, 12.5 rebs, 6.3 asts, and 2.5 blocks.  But Embiid cant figure out how to score on Kevon Looney or a 6'7 Draymond?  If a post-prime Marc Gasol is your kryptonite you can't compare yourself to Shaq.  Meanwhile Jokic, who also has a short-handed team, dropped 47 points, 15 rebs, and 8 asts in a close OT win on the same night.  This is the kind of stuff that sticks in voter's minds.  Doesn't help that Embiid played on national TV tonight too."
"I think Jokic just helped to fully secure himself his MVP tonight, especially with Embiid disappearing down the stretch against Steph earlier.  You can't go on TV and say the MVP belongs to you and then take a poop against Kevon Looney/Draymond double teams.  I like the Sixers this year but with Embiid being this concerned with the MVP race and Ben being the same way with DPOY it makes me wonder where their priorities are.  I could very well be looking too much into it but we don't see any other superstars on contenders lobbying for personal awards this hard."
Ok 76ers fan how does it feel for your MVP candidate to get locked up by Kevon Fucking Looney
"Yeah, Kevon Looney is so good"
MVBiid got locked up by Kevon Looney
That feeling right now?  That's you feeling the will of Kevon Looney.
Imagine being an MVP candidate and getting stuffed by Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney has his work cut out today in guarding Embiid. Hope he got some good rest last night.

Hopefully Kevon Looney or Draymond Green
I actually remember seeing something say “Kevon Looney is the next KD” lmao. Whenever Looney attempts a 3 pointer I’m just like “NOO YOU’RE NOT THE NEXT KD!!!”
"Warriors have won championships with worse Cs than James Wiseman is right now.  Trading him now would be a stupid-ass move. He doesn't get paid enough to carry the possibility of really adding bench depth, because every player in the NBA who's even *slightly* good gets overpaid by desperate teams with the exception of Kevon Looney, who we already have."
"It's more like Warriors will have to try to survive with only Kevon Looney, Draymond Green, and Juan Tuscano-Anderson as ""bigs"" with Looney being 6'9"" with a 2"" vertical, and Green and Juan at 6'6"" lol."
"LeBron would kill for having the DPOY Draymond, future DPOY Wiggins, future 2x ROY Wiseman, future dominating center Kevon Looney, future top 10 3pt shooter ever Oubre, not to mention Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore. That’s an all-time supporting cast and Curry somehow holding them back, even trying to commit suicide on Houston’s stairway and still choked on that one"
Kevon Looney has been unleashed
Kevon Looney
You’re comparing a supposed “superstar” in Simmons with fuckin Kevon Looney..c’mon bruh
"Which means it is likely a false positive and he won't miss much time. It happened to Kevon Looney this season. He only missed one of two games.  Otherwise he is line Damion Lee, who got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine with many other Warriors players but still got sick and in his case had a pretty bad case."
"&gt;Not a ridiculous argument at all lmfao they had shaun livingston who was still excellent back then, ridiculous argument by you  Livingston can't shoot, which means the Warriors refrained from using him in their small lineups.  &gt;Looney still was going to get minutes regardless, he got minutes the next season in the series too. Not sure why you think iggy is on the floor at all times  Sure, but he played a lot more than he would have if Iguodala was healthy. And lol, I'm pointing out that when you have a guy who normally plays around 30 minutes, those minutes are going somewhere when he is out. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they went to Bell and Looney (who isn't bad, but was overmatched against Houston).   &gt;You’re really using that as an excuse? The warriors had looney in the paint, we had capella in the paint with Draymond playing free safety. The same shit applies. You make no sense  The issue is the Warriors would normally play small for very long stretches of the game, which they couldn't do with Iguodala out. How do you not get this?   &gt;That’s on them for abandoning there strategy, they had livingston so they still could have done it.  No, because the spacing doesn't work there. Livingston can't shoot.   &gt;You’re really overrating iguadolas defense, harden put up 35 on 60% TS the next series with iguadola playing every game, we just ended up losing because we were worse that season  That was a year later lol. Harden didn't shoot well with Iguodala guarding him in 2018, and neither did CP3. Are you really contesting that Iguodala is a huge upgrade over Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney??  &gt; “A bit of defense” lmao just admit you didn’t watch a second of lrmam play. He was easily our best defender or second behind tucker.  Yes ""a bit of defense"". Tucker and Ariza were both excellent, and Gordon was serviceable. Replacing LRMAM's minutes with those guys isn't some big downgrade.   &gt;I’m not arguing we were better or even more talented, I’m arguing that we deserved to win that series and you’re not going to say we didn’t because they were missing a 5 PPG old man compared to an allstar and a role player.  You didn't deserve to win the series first of all. Injuries are part of the game. The team that ""deserves"" to win is the team that actually went out there and got it done. Secondly, the injury to Iguodala was simply more impactful compared to LRMAM. There is simply no way you can argue that the downgrade from Iguodala to Looney and Bell (especially on defense) is the same as the downgrade from LRMAM to PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, and Eric Gordon. Combine that with the Warriors being unable to play small, which was by far their best lineup for years, and the downgrade is simply much larger. Houston was going home regardless of health. I'm sure you won't agree, so let's just agree to disagree. We'll never know who would have won for sure. You have your opinions, and I have mine."
Kevon Looney is a starter when we're trying to win
Lmao why did I think kevon looney was like 33
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, James Michael Mcadoo, Kevon Looney, Anderson Varejao  and Jason Thompson who got waived midseason."
"Claxton's versatility has really impressed me. He can slow down bigs in the paint, and is nimble enough to stay in front of guards if he's pulled to the perimeter. Reminds of what Kevon Looney provided for the Warriors in their playoff series against the Rockets. He isn't going to lock down guards, but he can stay in front of them and bother their shots, which is a pretty valuable skill for a big."
"Lol all the Rockets had to do was win one game. KD was also out with score tied or Warriors behind in the 4th of game 5. Warriors didnt have Iguodala without whom they struggle to play their small ball lineups and no bench the next year. You lost to a team of Jordan Bell, Kevon Looney and Quinn Cook the next year."
I think they need someone better than Kevon Looney who continues to show durability problems.
Stanning for Draymond here but Simmons has Embid behind him. Draymond has... Kevon Looney?
Dude looked washed I don’t know how many times we have said this. He flat out couldn’t dribble around Kevon fucking Looney  Edit: plus the constant injury concerns Glad to see point god is doing well though. Loved him here in the H
"Sure : AD, OG Anunoby, Bam  Maybe ? : - not sure about Ben Simmons against centers and really strong players, I like him way more on guards weirdly  \- really disapointed by Giannis as a perimeter defender moving his feet so not sure either,  \- Thad Young/Draymond/PJ Tucker could but not sure they still have the foot speed to do that  \- Kevon Looney : yeah I know weird, but I really think he's a great great switch defender, heck he might be better at it that he is at actually guarding  a big center  \- Kawhi/Butler/Lebron : in a pinch they can guard some centers and some point guards, not all, and not for a long time either at this point, Kawhi and Lebron could in their defensive prime (Butler is purely theoric, actually don't even remember him on a real big)  &amp;#x200B;  I'll admit I'm pretty clueless about Johnatan Isaac, I know when he was drafted many people were thinking he could do it"
"i was at a warriors vs hawks game in atlanta 2 years ago and they announced if a warrior player missed both free throws attempts in the 4th quarter everyone would get free chick fil a and i had never wanted my own team to miss so badly in my life, and kevon looney did miss 2. it was great. the warriors still won and i got free CFA"
"You know you have a super team when you gotta talk about the guy on the bench playing 12 minutes a game to try to find nonsuperstars on your team. Was the KD, Curry, Green, Klay GSW team not a superteam because Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, and Kevon Looney getting minutes off the bench in the playoffs?"
"kevon looney was about as healthy this year as he's ever been... steph wrecked himself on a step but that's it, and dray just had covid and some tweaked fingers.  klay... sigh...."
did reggie just say kevon looney? lol
Steph lost to the AD LeBron Lakers by 3  With no Klay  With Kent Bazemore and Kevon Looney starting
CJ was somewhat good in 18 against the Warriors. They just couldn’t keep leads because Dame was playing hurt. If Kevon Looney didn’t fall on Dame crushing his ribs I think Portland maybe wins 1 game instead of getting swept.
Kevon Looney is always the answer
Kevon Looney is like 25 but looks 45
It was remarkable how much better the Lakers looked with Gasol or AD at the 5. I think Drummond got out rebounded by Kevon Looney in the play-in.
"&gt; Sadly, you have to factor in the team and what affects what, not just the names and accolades.  MMMM you're right they had to rely on back to back MVP Curry and best post season shooter Klay Thompson. Must've been real tough! /s  &gt; And they looked gassed because? That's right, it's because KD wasn't there and they weren't deep enough to spread those minutes around.  Who was their backup small/power forward when they went 73-9 or when they won the chip in 2015? Oh it was either Harrison Barnes or Kevon Looney. Well would you look at that, they had Looney in those finals against my Raptors and Jerebko who was slightly worse than Barnes was. I'd say the backups were pretty much the same as their 2015 chip...  &gt; Just pretend that the Lakers faced the Nuggets in the finals. They were a scary team with Murray playing like a superstar.  I do pretty much. That was the real NBA Finals for 2020."
Have you seen Kevon Looney
"KD for one game and a practically hobbled Klay in Game 2 aint 75% of jack shit. Im also gonna bring up how Kevon Looney was injured who is the Warriors main reserve center.  The Lakers actually faced a fully healthy Pistons team for 6 games and luck went in their favor.  People still credit Kawhi a lot for bringing a championship to the Raptors and Canada and rightfully so, but please dont ever say the Raptors were better than a fully healthy Warriors with KD and Steph"
Last time he said something like this he got outplayed by Kevon Looney
"There are examples of teams doing a solid for non-stars.  Why do you think 40 year old Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat rooster?   Ex-Laker's big, Marc Gasol, gets a cushy job as Laker's ""development coach"".  I'm expecting the something similar will happen for Kevon Looney for playing through the playoffs with a broken collarbone. Which led to permanent nerve damage.  It's funny, this year they're not even trying to be subtle. They're straight up buying out contracts and letting players go where they want.  Cavs did Andre Drummond a solid. Pistons did Blake Griffin a solid. Spurs did Lamarcus Aldridge a solid."
"That’s the point lmao? If Klay didn’t have injuries hampering him game 1, was present for game 2 and didn’t go down in 6 the warriors would have won that series in 6 lol. Kevon Looney also went down. No one said the team was bad, the Warriors were still insane without KD. The problem was that they had injuries down the roster to the point they were playing with garbage at the end"
"Or a solid PG like Steph, with shooters like Klay and Wiggins or Poole, who can make big shots with a really solid PF like Draymond who can act as someone who takes the primary defensive assignment when Kawhi wants to go all-offense mode or load manages. Add in a thriving young player like JTA or Paschall, and a solid old center like Kevon Looney and Kawhi could potentially make the Finals again."
Kevon Looney too. He's an excellent defender and offensive rebounder. And obviously Klay Thompson lol. The rest can go.
Does he even trade Kevon Looney?
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
"Yes absolutely. GS had the best player but could only go 8 deep and 1 of those played only 6 minutes in Mulder. Memphis has one of the deepest rosters in the league. While GS had to rely on Juan Toscano Anderson, Kevon Looney, and Kent Bazemore in crunch time"
"Yeah, when someone gets by him he has Embid.   Draymond has... Kevon Looney?  Andrew Wiggins?"
Yes Kevon Looney vs Gobert isn’t a great matchup lol plus y’all already beat the Jazz twice now we know Grizz could do the same
"Meh, I remember him getting bodied by Kawhi a lot last playoffs too,   And it's not his fault lol, Kawhi is just too strong man. I vividly remember a play where Kawhi straight up stiff armed Kleiber on the drive and sent him barreling 10 ft past the stanchion, similar to where he stiff armed Kevon Looney that one time  That mf Kawhi is *strong*"
Lool..kevon looney for keldon johnson or looney walker
"Bro, they started Kent Bazemore and Kevon Looney. Stop discrediting Curry and Draymond for dragging a roster that literally no one else would have sniffing the playoffs."
"This team was in the finals with Draymond and Kevon Looney  Having Steph and Klay affords you a lot of luxuries. Two bigs than can post, screen, and pass they way Draymond and Sabonis can would be a terror in that offense"
41 year old Draymond is basically Kevon Looney

Kevon Looney had 12 rebounds by the half. I can pretty much guarantee he's half-dead. Similar probably goes for the rest of the guys who played.
"No I just am saying how the Lakers bent their defense a lot more to stop Curry than the Warriors bent theirs to stop LeBron.  That bending of the defense leaves openings all over the court, however the Warriors shambled roster wasn't able to take advantage of it well enough, which is the reason it's a viable strategy in the first place.  Had Anthony Davis been one of Curry's teammates; he would've been getting a LOT of free dunks out there (which would not show on the stat sheets as assists for Steph despite creating them btw). If Klay Thompson is out there, that's a lot of wide open threes.   Unfortunately it is JTA, Jordan poole, Kevon looney, Kent Bazemore, Wiggins trying to finish those opportunities. They were almost able to do enough but not quite"
Ass garbage fucking Kevon Looney outplayed him
&gt; Drummond can’t finish~~ed over Kevon Looney fucking lol~~
AD seriously getting outplayed by Kevon Looney.  Drummond getting outplayed by Drummond.  The corpse of LeBron is sad to watch.
Kevon Looney is honestly much better than Drummond
Kevon looney always shows up big in the big games.
Drummond can’t finished over Kevon Looney fucking lol
Kevon Looney
"Kevon ""Dennis Rodman"" Looney showing up"
Kevon Looney has more rebounds than LeBron and AD put together.
Poole JTA and Kevon Looney have been invaluable this game
"""I'm not soft. I'm not soft. I'm not soft!"" Anthony muttered under his breath while taking a break on the bench. He could only hope that his mask over his face could hide his fucked up teeth as well as his manic episodes.    ""How can I shut up the critics? I won a championship but all they do is call me Mickey Mouse. It's not fair."" Anthony knew that he deserved his ring, but why couldn't anyone else see that?   ""It's because everyone thinks I'm a pussy!"" He thought to himself as his head fell to his hands. He tried his hardest to assert dominance when he told Kevon Looney he looked like the monster from *Where the Wild Things Are* but all Looney responded with was ""You say 'Please Sir' every time Lebron has the ball!""  A tear grew on Anthony's ducts as he ran back on offense. He couldn't believe it. He'd thought of that insult for four straight hours and he got no respect for it.  ""Nobody will ever respect me"" he said to himself as his brow curled into sorrow. ""Nobody..."""

 TA Kevon Looney!!!
"Put some respekt on 25 year old Kevon Looney's name. An undersized center who is a staple in the Curry-Thompson 3-point massacring offense. Steve Kerr has.  &gt; He is reliable, patient, productive, steady, consistent etc. But during the playoffs, **Looney has taken his game to another level to the point in which Steve Kerr called him a ""foundational piece"" of the franchise.** Through 16 games this postseason, Looney is shooting an incredible 73 percent from the field and playing his typical stout defense. Since Durant's absence, Looney has upped his game even more. Over the last five games, Kevon is averaging 11 points on 77 percent shooting.  https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/how_warriors_bench_players_raised_their_game_with_kevin_durant_out_bay/189829/"
"Looney has long been overlooked as an integral piece of our team dating back several years now. I believe that working with Bogut and Dray was absolutely awesome for his development.  In a switch-heavy defense, him being respectable on the perimeter is absolutely massive in terms of holding the ship together. We saw what happened when Festus and Varejao got put on perimeter island.  Beyond that, and as other have mentioned, it’s his IQ which really plays into the system. This Warriors (Kerr’s) system really fires on all cylinders when the roster is loaded with high BBIq players, which Kevon absolutely is. It’s no fluke JTA has thrived, as he is also a perfect Warrior system player. Iguodala, Liv, and Bogut amongst others were all great examples of this.  (As a quick interlude, did anybody see him absolutely slogging it out through the finals looking like a mummy??)  That being said, it’s where I think we goofed most this year. Oubre is notoriously daft in the BBIQ dept., and we didn’t bring in any other guys who really have a knack for the game. Kevon Looney is relatively unathletic, but his comprehension of the game and system has allowed him to be a sturdy piece in the Warriors machine, and had Myers gone out and looked for similar players I think we’d be better off—here’s to hoping we move in that direction going forward.  All of that being said, I love having Kevon on the squad, and funny enough, I think he’s one of our most important players this year, and epitomizes Warriors ball as Kerr has established it. Here’s to seeing him keep it up!"
"I mean, I love his game as well, but I don't think Kevon Looney is gonna hit 50"
steph is a top five guard rotation on his own  love seeing Kevon Looney pop up a couple times
2x NBA Champ Kevon Looney. I've never seen a 24 year old athlete move like he's 84
"If you consider Jokic to be athletic, then in the current NBA, I'd have to nominate Kevon Looney. Dude moves slower than that amber from Jurassic Park, has the lateral movement of an apartment building, and couldn't jump over a credit card. That said, he's a treasure and has come a long way from 2019-2020 when he was basically Benjamin Button at age 23 and didn't seem like he'd ever get healthy."
"Lol Kevon Looney is 4th in screen assists, I wonder who was making all those shots after screens hmmm."
"Well to me the the biggest example is Draymond, who would have had a drastically different career if not for Kerr creating an offensive/defensive scheme to maximize his skill set.. trust me Dray would not be a hall of famer on 29 other teams in the league, he’d probably be a defensive role player like Covington on most other teams  But for other examples of the Warriors getting the most out of role players (just spitballing, not a comprehensive list at all): - Javale McGee: dude had his career revitalized by the Warriors, he was pretty much useless before he came to the dubs and we made the perfect lob man bench role for him. He was incredibly impactful in his time with us, and hasn’t reached nearly that same level of impact with any team since - Ian Clark: this guy is now out of the league I think, another example of the Warriors turning a non-nba level talent into a worthy role player. Dude was never elite but he was actually a super solid role player here, that two man game between him and David West was so reliable for the second unit. Always felt like he brought some good poise and comfort level to the 2nd unit, and obviously he never got back to that same level with any team since then - Mo Speights: was actually a vital piece of the bench unit for the 73 win squad, had the perfect role on the dubs that allowed him to utilize his only skill (shooting) and hide his defensive deficiencies. Yet again, this dude was out of the league shortly after leaving the warriors. They were the only team in the nba that was ever able to turn Mo Buckets into a usable role player - Kevon Looney: prime example here, this guy has zero flash to his game, basically no offensive skills at all, wouldn’t be more than a third-string “use in case of injury” big on most other teams, but the Warriors have turned him into a crucial part of their team by utilizing his fundamental skill set in their offensive and defensive schemes  - JTA: this guy is another prime example, I guarantee he never sees the court for any other team in the league but the Warriors found a way to utilize his very unique skill set in a similar way to Draymond. The guy can barely dribble, can’t create his own shot at all, is purely hustle and BBIQ yet is an important rotational piece to the Warriors. He’s one of those guys where if he’s on any other team his skillset would be pretty useless but on the Warriors they’ve found a way to make his skillset valuable.   Now obviously they can’t have this success for every role player that comes through the org, but these examples of guys who literally wouldn’t get playing time on any other team becoming important rotational pieces for the Warriors is seriously impressive. Yes, Kerr has his flaws as a coach (his stubborn rotations lol), but give the man his credit for being a genius on creating schemes that maximize the skills of his players, instead of trying to fit players into his schemes.   I mean he literally created one of the most unique offensive systems ever to maximize Curry’s skills, and in one season took this team from first round exit to champions pretty much just by tweaking the schemes"
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."

Ah yes people like Kevon Looney and Juan Toscano-Anderson  so hateable
"The Warriors are going to need all the versatility they can get this post season. Even if Wiseman had been healthy he's not developed enough to help against traditional bigs yet, so the Warriors are vulnerable in the paint and on the glass. We saw that tonight against the Grizzlies.   Valančiūnas tied his 4th highest scoring total of the season tonight, along with 6 offensive boards, 10 defensive boards, he only had 2 turn overs and 2 personal fouls in 35 minutes, only Ja played more tonight. He also threw in a steal and an assist, was 5 of 6 from the free throw line, and 80% from the floor. He really did his job in taking advantage of the Warriors lack of size.  I think tonight exposed the Grizzlie's lack of shooting, because the Warriors were able to collapse on the Ja drives and Jonas post ups and then recover to mostly poor shooters who did not make them pay. It reminds me so much of this Warriors team early in the season. Thank god they've got a few guys in the rotation now who are willing and decent shooters. It's been huge.   But yeah, the Warriors don't really have size, their most traditional center is undersized Kevon Looney. People shit talked him but he's so big for the Warriors.  Finally, look at Wiggins versus the Pelicans and then tonight versus the Grizz, he's really locked in and playing hard. He could be a real x-factor for this Warriors team in the post season."
i love kevon looney so much. high iq player who’s always willing to do the dirty work.
Slightly off topic but I can not believe Andrew wiggins and kevon looney are only 26 and 25.
"Kevon Looney turned 25 in Feb, he's a young guy vet for the team"
"First and foremost Klay Thompson. Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Shaun Livingston, Nick Young, Kevon Looney, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Patrick McCaw"
Eric Gordon was significantly more useful in that series than Kevon Looney. Gordon was already getting starter level run when Paul went down whereas Looney was an 18 MPG guy suddenly thrust into the starting role. The drop off from Iguodala's perimeter defense to Looney's is worse than any aspect of going from Chris Paul to Eric Gordon
"Am I comparing the loss of defensive impact from starting Andre Iguodala to starting Kevon Looney to on the other side the Rockets going from Chris Paul at point guard to James Harden at point guard? Yeah, I think that's in the ballpark of fair.  The Rockets were -63 in that series. This idea that the Rockets ""solved"" the Warriors needs to die. They eeked out a couple of close wins after Iguodala went down because there was someone on the floor the Rockets could abuse hard enough on offense. It's really hard for bigs to be relevant for the right reasons facing a perimeter centric offense. Just ask Rudy Gobert.  The harsh truth of that series was it was the absolute closest that those Rockets could have played that Warriors team. You can simulate that series game 1 to game 7 20 times and the Rockets maybe win 1"
"[Clear foul by Looney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdsoLheuiA), he was on the move while Kawhi was driving to the basket. Kawhi is just really strong, unfortunately for Kevon."
You didn't see him get locked up by Kevon Looney two years ago? lol
"when he couldn\`t get by kevon looney on the switch, I was like damn"
"Problem with the Lakers tho is now who guards AD?  KEVON LOONEY DOES, THAT'S WHO. 82-0."
"&gt; This is the same damn CP3 he’s always been   No it’s not, in the 2019 playoffs the dude couldn’t beat Kevon Looney off the dribble on switches.   He looked a shell of himself in that Warriors series."
They blew up because CP3 struggled to blow by Kevon Looney.
"Yeah it's definitely not dirty at all, but some people are ridiculous. I remember same thing happened when Kawhi lowered his shoulder in a drive and it resulted in Kevon Looney breaking his clavicle after hitting the ground hard.   Just because a guy gets injured, doesn't mean the play was dirty, especially considering their reputations."
Kevon Looney isn't nothing. One of the dudes in the league that is capable of defending guards when switched upon.
"It literally was. The ""kd and klayless warriors that would slap this suns team"" lineup would have been curry, quinn cook, iggy, draymond, and kevon looney, with alfonzo mckinnie,  jordan bell, boogie, and livingston (averaging 4 pts/game in the playoffs) coming off the bench. Please shut the fuck up."
"No love for hybrid Kevin, Kevon Looney"
Chriss was very good in Golden State but you don’t take a center second overall and not expect him to quickly climb past Marquese Chriss and Kevon Looney for the starting spot. This was one of the biggest reasons he didn’t work out for the timberwolves: he didn’t want to be behind KAT.
"Wait, what? Wiseman is NOT better than Zaza/JaVale/West were. Are you conflating ceiling with current level? Kevon Looney completely outplayed him this past season, as well.   James showed flashes on offense, but was borderline unplayable for much of his rookie season, mostly having to do with poor decision making and woeful defensive instincts. He’s incredibly raw"
i’m thinking of it like kevon looney is from milwaukee so i bet he would enjoy it if they won (go bucks!)
Hey hey don't disrespect kevon looney like that.
Kevon looney smh
Kevon Looney is only 25?? I thought that dude was mid-30s back during the Golden State title runs!
Kevon Looney BBIQ + James Wiseman body and athleticism will be one of the best centers in the NBA
"maybe he was just tired?  chris paul had the worst season of his career after his rookie year and harden responded with the greatest scoring season of all time to drag the rockets from 11-14 to the 4th seed.  then he averaged 35 ppg in the most important playoff series against the warriors while cp3 averaged 16 ppg and couldn't beat kevon looney off the dribble.  maybe he didn't want to run around after essentially doing everything on 75% of the possessions on offense.  people act like players are robots with unlimited energy to do anything and everything all game long.  while harden should have thicker skin, no one carries a group project for a year and then wants to hear the people they carried spend all day bitching and moaning that the font on the report should have been different.  if cp3 couldn't shut up long enough to not piss off another teammate, then he certainly shares some of the blame."
Someone didn’t watch a single Rockets game in 2019. CP3 couldn’t score on Kevon Looney that year.
Lmao exactly. Kevon looney was locking him up and the problem is harden moving off ball?
Lol blame CP3 for looking washed in 2019  Man was getting locked up by Kevon Looney
Who said Kevon Looney was similar to KD in college?
Kevon Looney moment   He was hyped up to be the next KD but because he just had no legs he became a stereotypical big man and he's only 25 but hes really productive on our warriors squad so props to him for fighting the injuries.
"There really aren't.  Wiseman was a raw rookie who'd played three games since high school at the *start* of last season. By the time he got injured he was actually starting to look *good*, because the Warriors were spending every minute he was on the floor on developing him, because they hadn't even had a training camp.  The Warriors spent literally *years* developing Kevon Looney when they were at the absolute peak of their greatness.  Why the fuck would they give up on someone who has the potential to be significantly better than he is after *half a fucking season*?  ""Sure, he could be our next franchise player, but we can't give him the kind of development time we gave *Kevon Looney*. Time to ship him out for a bench scrub.""  Any player getting Wiseman's salary who's better than Wiseman isn't getting traded, because they're contributing too much to the team they're on *now* for that.  Unless the other team wants them as a future franchise player, I guess.  Be specific. Name names. Who do you think the Warriors could trade him for and get better?"
"Calm down buddy, his player comp was [Aminu](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevon-looney/) and he went low first round"
"Kevon ""Harden Stopper"" Looney"
WOOOOOOOOOO  You ain't a real fan if you don't love kevon looney
I think Kevon Looney will return to Golden State Warriors next season
siakam and draymond are two elite defenders that can guard 1-5. throw in someone like kevon looney for 15 mins and you good.
"We almost beat the lakers with kevon looney starting.  Looney and dray are both incapable of scoring from anywhere on the court, even when left open.  The only time Curry has ever played in a 4 around 1 system the warriors won 73 games (dray shot 38% from 3 that year). Every other year there’s always been 3 around 2 guys that can’t shoot.  Give Curry a full time 4 around 1 squad and I like his chances vs anybody.  (Also we kicked the nuggets ass all year long with this bum ass team we got now.)"
its because Kevon Looney activated both the Millenium Items and Heart of the Cards
"Yeah…that isn’t how basketball works. The system is built and adjusted around the roster, not the other way around. It isn’t some one size fit all system that can never be adjusted no matter what. If Kerr has a talented scorer at the 5 spot (something he’s never had before) then he’ll find a way to use him. He’s obviously not going to build the system around Kevon Looney when Steph, KD and Klay are leading the charge.  It really seems like you just have a Warriors hate boner and are vehemently against them improving their roster. Christian Wood will very likely continue his production next season and your comments will look even more dumb dumb."
"I mean, yes almost all of them in the last two decades?  * Lakers started JaVale McGee with Dwight as his backup * Raptors started an old Marc Gasol who was making a lot of money, but was on a minimum and unplayable on the Lakers two seasons after * Warriors for their two most recent titles used some combo of Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Kevon Looney and JaVale * and going back to 15/16 the Cavs started Tristan Thompson  idk if you call this moneyball, but it's basically just spending your money in places where it is hardest to get production above replacement level. except for the really elite centers like Embiid and Jokic, the defense/rebounding/rim roll skillset is in such an over abundance right now"
Guess Kevon Looney is the best C in the league by that metric.
"Because playoffs are a matter of matchups. Sometimes players who otherwise arent that good, get a perfect opportunity to show off.  Beverley was unplayable against Dallas, and didnt play much against Utah. He’s only found consistent playing time against Booker and the Suns.  The reason I dont think he’s a good player is because:  1. He’s borderline unplayable offensively  2. He constantly gets in foul trouble, gets techs, flagrants, etc. Just some extremely low IQ possessions.  3. Defensively (which is supposed to be his biggest and only strength) he still gets routinely abused by taller, stronger guards.  4. He doesnt really bring any tangible value. He doesnt score, doesnt rebound, doesnt assist, doesnt really steal the ball often either. He bring intangible value, which by it’s nature, is very hard to judge properly. Like, his coach might think he brings a lot of ‘grit’ and ‘toughness’ to the team, but by all accounts and metrics, he is often a negative asset.  TLDR: He is only good in some specific matchups, and doesnt bring anything of tangible value. It’s not hate, he’s just very good. Kevon Looney got a shit ton of minutes in the WCSF, WCF, and Finals, but he’s not a great player."
It still shocks me that in the 2019 finals Kawhi hit Kevon Looney so hard he broke his sternum and never picked up an offensive foul lol
"Not even a GSW fan but Kevon Looney is one of my favorite role players in the league. Quiet, professional, and always plays hard."
"It’s been 1 year… lamelo isn’t on the floor if Klay is healthy and wiseman has the potential to fill a hole on the roster. If you know that Klay is going to tear his Achilles, then sure maybe you go for lamelo.   Some of his other picks: Draymond in the 2nd round, Kevon looney last pick of the first round, Jordan poole end of the first round, paschall 2nd round. The latter 3 are all pretty good considering pick position. The warriors have been elite with either no draft picks at all or very late picks for half of his tenure.   He also got mark jackson out and Kerr in. He helped bring in KD, and is a big reason why they were in the finals 5 straight years…"
"I mean, they ran Kevon Looney out at center. It sure as hell wouldn’t be conventional, but it might be a decent lineup."
Huerter? But i barely know her!  - kevon looney
He looks washed.. man couldn’t get by Kevon Looney off the dribble
Considering KAT has 2 all star nods and an all NBA selection Ayton doesn't have the same success.   His resume stacks up to Kevon Looney atm not Towns 😂
"Kevon Looney is flattered, actually."
Kevon Looney is in shambles
"Kevon Looney over Quinn Cook any day of the week, is Quinn still in the league (legit question)?   Also I would definitely think Norm has a bigger impact than Trez (and probably Kelly) but it’s not that huge of a gap."
Kevon Looney is still the pick.
he got sonned by Kevon Looney
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
Could say the same about lebron and kevon looney.
"Mf got out rebounded by Kevon Looney in the regular season, it’s not that surprising to see him get beaten up in the playoffs"
"He still is an iso-god, he just can't rely on raw athleticism to get him to the hoop any more. Have we been watching the same Point God this season? Off the curl/pin-down/on-ball screen, if a big switches onto him, it's a mid-range bomb in isolation after a combo or two.   Kevon Looney has, I would say, borderline elite foot speed and defensive positioning. Definitely a product of the system he plays in, but he's very capable at switching onto most wing/guard players for a possession, helps that he's undersized at 6'9'' for the position so not the best comparison I think.   I fully believe he could still blow by a traditional center, or even Davis Bertans or a 3-4-5 of that caliber."
His last season he couldn’t get by kevon looney in the playoffs. It wasn’t looking good
Ask kevon looney
"&gt; Looney seems like he's been fine since his neuropathy surgery. &gt;  &gt;   Got a link for this?

"I'm sure the casuals are doing that. Sophisticated fans that appreciate the lesser-recognized stars of the game tune in for Kevon Looney and Juan Toscano-Anderson,"
"I went ahead and highlighted all of the fouls for you so there's no trying to delude yourself out of this just being ""physical play."" By all means if the NBA wants to change the way that games are normally called to make something like this legal then go for it, I think that would be great if the game were made more physical. But that's not how it was being called that game and it isn't how the game is called in general.   This extends far beyond LeBron and Jokic so you can miss me with trying to pin this on ""you just don't like LeBron."" This play was a full course meal of fouls, there isn't any denying it. This is just one play in the context of a greater issue that is referees being wildly inconsistent with how they call games, whether it's game to game, or quarter to quarter, or player to player, or it's just some random offshoot play that they go to sleep on.  This game in particular was being called pretty tight the whole night. Less physical plays than this were being called fouls all night, and this was the one play out of the entire game besides a couple weird ass TT/Plumlee rebounding scraps in the first half, to have the whistle that far back from the play. That's the issue.   If the refs in private said, ""This was a really young player who was moving his way to an all-NBA level player for the first time up against the best player in the league, we wanted to be hands off with that and just enjoy that basketball moment and let them have that physicality in that play"", then by all means I am fine with that. I really am. But we don't know if that was the process behind that moment, and for anyone to come out and say that Jokic wasn't fouled all over this play is just dishonest and disingenuous, and for what?  It doesn't matter if this was Andre Drummond and Kevon Looney, the issue remains the same."
"Lmfao in 2019 Paul had the worst season of his career and couldn’t get past kevon looney, clint capella battled stomach virus and played like shit. Harden averaged 35/7 on 60% TS in 2019, he didn’t have enough help. He played better then Steph and kd that series   &gt; none of those guys are on the level of kd and kyrie  But they had a bunch of role players who play great defense lol"
Clint capela sees Kevon looney in his nightmares.
"Nobody is comparing it, but it's disingenuous to act like that series was even close when Iguodala played. Golden State smashed Houston in Games 1 and 3 with Iggy and when he got hurt his minutes went to players that either barely played or didn't play at all.  The Warriors were a superteam, they didn't have depth, all of sudden they went from Iguodala to rookie Jordan Bell or Kevon Looney."
That kid doing what James Harden couldn't... get around Kevon Looney on the perimeter.

anyone else think kevon looney has the same face as kyle from nelk?

"I fail to see how the spacing would be any worse than it currently is. The starting center was Kevon Looney this year lol. Move Draymond to center, Simmons to power forward. Bring in shooter to replace Wiggins. Wiggins is not a great shooter anyway  Besides, Ben has been one of the league leaders in 3 pointer assists for years now. He would hit Steph and Klay hard rolling off screens"
Which he contributed too as well. Was throwing his elbows all over the place he even injured Kevon Looney. Got 2 free throws for it. So his TS% proves it's the goat playoff run.
was pretty bad on the warriors in 2019 but tbf its hard to look good compared to the GOAT Kevon Looney
"This guy was literally voted best defender in the league last year, is a much better passer/creator than Wiggins, and is such an horrific scorer than he averaged 15.35 points per game the last two seasons on a team that would appear practically designed to be the worst fit imaginable- This is about 3.65 points less than the great Andrew Wiggins' points as a Warrior.  I'm not sure why a team with Steph and Klay would ever in a million years need to worry about spacing. What exactly are you worried about? Heck, there's no reason why Ben couldnt just play the 5 if you're so worried. I mean, I know he doesnt fill up the stat sheet like Kevon Looney, but I think he'd managed..."
Well yea that's what happened. Noone is cheering if Kevon Looney gets hurt. Raptors fans realized they just won. Noone even knew about the Achilles in the moment.
"Norman Powell, Richaun Holmes, kevon Looney when he isn't injured, Larry Nance Jr,   Yeah the draft not only has several.multi time all stars but a lot of high quality starting level players too."
"I don't know. 2016 had Bogut at center, 2019 had Kevon Looney. Both had Livingston and Iguodala off the bench, but in 2016 they were 30 and 32, in 2019 they were 33 and 35. 2016 also had Barbosa and Speights, 2019 had Jerebko, Cook, and McKinnie. KD &gt; Barnes, but I'm not sure by enough to make up for all the rest."
"33% from 3 on 3 attempts per game for his career. Not a good shooter. Besides that, they could just as easily bring in another knock down shooter to fill in that gap as well. They were running Kevon Looney at center during the play in. Switch Draymond to small ball center, bring in another shooter and their offense could be wild"
Kevon looney is low key a defensive beast. For a man with the hips of a elder home resident he keeps up with slashing guards and wings remarkably well.
Kevon Looney
I’m imagining Steph’s face on Shaq’s body moving actively off the ball and coming off screens set by the likes of Kevon Looney.
"warriors had an injured team and still made the finals they had jordan bell starting and qiunn cook playing heavy minutes, and jonas and demarcus  and kevon looney , need a go on? klay was injured playing and broke down because of the heavy load , same with kevin   &amp;#x200B;  its not that hard to beat a injured team and giving your best 9 players heavy minutes to capitalize on that , it was basically stephen curry that series vs the raptors. Keep hyping them up tho , because in reality they are just role players lol"
"I don’t think the point changes: Clint Capela with his offense right now can’t really be put in a contender that asks him to do a lot offensively, whether or not if that’s with the Hawks.  It’s not that long ago that his offense completely disappeared when Kevon Looney was guarding him.  Plus y’all have 2 more years left on his contract."
"They have Kevon Looney. But other than that, I agree, he's probably not moving the needle. More or less just replacing Kent Bazemore."
"Wiggins homecoming? Raptors get Wiggs and Paschall. Warriors get Dragic, Baynes and second round pick(s)  Warriors depth chart:  |[](/GSW)|Starters|Reserves|3rd string| |:-:|:-|:-|:-| |**C**|James Wiseman|Kevon Looney|Aron Baynes |**F**|Draymond Green|Nemanja Bjelica| |**F**|Otto Porter Jr.|Jonathan Kuminga|Juan Toscano-Anderson| |**G**|Klay Thompson|Modey Moosy|Jordan Poole| |**G**|Stephen Curry|Goran Dragic|  edit: Raptors just waived Baynes. Nevermind"
Those metrics don’t mean shit when Chris Paul cant get past Kevon looney when it matters lmao
"Nah, Warriors still take that series, y'all forget how bad CP3 was in that series, I'm a big CP3 Stan but he couldn't beat fuckin Kevon Looney in a switch, there's a reason Harden wanted him gone after that series."
"Yeah, he turned Kevon Looney's career around by [yelling](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/how-iguodala-helped-looney-get-career-track-i-finally-listened-him) at him to stop eating Chick-Fil-A and Taco Bell and to start eating turkey and broccoli. That's the kind of thing only a 30+ year old vet can tell you. Most 20 year olds are still eating like shit."
"It’s just complete irony (with a terrible mix of ego and stupidity) that the Rockets broke that core up right AFTER Warriors were beaten and had lost both Klay (due to injury) and KD.    The only team that were better talent-wise/could beat the Rockets imploded and the Rockets (cough Harden) decides to blow it up.   To be fair, Chris Paul had a terrible series against the Warriors in 2019 (but so did everyone else aside from Harden and Gordon) and Clint was hindered by injury and was embarrassed by Kevon Looney.    But just the thought process of blowing up that trio that had such a devastating dominate record when playing together your main (and really only) competition bows out is unforgivable.   Now 2 years later; all three are on different teams. CP3 has reinvented himself and was 2 wins from a championship, Clint found himself an important role with an up-incoming team with a new superstar guard, Harden is the one that got injured and the Rockets are in the middle of a rebuild.   Just BS irony."
"Even with Ross and Delon, they were packaged for Ibaka and Gasol which led to the chip.  The only player drafted after Ross within reason you can argue for is Drummond and with JV already on the roster (and JV being better than Drummond) it was the right pick. The ten picks after Drummond were Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Royce White, Tyler Zeller, Terrence Jones and Andrew Nicholson. Getting Ross is a W for Masai and the Raptors.  With Delon, he was drafted 20th so getting someone who was a first guard off the bench player is a good return on that. The players drafted after him in the first round were Justin Anderson, Bobby Portis, Rondae, Tyus Jones,  Jarrell Martin, Nikola Milutinov, Larry Nance Jr, RJ Hunter, Chris McCullough and Kevon Looney. Other than Looney, Delon is good return based on the picks after, I don't consider this a miss.  Bruno was a miss no doubt though. But hey, we got the Raptors 905 built up because of him so in the grand scheme of things it worked out lol  So yeah, **basically** (key word basically) all our picks have hit. Other than Bruno we haven't missed a pick."
I would’ve liked to have seen more ball and player movement too but CP couldn’t get past Kevon Looney off the dribble in his last year here. He doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on
Nice. Thanks for doing this. One comment for the Warriors. You missed Kevon Looney as backup center
"like I said, if we can have Kevon Looney and Dray in the starting lineup, we can have Simmons and Dray in the starting lineup"
At this point they'd even settle for just Kevon Looney.
I’ve been waiting for this! Kevon Looney! Switches onto Harden and doesn’t let him score
"From that time he had a wide-open dunk only Trae Young could contest and bitched out.  Kevon Looney also isn't afraid to go to the line, though!"
"Kevon Looney would not be afraid to dunk on Trae Young. He also is not scared to shoot, he just passes to better options if he can."
"I mean Kevon Looney started for the last 20 games and the warriors went 15-5, if we can have Kevon Looney and Dray in the starting lineup, we can have Simmons and Dray in the starting lineup… not saying I want Simmons, but it could definitely work"
"If we can have Kevon Looney and Dray in the starting lineup, we can have Simmons and Dray in the starting lineup… not saying I want Simmons, but it could definitely work"
No fucking way you just compared Kevon Looney to Westbrook.
"So does Kevon Looney. It helps having superstars like KD, Harden, and PG. I’m not saying westbrook sucks but he’s a 3rd or 4th option on a contender, not a star player people say he is."
I keep thinking kevon looney is like 29 but he's only 25.
"Kevon looney pretty old looking too, and only 25 or so"
"Yeah, the report was kind of hilarious. It had stuff like, Kevon Looney got fouled but it wasn't called, instead Curry got the ball and scored a 3. Due to ref mistake Looney should've been shooting free throws, with an expectancy of 1 point scored. Therefore, Rockets lost 2 points due to officiating."
"You still have to guard Simmons. Not so much on the perimeter but he's not a total dud.  And yes, you'd have them on the high elbows with Curry off ball, Klay and Oubre doing the same or spotting up. It's called the triangle offense and it's been known to have some success. Kerr already uses triangle elements in their offense. He loves backdoor cuts and big men who can pass. You're vastly underestimating Kerrs coaching ability here and what you can do to a teams defense with two elite playmaking big men.  Also you could stagger their minutes down the stretch.  You think Simmons is less of a scorer than Andrew Bogut who was a part of their title? Or Zaza Pachulia? Or Kevon Looney? All of whom were on the floor with Dray.   You don't need shooters at every position to win games.  Also Draymond-Simmons would be the most versatile defensive tandem in basketball history."
"The Warriors need a center that fits what they do. They need someone who's gonna be big on the boards, is a good passer and is smart enough to fit in with their movement based system in terms of screening correctly and intelligently.  Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Draymond is plenty good enough 1 through 4, they need to stop pretending that 6'8 Kevon Looney is a starting center.  Find a guy who will hoover rebounds on both ends, play good D, help facilitate. Someone like Deandre Ayton would fit perfectly with what they need. Board man gets paid."
"* Blazers - Dame banged up and then leaves the series after being down 3-1. But I don't think anyone legitimately expected the Blazers to win after how the Lakers responded in G2 and onwards.   * Rockets - They lost Danuel House after two games, a dude they signed for 3 years 11.5M total. Not exactly swinging the series. Also they actually had Eric Gordon healthy for 5 games, which is far more unlikely.   * Nuggets - Will Barton again it's not like they lost their main dudes. They got to the Western Conference Finals without him.   * Heat - Bam went down when the series was 3-1, true that was a break for the Lakers but I don't think having Bam means the Heat win 3 games in a row against LeBron.  Losing 1 or 2 players in a 7-game series is pretty common and to me 2020 doesn't stand out really.   2019 Finals with GSW losing KD, Klay, Kevon Looney was the worst since 2015 when LeBron was out there with Dellavedova."
Kevon looney? Hooper. Tim Duncan? Not a hooper.
Kevon Looney does not approve.
"Kevon Looney, I don’t think I really need to explain.."
KEVON LOONEY
Tell that to kevon looney
"MN loves Golden State tho, So they’d probably do it for Kevon Looney and a 2nd rounder"
I must’ve missed the games when kevon looney and Javale shot 80 percent from 3 when they were on the court with draymond
Just to expand on that. Kevon Looney is 25. Players go through a time vortex sometimes in the nba and either age faster than you thought or stay young forever. It’s weird.
I will not stand for any Kevon Looney slander
PG: Devonte Graham SG: Gary Trent SF: Isaac Okoro PF: PJ Tucker (assuming he'll be starting this year) C: Kevon Looney
"Look how late those Spurs picks were.  They weren't drafting early!  As to Kevon Looney... To judge players' value, lets look at what they get paid.  In his first real contract (the contract after rookie contract), Looney got paid about 4.5 million/yr.  But Kyle Anderson got 9.5mil/yr.  Dejuante Murray got 16 mil/yr.   And Derrick White got over 18mil/yr.  Those guys might as well be in a different league than Lonney.  They're starters.  Looney is bench.  As to the missed drafts-- my original argument was that Warriors don't deserve a rep for being **good** at drafting/developing players (i.e. mentioned in same sentence Spurs or Celtics).  Because they simply haven't done it since 2012.  Trading away picks is a part of that.  There are simply no real success stories to point at and say ""Hey, these guys are good""."
"Right, but most of the Warriors were also very late drafting, with no picks in 2014, no first round pick in 2017. So with that they got Kevon Looney and Jordan Poole, which actually seems okay even if not great. They developed Wiseman poorly in 2020 (hence the massive development side changes) but for the 2014-2019 drafts, not sure there's a ton to criticize."
2x NBA champ Kevon Looney
And Kevon Looney
"Possibly, but you forgot to put Kevon Looney #1"
"Uhmm, depth is garbage? So Poole, Otto Porter, Nemanja, JTA, Kuminga, Moody, Payton, Iggy, Damion and Kevon Looney is worse than Barnes, Iggy, Bogut, Livingston, Ezeli, Barbosa, Speights. I don't know what crack you smoking but it apparently makes you brain dead."
2x NBA champ Kevon Looney
Kevon Looney
"Everyone makes fun of his ""backpack"" shooting motion, which is fair. But it does seem kind of intuitive that it's because he's consistently played the 5 in the playoffs and the injuries build up. Being an undersized center definitely takes its toll. Shit, just on the Warriors, look no further than Kevon Looney."
Wow really Kevon Looney? This is exactly the kind of unwarranted petty beef this thread was asking for
"He would fit as a replacement for Kevon Looney on the Warriors for example, but I have a feeling Ben Simmons doesn’t want to just screen/defend.   He could fit well with Kat and KP as well, but that would make the paint more or less closed off for them, and i’m not sure neither of them would enjoy just being on the perimeter.  I think Ben needs a stretch big man that is fine with standing on the 3-point line all game, to compensate for his shooting.   A half court distributor makes little difference without proper spacing.   And he still wouldn’t be playable in a 4th quarter of a playoff game. 34% is 34%. Defenders would foul him as soon as he touched the ball, and spacing would be all wonky if he would play off-ball as mentioned before."
"Zaza Pachulia,Kevon Looney,JaVale McGee  “I took that personally ”"
Thats kevon Looney to you sir!
Kevon Looney or Yao Ming
Steph Curry Kevon Looney and Draymond is the greatest collection of talent we’ve ever seen?
"But why would you want to pay Ben Simmons' HUGE salary if you're going to use him in a Kevon Looney role?  The thing about the NBA is—because it's a salary cap league, you maximize winning by getting the best value for money/contracts that you can get.   Getting Ben Simmons to play as a conventional center is an atrocious value signing, IMO"
"Moody will be useful, might even close some games in the regular season since I think Iggy is done and Porter is so injury prone  Kuminga will show flashes, has a really high ceiling, but after 2 months when he DNP's most game I""ll ask why before realizing he has a 44%TS   Wiseman will start put up some counting stats and by the playoffs Kevon Looney will still be their second best option at center after Dray"
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
Cp3 was absolutely washed that last year in Houston. He looked like a shell of his former self and could barely take kevon looney off the dribble against gs. He only started to turn the tide about a month into next season with okc when they started to go on their run.
Ok fine we’ll do 2x NBA champ Kevon Looney
Kevon looney. Warriors have one less title without him.
"I understand your point, but I am going to have to disagree with you. There is more than one way to skin a cat. The Warriors roster is led by veterans in Curry, Klay, Green, Looney, and Wiggins. The first four of whom have been together for a long time and gone through championships.  To say that a team cannot compete for a title with young players on the roster seems short-sighted and oversimplified. The Suns were very young this past year and made the finals (Ayton, CamJohn, and even Booker is pretty young). These players were starters. The Warriors young guys are back of the rotation players.   in 2020 the Heat had Bam starting in the finals in his third season.  in 2019 the Raptors had Siakam as a key part of the team in his third season. Same with VanVleet.   Kevon Looney played significant minutes on a finals team in both 2018 and 2019 after struggling through injuries his first two seasons.   Pat McCaw played spot minutes for the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 in the playoffs in his first two years.   Kyrie Irving was the 2nd best player on a finals team from his age 22-24 seasons.   Again, I understand your point. LeBron likes having vets around him. But from an organizational standpoint, another strategy is to compete now, but also not sell out the future if you can avoid doing so. A blend of vets and young players can build dynasties as seen with the Spurs and Warriors. A team of only vets often results in ""championship or bust"" and after the vets leave or retire the team is awful (2013-15 Nets, 2015-18 Cavs, 2013 Lakers, 2019-20 Rockets, etc.).   Just because the Celtics have not won a championship does not mean that the strategy to have vets and young players on the same team does not work. It just did not work for them, yet. They are also a perennial playoff team and Tatum and Brown have developed into stars in their own right."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
That’s like saying the asking price is Kevon Looney or Klay Thompson
I am convinced that the only ones capable of slowing down Trae are Kevon Looney and Kyle Anderson.
"&gt; ""But if the Warriors can succeed with Kevon Looney **at center,** there is reason to believe they can do so with Simmons **in that spot.""**  so... Ben Simmons... at center...?"
"Ben is the more talented and impactful player at both ends, and he'd instantly make us the best defense in the league. I just think the talent gap is big enough that it overrides any fit issues. We'd trade Kevon Looney for Donovan Mitchell in an instant no matter how lopsided it makes our team because our ceiling with Mitchell is insanely high. And if it didn't work, Draymond yelling at Simmons for not taking layups would be really funny."
KEVON LOONEY IS THE BEST CENTER IN THE NBA !
Kevon Looney and Boogie Cousins have the best Key and Peele sounding names. 2019 Warriors ftw
Steph got hurt from falling backwards onto some steps that’s not a case of poor durability that’s just shit luck…..and if Dame or Harden’s 35 million dollar 2nd option missed the whole season and they trotted out lineups with Draymond Green and Kevon Looney/Wiseman the offenses would struggle with that spacing ….at least Dame has 3 respectable shooters on the floor with him at all times. Imagine where Steph would be with CJ on the wing and where Dame would be with the best shooter and only above average shooter in the starting lineup other than him being Andrew Wiggins
"Not the same guy but I’ll have a crack. Draymond’s passing and offensive contribution also comes from his incredibly smart understanding of the game and other teams’ defensive schemes. He anticipates rotations and will move the ball to exploit the holes that he sees opening as a result of the other players’ off-ball movements and you’ll often see him call out orders to other players when he’s at the top of the key with the ball to get this to happen. Because he can effectively run point for us in offensive sets, it frees up our shooters to move and break apart the defense trying to scramble to prevent them from getting an open look. He’s the grease in the gears that makes our offense as fluid as it is, which also means he’s visibly in the spotlight the most when things gum up, which is why people will often fixate on his turnovers to point blame in close games. He’s a force multiplier on offense — people will always try to tear down this aspect of his game by claiming “anyone could be good at passing if they had Steph and Klay to pass to”, but the stats don’t lie here. Draymond + any of our good offensive players (be it Steph, Klay, KD, or any or all 3 of them) is *always* a statistically much stronger lineup than any of them without him. Plus, the eye test passes very clearly here; even when he plays with our worse lineups, you can see the good opportunities he generates for the other players even if they can’t always convert.  His defense is well established, but it’s also worth visiting *why* he’s so effective. Just as on offense, his contribution here is mostly intellectual. He knows exactly what needs to be done to disrupt a play, and will order and even sometimes physically move our players into the right positions to do so. He’s not just playing his own game on defense, he’s coordinating all 5 players on the floor to get everything in place to disrupt. It’s why players like Kevon Looney work so well with him — Looney isn’t fast, but he’s patient and smart and learned well from Draymond to the point that the two of them were so well synchronized they made the Harden-Capella lob unplayable in a playoff series after it dominated a whole season. Anyone that can absorb and listen to Draymond’s defensive plans becomes an instantly more capable defender. The Warriors have consistently turned even former negative defenders like McGee, Swaggy P, and Wiggins into serviceable or even decent defenders and a lot of that comes from Draymond’s mentorship and leadership on that side of the court. He makes sure everyone’s in the right place at the right time and will ride people hard to make sure they’re putting in the effort he expects on D."
"I thought Kevon looney was like 38, can't believe he's 25. Not even old enough to be a mentor to the young bloods."
Ay yo Kevon Looney has 2 titles
Kevon Looney in shambles.
You need to read and react perfectly to all 4 teammates to move off ball like Steph and Klay do. That takes years of chemistry and a ridiculous amounts of bball iq by everyone on the floor. There's a reason a guy like Kevon Looney has played so much for GSW.
Kevon Looney.
"&gt;Chris DeMarco, assistant coach: We had a road practice, got back to the hotel and he wanted to take a lap because it was New York City. He wanted to walk around, grab something to eat. We went to lunch and then on the way back, a reporter stopped us as we were walking by and asked us if we wanted to do an interview on scaffolding. I was in the middle of saying “No, we don’t live here,” and Klay just goes, “Yes.”  &gt;Kevon Looney, forward: He did the interview like he was just some local citizen.  Lmao [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyGcGV72ac) of the greatest moments in NBA history"
Would you like to play Steph at Center and Kevon Looney at point guard? There's your answer.
He’s like an athletic Kevon Looney. The East is in trouble now.
*Kevon Looney in shambles*
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.   Ante Žižić  Cody Zeller   Moritz Wagner  Nikola Vučević  Noah Vonleh     Omari Spellman    Dwight Powell        Kelly Olynyk         Nicolò Melli       Kevon Looney      Frank Kaminsky    Nikola Jokić      Willy Hernangómez  Dewan Hernandez       Harry Giles     Cristiano Felício      Andre Drummond    Ed Davis            Marques Bolden  Jonah Bolden         Ryan Anderson
Sure but it’s absolutely not his game. If Kevon Looney were a knockdown 3 point shooter it’d be a huge deal too.
Shaq was a rich man’s Kevon Looney
Only Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II have better shooting splits than Draymond this game.  I'm sure we all expected that of course
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
"ugh, fine, they can have Wiggins, Payton and Kevon Looney but we want Loon back in free agency"
"Kevon ""Andre Drummond on the boards""  Looney"
"2011 Game 1 Starting 5: Monta Ellis, Steph Curry, Dorrell Wright, David Lee, Andris Biedrins   2021 Game 1 Starting 5: Steph Curry, Jordan Poole, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney   This would actually be a really fun game.  2011/2012 Steph Curry was one year away from breaking out and becoming All Star caliber.  Monta Ellis and Jordan Poole are both high octane offensive guards with questionable defense.  Dorell Wright was a decent 3 and D wing that would match up well with Wiggins.  David Lee and Draymond Green are opposites in that David Lee was a fantastic offensive player with questionable D as opposed to Draymond's elite D and questionable offense.  Biendrins and Looney are both decent defensive players that don't add a whole lot offensively.   I will rock with this years team because it has the far superior version of Steph.  Wiggins is a better player than Wright was, though Wright was a better shooter and would far better now than he did then I think.  A lot of 2011 Warriors offense came from Ellis and Lee who were not 3 point shooters, so it would be interesting to see if they could score enough points to keep up."
"It took exactly one month to drop Wiseman from the starting lineup, the rookie was costing games and the offense was rolling with Loon out there in comparison, knowing when to screen/handoff/switch and the understandable chemistry/system fit.   Yeah if the Warriors win a lot more games than they lose with Kevon starting and Bjelica closing out, Steve isn’t going to fix something that ain’t broke. But if it’s obvious that Looney is hindering us to the tune of Ls, then Kerr isn’t immune to making a switch…eventually."
Does Kevon Looney have the shortest neck in the NBA?
Do the warriors realize there’s a reason Kevon Looney is wide open 10 feet from the hoop every possession
Kevon looney and DJ at the first points just as we expected
The Lakers are gonna try to swamp the boards against Warriors smallball-ish roster and lineups. I hope Kevon Looney ate his Wheaties this morning.
"kevon looney, lol  incidentally the only warriors starter that saw any minutes in that one game late last season where pelicans' only starter was eric bledsoe, and espn decided that wasn't good enough so they promoted it as steve kerr's warriors vs eric bledsoe's pelicans.  the disrespect! 😔"
"He'll play center in the right matchup, it doesn't make sense to bang down low against \**check's notes*\* Kevon Looney..."
"And that led to them slumping out of the playoffs against a team without their best player, because Gobert couldn’t score against 6’8 guys and the team wasn’t good enough playing defense against Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann while Gobert was forced to stand in a corner. Like I said there’s a cap on your teams success. Paying Gobert 40 million means Mitchell has to ascend to a top 5 player to compensate. Whereas when you use your maxes on players who can give you production (Giannis&amp;Middleton/ Bron&amp;AD/ Steph&amp;KD/ Harden&amp;CP3) you can have Kevon Looney or Brook Lopez or Clint Capela at center and be a better more dangerous team."
You should be more worried about your own team:  * Steph Curry has missed 115 games in the last five years due to various injuries  * Klay Thompson has missed each of the last two years and won't be back until December or January  * Wiseman missed half of last season and is at least going to miss the first couple months of this season with an injury  * Otto Porter Jr. has missed 120 games over the last three seasons with injuries  * Kevon Looney has missed 56 games in the last two years with injuries  * Andre Iguodala is older than anyone on the Lakers (which is saying something)  * Draymond Green has missed 47 games over the last 3 years with injuries
"You right, We are so lucky to have Kevon Looney"
kevon looney - loves looney tunes  source: trust me
"&gt;Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney   I strongly disagree with this. I think the 5 players would win.   The thing about these star players is that they force help defense from a second defender and create an imbalance. Defending them is about weighing up stopping them vs creating the imbalance.   If you have an extra player then you can help out while everybody else stays home.   And the 5 will get an open shot at the other end almost every time down."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
Kevon Looney has to carry a fair load until Wiseman comes back:
Remember when they said Kevon Looney was the x factor?
Jordan Poole Andrew Wiggins Otto Porter Jr Nemanja Bjelica Kevon Looney
"Big Three of Jordan Poole, Damien Lee, and Kevon Looney"
"kevon make 'em look silly,  looney tunes"
"and besides Kevon Looney is the role player the Warriors need. Literally for all of the dynasty Warriors have been running role player centers. Having elite talent at the 5 is literally the opposite of the identity that Steve Kerr and Curry/Klay/Draymond have been playing. It's been small ball. Yes they tried out Cousins, yes he was good, but they didn't NEED him."
"A talent like LaMelo would put everyone except All-Stars out of the starting lineup. Who're you gonna play in his place, Kevon Looney? A lineup of Steph Klay LaMelo Wiggins and Dray is mighty good on both sides of the ball."
"Kevon ""Groot"" Looney"
There was a very popular comment on r/nba that said Kevon Looney looks like a werewolf that has transformed 10%.  I can't find it.
All these people taking Capela don’t remember him getting outplayed by Kevon Looney in the playoffs twice I guess. He’s definitely better than Vuc defensively but not enough to make up for the offense. Dude cannot do a damn thing offensively without an elite playmaker on his team.
"Idk.  I’ve heard some theories that it’s because he used to work for the Griz and he has some grudges against the Warriors from his time there, but idk if I buy it.  I think it’s more that he just doesn’t watch Warriors games, at least not since KD left.    Some of his writings and predictions about the Warriors just make no sense when contextualized by recent events.  He predicted Damion Lee to be twice as impactful as Jordan Poole in the upcoming season.  He predicted Kevon Looney to be deep in our bench reserves despite the fact that he’s our second best big.  He talks about how limited our shot creation will be despite the fact that we have Steph, Wiggins, Poole, and now OPJ who are all more than capable of creating for themselves.  Hell, one of the things that just made no sense is he said that it would take an MVP level season from Steph to get us to the playoffs as an explanation for slotting us in at 9th, despite the fact that Steph was top 3 in the MVP race last year and has shown no sign of slowing down.    Given all that, it seems like he’s just skimming box stats for the Warriors without paying any attention to what’s actually going on on the floor."
"Kevon Looney taught me to have faith in Warriors player development.  Jordan ""the real Jordan"" Poole is confirming my faith."
Kevon Looney &gt; Mason Plumlee
"Only for Warriors fans, sorry   Kevon Looney is only 25  He looks 35 and I swear has been playing at least 8 years  Eric Pashall is 25"
"&gt; This is probably statistics noise, but a case can be made that late first round picks get picked up by play-off teams, thus landing in a place where they have a better chance at developing than say.. Minnesota or Sacramento (sorry, I had to).  From a Warriors perspective (more than a playoff team over the last several years) it's a pretty interesting take. Look at who we picked:  We have Jordan Poole at 28th who is looking to become a real NBA contributor and a possible 6th man of the year candidate. But the more interesting thing is guys like Jordan Bell (38) who is garbage now but was useful for us in the WCF and Finals in his rookie year. Damion Jones (30) who was never useful in the playoffs but definitely had a window where he was looking like he could be a solid guy for us. Patrick McCaw (38) who was clearly a playoff contributor when KD was hurt he had to start many deep playoff games and Finals in his rookie year and delivered. Useless now wherever he is. Kevon Looney (30) is our starting Center and was our best center option against James Harden and other teams who switched everything making traditional centers unusable. Draymond Green (35) don't need to say much there. My point being the guys that were pretty good for us, left and did nothing. I can't think of any of these guys doing anything beyond what they did for us while contending."
Kevon Looney is at least 5 years younger than you'd think
Kevon Looney  Fair: nothing he is a perfect NBA specimen  Unfair: potentially the most forgotten about player in the league
"Idk I think he’s pretty off base here, it’s clear we are going 82-0, 16-0 in the playoffs. Carried by FMVP, DPOY, First Team All-NBA Kevon Looney"
Diamond Stone (if that counts) and Kevon Looney are also Milwaukee boys. Sam Dekker and Henry Ellenson are also Wisconsin boys.

Kevon Looney
"In my defense it’s a 2 year old video where he does say that the training staff trotted out injured players, he just protected the idea that they do it knowingly.   He literally stopped Kevon Looney from playing after he was cleared for play time Bc of the warriors lax injury rehab"
Blazers had no answer for Dray’s short roll passing late in the fourth. Would get Kevon Looney lobs / dunks every time. Steph and Dray pnr was unstoppable.

"Kevon Looney is 25, so not sure if he counts. But he's a Mr Fundamentals type of center who doesn't rely on athleticism *at all*. So he could be a low end starter / high end backup C for the next decade"
I would say 25 year old Kevon Looney because he already plays like he's 65 but idk if he'll be able to move in 5 years
"Omfg Kevon Looney. He doesn't fight anyone, at least not since his service in the Spanish-American war."

Kevon Looney didnt get run off the court by cp3 in 2019.  You guys had one season going to the finals but you’re quick to call the dubs unproven
"It was a smart strategy in the 2019 finals when Stephs teammates were Quinn Cook, Alphonso Mckinnie and Kevon Looney.  Against this current squad its a stupid strategy.  Warriors have role players that can shoot and make plays now unlike 2019."

He does if he’s taking Kevon’s minutes. Kevon only plays center. Wiseman only plays center. The two are like never playing with each other unless there’s a rash of injury. The other players you named do have positional versatility on the other hand. Part of the Warriors identity at this point is to post small for portions of games. Wiseman playing 20mpg and Looney not being out of the rotation changes that as well.  If Wiseman isn’t replacing Looney’s minutes then he’s a situational play who may see his minutes yanked around depending on the mu. That’s what I’m saying.
"To be a net positive he doesn't have to be better than Kevon. That makes no sense. Is JTA not a positive because he's fight for minutes with OPJ, Kuminga, Beli? No, all those guys are positive. Warriors are just deep.  Looney isn't entirely pushed out of the rotation if Wiseman plays 20 mpg. There's room for more than one big on a team. Wiseman takes a few from Looney, Otto, Beli, and Dray at C minutes.   Wiseman isn't replacing any one player. He's just another piece to use in lineups."
"Just tuned in, I see Looney with the typical consistent Kevon Looney statlines #weneedwisemanback"
"Pretty much kicking Looney out the rotation then. I don’t see us doing that given his experience in our system and how good our lineups tend to be when he plays with Steph &amp; Dray. As I said, it’s a situational play as opposed to Wiseman outright being the better option. And as you can see by our record we’re not exactly desperate enough to just throw Wiseman out there hoping that he’s made a leap.  He needs to - curb his fouling, stick his screens, cut out the isolation work, develop chemistry with Curry to know how to find him and screen for him on his recollection threes (often not drawn up, but instinctual in our read and react offense. This is why Kevon is valuable), improve his spot up shooting, develop as a passer, bring physicality on both ends of the court seeking contact offensively and aggressively boxing out on the glass. That’s a lot. He’s 20, coming off an rookie year where he was one of the worst starters in the league and an offseason full of rehab. I’m just keeping expectations moderate for the kid."
"I agree that Wiseman is currently a net negative, but he's also not going to develop unless you give him minutes. Kevon Looney wasn't a positive player until the end of his 3rd season in 2018. Jordan Poole is looking much better this year (also his 3rd season) compared to previous years. Wiseman needs in-game experience against NBA competition."
Kevon Looney on the other hand..
"&gt; Every matchup, you for whatever reason believe Wiseman could contribute to would be better defended by Looney.   You have literally nothing to back that statement up. Looney is injury prone and thanks to his bad hips very immobile, he has great hands but has always struggled against aggressive bigs that finish at the rim because he is not a rim protector.  &gt; Just look at last season, consider the injury and be realistic for once.  While you ignore Kevon has be injured almost his entire career limiting his minutes? Sure bud.  &gt;And yea you got no reason to be mad. It seems that a lot of casuals like you see someone who is tall and assume he is going to be a defensive plus on a contender   You're literally the one saying this team is worse off, i.e. ""at it's peak"" with one *less* option at the 5. But sure, keep telling yourself our best shot is to run Draymond into the ground playing small ball center with no bench option to match up against a vertical threat."
"You don't understand what I'm saying.  Just beacuse Wiseman is tall doenst mean he is going to defend better than someone like Kevon. Loon is a good playoff proven defensive center. Every matchup, you for whatever reason believe Wiseman could contribute to would be better defended by Looney. Just look at last season, consider the injury and be realistic for once.  And yea you got no reason to be mad. It seems that a lot of casuals like you see someone who is tall and assume he is going to be a defensive plus on a contender, despite looking ever so lost last year and a meniscus tear throughout the offseason. Every NBA expert in the Warriors realm understood that a Wiseman contribution to a contending team is extremely unlikely, so yea call it a bad take said by me with a straight face lmao"
I fall asleep every night thinking about Kevon Looney setting screens.
A lot of people will say it’s cuz of Steph but it’s really Kevon Looney people tune in for
Ha this is what James Harden learned about Kevon Looney a couple years ago
He's not an all time great defender by any means but Kevon Looney is a very good defender while having the athletic ability of a geriatric sloth. I'm pretty sure I can jump higher and run faster than him
"Anchoring? That's a stretch. Yeah he's an above average rim protector on a very good defensive team. But that team was good on defense because of vogels scheme, lebron IQ, Caruso guard harassing, veterans understanding how to execute, as well as Anthony Davis' rim protection (where he got some spot help from Dwight and Javelle). He's good, but he's closer to Kevon Looney than he is Giannis as far as rim protection goes.   And he gets cooked way too often on the perimeter."
"FMVP lol.   Even if Dubs win a championship, FMVP will go to Kevon Looney or Wiggins most likely."
"Because you have Steph Curry? Because you don't need a ball-dominant point guard when you run a motion offense and *have Steph Curry*? Because you haven't had a decent true C since Andrew Bogut left?  We don't need Wiseman to be prime Hakeem out there. If he can be *Zaza Pachulia* only without *injuring so many of his teammates* that's enough.  Meanwhile a guy with his physical tools getting mentored by Draymond Green, Kevon ""would be a star if his body didn't betray him"" Looney and Andre Iguodala, now getting coached by the guy who taught Jokic how to play basketball, could be a future franchise centrepiece."
"i love kevon, but kevon looney"

"Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II should both be able to stay over 50% at low volume, considering most of their shots are layups and dunks and they almost only shoot when wide open.  Bjelica also has a chance to stay above 50% if his shot selection stays smart."
"Because KAT is in another stratosphere than Kevon Looney as a player. The things the Warriors could do on offense with KAT is absurd. Even with defense Looney is a good, switchable player but it's not like you're losing a DPOY back there. Plus with less of an offensive burden I wouldn't be surprised to see KAT improve on defense."
"As a Raps fan, I remember watching an injured Kevon Looney bricking open corner threes and thinking “god damn that could have been Klay or KD.”   I mean, that’s just how it works when two of the best shooters of all time go down, but ya, those years were especially top heavy"

Kevon Looney had 12 offensive rebounds wtf
"hey man, Kevon gets Looney in the paint, put some respect on that boy"
PatBev and Kevon Looney expressions got me in tears 😭
KAT will likely see Kevon Looney is his nightmares from now on
NOT Kevon Looney out rebounding KAT. Dude held it down..
"What a game for Wiggins and Edwards  KAT not having a good time tho, postered by Wiggins twice and getting outplayed by Kevon Looney"
"It's less the 7ft thing than having a defensively sound center with weight to throw around. Robert Williams and Kevon Looney are good examples of solid defensive centers who aren't super tall. Heck, Birch alone would have made a big difference. Siakam lost a good deal of weight in the last 7 months and that probably makes him more agile but I think he's less great at center compared to last year."
"Wiseman + Kuminga + Moody + Kevon Looney + Jordan Poole works, but that would fuck GS bench"
"I do feel like Ayton would be the x factor. He's a terrific defender but bigs can definitely look bad facing Steph Curry. On the other hand, he'd be a tough cover for anyone not named Draymond Green or a healthy Kevon Looney (which is very far from a certainty). Would be really interesting."
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
"Their transition D needs to be less ass for a prayer of that.  When Kevon Looney is beating your entire team back on the fast break, your transition D is *dogshit*"
"Kevon Looney and Nemenja Bjellica are our only Cs right now too, lol."
KEVON LOONEY IS THE GOAT IN AN ALT DIMENSION WHERE HE HAS WORKING HIPS
"Kevon Looney yelled ""THERE YOU GO!"" Jordan Poole gave a look of pleasant surprise. Nemanja Bjelica belted, ""WE GOT A [SERBIAN LANGUAGE] SQUAD NOW."" And before GP2 hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Steph Curry hugged him and said ""Y'all look so different."""
"No, they aren’t. Steph Curry is arguably the greatest offensive engine in NBA history. He’s basically made an entire career of making players better without even touching the ball. He is the Warriors entire offense. The Warriors would be utterly pathetic without him, but with him they remain at the top of the NBA.   Durant, Jokic, and Lebron (if he doesn’t decline) are right there with Steph, but to me Giannis doesn’t even compare. I understand why so many people want to anoint Giannis the best player. He’s dominant, a physical freak, puts up huge box scores, and most importantly… just won a championship. The problem is, I don’t think the Bucks were that impressive at all in their championship run with Giannis as their best player (specifically on offense). The Bucks offensive stats were pretty pathetic for a championship team with Giannis leading that offense. The Bucks won a championship despite their mediocre offense because of… let’s be honest here…injuries to other teams. I’m not hating on the Bucks here, but their (Giannis led) offense was just abysmal in that Brooklyn series and had Brooklyn been even remotely healthy they beat the Bucks. The Lakers injuries also decimated what was easily the 2nd best team in the NBA with 2 top 10 players and the length and defense perfectly equipped to completely shut down the Bucks mediocre offense.  I bring all of that context to say Giannis isn’t really great as a number 1 option on a team because of his limited offensive abilities. Assuming health across the NBA, that Bucks team isn’t winning another championship. Meanwhile Steph will drag a lineup of Damian Lee, 31 year old Draymond, and Kevon Looney to one of the leagues best records."
"Knox is alright but for me, as a Celtics fan, I'm more partial to the talents of Kevon Looney. I think we should send Tatum to the Warriors and rebuild our team around Looney's low post dominance"
"Known low post scorer Kevon ""old man hips"" Looney"
"Watch some of the warriors' games this season, it's obvious where Wiseman will play.    The warriors one loss this season, to Memphis, the turnovers were a big issue, Steph being triple teamed in the fourth and no one else being able to step up was a big issue, and Ja Morant being damn good at basketball was a big issue.    However, Steven Adams logging 10 first quarter points by BULLYING the warriors on the interior was a huge issue too.  The warriors struggled against the Lakers' bigs; did you see JTA trying to body AD?  That was ugly.  Zubic got what he wanted when the warriors played the Clippers.    The warriors, right now, have NO answer to big bodied 7 footers.  You know who you have to figure out if you want to win the western conference?  Jokic.  No one can stop him, but you need to slow him down.  Right now, with the warriors defense the way it is, they have zero answer for any of the huge bodied big men on other contenders.  You know who won the west last year?  Phoenix, the warriors have no answer for Dandre Ayton right now.    Wiseman doesn't have to win those matchups for the warriors to be significantly better, he just has to be better than Kevon Looney, whose giving up ridiculous amongst of height and reach to the behemoths of the west.  I love Loons, but he's not built to defend bully-ball centers, he's built to defend the Clint Capellas of the world.  Rudy Gobert, the center for the 5-1 Jazz, is way out of his paygrade.    Wiseman isn't developed enough to stop any of those guys either, but it will be harder to physically out-muscle a true 7 footer in the paint.  He just has to be able to do enough to tilt the outcome of the game a little.  The warriors are good already, it won't take much, but there's no way they are beating a team like Denver or Utah in the playoffs unless Wiseman is can play."
"Kevon Looney was also the 30th pick in the draft, not the 10th.  And he re-signed with a team that has recently won multiple championships vs a team that has won zero and has a well know cheapskate as owner."
Same with Kevon Looney
"Sometimes it’s just that their rookie contract is worth more than their value.   Anthony Bennet did that with the Timberwolves, Kevon Looney with the Warriors, Korkmaz with the 76ers.   It’s unlikely, but I’m just disputing the notion that there is zero advantage considering we have seen it practiced a few times for specific advantages in the past."
"Warriors declined Kevon Looney's option and re-signed him for cheaper, although it was a 4th year option not a 3rd year option and Looney had a ton of health issues on his rookie contract."
"If Kevon Looney moving a bit on screens is an issue to you, then you got bigger problems lol."
"Yeah, refs gotta help out superstar Kevon Looney."
