Cassius Stanley first dunk was robbed.  He jumped off his left leg then put the ball under that leg
"He's not correcting grammar, u/yusbishyus is trying to one-up u/OG3SpicyP by bragging that not only does he not know who Cassius Stanley is, he also doesn't know who Obi Toppin or Anfernee Simmons are.  Pretty much just bragging that he doesn't watch basketball."
"a lot of people think that dunk was a pedestrian eastbay.  It's one thing to put it between the leg that you didn't jump off of. Naturally when you jump off of one leg, your other leg raises up, and if you have a decent hangtime, you can put it between your legs in the time it takes for you to reacth dunking height.  It's another thing to do what Cassius Stanley did, which was put it under the leg he jumped off of.  That means after he jumped, he had to catch the ball with his right hand, have enough hangtime to switch his legs, while still going up, and have the height and hangtime to dunk it."
"I was told Cassius Stanley wanted to use a trampoline for one of his dunks, but it got stuck in the COVID protocol"

"Cassius Stanley has never dunked in an NBA game, and he is in the dunk contest"
i‚Äôm not gonna lie i thought cassius stanley played for michigan state
I got fake currency on Cassius Stanley because I liked his name. He better win
Cassius Stanley? Anfernee Simons? Really lol?
y‚Äôall just cause they aren‚Äôt big players doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt dunk üíÄ go look up Cassius Stanley HS mixtape
"Ah yes, now to watch Obi Toppin, Anfernee Simons and Cassius Stanley in the all star weekend dunk contest."
Who tf is Cassius Stanley
Cassius Clay oh no Stanley.
Haven‚Äôt heard Cassius Stanley since his HS days
Who the fuck is Cassius Stanley?
No disrespect but who is Cassius Stanley?
Cassius Stanley? Who he play for?
Does Cassius Stanley get any playing time at all? Feel like I've never heard of him in the league
"So you‚Äôre telling me. Derrick Jones, Lavine, Zion, Dwight, Connaughton, Diallo, DSJ, and Miles Bridges (more than those) all declined the dunk contest? Cant tell me there isn‚Äôt someone better than Cassius Stanley"
Who‚Äôs hype for.... *Cassius Stanley...* yo.. how many mf‚Äôs declined this shit? He has 22 career minutes..
"Cassius Stanley was a big name in HS during Zion‚Äôs time, but he got injured and fell off big."
Who tf is cassius stanley. Idk any of these dunk contest randys
How tf does a guy like Cassius Stanley make the dunk contest? You can‚Äôt tell me there wasn‚Äôt a semi decent dunker that actually gets minutes that would accept
Am I casual if I‚Äôve deadass never heard of a ‚ÄúCassius Stanley‚Äù no way that guy has more than like 50 total NBA minutes.
I hope so. Hell Cassius Stanley has literally never even made a dunk in an NBA game and is currently playing in the D League. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre just at the bottom of the barrel for who they can get in the dunk contest nowadays.
"Cassius Stanley and Obi Toppin, welcome to the 2020-21 Eastern Conference All-Stars!"
"Looks like a job for Cassius Stanley, already in town for the dunk contest"
"Its bc it‚Äôs always bums in the dunk contest, people wanna see Zion and Lavine, not fucking Cassius Stanley and Anferne Simons"
"If you don't think Cassius Stanley is a star, you shouldn't call yourself a Fort Wayne Mad Ants fan."
I dont even know who Cassius Stanley is
Cassius Stanley and Obi Toppin. I like that.
Cassius Stanley in shambles
I've never even heard of Cassius Stanley
Cassius Stanley has literally not dunked in an NBA game.
Bro who the fuck is Cassius Stanley
I 100% know he knows who Cassius Stanley. His job is to report on NBA but the amount of time he gives to college basketball is likely far more than the average fan. His life is reporting on NBA so of course he is going to say he doesn‚Äôt pay attention to college until near the draft.
Thought u meant Cassius Stanley.
It's all up to Anfernee Simons and Cassius Stanley to carry this dunk contest now.
Cassius Stanley was 20 when he graduated from HS.  I believe Devin booker was 18 when he was drafted.
"Tacko Fall and Cassius Stanley, 7‚Äô5 dude with a 46 inch vertical. Modern day wily"
"He said he doesn't want to be in it since Aaron Gordon was robbed last year, he also called out the scoring this year for the Cassius Stanley dunk."
For real. No disrespect to Cassius Stanley but dude plays like 4 minutes a game. Unless you‚Äôre really tapped in to the Pacers you have no idea who this dude is. Until big names start entering the contest it‚Äôs just not that interesting to most fans.
I‚Äôm okay with a lottery pick rookie doing it as a way to make a name for yourself but if you‚Äôve never dunked in an nba game (Cassius Stanley) idk why you should be in the contest.
So Cassius Stanley? Lol
"Trade for Derrick Jones Jr, Cassius Stanley and Dennis Smith Jr. The team will still tank, but there's going to be lots of highlight dunks to keep the fans interested. Add Poku, Bol Bol and Tacko as well, and watch ticket sales sky rocket."
Aaron Holiday regurgitates the ball for Cassius Stanley.
I listened to hundred of hours of podcasts about the draft because there was nothing else. I don‚Äôt even care about the draft. But now I have an opinion on Cassius Stanley.

I thought Cassius Stanley would be a steal that could be an instant end of rotation guy to bring energy to the bench unit. I thought that was his ceiling but I thought for sure he‚Äôd play significant minutes for a team from the start. He was so athletic and his jumper showed signs of life at Duke
10 Teammates separate the first man to ever score a point in the NBA and the most recent person ever to score a point in the NBA   Ossie schectman (first NBA basket) --&gt; Bud Palmer --&gt; Carl Braun --&gt; Bill Russell --&gt; Don Chaney --&gt; Mychal Thompson --&gt; Byron Scott --&gt; Reggie Miller --&gt; Jermaine O'Neal --&gt; Klay Thompson --&gt; Justin Holiday --&gt; Cassius Stanley (Last points in the IND/WAS game)
At least Cassius Stanley looked good :)
Cassius Stanley lmao
Here comes Cassius Stanley
"We are probably putting McDermott in the starting lineup, and giving guys lower on the rotation like Cassius Stanley more minutes."
Cassius Stanley had one of the best mixtapes ever
Cassius Stanley gets traded to the Lakers for a 2029 2nd round pick
Didn‚Äôt Cassius Stanley beat zions vertical record? But probably Ja imo
"Zion didn't attend the combine afaik. The 45"" vert was at Duke (and I think Duke is suspected to inflate those numbers. Cassius Stanley had a 46.5"" vert at Duke but only a 44"" at the combine for example)"
"Taking a wild swing and saying Cassius Stanley, but I‚Äôm not sure if he can on the Pacers.  Out of more popular names I say Kevin Porter Jr and Cam Reddish."
yall sleeping on cassius stanley
&gt;Vertical  &gt;Cassius Stanley  I'm taking Keon Johnson   &gt;3PT  &gt;Klay  I'm definitely taking Steph over Klay
Cassius Stanley. Im a sucker for epic slam dunks
"He ain‚Äôt play with KJ and SPJ, or Cassius Stanley, but your point still stands. The squad is loaded. This is really gonna be his show out year, him and Amari are probably the best two players unless I‚Äôm missing someone that transferred."
"Imagine Cassius Stanley losing out on 3 million (which is more than he makes in a season) because the dunk contest judges are bad at their jobs, which is to judge a gimmicky contest that shouldn‚Äôt carry much weight"
Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.
"Cassius Stanley is a 1 and done player from Duke entering his 2nd season. Devin Booker is coming off a Finals appearance, scored ~9,400 points and is entering his 7th season. Stanley is 22 and Booker is 24."
Played against Cassius Stanley when he was at Sierra Canyon ridiculous athlete and ran into the Mobley Twins twice during the CIF and an AAU tournament they were just too dominant. But the best player I ever played against was actually Dennis Schr√∂der at Ucla  I would like to say I'm pretty quick and agile on the defensive end but guarding dennis is a whole different ball game. His first step and change of pace was just too much
Cassius Stanley was robbed.
"Keep Westbrook.  Trade James to Cleveland for K-Love.  Grab Cassius Stanley and Dorsey and a bunch of other fuckers born in LA.  Trade Unibrow for Lonzo Ball.  Hire Steve Lavin as head coach.    Trade all the other pieces for Klay Thompson. Then sign Jason Kapono. Make both Kapono and Thompson wear headbands, and let the announcers try to figure out which one is which.   Lose Championship #18 to the Hornets in 5."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
Cassius Stanley about to drop an imaginary triple double
"Yeah and the comparison makes no sense because of how far ahead Luka is.  Shit is like comparing Cassius Stanley to Michael Jordan, it's just that MJ is way ahead of him."
I played against Cassius Stanley and was switched onto him for a possession. He iso‚Äôd then missed the jumper. We never matched up on another possession and Ive never guarded another NBA player.  I will always say I shut down an NBA player.
