Full Injury Report:  Luka Doncic (Hand Injury)   Kristaps Porzingis (Face Injury)   Tim Hardaway Jr (Face Injury)
On my mama cuh  Kristaps Porzingis is crying into his French Frank body pillow rn
"Watching the game last night, Kristaps Porzingis is the biggest blame. He got outplayed by Juwan Morgan, and the team as a whole, was awful at defensive rebounding. He was one of the worst.  When the Mavs defender got screened by Gobert, Kristaps let Ingles, who has been on fire from downtown, open from 3 instead of closing out. They play Golden State next week, and I have 0 doubt Steph is licking his chop to shoot on Kristaps if he doesn't close out. Like that is embarrassing to not close out, especially against a team who has been hot from downtown the majority of the regular season.  Don't get me wrong, the rest of the Mavs weren't great on defense either. But Kristaps was just the biggest offender of bad defense that entire game."

I think we won if this continues."

Are...Are you kidding? Why are you people so quick to forget? Kristaps Porzingis was All-Star caliber for most of last season and was fantastic in the bubble.
"Don't let this distract you from the fact that Gobert is Porzingis' daddy. In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded 150 points (21.4ppg) on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field."
"Fun fact: In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded 150 points (21.4ppg) on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field."
"Lu Dort  Hear me out before downvoting. He's definitely a great contract value but I see as many or more posts/highlights for him than guys like Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, KAT, DeAndre Ayton, De'Aaron Fox, etc."
"I think Kristaps Porzingis is his estranged, long-lost son. Unicorn looks like a 7 foot tall Steve Kerr, it’s absurd!  As for Kerr’s coaching, I think he’s pretty good."
&gt; kpj   Kristaps Porzingis Junior?
"Yup, because TS truly encapsulates a player's worth. Why do we even need scouts anymore when we have bball reference? Luka has had all the spacing in the world to help increase his TS the past 5 games, with superstar talents in the starting lineup like Rookie Josh Green, end of bench piece Wes Iwundu, vet min Willie Cauley Stein, and injured Tim Hardaway with the recent addition of rehabbed Kristaps Porzingis!"
i love Kristaps Porzingis
"You really going out here disparaging Jaren as hard as you can. You haven't even acknowledged the rest of my comment, and a simple google search or watching a game would show that he is elite defensively, but fouls often. The reason he doesn't rebound is because he doesn't need to, as I said. He excels as a shot blocker, and a transition / perimeter offensive threat. He's got great handles, finishes ~70% at the rim and 40% from three, both on above average attempts, and a 5% block rate. In comparison, Rudy Gobert, one of the best shot blockers in the game, has a career high of 7%. He can defend, both perimeter and interior, and runs the floor. You comparing him to Steve Novak and Andrea Bargnani, one-dimensional players, doesn't do any justice when you think about the impact that Jaren really has. 2 DWS in the past season, and a neutral defensive box plus minus isn't exactly an insane net negative on the court. You just need to stop looking at him through shit-covered lenses and realise that he's a good player, and that his role is different to Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis or any other big man in the league. He isn't just tall and shoots 3's, he's a versatile perimeter and interior defender, and an offensive threat wherever he is."
One lightly used Kristaps Porzingis.
Looking like Kristaps Porzingis out there
"Yeah, Kristaps Caldwell-Porzingis"
"He’s basically store brand Harden.   The rockets have shown that even with elite talent and a roster specifically curated to complement heavy iso play in a heliocentric team, it’s unlikely to win a championship with that style. When all your sets are designed around one player, it becomes painfully predictable and while it’s passable in the regular season, it falls apart in the playoffs. And good lord if that star player is having an off shooting night, that game is a write off because the team only knows how to play through that player. I like that Luka studied Harden and mimics his step back, foul drawing, and driving techniques, but also involves the entire team and knows to take a step back and let Porzingis get to work. I know Trae doesn’t have a Kristaps caliber player on his team but he should also defer to his 2nd best player and let him get his touches so he can warm up.  Harden can also play D when he needs to, he just coasts in the regular season. Luka desperately needs to use his size advantage but he does have all the tools to become at least a decent defender, though his positional mismatch is so large that he can really become an elite defender if he got a bit more athletic. Trae doesn’t have the length or the defensive IQ to be even a neutral defensive asset."
That missed three in the last 10 seconds by Kristaps Porzingis was the absolute single worst bricked shot I have ever seen. Good grief it barely scraped the bottom left corner of the backboard.
"I’ll sum them up for you. They have Luka Doncic who is already reaching superstar level. They also have his other teammate, Kristaps Porzingis. Both are good. Rest of the team is good and they have a chance at proving themselves in the playoffs."
ever heard of kristaps porzingis?
Kristaps “the DMR” Porzingis
World is a better place when Kristaps Porzingis is playing basketball
DeAndre Jordan for Serge Ibaka. Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyrie Irving for Wendall Carter? Kristaps Porzingis. Jarret Allen.  I think WSC is Wendall Carter. None of this shit is realistic.
"&gt; You’re just wrong and don’t understand basketball.  &gt; It’s evident most people on the sub are ignorant about the nba.  &gt; It’s 2021. Offense is valued over defense.  &gt; Let’s play a game here of what would you rather have with health not being a factor:  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Kristaps Porzingis?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Vucevic?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or KAT?  &gt; You take each of these centers over Gobert based on overall skillset.  &gt; Gobert is considered a better defender than all of them, yet we wall know he’s worse than all of these centers because he’s complete ass on offense.  &gt; Being highly skilled on offense and below average on defense is by far more valued than highly skilled on defense and below average on offense. Also, all the centers I listed aren’t terrible on defense either, just slightly worse or moderately worse than how Gobert is perceived.  &gt; Come playoff time, Gobert and every other unskilled offensive big man are useless on offense and a huge liability.  &gt; The Deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard centers are a thing of the past now.  So people know what this tantrum post is in reference to. This dude is upset that I didn't agree with him."

"I'll give you credit, because people tend to under-value Porzingis' influence on Luka.  Our team with and without KP is night and day different.  Luka needs the spacing to create, and Dwight Powell (and Maxi and whoever else) is a far cry from Kristaps."
Seriously. People can't say Kristaps?  2 syllables. Can say it like.... Chris....stops.   Saying Porzingis is harder lol.

"Lol I don't give a fuck about my experience relative to theirs, anybody who has Kobe Bryant as the greatest player ever is a nostalgic moron. It doesn't take much to see that. Michael Jordan alone was just straight up much better, and he alone automatically eliminates Kobe from the greatest ever title.  Players are not the ultimate authority on anything. Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley were both top 15 players ever and cry nonstop about how teams are shooting too many threes and about how guys like Kristaps fucking Porzingis should post up. Magic Johnson had LeBron James on his team and said ""fuck spacing"" in favor of constructing a meme team around him."
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"People think way too hard about the label of star and superstar, IMO. I think your assessment is the right one, mainly just based on how the word is most frequently used. “Mavericks star forward Kristaps Porzingis” isn’t raising any eyebrows, regardless of where you’ve got him ranked in your top 100 players. To cross sports a bit, neither is “superstar wideout Odell Beckham Jr.,” regardless of how he’s performed with the Browns. If you’ve become a household name or even close to it, you’re a superstar, full stop."
"Also gotta add that Chris Webber loves saying blatantly wrong information. Last game we had with him, he was talking about Kristaps Porzingis being a very good passer. But KP has never even averaged more than 1.8 assists per game lol"
"I mean more like when a guy is a one time all star you don't hear ""all star Goran Dragic"" or ""All Star Kristaps Porzingis"" but you can hardly say Conley's name without a comment about how he's been snubbed his whole career."
I don't buy that at all.  He's a top 5 help defender but he's only average on ball.  His best defense on ball are against stretch bigs like Porzingis.  He still did the best job I've ever seen defending Kristaps.

"Huh? Kristaps’ numbers are across the board better than Gary Trent Jr.’s. Trent Jr. is averaging 15 points per game while Porzingis is averaging 20.5 points per game. I think you’re underestimating how big of a loss McCollum has been for Portland, yet you would never that they are down key pieces by looking at their record.

We're #11 in the West right now, but we've won 4 of the last 5, so it's looking up.

And ""often-injured"" is hilarious when you're talking about Kristaps ""literally never finished a season healthy"" Porzingis.    &gt; Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Bottom line is that the blazers have been missing their 2nd AND 3rd best players for 12 out of the 23 games, have missed Zach Collins the whole season, and Derrick Jones Jr, Covington, Hood, Nassir, Anfernee have all missed more than one game.   &gt; to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Well that's just a flat lie because Tim Hardaway has literally played 24 games lmao.  They played maybe one game with no starters?  So same as us."

"We aren't but a big reason why we'd win the series is that KP is so incredibly soft. In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded averages 21.4ppg on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field, 13.6 rebounds and 2.9 blocks.       In their recent head to head this season Gobert dropped 29/20 on the lanky pillow pet.      If the Jazz matched up with the Mavs in round 1 we'd be winning in three games due to our pick and rolling prowess that Zingis has no way of containing."

"How tf did you get all of that from me calling Dwight the better lob threat and pnr partner lol?   You said  &gt; Lol what on earth is Dwight doing without the ball  And to answer that, he’s doing much more infact. Joel is good at lobs but Dwight is an all time great lob threat, many even consider him the best. Not to mention one of Embiid’s biggest knocks is that he isn’t a great pnr big, something you don’t have to even think about with Dwight. Shooting is great but when you’re taking 3 threes w gane ...  And yes lol, DeAndre Jordan is the better offball center, with the ball Joel is a million times better, but you don’t even know the wonders guys like DeAndre Jordan, Shawn Kemp, Amare Stoudemire, and Dwight do for their PGs. Joel is good but you’re hyping him up like he’s Anthony Davis or Kristaps Porzingis off the ball"

"I want some size! **Ben Simmons - Paul George - Kristaps Porzingis** (only for 3-pointers and back-up defender) - **Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert** (for me Mitchell number 1 at Jazz because of usage and his clutch time role). Maybe it's not most powerfull team, but I would watch this team play once!"
"The West is the biggest crapshoot. Like the 7th and 8th seeds this year are two of the scariest teams in the playoffs now (assuming GSW gets the 8th seed), it's going to be a blood bath to the finals, probably multiple 7 game series. So many single all star teams with players just playing out of their mind. A healthy Lakers becomes immediate favorites to come out of the West and could knock out PHX. GSW actually has it in them to knock out Utah especially if Gobert and Mitchell are hurt. But then there's still the freaking Clippers, Portland, Denver and oh yeah the young GOAT Luka and a potentially healthy and resurging Kristaps Porzingis. The outcome of this years playoffs is going to change so many narratives, CP3 legacy changing, Kawhi and PG13 legacy changing, Gobert legacy changing, LeBron and AD legacy setting if they do it, same for Steph Curry. It might not change much for Jokic's legacy but it could change the story for MPJ if he really shows up, it could completely overhaul the way Denver thinks about the future with Murray and MPJ. If Luka has a deep run it's going to set him up to be the new face of the league."
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
"Centers that are definitely better than Ayton right now:   - Embiid  - Jokic  - KAT  - Gobert  - Bam   - AD   - Vucevic   - Capela   - Sabonis     Centers that are arguably as good when healthy:   - Christian Wood   - Jusuf Nurkic   - Kristaps Porzingis   - Jonas Valančiūnas      So at best Ayton is what, the 10th best center in the NBA? It's definitely debatable if he's top 10 or not. I'd say probably 10th or 11th."
Kristaps Porzingis.
"Unless Kristaps stops having DNP's every third game for the rest of eternity, he doesn't fit anywhere tbh  I've been cursorily paying attention to the Mavs this year.  I can't understand how anyone can trust they'd have a healthy Porzingis in the playoffs, which is really all you're paying him for"

"&gt;KD is one we thought we wouldn’t see for a while, but Kristaps Porzingis is playing similarly, as well as Michael Porter Jr..   How do these guys play like KD? They don't have his handle, mid-range game, MPJ can't create his own shots, they're built like KD but play nothing like him."
"You’re probably right Zion and Adams are preventing him from getting to the rim more. He did it better in LA for sure.   He is a much better 3 pt shooter than Derozan but he also doesn’t have Derozan’s foul drawing game. Demar was more efficient on average. Both are around the same level of passer. I could see BI surpassing derozan but not by a huge amount.   Kristaps is such a wildcard health-wise I certainly wouldn’t trade Ingram for him. Ingram has proven he can stay healthy. But I don’t think Ingram is far better as a player. I think both top out as the third best guy on a title team, but Porzingis can fill that role better due to his defense and utility as a screener and roll man. If it weren’t for health concerns I’d probably have Zinger over BI. Zinger can be that Chris Bosh type third option. Ingram to me due to not being a great passer and not having a super efficient shot profile won’t be a great enough offensive player to differentiate him IMO.   I’d love to have more great players in the league so I hope he proves me wrong!"

What if the Knicks trade back for Porzingis to form a ‘big ball’ lineup?

Not ""allowing him to work with him"" but the level of access he had. Also have read this more than once in some form [""The Knicks had four coaches during Porzingis' tenure, former president Phil Jackson strongly considered trading him, and he received pushback for working with his physiotherapist, Manolo Valdivieso.""](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862270-the-porzingis-plot-inside-the-deal-that-could-haunt-the-new-york-knicks-forever)  &gt; but I haven't heard from him since  Yeah I think that's kind of the point though, all these issues you no longer hear about. The Mavs have satisfied him. And this Janis stuff had been a thing for a long time before he got traded from the Knicks, there were reports about Janis and Phil Jackson having problems back in spring of 2017 it didnt just all come out after the trade.   &gt; Didnt Carlisle openly say KP in the post is a bad play and they arent gonna run it?  That whole quote was him having KPs back and defending him, talking about how the ""post up is outdated and not efficient"" to deflect issues KP was having there. No matter what lip service he gives publicly, Carlisle damn well knows it's not a good thing teams can get away putting 6'6 wings on KP because he has no way to punish them. It's part of what's stunted his development."

"Basically, when he left the Knicks, Kristaps decided to burn pretty much every bridge that he had with Knicks fans. Granted, I KNOW how bad Steve Mills was as our President, but at the same time Porzingis was NO saint.     Things that happened during KPs departure saga:     \- He'd retweet stuff about how he planned on getting traded to the Mavs when he was going against Luka.   \- Skipped out on exit meetings instead of trying to communicate his dissatisfaction with the franchise...then acted surprised when he got traded.   \- Never actually communicated to our front office himself and instead would get his brother to speak on his behalf. That way, when the media inevitably brought something up, he could deny it.   \- Speaking of his brother, Kristaps requested that his brother have a high position in the Knicks front office despite Janis having even less experience than Steve Mills in all things basketball front-office related.   \- Got into legal trouble a few times (I remember there was a fight and then a sexual assault accusation).   \- Threw shade at Fizdale who, while an awful coach, always sung KPs praises in the media and didn't deserve to catch a stray from KP.     ...and of course, whenever he got traded, the media &amp; r/nba absolutely BASHED the Knicks organization for making the trade, called Knicks fans stupid, awful, and blamed us as to why the Knicks would never land high-profile free agents.     So, after all that...Knicks fans are a little bit more than sensitive when it comes to all things KP-related."
Mavericks Center Kristaps Porzingis OUT (Sore Left Arm)
Luka Doncic - 1 tech per game   Kristaps Porzingis - 1 surgery per season   Willie Cauley-Stein - 1 missed alley oop per games
Literally Kristaps Porzingis in 2018. Shot 40% from 3 and was arguably the best rim protector in the entire league that season. It's why he was called the unicorn.
Your favorite team got trade raped by Steve fucking Mills and now you’re being willfully dishonest about what the Knicks got out of the trade to try and make it look bad for them. Randle and Morris were signed with the cap space created in the trade which offloaded Hardaway and Courtney Lee. Randle is significantly better and healthier than Porzingis and Morris was traded for Immanuel Quickely who is an elite rookie. Smith was flipped for Rose who has clearly improved the team since his arrival and we still have your next two 1sts which will prevent you from continuing to build around the actual superstar talent you have on your roster while you waste $30M per year on the injured fraud.   Randle + Quickley + Rose + ‘21 1st + ‘23 1st &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; giving Kristaps Porzinjured $150M guaranteed. Cry about it lol. Go Knicks.

"Everything is partly luck. The goal is minimize your luck. If you run a team consistently and effectively, you'll often walk out of those it could either way situations on the right end. Losing so you hope you can luck into a high draft and hopefully you get lucky the pick turns out to be good is an awful way to run a team.   Also ask yourself this, why did Curry potentially not want to go to Minnesota? Why did D'Angelo Russell and Kristaps Porzingis not want to go to Philly? Players aren't interested in a process (Embiid is a human meme, he wouldn't really be happy playing on a team winning 15 games), nor should teams want players they want to be in a process.   There's a difference between not making moves that impact your future (meaning trading picks or assets to make a run for the 8th seed) vs. not trying to squeeze out every win with your current squad. The teams that do the latter are not going to be good teams."

I agree. The team might do fine in the regular season but as long as Kristaps Porzingis is getting paid big money by the Mavericks I do not expect them to win a title or make the finals or conference finals in that window. 30MM+ is just too much a franchise blunder to overcome.  The new GM has a tough job.
"Ironic.  &gt; Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. **It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry** and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason.

"They should just fire Nelson for these terrible moves. At some point the credit given for drafting Luka has to run out.   &gt;Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
"Dallas announced Voulgaris’ hiring in the fall of 2018 with a title — director of quantitative research and development — that vastly understated his actual role. Multiple league and team sources tell The Athletic that Voulgaris has been the most influential voice within the Mavericks front office since joining the team, either initiating or approving virtually every transaction made over the past two seasons. Those same sources add that Voulgaris has frequently gone as far as scripting the starting lineups and rotations for longtime head coach Rick Carlisle.  That influence has spanned Doncic’s three seasons in Dallas. While he had been drafted prior to Voulgaris’ arrival — Donnie Nelson, the team’s longtime president of basketball operations, was the driving force behind trading up to acquire the Slovenian wunderkind, a process he described in detail to The Athletic last year — Cuban had sought out Voulgaris’ basketball advice in the years before putting him on the team’s payroll. As one team source says, “Mark Cuban is the most powerful person in the organization, but whoever he’s listening to is second.” Cuban was won over by Voulgaris’ vision: an analytics-driven spread pick-and-roll offense with Doncic as the focal point which he has tried implementing in the past seasons.  It’s unclear when the Cuban and Voulgaris relationship began, but their coming together is perhaps unsurprising given Cuban’s origin as a self-made tech billionaire whose first major purchase was the Mavericks. Voulgaris has never been shy about his desire to run a team. In an ESPN feature from 2013, Voulgaris is quoted as saying, “The whole process (of becoming a highly successful gambler) has led me to believe that I’d be able to put together a better team than almost any general manager in the league. If not maybe all.”  The way Voulgaris tells it — the ESPN feature is the only notable reporting ever focused on him, and he declined an interview request from The Athletic shortly after being hired — he began gambling on the NBA in the late 1990s and had made millions by the early 2000s. His success, he says, came in part from an instinctual reading of certain coaches. It finally failed him during the 2003-04 season, causing him to lose much of his gambling wealth and step away temporarily, only returning once he’d developed an analytics model that brought back his old edge. He says he did exactly that, his new model beating the odds at a rate higher than five percent. In 2009, he gave up gambling again to consult for an unnamed NBA franchise. The advisory role lasted one season; he returned to his previous life afterward and began publicly promoting himself. In the coming years, he became a well-known presence in the basketball world.  Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says.

What I gather from the PG and Kristaps Porzingis is that people are mostly unserious/exaggerating in their clowning of PG but the memes/jokes about Porzingis are largely a legitimate reflection of how people see him as a player. Would this be a wrong assessment?

"Lol I think people are missing the point.  13/5/1 aren't bad numbers if you're, say, Jae Crowder. If you're former all-star and purported second star to a contending team Kristaps Porzingis, those numbers are really, really bad. Look how the Bucks are getting thrashed with an 18ppg guy as their second option. The Mavs can only dream of being thrashed by the best team in the league in the second round right now."
Kristaps Porzingis
"increases or stays the same. Players that are tall are learning to handle the ball at point guard levels now. Ben Simmons is an anomaly now but players are going to learn to dribble better and faster at earlier ages. Aleksej Pokusevski, Bol Bol, and Kristaps Porzingis are all 7 foot shooting guards. Cade Cunningham is a 6’8 point guard. Not saying that they are that good but there is a trend."
So many ways to spell Kristaps Porzingis
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Paul George  SF: Julius Randle  PF: Giannis Alphabet  C: Kristaps Porzingis
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
"""...and to take his place is Kristaps Porzingis."""
Did Giannis join the group chat with Kristaps Porzingis and Anthony Davis or something? How did this guy get so passive overnight?
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kristaps Porziņģis. His production is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical advanced analytics most of his contributions will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kristaps' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his style of play - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Carmelo Anthony, for instance. The Porzingis stans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his plays, to realise that it's not just bricking 3's - they say something deep about LIFE.  Someone finish this for me."
"&gt; ""Teams are scared off by the money""  Ever heard of the Grizzlies? Mavericks could do some magic and make Kristaps Porzingis the new Chandler Parsons. Trade KP and assets for JV and Winslow."

So is that trade considered Kyle Kuzma for a taller Kyle Kuzma? Or is it Kristaps Porzingis for a smaller Hingus Pingus?
i bet if you swap marcus morris and kristaps porzingis on those two teams the mavs win
"I didn’t watch any mavs games this season, but from what I gather knowing Kristaps he’s a tad bit of a diva. I’m also thinking the reason he’s not getting involved as much is cause he’s not doing much to really warrant the team to wanna involve him more.  There’s still shit Luka needs to do but Porzingis needs to know he’s the 2nd fiddle and he should find ways to make himself work better for this current system.  A duo like Luka and Kristaps should be dropping consistent 55-60pt+ a night, where the scoring is rather even between the two."

"&gt; Kristaps Porzingis reportedly feels like ""an afterthought"" in Dallas amid the rise of Luka Doncic.  &gt; Tim MacMahon of ESPN reported Porzingis has been ""frustrated"" at not being looked at as a true co-star to Doncic, who gets the lion's share of the praise and touches in Dallas. Mavericks governor Mark Cuban has previously admitted Doncic and Porzingis are not friends off the floor, comparing the situation to Dirk Nowitzki's relationship with Jason Terry when they first played together.  that's literally the whole article"
"It's fair to say luka is a pretty good facilitator given his assists average. If Porzingis isn't getting enough touches we can say the problem is on his shoulders and not on luka's. I'm pretty sure if kristaps played as a proper big other than a below average shooting guard he would be more involved in offense. The guy is 7-3 and averaged 5.4 rebounds in a playoff series, fuck him."
No. They lost because Kristaps Porzingis is not a #2 option any more.

"yeah CJ's value gets underrated (maybe not by a lot, but by some margin) due to his defensive deficiencies and some playoff no-shows. But he's still a very good player with a modern skillset and it's no coincidence he's been part of top-tier offenses with Portland. He's a guard who can create his own shot and shoots 9 threes a game at 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? In a league where shooting efficiency is more important than ever, that's still valuable, even if it comes in a package that's not built to be a defender. Peep the advanced stats - they still paint CJ as a very solid, positive player (and not as bad on defense as fans make him out to be). The problem is that he may not fit well next to Dame.  A few trade targets I see:  * Jimmy Butler — would require many additional assets and is 100% contingent on whether the Heat want to pay Butler a massive contract. Very likely they will. Jimmy would be a great complement to Dame as a secondary ball handler and defender, but CJ's volume 3pt shooting would be missed. * Jerami Grant — would require some additional assets and contingent on Detroit looking to flip a player they for value. Grant is still somewhat unproven. He turned into an offensive creator in Detorit and after a hot start saw his efficiency dip, as well as his defense. But he has solid size, a varied skillset, and generates 6+ FTAs, something Portland lacks outside Dame. Blazers could bet on him taking another step by becoming more effecient as a second option. * Tobias Harris + Matisse Thybulle — 76er fans will probably instantly nix the inclusion of Thybulle. That's fair. But it could be a very attractive package for Portland, and would be worth additional assets to bring in a complementary scorer and versatile defender. A third team may need to get involved to provide value to Philly. * Kristaps Porzingis + Josh Richardson — call me crazy, but I think KP has become a distressed asset whose potential is actually underrated. The Mavs let Luka go full Harden-ball, leaving his teammates standing like statues beyond the arc. (That's fine, Luka's good enough to justify that). But skilled bigs require more creativity to use and the Mavs showed no interest in getting KP involved through DHOs (something Portland loves), elbow face ups (where KP's height can really shine) or screening actions (another Blazer fave). This move is a big gamble, but Portland has kept its powder dry for years. Time to take a swing. If it misses, it means Dame time has run out. But that window is closing anyway."

"Kristaps  ""throw in"" Porzingis"
"Dallas has got Luka on a STEAL of a contract, and they used this windfall to give the max to...Kristaps Porzingis."
"From a [2020 article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2878938-which-stars-can-be-trusted-with-post-ups-in-todays-nba):  ""Stop Posting These Guys Up  After a Dallas Mavericks win over the San Antonio Spurs earlier this season, Kristaps Porzingis received harsh criticism for his lack of play in the post. It is easy to look at his 7'3"" frame and think he'd be a dominant post player, but that has never been the case since he joined the NBA in 2015.  Porzingis' best-ever PPP in the post was 0.96 in the 2017-18 season, which is when he tore his ACL. This season, he has the league-worst PPP on post-ups including passes at 0.76 on 140 possessions. Posting up is just not Porzingis' game, and Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle made it clear that he agrees: ""A post-up is not a good play anymore. It's just not a good play. It's not a good play for a 7'3"" guy. It's a low-value situation."""
The problem is that they wanted Kristaps Porzingis but got Tingus Pingus
Good series. But who was the giant 7 feet 3 guy who threw away the ball constantly? And where was kristaps porzingis?
he tricked y'all man starting lineup  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam  Kristaps Porzingis  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
"Trade Porzingis plus the worse version of him (Kleber). Need a big, doesn't necessarily need to be a stretch, and a secondary ball handler/playmaker.  Possible trade: Kristaps + 2 firsts (maybe add a second) for Chris Boucher and Fred Vanvleet"
"6 bench points? Brutal. Also playing a corpse of Kristaps ""limited minutes restriction now and then"" Porzingis 43 minutes."
"May I introduce you to Kristaps ""Pippen"" Porzingis"
Trading for Kristaps Porzingis was also the right move for the Mavericks
Worse contract: Kristaps Porzingis or Kemba Walker?
Luka needs help in the worst way; 16-11 &amp; 0/5 from 3 in game 7 from your $30million “unicorn” doesn’t cut it. Kristaps Porzingis gotta go.
Worse contract: Kristaps Porzingis or Kemba Walker?

“yeah but imagine if it went in tho” - kristaps porzingis
"I forgot Mavs had a supposed ""second star"" in kristaps porzingis, that dude is incredibly overrated..."
"People always on PG13's ass, yall need to roast that scrub Kristaps Porzingis for wasting Luka's time..."
"Sign and trade Oubre &amp; Wiseman for Porzingis.  I think Kristaps could work well in Golden State under Steve Kerr's tutelage.    Mavs get another wing defender in Oubre, and a young Wiseman to develop with Luka."
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.

Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19709279/boston-celtics-new-york-knicks-discuss-trade-offers-kristaps-porzingis  Look at the names and picks that were being thrown around there.

Khris Middelton and Kristaps Porzingis make a combined 335 million dollars.
He made a whole YouTube series I think about it a few summers ago. He works with this crazy scam artist: https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmqdme/meet-carlon-colker-the-personal-health-guru-behind-kristaps-porzingis
"Kristaps Porzingis. Guy just can't stay healthy. If you can't play 60% of the season every year, how good are you? The team can't rely on you to win. John Eall has sadly fallen into this category as well, and if Kyrie can't get healthy over the next couple years, he's about to fall into this category too."
"Kristaps Porzingis. Everybody focused on his bad offense preference in this year playoffs, but his real issue is lack of any defense. Even 6'1 guards can score on him in the paint effortless."
"May be a weird one but would be fun in today’s NBA:   PG: Fred Brown  SG: Michael Redd  SF: Dale Ellis  PF: Cliff Robinson  C: Kristaps Porzingis  Real answer would probably be Cassell, Iggy, Artest, AK47, Cliff"
"In the NBA reincarnation system Laimbeers's game has subsequently been  split into PJ Tucker (post defense), Kristaps Porzingis (shooting) and Patrick Beverley (general demeanor)."
Pretty cool Jason Kidd will be coaching his former teammate Kristaps Porzingis
"&gt; With the Bucks, Kidd deployed an overly aggressive defense that would put the unit in compromising positions…Kidd benefited from the opportunity to learn from one of the top defensive minds in the NBA, Frank Vogel, during his stint as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers.   Sounds promising  &gt;The personnel that Kidd has to work with is far from ideal, especially when comparing to the Lakers. There is a severe gap in impact when going from Anthony Davis to Kristaps Porzingis as a defender, in general, but especially as a rim protector.  That is a severe understatement"

Who is Kristaps Porzingis
PG: Greivis Vasquez  SG: Kevin Martin  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Kristaps Porzingis  C:  Hassan Whiteside
"Yeah it's like having Kristaps Porzingis as a ""center"". If your center is 7+' but can't protect the paint, can't rebound, and can't punish smaller players inside, then functionally he's just an unusually tall wing."
"Honestly? I think they could make a run.   Assuming the reports of Lillard demanding a trade are true, if the Trail Blazers decide they need to do a full rebuild OKC can just throw picks at them (this is also assuming Portland just takes the best offer and doesn't care about where Lillard wants to go). Given OKC's vast amount of assets, I think they might also be able to get Ben Simmons and Kristaps Porzingis, especially considering how their asking prices probably aren't that high.   A lineup of Lillard, SGA, Dort, Simmons, Porzingis would certainly be a playoff team, and if SGA takes another step and both Simmons and Porzingis have the scoring pressure taken off of them and can focus on taking quality shots, they could very well make a championship run"
"Then defenses would be fine with small guard/forward mismatches during a post up. He still has length and instead of relying on point of contact too much take advantage of his greater reach and height requiring a disparity of movement for the guard (left to right pivot is quick for KP but would take 2-3 steps for the smaller guard to catch-up).   Again “hee-haw” and if I was supreme master of the universe I would automatically make every person and automaton that said “kristaps porzingis” be voiced in a toddler-like manner.  Let’s break it down.  “Kwistaps Poe-zing-wus”. Immediately followed by a giggle, burp or coo-like noise.  Hee-haw in advance bc the rebuttal will be “he doesn’t know that”."
"Boylen messed up his development and now he's mentally restricting himself to shoot 3s.   He can't defend, rebound or playmake to save his life. Get's hunted on switches and is too slow to play the 4. All he does us shoot 3s which tbf, he is doing it well at 40% on 6 attempts. He rarely attacks the rim or posts up   He is the Kristaps Porzingis of the east"
"The offence is fine, as long as KP doesn’t try to create his own shot.  [The defence is the problem ](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155) because (especially after the most recent surgery) all KP can do is drop, and Luka is bad at drop coverage. On the other hand the big defensive advantage of an oversized PG is the ability to switch/show/..., but KP gets murdered in such a scheme."
"On offence, sure.   [On defence — not so much.](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155) Naturally he can’t say that in his first presser, but I do hope they’ve realised this by now."
"Interesting. It all depends on what direction Sixers want to go in.  I've been thinking about an adjacent idea, whereby Sixers go a Lowry+Embiid+lots of depth way and can bring back Green, Korkmaz, etc. You might not like it though from a Raps POW.  * Sixers get Lowry S&amp;T, Hood, Redick S&amp;T (only 1st year guaranteed, goes back to NE where he wants to be, driving distance from his family) * Mavs get Simmons, Harris * Raps get KP, JRich (expiring), indeterminate amount of draft compensation from Philly  This does the following:  * Sixers get a deep team, can use the MLE, might even avoid the tax by a whisker, and can easily completely re-do the team in 2 years time. It's a more conventional team, where Embiid is maximised, and only two (Embiid&amp;Lowry) have to stay healthy for a run to work. * Mavs take on lots of money, but get off of KP [whose defence doesn't fit with Luka](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense) \-- Luka is bad at drop (getting over screens, as is almost everyone else on the Mavs) and KP is limited to drop (and zone) alone -- in favour of a switch/show/Box-and-Ben D * Raps do Lowry a solid. KP is the equivalent of training wheels for whomever you get at 4 (probably Suggs, right?) because his spacing does wonders -- no defender is leaving him along 30ft from the basket. A FVV/Suggs/OG/Siakam perimeter also works well with him defensively, especially under Nurse. These are the guys who can get over screens and enable KP to be a valuable defensive piece. KP also expires before the 4th pick needs to get paid, and barring injury his value would rise in the more equitable Raptors' system."
"Hope that happens soon. And that someone believes in him a whole lot.  He’s actually valuable on offence - despite the middling 3p%, he’s a great spacer by virtue of the defender staying on him 28ft from the basket.  Defensively he’s regressed, but the fit with the rest of the roster on D is the real problem. He can only play in drop now, but following the most recent surgery he certainly needs the perimeter defender to have fought over the screen — something that few of Mavs players can do. Luka in particular is very poorly suited to drop, and his defensive impact is maximised in a switch/show-heavy scheme — one that KP can’t work in. [Tape and numbers both agree on that.](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense#539498155)  If Raptors S&amp;T Lowry somewhere, KP would be a fantastic fit — FVV, Suggs (seems a likely 4th pick), OG, Siakam and KP should work pretty well. KP’s spacing is like training wheels for Suggs’ first bicycle ride in the NBA, and the perimeter guys are of a type and caliber where KP could have a far better defensive impact than he’s had on the Mavs."
"Pretty sure it was 2016 in Portland vs Knicks. We had to choose our game a long time ahead as we were travelling from Vancouver, Canada. We chose the Knicks because even though they sucked, I was still interested in seeing Melo, D Rose and Porzingis play against Dame and CJ. Well, we got to see Dame and CJ but Melo, Rose and Kristaps didn't play, lol. Think the Blazers wiped the floor with the rest of the Knicks scrubs."
Hmmm Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant for Kristaps Porzingis.
Kristaps Porzingis vlog - Road to Shang Hai - Day 1
"Not nearly as promising as Garland. They have role player potential when he has all star potential. Not to mention he’s a much better fit next to Lonzo and Ingram. He can playmake for them, run the pick and roll and space the floor. The Pels have a lot of trouble running pnr. Hayes can develop a jumper but he’s never gonna be Kristaps Porzingis. Garland would fit like a glove"
Probably thought that our anchor is Jonathan Isaac and not Kristaps Porzingis.

"He's 23, athletic, can shoot, and decently good on defense. He's not gonna be a focal point offensively but he's a great piece to have. A max for John Collins is about 32M/year or about what Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, and Kristaps Porzingis are making right now. I don't see why he shouldn't get that much money."

KRISTAPS MOTHERFUCKING PORZINGIS HAS ^(sneaked into the chat.)
"Kristaps Porzingis has been asked to play the role he don't like. On another side, Luka have to trust his teammate more to handle the ball."
"Your comment proves nothing because Melo ended up staying and resigning so of course Knicks fans aren't upset at him.  How about we use Kristaps Porzingis, surely Knicks fans are understanding why he demanded a trade. He wanted a better situation for himself and his family. Why does he get boo'ed when he plays in the Garden for wanting a better situation? Fuck that fanbase"
Tbf Dirk played like that as well. Kristaps coild have used more touches in the postseason imo. He averaged 20 a game in the regular season and only 13 in the playoffs while his shooting % was pretty much the same. Porzingis is nowhere near a superstar but he wasn’t even used as a second option. A Luka-Kristaps pick and roll could be hard to defend against and it wasn’t tried at all
"Tbf, it doesn’t seem like anyone likes Kristaps Porzingis."
"Give Luka any big man that mastered the pick'n'roll and he'll have 11 assists per game. Kristaps is too soft for Luka. Doncic needs a big man that matches his intensity and will to win and exceed expectations whenever they share the floor.   If the mavs can trade porzingis for Myles Turner that would be a good trade. Myles Turner getting spoon fed looks by a premier playmakers is capable of reasonably spacing the floor. He'd be a plus on defense, he hustles for rebounds and played solid in the p'n'r with Brogdon who's, no offense, not in the same stratosphere as Luka.   Indiana gets a guy who wants to be the leader. With more touches and the offense catered to his game I'm sure Kristaps would have a good season with the pacers. If he pans out they're back into playoff contention and if he doesn't they can start a soft rebuild"
"At the time, there was a general consensus that the No. 2 pick was going to be either Darko Milicic or Carmelo Anthony, and folks were quite split between the two. Similar to many, many prospects who've come through over the years (foreign or otherwise), there was the pretty solid belief and expectation that Darko was a gem and monster pivot in the making.   The debate mostly centered around whether you wanted someone who'd proven they could already perform on the big stage (Anthony) or the swift-moving center with A+ potential who may need some time to grow (Milicic was still 17 a week prior to the draft).   To give a feel for how certain of a top pick Darko was, [here's an ESPN The Magazine cover from *before* the draft](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ksezwy34L._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2C255%2C255.jpg).  It's hard to think of a modern parallel because so much has changed in the way we scout international prospects (largely because of failures like Milicic and Nikoloz Tskitishvili). But the Darko hype was somewhat similar to the Luka Doncic draft hype and perhaps the Kristaps Porzingis hype prior. The difference being, teams have since learned to delve much deeper into international scouting, beyond ""this dude's individual workout for us was amazing and he has the body of a Greek god"". Now we often have a better idea of who's *really* going to translate well from overseas when it comes to picking that high (though busts still remain).   [Here's a fun piece on all the pre-draft Darko hype.](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2014/9/24/6841293/rip-hamilton-reaction-darko-milicic-2003-nba-draft)  One way or another, guys like Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were universally slotted outside of the top-3. It was always going to be LeBron James, then Carmelo Anthony and Darko Milicic in some form or fashion.   And for what it's worth, as a Pistons fan, I can say they've received plenty of mockery and criticism for their selection over the years, though it may have been blunted by the fact they won an NBA championship against long odds Darko's rookie year."
This kind of stuff should happen to Kristaps Porzingis

"[Wojnarowski] Sources tell ESPN that Dallas star Kristaps Porzingis reportedly stormed into the Mavericks locker room demanding to know who had stolen his meniscus. When asked about it, Doncic denied any knowledge. More to come soon"
TFN needs to be Kristaps Porzingis nickname.
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Pretty sure this happens a lot. Like Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics. Kristaps Porzingis refused to workout or be interviewed by the Sixers. Luka refused to give medical records to the Kings. Mo Bamba told the Grizzlies not to draft him. Jahlil Okafor told the Sixers not to draft him. Jabari Parker allegedly 'tanked' his workout with the Cavs so they wouldn't draft him.  Hell Steph Curry refused to workout for any team except the Knicks. Kobe Bryant was telling every team in the league he would only play for the Lakers all the way back in 1996.   Long story short it happens all the time. Sometimes the player gets what they want. Sometimes they don't.

"Kristaps was very good with Luka during the regular season. One bad playoff run does not make him a bad player. Same thing with Gobert. Both of their coaches used them in a flawed gameplan. Some of it is their fault, some of it is due to poor roster construction and some of it is the coaches. Porzingis was turned into a spot up shooter and couldn’t build a rhythm because he wasn’t getting consistent touches due to the Mavericks 5 out scheme. Gobert was asked to do too much due to the Jazz defense scheme. After seeing the game it seems to me like he was in a lose-lose situation set by his coach. He has to help on drives because the Jazz are either too small or slow footed. If he sticks to Mann 30 feet from the basket he essentially serves no purpose anymore. The Clippers would realize this and just use Mann as a decoy and would be having a buffet at the rim because they’re bigger. Gobert would then be getting flamed for not protecting the rim or getting roasted on the perimeter which is not his specialty. Him giving no effort on the 3s tho is inexcusable but that’s just the way I see it."
Throw in Kristaps Porzingis
"What would you have preferred.. they keep him?  He played just 43 games due to his knee. Chronic knee will get worse in time not better. The Celtics and Brad Stevens have up close knowledge of his health. To hold out waiting for a better offer is with even greater diminished returns. Remember to trade him they would need a team to have to come within the vicinity of his salary in 2021-22 which is $34.3M. That greatly limits Kemba's trade partners. Since he makes such a high salary, the only available trade partners are teams who have a high salary player who has greatly underachieved such as Kristaps Porzingis or injured player such as Kevin Love. In Porzingis case, they would be taking on additional years and additional money."
Two words:   Kristaps Porzingis
It’s also possible that Dallas makes a few schematic changes to reupholster Kristaps Porzingis’ value enough to trade him at par by the next trade deadline.
i believe every rumor and conspiracy theory about the mavs right now  did kristaps porzingis kill JFK?  you can't prove that he didn't.   also I have it on good authority that luka is responsible for releasing covid-19 from a chinese lab
Ya its Kristaps porzingis!
this guy Kristaps Porzingis rly made Carlisle leave
I feel like I have to say this in every thread but may I interest you guys in a Kristaps Porzingis?
"how did they fuck up?   should every team be beholden to the family members of their lottery picks?  this is like when kristaps porzingis demanded the knicks hire his brother to their FO, like dude you are still on your rookie deal you haven't done shit you aren't lebron or kawhi..  so they shipped his ass out, incredibly the knicks actually made the smart move"
"&gt; Anthony Edwards will become the most efficient high-volume scorer out of any player of his 2020 Draft class.   This isn't controversial at all. I mean, who else would it be?  &gt;The contract Kristaps Porzingis is on right now is a lot better than what people make it out to be.  How so? Because it legitimately seems pretty shit  &gt;Andrew Wiggins will be a 20,000 point scorer at the end of his career.  Again, not controversial. He's only 26 has already cracked 10,000"
&gt; Ben Simmons is proving himself to be a role player  the Kristaps Porzingis special
"The superstar and Kristaps Porzingis story, but East"
&gt; Kristaps Porzingis will have a career year but that’ll go to waste by virtue of the Mavericks falling to the Play-Ins.   How can that happen? he missed 29 games last season and we weren't in the play in. If KP has a career year we're a top 4 seed.
- A lot of people will be saying that Philly made a mistake trading Simmons because they will end up noticeably worse in this year’s regular season unless they can get Damian Lillard.  - The Nets Big 3 will end up winning no more than 1 title.  - Miami will not win a single playoff series despite their offseason additions.  - The Celtics will underperform and fall to the Play-Ins.  - Utah will trade away one of Bogdanovic or Ingles for pennies in the hopes of avoiding the tax.  - Kristaps Porzingis’ will have a career year but that’ll go to waste by virtue of the Mavericks falling to the Play-Ins.  - The West will only have 5 teams above .500.

"Damn, I can’t believe I was alive to witness the LeBron James and the Kristaps Porzingis era, truly something special"
*Kristaps Porzingis’ Mavs
Kinda surprised no one said Kristaps Porzingis.   Mark Cuban went out to make master race team I mean recreate Dirk Nowitski-Steve Nash duo and now reports come out that Luka and KP hate each other. And Mavs are stuck with KPs Max contract
"I guess if you want to call talking heads casuals then this is fair, but there was a consistent media narrative that we lolKnicksed the pick. Chris Mannix of SI [gave the pick a C+](https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2015/06/19/kristaps-porzingis-2015-nba-draft-new-york-knicks), saying that KP was “2 years away from doing *anything* at an NBA level.”    Regardless though, did you read the prompt in the OP?    “Been looking into Josh Primo lately, **a pick that most spurs fans seemed to hate in the moment**, but he’s been doing really well so far in summer league.   …   I’m making this post to ask if anyone has any notable draft reaches? Players who were chosen way higher than the **general public** anticipated and either did really well and justified that placement or did poorly.”    So idk why you took issue with my comment lol."
"&gt; He's the Kristaps Porzingis we wanted, but he's stronger and rebounds better. This kid is 100% legit. I'd be pretty excited by now if I was a Bulls fan."
I was told that it's currently Kristaps Porzingis
"&gt;at shooting and nothing else.   Dirk averaged 25 points and 10 rebounds across 145 playoff games. He was an elite defensive rebounder and an above-average defender (3+ steals in 13 games, 3+ blocks in 12 games, had at least one block in two thirds of his playoff games and at least one steal in two thirds of his playoff games).   The big men he played against in his prime - Webber, KG, Pau, Duncan, Yao - he absolutely toasted.   Put it this way: if Kristaps Porzingis were at Dirk’s level defensively, he’d be an All-NBA consideration.   Also “shooting and nothing else” kind of brushes over the fact that Dirk’s gravity on offense forced the entire defense to adjust to where he was on the floor. He was a 50% bucket from the exact same mid-range Kobe made a living on, except the presence of the defender literally didn’t matter. Ibaka? Grilled. Haslem? Toast. Bowen? Lol. Shooting over you or putting it on the floor (people forget or just don’t know that Dirk’s most iconic playoff game-deciding highlights are mostly drives from him putting it on the floor).   You also can’t use the “Dirk was surrounded by All-Stars” argument, as the second-best player he had after Steve Nash left was either Jason Terry or Tyson Chandler (whom the Bobcats had mostly given up on the summer before the Mavs won their ring).   Rondo + Ray Allen + Pierce was a way better supporting cast than JET + Tyson + Marion + Kidd.   Plus, Dirk was the best player on his team for far longer and at a far higher and more successful level than KG was. The Mavericks were a consistent 55-win team for the 2000s. They were a 4-seed with 60 wins one year because the Spurs were so good.   With the exception of KG’s MVP season in 2003-04 where the Wolves won 58 games, they never had another season with more than 51 wins (twice). They had 50 wins once.  The Mavericks won at least 50 games every season from 2001-2002 (57 wins) to the 2010-2011 championship season (57 wins). In the eight years between, they won 60, 52, 58, 60, 67, 51, 50, and 55 games.   Dirk has the far superior playoff résumé in terms of stats, longevity, or win shares.   Dirk has the far superior regular season résumé in terms of stats, longevity, or win shares.   He also - and this is important - **never left his team**. KG is a ring-chaser. Shaq was a ring-chaser. Kobe was not, Duncan was not, Dirk is not, Giannis is not. Those rings simply mean more than Hardest Road/South Beach-type team assemblies when evaluating the careers of players against one another."
Kristaps Porzingis. I still feel he has the chance to be a borderline top 10 player in the league if he can stay healthy.
"Guys who made all star appearances that people will forget on sporcle quizzes: Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Chris Kaman, Victor Oladipo, Deangelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Julius Randle, Goran Dragic, and Roy Hibbert."
"For me it's Kristaps. Labeled as a ""unicorn"" near the same level as Embiid and Jokic. Those two have taken off and everyone's wondering if Dallas can even trade Porzingis. He might have actually let the Knicks win a trade..."
Kristaps porzingis (not that he can’t turn it around)

"It’s not like they made bad picks but I wouldn’t say they “hit” on every single one   Like at the time Ingram Lonzo Russell were all the right picks but all underwhelmed at times on the Lakers, and guys behind them (Jaylen brown, jayson tatum, kristaps Porzingis ) have done better"
"It literally reads: ""Two Knicks fans have a rational, reasoned debate about how good Kristaps Porzingis is and can be.""  Obviously it's a tongue-in-cheek article from biased Knicks fans at the time"
"At some point we can't just appease anything Luka wants.   Hiring Jamal Mosley as coach, means we don't get Nico as GM, and probably promote from within which means Michael Finley (Donnie Nelson's protege) gets promoted. This is just re-creating the past regime, but with a less proven GM and worse coach.   Mosley was our defensive coordinator and the past few seasons our defense has been horrible. Obviously there's only so much you can do with THJ and Luka as your backcourt, but Mosley didn't jump off the page as an all time great coach like Silas, Nurse, Snyder etc... or other assistant coaches have.   Hiring Kidd was so we could hire Nico as GM and hopefully get some new perspective in regards to team construction/building and hopefully able to lure big name FAs here. Donnie in 20 years had Kristaps Porzingis, an unproven Steve Nash, an old Shawn Marion, old Jason Kidd, raw Jason Terry, old Vince Carter, Chandler Parsons and Monta Ellis as his biggest aquisistions. I don't think Mark wanted to risk that with Luka and went with Nico who is tight with a lot of NBA stars (Dame etc...).   Donnie was an excellent foreign scout (he found Nash, Dirk, Luka, Giannis, Porziņģis) before they were stars and aquirred all but Giannis who he wanted to draft in 2013. But we don't really need foreign scouting anymore, we need to build around Luka now while our window is open and Donnie has never proven to be able to do that. His connections are all within scouting not FA and star players.   tldr; hiring Mosley would just mean the same old same old and we wanted to change our approach."

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"&gt; ""foreign proven talents""  &gt; darko milicic  Darko's pick was more like prospect than a proven player.  Check EuroLeague, EuroCup and domestic leagues stats of Pau Gasol, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Danilo Gallinari, Andrea Bargnani, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender and Alperen Sengun in their season before they were drafted. You should see that Luka and Pau were players that proven their worth in Europe and Bargnani, Bender and Darko were more like hopes as their stats weren't great enough yet."
Kristaps 5'27 porzingis
T.J. Mcconnell and Kristaps Porzingis would be the GOAT.
"It's more that people just star gaze when they remember the knicks teams and ignore what Phil Jackson was doing to that team.  Like Phil's first year, the knicks starting line up was: Shane Larkin - Iman Shumpert - Carmelo Anthony - Amar'e Stoudemire - Samuel Dalembert  The next season: Jose Calderon - Sasha Vujacic - Carmelo Anthony - Kristaps Porzingis - Robin Lopez  Like when these bad rosters lost games, starting games with guys that would be out of the league in a year, it's easy to blame the guy you remember, because no one remembers Cole Aldrich, Quincy Acy, or Lou Amundson starting and getting significant minutes on a team fans expected to make the playoffs."
Time for Cuban to complete his dream team:   Goran Dragic   Luka Doncic   Maxi Kleber   Kristaps Porzingis   Boban Marjanovic
Kristaps Porzingis
"Luka Doncic, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Lauri Markkanen, Kristaps Porzingis with Boban Marjanovic as the sixth man. Cuban has clocked his game."
Porzingis is the rim protector? He's averaging like 2 blocks per game.  I think you mean they need an offensive rebounding threat since kristaps likes to just shoot 3s.
"""Kristaps Porzingis grew another 3 inches during the summer"""
"Mike Tobey &gt; Kristaps Porzingis  Thank you, I will not be taking questions at this time"
"He’s entering the kristaps porzingis danger zone. Too big to play the the 3, but not physical nor efficient enough in the post to play the 4. He can’t defend the rim all that well, and his 3 pt shot has come and gone. I think boylen broke him mentally. Wishing him the best, but he’s a bit of a project. Wouldn’t want to pay him more than 10 million a year in his current state. Best case scenario he finds his way on a starting role on a rebuilding team where he gain regain his confidence and work towards becoming a 3 and D guy. As for the bulls, perhaps keep him as a bench scorer along Coby for the right price?"
Could we interest you in some Kristaps Porzingis? He's 6'9 but with 6 more inches

Step 1. Don’t give Kristaps Porzingis a big expensive contract that he’s not worth?
Mike Tobey &gt; Kristaps Porzingis
"Kristaps Porzingis, he’s only about to be 26 and is in the first healthy offseason he’s had in his career.  I think he’s going to add some new pieces to his game and we might just see all star KP again.   New coaching + hopefully some free agent additions (Lowry plz) could be really good for his game."
"Kristaps Porzingis may be be ""the unicorn"", but Nikola ""Quesarito"" Jokic is both unicorn AND pegasus."
Fun fact: that chair grew up to be Kristaps Porzingis.
The white Kristaps Porzingis
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."

"otherwise he's gonna get shit on for the next 4 years of his expensive contract  on the same page, good luck to Kristaps Porzingis."
"Who says no  Ben Simmons PG, Kyle Kuzma PG, Yao Ming SG, Kristaps Porzingis SF,  SGA PF, Muggsy Bogues C"
We can take him and 2 future firsts for one Kristaps Porzingis. Deal?
"This post made me actually go down into the advance stats in basketball ref.  Ben's value over replacement player is 13.4, over the past ten years the only number 4 pick to come close to that VORP was the beloved Kristaps Porzingis with at 7.4, nearly half the VORP simmons has. Hell half the number 4 picks of the pass decade have a negative VORP"
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
"As sad as it is now, Kristaps Porzingis. I was into basketball in 2010 but never really got into it. After Linsanity happened I stopped watching basketball. Then in 2015-16 during the warriors run I fell in love and watched the Knicks and loved seeing KP play. Then what he did in 2017-18 before he tore his acl was amazing dude was averaging like 28 PPG until he got in a slump in January then he tore his ACL. Ever since then I just stuck by the Knicks to have those feelings of awe and amazement again. It’s been tuff but this year rekindled that love again and I’m so looking forward to what the future of the Knicks will become"
"Kristaps Porzingis. I'm from his hometown Liepaja, so I finally got someone to root for hard when he joined the NBA. I've met him countless times in Liepaja"

Can't think of a better pick and roll partner for Russ than the great Kristaps Porzingis.  Call it in.
Kristaps Porzingis is gainfully employed
"Raised: Terance Mann, Trae Young, Deandre Ayton, (bonus: Cam Johnson)  Dropped: Ben Simmons, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
Kristaps Porzingis will not be traded.    Ben Simmons will be traded.
Well that should hopefully end that nonsense. The Kings should focus on a Bagley and Buddy Hield for Kristaps Porzingis trade or that same package for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams.
"&gt;15 - Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, Kristaps Porzingis, D’Angelo Russell, Myles Turner  So KP is a SF here?"
Buy low on Kristaps Porzingis to keep Dame happy!
Did you miss Rick’s “post up is a bad play and it’s a bad play for KP” speech in December 2019? [You can find a transcript here.](https://theathletic.com/1489818/2019/12/27/rick-carlisle-rips-into-tnt-broadcasts-criticism-of-kristaps-porzingis/)  Rick was not interesting in posting up KP ever — for good reason of it returning fewer points than the average Mavs half-court set. The only people who think it’s a good idea to post-up KP are KP and people behind the times.
"[Woj] Sources around the league tell us Luka Doncic is trading Kristaps Porzingis to the OKC Thunder for a 2nd rounder. With the free space, the Mavericks intend to sign Crancar, Prepelic and Tobey. Sources also tell us Luka Doncic is closing in a deal with Masai, where Goran Dragic would be traded in exchange for Mark Cuban's Shark Tank."
"I think KD definetely changed the way teams draft now, GMs in the draft are now more frequently drafting Tall Lanky guys with Guard like talents in the draft to get a big swing and I think some of that can be attributed to KD.  Kristaps Porzingis, Brandon Ingram, MPJ, soon Emoni Bates/Victor Wembanyama."
"I don’t think it’s single digit percentage at all. You won’t always get the same caliber of a player but I’m pretty sure I can name one or two star players that were available on the market for the last 5. Last year, Harden and Vucevic became available. The year before D’angelo Russell became available. The year before that Kawhi Leonard, Kristaps Porzingis, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris became available. Year before that it was an all-star level Blake Griffin. You see where I’m going with this? Literally every player I just named when added to this roster would keep them contending at a high level if they received them at the level they played at the time to today (other than maybe Vucevic since he plays the same position as Embiid). These happen far more often than you think and in recent times, rather than being a single digit percent chance of happening on a season by season basis, over the last 5 years it has happened 100% of the time."
"Kristaps Porzingis is a very likely reason. Either because of his salary cap hit or play or both. Luka magic can overcome a lot for sure, but he still needs help."

"Trading Wall will be next to impossible...but who says no?  PHI gets:  John Wall, Caris Lavert, TJ Warren, Chris Duarte, and picks from HOU  HOU gets: Kristaps Porzingis   DAL gets: Tobias Harris   IND gets: Ben Simmons"
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"&gt;Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.

"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."

"How about Derrick Rose? Matt Barnes? Kristaps Porzingis? Luke Walton? LeBron James?     But Nah, y’all just want to talk shit about the dead dude who made amends and raised four daughters. Bunch of hateful shitty motherfuckers."
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"

Kristaps Porzingis - Dario Saric = Dragan Bender
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
In 2019 when the Knicks played the Mavericks in Dallas and Frank Ntilikina drove to the rim [to dunk try and dunk on Kristaps Porzingis](https://youtu.be/kNLU6nFDjDo). Was sitting on the couch and leaped up yelling after someone who’s incapable of scoring confidently shoved his nuts in the face of someone who was the franchises biggest villain at the time
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"

"John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love and at a stretch Kristaps Porzingis are some of the worst contracts today."
"I feel like there is a real misunderstanding of just how bad it is for players to be playing through knee soreness. If you go back and look at most horrific knee injuries players have had in recent years, they are often preceded by players reporting soreness in that same knee in the weeks prior but continuing to play on it.   The ones that really stand out to me are Kristaps Porzingis with the Knicks, Andre Roberson with the Thunder and Victor Oladipo with the Pacers. All three guys were sitting out games with and complaining about knee soreness right before their major knee injuries (ACL with Porzingis, patellar tendon rupture with Roberson and quad tendon rupture with Oladipo). Knee soreness is a sign that something is wrong, and if you play through it, it doesn't get better, it only risks getting worse."
Kristaps Porzingis will go down as one of the biggest wastes of potential of all time.  Also Giannis will retire as a top 15 player ever

"&gt;SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)  I'd suggest Luka and Wiggins.

Dray is a relatively small PF/C that is a historically elite defender despite his height. Dray is mobile as hell and an iron man whereas KP is stiff and injury prone. Also opposite in personalities as well as being opposite in games."

"In his last 6 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has averaged 24ppg on 51/66 shooting (77%) from the field.         He absolutely dominates that matchup (Zingis is 19ppg on 41%) and it's why I was really hoping the Mavs had closed out the series against LAC because it would have given us an easier Playoff path.        One of Gobert's best games last season was a 29/20/3/3/3 performance against Dallas while Mitchell was out with injury."

"We are a league where teams go all-in on second-tier All-Stars just for a shot at staying relevant. Kristaps Porzingis is making $32 mil this season, Paskal Siakam is making $33M, Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making $36M. John Wall is making $44M.  Yes, Westbrook is inefficient, but he is a MVP winner, and so he got paid like one. I don't see anything wrong with that. I certainly don't see him as overpaid. He got paid exactly what he was worth in this league at the time."

"IDK I could definitely see the spurs going after Porzingis, especially if the price is cheap. Could do something like Thad Young + Derrick White for Kristaps Porzingis and a pick."
That's exactly correct and here's the article for anyone who wants the numbers and tape breakdown:  https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/4/29/22408327/the-long-term-fit-of-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-has-nothing-to-do-with-offense
"*That's not an offensive chemistry thing, that's a bad bad bad fit in terms of defensive scheme.* Look at the OffRtg and DefRtg separately, and you'll see Mavs improve markedly on D regardless of which one sits.  Basically KP has been limited to playing two defensive PnR schemes (especially after the second knee surgery) -- either deep drop or zone. But he's not been very good in deep drop, and has been needing the other defender to get over the screen. Guess who can't get over screens well? Luka. Or indeed anyone else in the Mavs' starting lineup much of the time -- Finney-Smith and Hardaway included.  On the other hand, the biggest benefit of having a 6'7"" PG is not having any short (in the NBA context) people on the court. This should allow you to play more aggressive coverages, show high, even switch. Except that's impossible when KP is on the floor -- especially after the second knee surgery his mobility just wasn't remotely good enough for anything like that. A correctly constructed roster around Luka would be one that can employ a switch/show heavy scheme when appropriate, while a correctly constructed roster around KP would be optimised for a drop-only scheme.

"Off the top of my head, Ben Simmons, Marvin Bagley and Kristaps Porzingis"
The age gap between Jalen Brunson (25yo - 2018 class) and Kristaps Porzingis (26yo - 2015 class) is smaller than the age gap between Jalen Brunson and Luka Doncic (22yo - 2018 class)
"I will not take any Julius Randle slander.  Hawks just played some really good defense and exposed a flawed Knicks team that had no one that could create outside of him.  Kristaps Porzingis has been such a dramatic figure basically his entire career.  It's especially gotten pretty loud last season where he's been pretty vocal about his role on the team and possibly threatening to get out.  So far he's said he's buying in to this new thing but we'll see.  If it doesn't work out here on a second team which he has openly criticized, what really is next for him?"
He's gonna be a force for sure - his worst-case scenario imo is Kristaps Porzingis with a better handle   That Minnehaha team with him and Jalen Suggs was so ridiculously talented and fun to watch

"Spicy take here, but I think Andrea Bargnani did everything that Kristaps Porzingis does, but a little bit better."
I don't think Porzingis is really a player teams are that worried about for spacing anymore. It's not working that way in Dallas. I don't think Toronto wants to trade athleticism away anyway. Kristaps doesn't fit if he can't defend and isn't versatile.
"&gt; No, man. You just brush off all of the issues Jamal had as a player. He couldn't string together 3 games of solid play, idgaf who was scouting him or what he was doing behind the scenes. His inconsistency went way beyond the domain of just being a young player.  It was not beyond the domain or just being a young player. Since box scores are the only thing that is connecting with you then here:  In his 2nd year and 1st as a starter, the 20 year old Jamal Murray had 27 games of 20 or more, including 7 over 30 5 of those over 58%, 3 over 60%, 2 over 70%. Of all the games he had under 10 points the majority of them were in wins. He had more games over 16 points than under 16 point.  In his 3rd year he had 29 games of over 20 or more, including 7 over 30 and 2 over 40 (48 and 46) which were both over 60% from the floor and misses 7 1/2 games to injury. OBPM goes up, BPM goes up just like it did the year before. TRB% goes up, AST% goes up, TOV% goes down while USG% goes up.  As a 21 year old, and I cannot stress this enough a 21 year old in his first playoffs he averages 21/4/5/1. Massively weight down by one very poor game. He has more games over 23 points than under and has two 34 point games to boot. Is also a + in two of the Nuggets losses and has the highest TS% among all non-bigs on the Nuggets, and a higher TS% than CJ and Dame.  His efficiency scoring went down in the regular season a bit but he was also given much more responsibility and allowed to take more shots. Generally speaking the efficiency goes down when that happens until a player is able to get used to it. If they are able to. Obviously they felt strongly that he would.  He did this on a playoff team that was winning games. A successful team. One where he wasn't the main option every night or could decide his fate all the time. That means it wasn't the situation where a player is putting up empty stats on a bad team (Sexton) and on paper looks much better than they are. Inconsistency aside he was playing winning basketball, had winning effort, and on top of that had made it clear that if he has a bad game in the first 3 quarters he comes out in the 4th ready to kill. He proved this many, many times.  That is a 100% of the time maxed player by the team they are playing for. A super young guy who can struggle for an entire game but then tap in and become a closer in the 4th, and seeks that, is significantly more intriguing and interesting for teams than someone who comes out and gives you 14-18 a night reliably in the system--i.e. Mikal Bridges. There is no question that Jamal had consistency issues, he would go for 20+ 4 games in a row and then come out with a 14 pointer and a 15 pointer the next two. But what he wasn't was mentally inconsistent. He was checked in and wanted the moments, even if he was missing shots. This wasn't a situation where he was fading away or getting in his head and avoiding the  responsibility. That is massive and overweighs a 15-25 point rollercoaster ride given his age.  Before he turned 22 years old Murray had shown improvement every single year. Clear, visual, in game, improvement. Added and refined skills. Was becoming extremely good in the PnR with Jokic, so much so that even at that age with this up and coming team he and Jokic LEAD THE LEAGUE IN ASSISTS BETWEEN TWO TEAMMATES and were considered a deadly late game system by themselves. He showed it in the regular season and showed it as the #2 guy in his first playoffs, again, as a 21 year old.   Sexton is 23 years old right now, has been putting up empty stats on a perennially bad team as -the- guy with the system built to help him succeed, and taking pretty much as many shots as he wants. Shoot Murray even if his scoring was off could turn into the offensive facilitator and would actively go for rebounds. He more than doubles Sexton in each category by the time he turned 21. He also proved he knew how to play off ball as a cutter or shooter, and was very good at keeping the ball secure and not having turnovers or getting into situations that could force a turnover. These are extremely valuable things that aren't going to show up on the box score. That is extremely uncommon maturity and poise for a 21 year old.  His weaknesses were inconsistency with scoring (as a 19, 20, 21 year old on a competitive team I will provide you with countless examples of inconsistency at that age including players like Carmelo and LeBron) and defense. Unless you come into the league as a defensive player, and a very good one like Davion Mitchell or GP2, NBA defense takes a while to get used to and learn. Not just whatever scheme you're playing as a team that you have likely never played in, but the size and speed of grown ass men with years of NBA training and the significantly heightened skill level of scorers. People doing things you've never had to guard before. Every young player gets slack on learning defense when they come in, because 99% of them need 2-3+ years to become a tolerable defender for a playoff caliber team. If not more.   Seriously. You have a 21 year old who has proven to you he can string together 20 point games since he was 19. He can have back to back 30 point game sin the playoffs. He has a fantastic mechanics/footwork for someone his age, and a shot form that will translate to better and better shooting as he himself gets better. He's already adept at being the main ball handler, an extraordinarily good PnR guard who can score from all 3 levels out of it (there are some all-stars who struggle with this in their late 20s!), can confidently play off ball as a spot up shooter or slasher and make the right offensive reads to facilitate success (being a good look), who is an extremely hard worker, improves his level of play in bigger or higher leverage situations, and does not shy away from it.   All of that is far, far, far, far greater than the negatives of inconsistent shooting and poor defense. Those are the reasons that Tim Connelly and Coach Malone never once considered trading him, said he was off limits since year 2, believed in him and gave him more and more responsibility despite having a budding superstar in Jokic who could be option 1 and 2, constantly and publicly praised him while also treating him with the responsibility level of a vet after year 2, and signed him to that max extension.   As any single team with a brain would have done. It is an absolute no doubt decision for all 30 teams. He is a special player and it was clear to see what was in there half way through year 2.   &gt; Was the Sixers front office full of donkeys when they gave Simmons the max?  By the time Philly signed Ben Simmons to his max he had been the Rookie of the Year, an All-Star twice, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Defensive 1st team, lead the league in steals, was a pivotal member of a team 1 game away from the finals, and was cruising to 16/8/8/2 a night on high 50s from the floor. He had all the tools and wherewithal to be an incredible slashing threat too if Philly had a better passer. There is no team at any point in the history of basketball who wouldn't have maxed him. His issue is entirely mental, and sad, and there was no predicting that.  &gt;  Was the Knicks front office full of redditors when they gave Porzingis the max?  Are we talking about the Kristaps who put up 23/7 with 2.5 blocks a night while being 7'3"" and shooting 40% from 3 and made the All-Star game? The guy who had made a massive jump each year in the league and was playing incredible before completely blowing apart his leg? If you're asking me if it was unwise for a team to max a 22 year old 7'3"" unicorn who could fly for huge dunks, shoot 3s better than many guards, and protect the paint and rim at an elite level I'd ask if you're joking. That's a no brainer. Now the issue if there was one is that it is a direct gamble to give a contract to any big man coming off an injury like that. Especially one as athleticism reliant as Porzingis. Regardless all 30 teams if they are in that position are giving him the max, you have to assume he comes back near that and if that's as good as he gets  for his career he's a better Brook Lopez and gets maxed into his 30s.  &gt; They were better players than Jamal as well.  Which is why they were no doubt decisions. Zero doubt. Zero hesitation. Zero questioning of the decision from those teams. Then both of those contracts presently look iffy because of completely uncontrollable circumstances. You can't guess if a player explodes his leg, and you can't guess if a player runs into one of the worst mental blocks in the history of the sport out of nowhere. That has zero to do with the front office's decision making.  &gt;  For every player who pans out and ends up being worth it there's a player that ends up overpaid.   Here are the players on a rookie max currently: Ben Simmons, SGA, Trae, MPJ, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Tatum, KAT, Booker, Murray, Wiggins, Embiid, Siakam. The only questionable signing in this whole bunch is Siakam. When Wiggins was maxed that was as much Minnesota not being able to afford any semblance of a good player leaving them. Otherwise which of these players do you think isn't gonna be worth the contract? You implied 50% of them and considering all of them except for 8 games of MPJ and Siakam have been worth it, who is going to have a massive regression out of nowhere?  &gt;  Waiting a year doesn't cost them, simply.   Yes it does. This isn't 2K. The human element plays a massive part in this. Waiting a year tells a player ""eh, we dunno if we believe in you yet. let's see another year"", while all of their peers in the same situation are getting maxed. It also opens up really dumb FA possibilities which teams do not want to deal with even removing the fact they are burning part of the bridge with what could be a cornerstone player + their team."

Kristaps Porzingis
"Betting on this guy to save them, good luck:https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kristaps-porzingis-player-injuries"
Hear me out because I think both teams on some level cringe at this: Dragic and Siakam for Kristaps Porzingis plus two first round picks (with some possible protections).    Raptors are developing so they don't care about Kristaps if they get extra picks. So long as he doesn't take court time away from their developing players. Mavericks take it so they can remove a failed distraction and add Siakam.   Trade machine likely requires the Mavs to at least include Powell to make salaries match. Not sure if that's agreeable or not.
Kristaps Porzingis
"I didn't particularly like the idea of adding KP in the first place because it looked to me like the FO was ignoring all the small ball stuff that happened in the playoffs throughout the 2010s. There's a question of defensive versatility that seemed to me like it was ignored at the time -- they were seemingly hoping he'd pop up back to full health and be able to run around the perimeter on D like AD. To my mind, the greatest benefit you get from a 6'7"" primary ball handler/playmaker is that it allows you to field a fully switchable lineup because you don't need a 6'1"" guy on the floor to close games -- not that that's how teams should always play, no, but if the situation calls for it playing only players between 6'6"" and 6'10"" (very roughly speaking, you get the idea) who can all switch, is a good option to have. When you're paying someone 30M/yr, well, you're definitely closing with him and that's also less cap you can allocate to players that can never be put into a position where they're played off the floor.  Also, the offensive impact he provided was always hugely overblown. He was never sufficiently good at shot creation and topped out at a hair over 40% on non-rim 2s. I don't care how good [LARPing 2012 Carmelo](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kristaps-porzingis-is-doing-his-best-carmelo-anthony-impression/) looks like or how good it makes him feel, those bullshit 16ft turnaround fadeaways were and and are crap offence because he's simply not good enough at them. Sometimes standing at the 3pt arc actually is the best thing to do for team success.  tl;dr: they made a bet I thought likely unwise at the time, bet didn't pan out, it sucks"
"A, slightly older, Kristaps Porzingis is still destroying them on each side if the floor.  Nothing has changed."
"last year luka/KP screening actions were extremely effective though, one of the highest scoring in the league  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mavericks-bet-big-on-kristaps-porzingis-its-paying-off-on-offense-but-what-about-defense/  &gt;Consider Dončić’s pick-and-roll game. Only one player (Trae Young) has been screened for more often this season than Dončić, per Second Spectrum. Among the 53 players who have run off at least 750 ball screens this year, trips that include a Dončić pick and roll have generated the ninth-most points per possession. Those pick and rolls have been more efficient when Porziņģis is the one setting the screen (1.244 points per possession) than when they’re set by anyone else (1.193).  it worked in the past, it can probably work again.   I think the mavs would get a lot more mileage out of tweaking the rest of their roster and starting lineup rather than jettisoning KP for scraps"
"Trade idea:   Mavericks get:   * Christian Wood  Thunder get:   * John Wall  * 2027 Mavericks 1st (top 5 protected)  * 2023 Rockets 1st (lotto protected each year until unprotected 2027)  * 2022, 2024 Mavericks 2nds   Rockets get:   * Kristaps Porzingis  * Darius Bazley  * Gabriel Deck  * Derrick Favors  It works in the trade machine financially. Mavericks burn a pick to turn KP into Christian Wood. Rockets move Wood and a heavily protected pick to get rid of John Wall, and they get back a fair return. Thunder take on Wall's contract to get a few picks. Who says no?"

AMBER ALERT - MISSING PERSONS REPORT : KRISTAPS PORZINGIS
"Match up stats are not good, like I said before.   Powell is a lethal scorer, he’s playing out of position in Portland but he’s still an amazing 20ppg with decent/good defense. He is better than THJ, Powel is so much more efficient. Powel literally has better stats too, by a lot, better defender as well.   Nurk is not worse on offense than Kristaps, you need to be able to do shit in the paint too with your main 4/5, Porzingis does absolutely nothing in the paint. Nurk can’t shoot threes but is a much much better passer, defender, in the mid range and at the rim. You can create gravity using the paint too especially with a great playmaker like Luka.   Dame is not a better playmaker than Luka, just stop it. Westbrook gets 11 assists a game, doesn’t mean that’s reflective of his true playmaking skills."
kristaps porzingis just because everyone on this sub seems to think he is the worst player in the league and will be in china next season
"This year's playoff has been very different. Kristaps Porzingis disappeared and could be traded during the off-season. They are calling it the Tim Hardaway Jr trade. Kuzma might get traded as well? Kuzma has struggled the entire time during his time with Lebron. I would love for Kuzma to be on a team where he can really show how good he is.  Right now he's a bum. But the Lakers will trade Drummond, Wesley Matthews, or Gasol before Kuzma."
"Kawhi. He stands next to Porzingis on defense and doesn’t switch onto/play man on Luka. He locked down LeBron in the 2014 Finals. His defensive impact in this series has not been anywhere near that effort.  I would replace Curry with Jokic, and Kawhi with Luka. Luka’s first words in his interview after a 42/8/15 game last night were “I was terrible”. I’m biased, but that seems like a top-five player who should take the spot of a guy who hasn’t done anything to slow him down.   He’s crushing it standing next to Kristaps in the corner though."
"Luka Doncic demanded 8 points out of Kristaps Porzingis before Game 5: “Typically, we play Fornite, if we’re playing at home. We’ll play in the morning, after shootaround. I told him, I need 8 out of you and we’re gonna get this dub.”"

"I know it's unrealistic but one way to go is not to have Porzingis out there against the Clippers' small ball lineup, I know everyone's been shitting on him and all but I was rewatching footage of the game again and he is a total liability out there, he gets bullied on switches, his drop defense against PG or whomever is just an easy basket for the Clippers, and he is always late on closeouts and rotates badly, and while you already have Luka out there who isn't particularly a smart defender, having 2 negative players on D is not going to cut it for the Mavs.  Also Kristaps on offense hasn't been a factor, he's more cold than hot and can't rebound for shit, I think matching his minutes with Zubac's minute is the way to go for Dallas, even if it means Porzingis is out of the starting 5, I wonder whether Carlisle would do this but seems unrealistic.  On the other hand I don't think Hardaway Jr and Kleber would shoot that badly next game, so that's already a good start, game 5 should be a must watch and I'm curious to see how Carlisle adjusts."

"Are chess and blitz chess the same sport or not? If under duress every ranked chess player must play the ultimate tournament under blitz rules suddenly, is that the same as performing well in every previous standard chess tournament.  How about instead of on-court rules we change an off-court one. Let's say the league allows all PEDs and someone like Kristaps Porzingis puts on 35 pounds of muscle. It fills out his game in all the ways needed, the Mavericks are still a great team, but all of a sudden they make it to the finals. The league then says, ""Let's never do that again, no more PEDs."" KP goes back to the same and the Mavericks get swept the next year.  How do you parse out what was specific to that PED season and what is applicable to the historic format of the league. Everyone agreed and played the same on-court rules, but some were at a unique advantage because their players responded to it better.  I'll reiterate that I DON'T think there is an asterisk. If people ask why there is this discussion about the Bubble Heat, I think there are legitimate reasons to at least consider it."

Sitting Richardson and Finney-Smith most of that quarter while continuing to play a Kristaps with no role and on the wrong end of a defensive mismatch just made no sense to me. That was a winnable game that I think partially was stripped from them because of that choice"
Clippers legend Kristaps Porzingis stopped him tonight
He needed to-to overcome Clipper legend Kristaps Porzingis' performance
I dont want to hear anyone call him KP or especially the unicorn from now on any longer. Nicknames are for good players. That mans name is Kristaps Porzingis
Kristaps Porzingis absolutely can shoot lmao. He's one of the few bigs who can actually space the floor because he's actually a good shooter who is wiling to take 5+ threes per game. He won't hesitate to let it fly unlike other bigs who shoot in the mid to high 30s on low volume. He has shot like shit and can't post up a defender a foot shorter than him because his center of gravity is 20 feet in the air but his floor spacing ability is part of what makes Dallas' offence so good.

Kristaps Porzingis by a mile /s  But gotta go with Dame and Kawhi here
"Kristaps Porzingis is listed at 7'3"",240 lb. Even when he gets way smaller defenders like Jackson and Rondo on mismatches, at the top of the key or elbow, he seems to be taking a lot of fadeaway/off the dribble jumpshots.  My man, just post up and take two dribbles, lay it in, there's no way that they can even see the ball at that altitude difference.  Is this something intentional by the Mavericks offensive system or just an obvious hiccup?"
"Better said, *why* is Kristaps Porzingis?"
Why is Kristaps Porzingis?
"Kawhi and PG are both playing out of their minds right now. That win is on both of them.  Also, I had patience with you, KP. I defended you throughout the season. I was more of a homer than Derek Harper. But, with all due respect, FUCK YOU KRISTAPS PORZINGIS. HOPE YOU GET TRADED TO THE FUCKING BOTTOM OF THE TAILANDESE LEAGUE. GO TO HELL."
Clippers legend Kristaps Porzingis
"We all heard the talk. “Biggest game in Clippers history”, and we really got to hand it to him. Shoutout to one of the most clutch performers in Clippers history: Kristaps Porzingis"
"Kristaps Porzingis fucking sucks and I wish the Mavs had never traded for him. Always hurt, can’t post up people damn near a foot shorter than him, has built no extra muscle in his legs and torso to have better body control. Just a waste man"
Can I interest anyone in a gently used Kristaps Porzingis?
what does kristaps porzingis actually do
* MVP: Luka Doncic * 6MOY: Jalen Brunson * DPOY: Kristaps Porzingis * MIP: Josh Green * COY: Rick Carlisle * Finals MVP: Boban Marjanovic
"I'd happily take a contested stepback 3 over leaving Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Morris, etc. on an island lmao. The idea that it's just completely impossible to get over the bone crushing screens by such monstrous brickhouses like Kristaps Porzingis and Maxi Kleber is also funny; they ain't Steven Adams or Zach Randolph bruh."
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"

You mean Big Man Luka and Guard Kristaps Porzingis
"Basically a worse Porzingis who can rebound, he’s not getting the Pick and Pops or the pick and rolls, and unless Mavs trad Kristaps, I don’t see it. If this was the rookie year Lauri, then I’d be all for it."
I am sure that Kristaps Porzingis gets way more pussy than you. And he is currently dating a smoking hot European girl.
AD really made me watch Kristaps Porzingis play two days in a row.
We’re about to come full circle and be like... “do you know who would be awesome with Luka? Kristaps Porzingis. Imagine a PnR with the two of them! How do you defend it? It would be one of the most effective scoring plays in the league! (It is)”
"Can we just appreciate the fact that before the draft people thought he was just another euro player, and now 3 years later he is being called the best player in a series that contains Kawhi, Paul George and Kristaps Porzingis?  It's mindblowing to see how far he has come in such a short amount of time"

"Kristaps Porzingis signed a 5 year / $158,253,000 contract with the Dallas Mavericks"
Kristaps Porzingis is what happens when you recreate the plot of Air Bud but with a Giraffe instead of a dog
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Anthony Davis plays like a black Kristaps Porzingis
I hope we get to see a healthy Kristaps Porzingis in the playoffs.
