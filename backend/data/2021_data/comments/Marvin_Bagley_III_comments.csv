"QUESTION: “What did Marvin Bagley III say or do to warrant a technical foul at the end of the first quarter?”  CAPERS: “The Sacramento team had been warned about continually complaining and then he resented a foul call and had a profanity laced statement directed towards the official which caused him to get the first technical foul.”     QUESTION: “What did Bagley say or do to warrant a second technical foul with 10:18 remaining in the third quarter?”  CAPERS: “There was a personal foul called against him, he had an overt reaction that went beyond the heat of the moment and because he had one technical the second technical was automatic ejection.”  https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-two-technical-fouls-called-on-marvin-bagley-iii-during-tonights-kings-at-pelicans-game/"

Marvin Bagley III where I expected.
"It's gold, comedy gold. Every single sentence has comedic value.   &gt;The young stud is absolutely blowing away the other rookies in this class.   Not really. He's good for a rookie. But hardly Unabombing his way through the competition.   &gt;And he has ice in his veins on top of that.   False, he has blood in his veins.   &gt;He easily should have been the first pick but he went like 12 or some.   No, Ball should've been #1 and his play in Charlotte is demonstrating why most draftniks had him as the best prospect.   Also, he went ""like 12"" or went at exactly 12? Numbers and draft order have objective ways to be measured, no need for ""like"" to be in there.   &gt;Good job Kings   Yay, good job for not screwing up one of the easiest draft-day selections any team had to make. You drafted the prospect who deliberately engineered his fall in the draft to go to the team he wanted to play for. Congrats for not picking Marvin Bagley III again I guess."

Marvin Bagley **III**
I still can’t believe the Kings passed on him for Marvin Bagley III
"Our management passed on Luka for Marvin Bagley III and our coach is Luke Walton, if that tells you anything."
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."

"&gt; Marvin Bailey III  &gt; Reggie Bagley  Idk, something is off here"
DeAndre Ayton kind of but not really. I could see the guy becoming a monster but his current trajectory is a solid rebounder who can score well. Also Marvin Bagley III
"&gt; Along with Barnes, the Kings are reportedly open to trading center Marvin Bagley III  Just wanna remind everyone that they could have gotten Luka instead of him.   Also, Barnes isn’t that good. Whatever picks the Kings can get for him, it’s probably better than keeping him. As for the Celtics, Barnes isn’t solving your problems."
"**Joe Caldwell**  Caldwell's contract with Carolina called for him to earn $150,000 per year and another $70,000 deferred for five years. A clause called for him to receive $6,600 per month beginning at age 55.[6] Later, the Carolina owner, Tedd Munchak, sued to try to negate the pension. Caldwell was interviewed on 60 Minutes, who ran a segment on the lawsuit. Caldwell prevailed and received his pension payments beginning in 1996.  He filed various lawsuits, alleging that he was wrongly blacklisted by the ABA and later the NBA.

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

Or even Marvin Bagley III himself...
"The first thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Luka Doncic.  The second thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Trae Young.  The third thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Shay Gilgeous-Alexander.  I could continue with Michal Bridges, Michael Porter Jr., Colin Sexton but you get the picture.   He turned out (largely but perhaps not only) because of injuries to be a lesser player than some of his 2018-Draft contemporaries."

"Looking at all three teams I am unsure of what they would each be willing to offer, that would make it worth it for the Raptor's to even considered a trade.  While the ""Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley III and a few future first-round draft pick"" doesn't make sense on an injured player.    The Raptors, at this time,with this roster, are the Darkhorse to make the playoffs and throw a wrench into the plans of some of the 5-9th placed teams in the East."
"1) Anthony Bennett- Other busts are not 1st overall material. He simply wasn’t an NBA level player.   2) Sam Bowie- Not as terrible but picked over Jordan, Barkley, Stockton, etc   3) LaRue Martin- Picked ahead of Bob Macadoo and Julius Erving with the 1st overall pick. Scored a 1,430 points before washing out of the league in 4 years   4) Darko Milicic- Detroit was insanely lucky that they had a top pick in a stacked draft while already having a great squad. They could have had a dynasty picking nearly anyone else.   5) Marvin Bagley III- It’s early to put him on this list. The 2018 draft was amazing and he was picked over Luka Doncic, Trae Young, MPJ, and a lot of other nice players"

Marvin Bagley III
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."

"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"Ah yes, Marvin Bagley III, rather than Embiid, is the type of center who Ben Simmons should be sharing the court with.  The real problem holding back Ben has been a floor that's *too* stretched with a center who can actually hit from three above a 30% clip.  Almost as if he was absolutely full of shit and didn't believe it when he claimed Embiid's game didn't mesh with his, as if he gives any more of a shit about team success than he did at LSU."
"I couldn't disagree more. Micic was last years Euroleague MVP at age 27 and he was drafted 7 years ago. Luka was the Euroleague MVP at age 19. Big difference. MVP of the second best league in the world at 19...?! For that you have to take him nr1 for talent alone. Luka being nr1 was written in stone 100%, at least for us Europeens who saw him play (and saw Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III play)"
"Which makes him 6 months older than Marvin Bagley III, who is already considered a bust."
"Jon isaac is ""untouchable""      Here's the truth, despite being drafted a year earlier, Isaac has only played 18 more games than Marvin Bagley III, while averaging less points and less rebounds. But one of these players gets clowned and is labeled as a bust, while the other is considered the ""best player on the team"". In 2 summer league games jalen suggs has already shown more potential than isaac has shown in 4 years. The only thing he's got going for himself is ""he looked like a real dpoy candidate for 7 games"". And before people come at me for politics, I felt this way before the recent drama, when people were saying they wouldn't trade him for the number 1 pick."
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
Surprising to see Marvin Bagley III to make a comeback. Maybe this night is the beginning of his redemption.
"So you didn't see our Lebron stopper, Marvin Bagley III?"
"Put some respek on Marvin ""LeBron Stopper"" Bagley III"
"Marvin Bagley III. And it's not really his fault, just kings fans wish we drafted Luka."
is marvin bagley iii a center?  their salaries match well.  oubre has more guaranteed money (although it's only $5M next year) but maybe kings would like a pick.  or is this just a lose-lose situation?
"I don’t know why people keep saying this, it’s false. It wasn’t even with KOC, it was with HoopsHype. It was prior to the lottery and Fox just listed off people he grew up around.  HH: I know you’ll be representing the Kings at the NBA draft lottery on May 15. Are there any prospects you’ve gotten a chance to look at and who stand out to you?  DF: I mean, there are guys like Michael Porter, Marvin Bagley III and DeAndre Ayton. There are a bunch of guys who I grew up seeing just because they’re only one year younger than me. Those are three guys I’ve known a while who are at the top of the lottery. I wouldn’t say I paid attention to just one of them; I enjoy college basketball, so I’ve watched a lot of those guys play."
"Marvin ""Flamebait"" Bagley III"
Is the guy that drafted Marvin Bagley III over Luka Doncic still around?
Marvin Bagley III come on down...to the Bulls!
"Bjelica was nice on Kings until they started playing Marvin Bagley III, that Kings were fun with Holmes, Bjelica Barnes, Hield and Fox and Bogdanovic off bench"
Horford is probably too good to meet your criteria of “decent but not great.” Some that probably do meet it that I haven’t seen mentioned yet though:  Wes Matthews     Garrett Temple      Special mention: Marvin Bagley III - his maternal grandfather played for the Pistons  and then in the ABA in the mid-60’s.
While Marvin Bagley III just fades quietly into the shadows ...
"""Multiple sources told me that Marvin Bagley III refused to check into Sunday's game when Luke Walton called upon him in the second half vs. the Suns."" Bitch made"
Or a Marvin Bagley III
"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
