it's tough watching deandre' Bembry getting crunch time minutes. he's not bad but I'm really missing of right about now
"Im pretty sure at one point last year I had to watch a lineup of Jeff Teague, Vince carter, Deandre Bembry, Bruno Fernando, and Damian Jones"
"I also watched Jeff Teague, Treveon Graham and DeAndre Bembry start last year"
"If Masai accepted trading Lowry for Matisse Thybulle as the main returning player, I'd immediately go to the Air Canada Centre and demand to see Masai to ensure he hasn't been drugged or kidnapped or blackmailed.  Thybulle has played 13mpg in 10 games this season so far and has looked terrible so far. We already got OG who fills the low volume 3nD wing except he is a better defender, better shooter, bigger frame all while being the same age. We already have Patrick McCaw, Nick Nurse favourite, who is a 3nD wing who actually plays as a backup PG (tho he is currently out) for us making him more valuable than Thybulle. We got Stanley Johnson who has surprisingly been good and fills the bottom half of the rotation energy hustle defense wing spot that Thybulle basically is. We got DeAndre Bembry who we just signed and could easily step in for a bench wing role with some ball handling.  Thybulle is just not valuable to the Raptors."

Bobby filled this team with bums.  Terrence Davis  Stanley Johnson  Aaron Baynes  Alex Len  DeAndre Bembry   And we couldnt even bring back RHJ who was solid defensively and hustled his ass off????
"so is rajon rondo better than all because he and the lakers won a lot last season? trae young is clearly the better player. the question is whos the better player not whose team is winning the most.  trae and the hawks literally almost beat the nets the other day and are 3-1 this season. id love to see what jamal murray could do in a team of damian jones, deandre bembry, 40 year old vince carter, and a bunch of rookies.   trae became an all star with that team. murrays with the way better team, has he ever been an all star? i mean wins over stats right?"
"Overrated is Matt Thomas. Some of our fans don't understand why he can't just do what guys like Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, JJ Redick or prime Kyle Korver can do. They act like he is the most lethal 3pt threat in the league, he just doesn't get opportunities to play and there's nothing else off about his game.   Underrated is DeAndre Bembry. He's been very good for us as a secondary ball handler, fast break finisher, and defender. He's pretty versatile out there always getting into passing lanes and making it more difficult for guys to get their shots off."
I want Thybulle even though we have Stanley Johnson and DeAndre Bembry who do 90% of what Thybulle does.
"You underestimate how much of a boner our front office has for 0-and-D players. Pat Mccaw, Stanley Johnson, Deandre Bembry."
The continued existence of DeAndre Bembry in the NBA is just baffling to me. This dude has now persuaded multiple teams to give him an NBA contract.
"Outside of a season ending injury to miltlple starters (touch wood this doesn't happen, sorry magic ‚ù§Ô∏è), there's no way this team is not making the playoffs.  Fade for cade was fun to think about, but we're too well coached with good pieces. We started deandre ""didn't get an offer from the hawks and signed here on a minimum"" bembry vs the sixers and the bucks and won."
I'd like to personally wish a Happy Valentines Day to DeAndre Bembry üòç
I was watching Celtics Raptors just now and some guy I didn‚Äôt recognize went to the scorers table about to check in. Turns out it was DeAndre Bembry
&gt; Deandre' Bembry   Dude sucks.  He's a try-hard with no 3 pter and can't finish.  He was in Atlanta and got pushed out the door.  The Raptors just need to do a complete rebuild or add a star like last time.
"DeAndre' Bembry on who‚Äôs more responsible: Him or Denver's Michael Porter Jr. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt compare myself with anybody,‚Äù Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a band-aid. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you interpret that however you want,‚Äù Bembry said."
Seriously. We went from Terrence 'Hole In The Mask' Davis to DeAndre 'First To Be Vaccinated' Bembry.

LOL you could see Deandre' Bembry throwing the ball at the end cuz he's mad that Trent is ruining the tank  /s
"Paul Watson, Deandre Bembry"
"Deandre bembry, although his lack of talent keeps him from getting minutes"
"I have a system I call I-TEST.  Basically I pour over game film and assign an index. However I have only used it for dong size probability as that is my primary interest. Current leader in I-TEST? Oddly enough, Deandre Bembry"
DeAndre' Bembry. I just love the way this guy plays and I'm always excited for him when he gets a spot start.
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"If I‚Äôd have known that after 5 years of not being able to shoot, drive, layup, or even dribble the ball he‚Äôd finally get his shit together, Deandre Bembry. All of a sudden he realized he gets payed attention to play basketball"
Payne and Deandre Bembry beat anyone in the league if they could finish better they would be unstoppable
DeAndre‚Äô Bembry because he was a beast at St.Joes
He got conditioned to expect misses after playing with taurean prince and deandre bembry as his wings his rookie year
"&gt;And now we got Capela finishing instead of deandre bembry  I can't tell you how much joy those words bring me. No matter what happens, to go from dudes like Bembry and Bazemore completely undermining Trae on offense while we were supposed to be tanking to our young star playing like a seasoned vet in his first ever playoff series with a group of solid pieces that trust his playmaking prowess and know where to be where their PG wants them to be is the prime example of what a good rebuild is supposed to look like. It's not about stacking talent or assets, it's about making the right moves to build around your young stars."
And now we got Capela finishing instead of deandre bembry üò≠

its spelled Deandre. Jordan is spelled DeAndre. Hunter is spelled De'Andre. Bembry is spelled DeAndre'. Learn.
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
He‚Äôs either prime mj or deandre bembry there is no in between
"Jersey brings:  - Kyrie / Jalen Brunson - Deandre Bembry - Kyle Anderson - JJJ / Kenny Faried  - KAT / Bam / Naz  Shaq or JR coaching, either way it‚Äôs hilarious."
quick someone get james jones to trade for deandre bembry
"Chris Boucher, Deandre Bembry and a 2024 FRP"
Hawks could use even Deandre Bembry at this point
"With all nba players such as: 42 year old VC, Jeremy Lin, Jeff Teague, Alex Len, Damion Jones, Miles Plumlee, Jabari Parker, Deandre Bembry, etc"
"He lead the NCAA in scoring an assists as a freshman. Hell, he averaged nearly 30 and 10 last year on a team that was giving heavy minutes to Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry, Jabari Parker, and 43 year old VC.   Yes, he would still be a great player wherever he went."
"I mean we believe you here. We got told every day that for two years Trae was empty stays because he couldn‚Äôt win starting Alex Len, Deandre Bembry, unpolished rookie Kevin Huerter, 42 year old Vince carter got SIGNIFICANT minutes, starting at the 4 quite a bit for us. I repeat, Vince Carter was our starting 4 and JC missed 25+ games both of Traes first two years in the league. We had 90+ MILLION DOLLARS in salary dedicated to Chandler parsons who played 9 minutes the entire season for us, Allen Crabbe who averaged 3 points on almost 20 minutes a game, and Evan fucking Turner. We had 3 of the worst 5 contracts in the entire league and this sub still laughed because Trae wasn‚Äôt winning averaging 30 and 10. That‚Äôs when I realized this sub does not look at context what so ever."
"He got thrown into some serious minutes right away at the start of his career. Especially the last two years, he was essentially the PG when Trae was out. Decision making really improved with reps. Became a very good defender this year which gets very overlooked. Just no one ever paid attention because the Hawks were rolling out deandre bembry and alex len out there"
"Honestly, the Raptors were doing pretty well before Siakam/OG/FVV/the entire coaching staff caught COVID, as they were the 4th seed in February, but things fell apart after the team was hit by COVID hard due to their lack of depth (DeAndre' Bembry was our starting PG for a while).  Unfortunately, Siakam also had to spent most of the season playing out of position as our centre to compensate for Baynes, since we lost our 2 best big men in Ibaka and Gasol last off-season."
Part of his charm! You‚Äôll see an intercepted pass to a wide open transition dunk. Then he‚Äôll chuck up a damn near 30 footer with 15 seconds on the shot clock. You boys better be lucky you‚Äôve never seen him share a court with Deandre Bembry. Two of the most lovable role players that throw up the most uncalled for shots ever. Lol love baze
How he was averaging 10 assists having to give the ball to Alex Len and DeAndre Bembry I will never know
"You think he built a team with 2 rookies playing about 30 mpg (Hunter and Reddish), Jabari Parker, DeWayne Dedmon, DeAndre Bembry, Jeff Teague, Allen Crabbe, Alex Len, Vince Carter, and Even Turner....And was seriously attempting to win basketball games? That's what you call tanking buddy."
Dump off passes to Omari Spellman and Deandre Bembry
"&gt;DeAndre Bembry  &gt;Taurean Prince  &gt;Traded Oubre  Mixed bag, Prince is a bad piece on a bad team, Bembry is on a minimum in Toronto, and Oubre is the best individual player, but was traded before he could really do anything for the team"
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
You're probably right because his name is DeAndre' Pierre' Bembry lmao. I'm a St. Joe's fan and have been following him for 9 years and honestly never noticed the apostrophe until now and he has two of them!
Isn‚Äôt that the same with DeAndres in the NBA?  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  DeAndre‚Äô Bembry  I could be missing someone but I think those are the only current 4

"I mean sure, they allowed Tatum to drop fifty in their sole loss in that series.   The highest total they allowed the Bucks to score was 115, and that was the overtime game seven. Bucks led the league in pts/g last season.   They clearly were able to turn up their intensity on that end in the postseason, and now they‚Äôve added a few defensive minded players in the off-season (Deandre Bembry, James Johnson, Jevon Carter). I‚Äôd like to see them add another big but ultimately I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a big concern for them."
"It already feels like they have that rep. Guys like RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry all signed here to try and turn their careers around.  Even during the Draft interview process, you had Mobley, Suggs and Barnes all speaking highly about the ""Raptors development system""."
deandre bembry  edit: ayton
God they are so nice now. I remember having to run Deandre Bembry at point when I played with them in 2k
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
He‚Äôs better than DeAndre Bembry and James Johnson.
If both the new guys are gonna be kept they'd have to cut James Johnson and DeAndre Bembry
"We filled a lot of holes this off-season. addressed the big man rotation(KD, Aldridge, BG, Millsap, Claxton Sharpe) addressed defense (Devon Carter, James Johnson, Millsap, DeAndre Bembry)‚Ä¶on paper this looks very nice"
"you forgot DeAndre Bembry, who they also picked up."
Stop it right now. Jabari Parker only got to play 13 games this year because he‚Äôs that bad Damian Jones played for three teams this year because he‚Äôs that bad and Deandre Bembrey is a worse three point shooter than Russ at 23.1%. I don‚Äôt see why you are fighting this so hard it‚Äôs ok for Trae to be better than Luka in something stop being so soft lol. Not to mention the two dudes you mentioned played less games then Deandre bembry did and the season was longer.
Barely. Also his starters. That stretch was Jabari Parker and Damian Jones and Deandre Bembry who are all significantly worse then who Luka is currently playing with.
That's Hawks legend Deandre Bembry you're talking about. Put some respect on his name.
"I mean I wouldn't have them at their pre 2021 form either but this subreddit is underrating them quite a bit. 32 wins is an insanely low total. We aren't tanking this year, the team is definitely trying to make the playoffs. Nurse has never been one to just throw out young players over the established guys if anything that's been one of his faults, FVV played lots of minutes last year, even Lowry played 35 mpg. Outside of the late season tanks he rarely throws the young guys to the wolves. People keep calling us a rebuilding team which I guess is kinda accurate but I think people have this idea that we won't be trying to win next year which is nowhere close to the case. Scottie completely shut down Beal in that game against Washington and I think got better every game on that end. He's someone that I think especially on defense is just gonna get better and better every game. We were running guys like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Deandre Bembry for a lot of last season, we had probably the worst C group in the NBA to the point that even someone as mediocre as Khem Birch made the team look so much better.   Obviously I could end up being wrong but I would be very surprised if we weren't a top 10 defense this year and win at least 40 games."
You forgot deandre bembry (27)
"Nets fans tried to warn you all. We get triggered when we hear the name DeAndre now, even though we‚Äôre referring to Bembry."
"That take is fucking ridiculous.  Please look at our team two years ago.  Outside of guys on rookie contracts we had 42 year old Vince getting 20mpg, Alex Len and Damian Jones playing basically all center minutes and DeAndre Bembry getting starter minutes.  It was legit painful to watch that team outside of Trae and JC (who was banned for 25 games)"
"I've always liked DeAndre' Bembry. It's the combination of flashy dunks, cool hair, and the fact that he wears #95"
Since when is DeAndre Bembry like THAT tho?
DeAndre Bembry was such an underrated pickup
Bembry seems to be the better DeAndre playing right now.
I refuse to believe that DeAndre Bembry is contributing to winning basketball.
Nets legend DeAndre Bembry.
"Harden has been possessed by the spirit of Ben Simmons  Bro you aren't here to set up DeAndre Bembry and Cam Thomas, you literally averaged 35 PPG 2-3 years ago"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

But is that a result of getting Patty Mills or guys like Deandre Bembry and Jevon Carter?
It's because he replaces DeAndre Bembry who is with all due respect doodoo.
When DeAndre Bembry taking almost 10 shots in a half of basketball you got major issues
People shit on DeAndre Bembry for his shooting (rightfully) but the Nets are at the top of the East
The refs were awful.  Coach Mose was really awful.  Everyone but Suggs was terrible on defense.  How hard is it to hard double Harden  when DeAndre Bembry and James Johnson are on the floor.   Just leave them open and don't even rotate.  Javon Carter as well.  They have 2 shooters on the floor just double freaking Harden.  Only Suggs realized that.
"Bruh, we really saw how well Harden could do with just a bunch of shooters and lob threats in Houston and then brought him to Brooklyn just so we can run him out there with DeAndre Bembry, Blake Griffin, Jevon Carter, and Bruce Brown."
For every six gamed where's he's DeAndre Bembry you get one where he's Paul George
If deandre Bembry play 30 mins against the warriors you are in trouble
"The Deandre Bembry Nets? I think Steph's better, but to act like it's not close or to form any opinion based off a single game when these guys have full careers to look at is just stupid.   And this title is just so annoying. Yeah, KDs better at rebounding, shot blocking, getting to the line. Regular season games in November don't really mean a whole a lot, it gets annoying watching every game be treated like it's a referendum on players' entire careers."
"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
Patty Mills  Bruce Brown  DeAndre Bembry  Paul Millsap  Lamarcus Aldridge
"Patty Mills, Jevon Carter, DeAndre Bembry, Paul Millsap and LaMarcus Aldridge.. pretty bad. Usually LMA is carrying that unit but he was off tonight."
"Sure 11/12 from the field is impressive,but not as impressive as DeAndre' Bembry statpadding masterclass where he got 4 Offensive Rebounds on a single possession in garbage time.Truly Drummondesque."
"Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Bembry, Patty Mills. The Nets front office is world class."
Not as impactful as some other names on other teams but patty mills and DeAndre bembry have been great
We signed the wrong Deandre. Bembry and Jordan both suck.
"Harden is starting to get a bit better, but Steve Nash continues his questionable rotations. It‚Äôs fine at this stage of the year, but I‚Äôd like to see a more consistent line up going into December.   DeAndre Bembry is looking like a good addition, though with Carter and Brown idk how we‚Äôll be splitting the defensive guard minutes. Whenever Kyrie decides to get vaxxed we‚Äôll see how the rotations end up.   Joe Harris has lost it, but thankfully Patty Mills has been picking up the slack for it. I don‚Äôt necessarily regret giving him the money, but he something is definitely off with him.   The team still needs a big man who can rebound, it‚Äôs been a glaring weakness for a couple years and I hope this is the thing they address closer to the trade deadline. I don‚Äôt know who is for sale, but I think that‚Äôs the necessary piece to put this team into a better spot (and getting Kyrie back for more scoring of course)."
DeAndre Bembry and Jevon Carter playing like prime MJ and Pippen.
and miss some extended DeAndre' Bembry minutes? couldn't be me
