How does that change anything about my statement? Also it's funny that you bring up that's series because he had the classic James Harden 2/11 that series. He just can't avoid these performances. They always happen.
"Great defense and James Harden? That's not possible. From what I've read in the past couple weeks, he's no better than a revolving door."
"Yeah, because playing off ball is super unimportant.   Curry gets fed all his shots on top. But also Curry being better playing off ball is an afterthought in your comment. And my take is ""such a nephew take"".   I didn't say Curry is better. I didn't make any absolute statements. You're the one doing that, which pretty definitively makes you wrong by default, because this isn't a debate between James Harden and some scrub. It's a debate between two multiple-time MVPs. Saying one is definitively better is stupid.   The argument can be made that Curry is a better facilitator. You can't just throw up assist numbers and say Harden's got more assists so he's better. Harden does so little off ball and Curry does so much that it more than makes up the difference. The ways Curry cuts and screens generate open looks for others just as much as the way he passes."
"Maybe casually isn't the word, but you don't move a generational talent (and Kyrie absolutely is, maybe not impact wise but the ceiling of what he's capable of) for Robert Covington and Steven Adams or anything like that. In this set up, when you've got to guard KD and Harden, Kyrie can probably eviscerate any defense in the playoffs. That's extremely valuable. He's a better shot-maker than Harden. You can get serviceable players before the playoffs start. The nets have shown that they can play okayish defense when they want to. They have a playable NBA center coming back (Claxton), they just signed an athletic big (pelle) and they just got Iman Shumpert. For all we know, that fixes a lot of their issues. They've been without a playable big man since getting James Harden. I just never saw the sense in giving up on the chance for the GOAT offense with zero chance of being stopped for a couple of guys who won't move the needle as much as you think in the playoffs, especially when the issues can be somewhat solved. Trading one of these guys rarely works out"
Bro what? The back-to-back MVP isn't a superstar? James Harden isn't a superstar? Are you smoking crack?
you had james fucking harden lmfao
"&gt; PG is getting more than one free throw attempt in any given game   I'm not so sure about that, dude isn't that effective any more as a driver, he's become much more like Klay Thompson.   &gt; Oh, and would everyone stop trying to post up James Harden? I get that you are supposed to attack him on defense but not there. That's the one spot he can actually defend.  Kawhi is honestly not the right type of player to attack Harden. Harden's weakness is speed, and Kawhi doesn't really have that. And we saw that Kawhi couldn't move Harden.   TBH it was kind of surprising how the Clippers didn't try any Lou Will/Kawhi actions to force Kyrie onto Kawhi and attack him on defense."
"This was a good game and the Nets absolutely earned the win but I love what I saw from the Clippers. You have to figure that if this were a seven-game series, PG is getting more than one free throw attempt in any given game and that alone could be a difference maker.  I think it's also worth noting that despite how much he's memed here, the Clippers really missed Patrick Beverley's defense tonight. Would Kyrie still drop 39? I mean, he most definitely could. Would they be a lot harder against Beverley than it was versus Reggie/Lou/Kennard? No doubt.   Oh, and would everyone stop trying to post up James Harden? I get that you are supposed to attack him on defense but not there. That's the one spot he can actually defend."
I think they'd be better. You can't build a wall when James Harden and Kyrie Irving are on the floor.
"&gt;Which suggests that he was a top 10 player  uhh not really? Lebron James was 3rd team that year. Was Kyrie better than him? If you think Kyrie was a top 10 player that year then he had to be better than 4 out of Lebron, Steph, KD, AD, Harden, Giannis, PG (remember that was PG's ""MVP"" era), Jokic, Dame, Butler, Russ, Embiid, Kawhii and CP3. He might have an argument over 1-2 of those guys, but he was definitely not top 10.  &gt;Then why gatekeep that ?  Gatekeep what? The term all time great? Terms are defined by use. Like how literally now means figuratively. People dont use the term all time great so loosely.   &gt;Repeat - I wasn't the one gatekeeping or suggesting any hard lines  Yea you were. You were the one who wanted to draw hard lines. I've never stated that my opinion is some kind of fact or gatekept anything. In my first reply to you I even qualified my statement with ""I would say that....."".   &gt;I did point out that all time great often was used to referenced careers (eg hakeem on raptors) and not current or peak. And HoF does reference careers  I'm not sure how this is relevant in any way, it seems like a huge strawman. I challenge you to point out where I contradicted this point. Did I say all time greats have to be good right now and not over their careers? That's nonsensical. Obviously you look at an entire career. Kyrie's career just isn't that good.  &gt;There's a lot of All-Stars who you could place below Kyrie.. he's not in the lowest echelon or occasional finding there.  I also challenge you to find where I said he was the worst all star ever...."
It's KD and James Harden imo. I think they just run a lot of iso with Kyrie because James and KD are versatile enough to play other roles.

"James Harden can play solid defense, but has in the past shown he doesn’t care enough to do so for like 95% of the regular season"
"Tonight it really shows how well they can work together. We heard this about Harden from Steph last year but people sort of wrote it off.. “James doesn’t want to play this way”.   Now he can just be a really good point guard, Kyrie can not worry about playmaking as much and truly be “mini-Kobe”, and KD is KD no matter what team he’s on or who he’s playing with, or against. This team is scary as shit."
James Harden is a fire hydrant in the post. You can't move him lol. Kawhi tried a couple times and even he failed.
They stopped caring about the season when the Brooklyn Nets acquired James Harden.
"All-stars Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Nicolas Batum"
James Harden is finally a main facilitator. /s   Go Beard! Go Clutch City!
Harden is focusing on facilitating now. Which is exactly what he should be doing if he wants to win a chip. I'm excited for a motivated James Harden again
"If you believe Marc Stein (and he's as reputable as they get so no idea why you wouldn't), Milwaukee was fairly confident about keeping Giannis before Free Agency began and before Myers signed that contract. Agents and league execs talk but when it was official that Giannis was signing the super max, there very likely wasn't a team in the Giannis sweepstakes that was shocked by the news. By the time Myers Leonard signed his new deal with the Heat, Pat Riley very likely had already moved on to James Harden or Bradley Beal."
"Well if you're so insistent that the Nets don't get a selection, can you tell me which of these 3 players doesn't get in.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Kevin Durant|F|E|BRK|16|30.9|7.4|5.6|0.8|1.4|2.9|0.520|0.447|0.873| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945|"

"No, James Harden is worth more than Allen and LeVert. You ignore the picks. The team got better this season with the trade"
I think having James Harden basically playing point guard is/ will really open up his offensive game since he can just focus on his self and not trying to set up teammates
"Definitely playoff minutes for James Harden lol, trying to play him into shape"
"Tell me more about how average at best defender, 6’5” James harden is a bad matchup for Joel Embiid"
"Harden has had like 5 highlight plays against a center. That is not locking down.   Relying on 6’5 James Harden to be a primary defender on Embiid, AD, Giannis, Jokic, etc is a laughable strategy"
James harden has locked down centers before. Since hes not scoring as much hell have the energy to defend.
"Gerrit cole, James harden, Deshaun Watson?  At least we got 94 chip over em and 3 baseball postseason victories over em"
"Greatest Big 3 of all time. They will get their damn respect in July. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving are the underrated trio."
James harden is so freaking good
Nets played better D now that their best defender James Harden is back in the lineup 👀
"Nets Big 4: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Tyson Fury."
"James ""Tom Brady"" Harden"
"James ""Tom Brady"" Harden"
"Let it really sink in for a sec.   The league seriously let the Nets get away with signing Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  **What the *fuck* were we all thinking?**"
James harden
"  Imagine Kevin Durant getting hot. You have to focus on him. Then there’s James Harden, one of the greatest scorers of all time. You have to focus on him. Kyrie Irving, one of the most efficient players of all time. You have to focus on him too. Then, that’s not even the end. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. You have to focus on him. And then there’s, Jeff Green. He’s not gonna do anything, right??? Other than shoot over 45% from 3......  This Nets team might be as good as the 2017 Warriors."
"3 places higher than James Harden... I’m not really sure what these are really even supposed to represent, but I get the feeling they don’t mean too much"
James Harden is a QB

"James ""Jon Jones"" Harden"
James Harden and fouling players named Marcus late in the game.
Pandemic P is not as good as James Harden - who could have guessed?
James. Harden.
Kyrie is a better scorer than James Harden. Harden has just mastered gaming the system morey style lol
So do half the other superstars lmao acting like he created this type of play. Look at James Harden.
He is James Harden but not as good of a shooter. I think he is great but he is very Harden'esque.
"JAMES ""MID-RANGE"" HARDEN. YES PLEASE."
Still amazes me that we have James fuckin Harden on the bench rn lmao while having Kyrie and KD playing
"Let James Harden handle the facilitating when Kyrie is hot. Just score, Kyrie."
"It really just hit me that the league let the Nets get away with signing Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  What the fuck were we all thinking."
"I tend to agree - I really don't think turning Luka into basically James Harden in terms of the weight of the offense being entirely on him is that healthy. He gets compared to LeBron a lot and sure I see why but offensively he's at least a bit more like Harden in his shot diet and what he hunts for, and in terms of how much is on him. Think that's probably a bit of an error."
"The advanced stats from last year also say Whiteside was .2 win shares off Kawhi? Gobert had more than Lebron? I could tell you exactly why that is, doesn’t mean they had a better season. BPM also again, relies on 4 other people on your team. Not a the best stat to use. In fact it would be one of the last. It doesn’t tell me the difference between 1st in BPM and 10th in BPM.  How can you say Lebron was better on defense? In what way hahaha? Because he finished higher in the defensive player of the year. He got one more first placed vote? I’ll admit Lebron is a better defender but we are like saying the difference between the best defender in the league and the second, it’s so marginal it isn’t even a factor and not guaranteed either. Wade averaged 2 steals and 1 block, how many players have done that as a guard?   I’m not completely ignoring it, if wades team was already a playoff team fair enough. But his team was lottery the year before. You brought up something two years in the future and used that as an argument for Lebron? That’s impossible to calculate. Like Kobe vs Nash, you can give it to the ‘ team’ with the better record, but you can easily make an argument for the other way around. James harden better numbers last year, just not the better record.   Plenty of justification for Wade winning it. Don’t have to give it to the best record, quite simple really."
Why is Kyrie trying to create his own shot with 3 Clippers surrounding him when he has KD and/or James Harden on the court with him?
Is this the James Harden-esque heel turn?
"I just think he’s suffering from overhype lol. He’s a great player, gonna be a top 5 player for sure once the older more established players retire. I can see him being a James Harden type where he’s always in the MVP conversation and competing for the chip, but I don’t see him being this so called new “GOAT” that his fanboys crowned him as. You gotta expect the hate to come after so many people anointed him the new face of the league when he hasn’t accomplished much yet."
Pretty sure Deandre Jordan just fouled James Harden right there.
James Harden fans 🤝 Russell Westbrook fans 🤝 Paul George fans 🤝 Giannis Antetokounmpo fans     Finding a new player for r/NBA to slander
"You got JAMES FUCKING HARDEN on your team and wasting him on playmaking? I get he's a good playmaker and whatnot, but he's literally a 3x scoring champion, just let him shoot the fuck out, man"
Can James Harden stop playing like a damn role player and look to score?!
I want the Clippers to lose...  ...this means I must root for James Harden?
My statement is true for literally any defender vs an elite scorer. Prime Gary Payton is not going to stop James Harden. Prime Ron Artest isn't going to stop KD. That's just how it is.
Pretty dumb to compare Old man Perk to  multiple time 6th man of the year Harden no shit Perk wasn’t playing at a high lvl and isn’t held to James Hardens lvls
"Of course, but there are magnitudes of no calls, and certain players receive mroe no calls than others and vice versa. I agree, I don't think it's intentional, but it persists. We have stats to prove it too. Look at Jeremy Lin, Goran Dragic, or Shaq, or LeBron, all receive a higher percentage of no calls than say Jimmy Butler or James Harden etc...   Just because other players don't receive calls too, doesn't mean Luka or LeBron etc... wasn't hit on a call. He has a right to be pissed, but do it at a deadball, not while the other team is looking to score."
"&gt; Nets won't be able to afford to keep him  Their owner is one of the wealthiest people in the world, they definitely could have afforded to keep him. They would have had his full Bird rights so they could have exceeded any offer he got from anyone. After all, he's not gonna be making the kind of money that James Harden is."
&gt; “great offense beats great defense”  People don't understand that this only is true on an individual level. A great offensive player (like KD/Harden and even Kyrie to a certain extent) will generally score against a great defensive player. Patrick Beverley hasn't and won't ever shut down James Harden.  But a great defensive team can do absolute work against a great offense.
"This dude seriously just said Manu is more important to winning than James Harden, wow. Replace Harden with Manu on any of the Rockets teams and they don’t even make the playoffs, and they’re most likely in the lottery."
"The Nets obtained James Harden and gave away Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen, Rodion Kurucs and Taurean Prince, their umprotected first round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, plus a first round pick swap (so if the pick of the other team is lower that that of the Nets they trade those picks) in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.  The Cavaliers obtained Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince and gave away Milwaukee's umprotected first round pick in 2022 and Dante Exum.  The Pacers obtained Caris LeVert and a 2nd round pick in 2023 from Houston and gave away Victor Oladipo.  The Rockets obtained Victor Oladipo, Rodion Kurucs, Dante Exum, the Nets 3 umprotected first round picks, Milwaukee's 1st round pick (via Cleveland), the Nets 4 1st round pick swaps and gave away James Harden and a 2023 2nd round pick."
"Rockets get: Victor Oladipo + A shitload of picks  Nets get: James Harden + some picks  Cleveland gets: Jarett Allen, Taurean Prince + some picks  Pacers get: Caris Levert + some picks"
"James gave OKC nothing Perk took everything by being on the court. Harden wasn’t even that bad especially since he was only like 20, but Perkins was useless"
"""It'd be a lot harder for James Harden to put up the #s he's consistently putting up in the 90s where there was no spacing and nobody on his team could make an open corner 3.""  I completely agree with your whole post, but reddit misses out on the inverse of this. People think the talent has improved dramatically and all role players are much better when in reality having them just space the floor while still not handling the ball has just helped them excel in ways role players in the past weren't often utilized.   Offensive strategy has improved to help role players, which in turn helps stars as they don't get hard doubled as often or as much and players are forced to stay on their guy. This doesn't mean the stars of yester-year are trash though nor incapable of developing a 3 point shot(as many stars in the past decade have done, especially bigs that previously never shot threes) nor does it mean those players were any less.  The 2000's were brutal for offenses, but that doesn't mean the players themselves were as brutal. Instead of appreciating what certain stars were able to accomplish with little spacing and harder defenses, due to the way the game was officiated, people act like 2000's basketball was awful and just iso-garbage(and isolation plays in themselves aren't even garbage lol)."
"""Roster's not yet finished"" is not a great argument. What NBA team, or any sports team anywhere, has a finished roster. Roster's are always in flux. It is finished until it's not. Yes, this is semantics bit the bottom line is the Harden trade, not James Harden himself, but the totality of all the players in the deal made the Nets worse. Yes, I said it. The Nets are worse off after the trade."
James Harden approves.
"Kendrick Perkins claims James Harden played poorly vs. Miami Heat in 2012 Finals due to constant strip club trips  Peter Dewey Kendrick Perkins was teammates with James Harden on the Oklahoma City Thunder when they faced the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.  Miami won the series in five games, and Perkins recently revealed that Harden’s struggles were because of all the activities, including strip clubs, that were available to him in Miami.    “Man, James ain’t give a s— and you know why,” Perkins said after explaining that everyone else brought their A games to the series. “Motherf—— King of Diamonds and everything cut a hole in his hands.”  Perkins also explained that they didn’t run into the same problem against the San Antonio Spurs because there was less to do in the city.  “In San Antonio, you didn’t have a damn thing to do,” Perkins added. “Shit, we got to motherf—— Miami, it was every-motherf——-thing to do. We couldn’t get that motherf—– to buy a bucket in that motherf—–.”  Harden averaged just 12.0 points per game in the series and shot 9-for-31 from the floor.  The Thunder would eventually break up their young core with Harden moving on to Houston. He now is reunited with Kevin Durant in Brooklyn.  Miami may have had a better team anyway, but Harden’s struggles certainly helped the Heat win the 2012 Finals."
"Wrong.  Top 10 in order and if you disagree you’re wrong.  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić"
yea because james harden is one of the best shooters and scorers ever. Either way he's way better than butler
The Brooklyn Nets by double digits. The Brooklyn Nets are 5-0 in National TV games  (excluding NBA TV games) this season. Only the the Milwaukee Bucks game has been close and that’s only because it was James Harden second game with the team and Kyrie Irving was out.
"Exactly, Inside the NBA is a major problem for the NBA. They shit on the product, they don't understand the product, and because they always reference their credentials (ringz Erneh), people take their opinions far more seriously than they should.   Like, all of them think that there's no defense in the NBA right now, which is patently false, evidenced by the last 2 NBA champions, they just don't get that it's much *harder* to play defense now because of the combination of rule changes and the increase in volume in the 3-point shot, which therefore increases the space that these insanely skilled players have to work with.   It'd be a lot harder for James Harden to put up the #s he's consistently putting up in the 90s where there was no spacing and nobody on his team could make an open corner 3.   That's not this era of basketball being *soft* or *worse*, that's the evolution of basketball, and it's bad for the NBA that Chuck and Shaq try and paint it the way they do."
"You know they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at James Harden you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another baller you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal! So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me! And then you add Kyrie Irving to the mix? You-the chances of winning drastically go down. See, the 3-Way in Brooklyn, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, cuz Kyrie KNOOOWS he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try. So, James Harden you take your thirty three and a third chance minus my twenty five percent chance (if we was to go one on one) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning the NBA Finals. But then you take my 75 perchance-chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds…percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning the NBA finals! Señor Harden! The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you this NBA season."
im not saying simmons is better than james harden
I’d love your reasoning as to why James harden isnt even in the top 10
"\&gt;Rockets win championship  Reporter: ""so is James Harden going to get a ri-""  Rockets owner: ""No."""
"Dlo plays like he's James Harden last year minus the production and Rubio just... well idk but he's just not good. Plays hard in defense, has decent synergy with Naz Reid but everything else has been bad from him."
"I didn't say I necessarily agreed with the take, simply that those things may have been where it came from. I think Luka is much more similar in regards to playstyle to James Harden than Nikola Jokic, but I don't think it's ludicrous for that comparison either."
What are you talking about?   I never said anything about Allen being a play maker. I’m saying we didn’t have any play making and now we do because we have James Harden.   I don’t know what to tell you if you really think Jarrett Allen and Caris are better than Harden? It’s ignorant.   Even Javale if we can get him in the buyout will bring our defense up far beyond where it is. It’s not that hard to find a big. There’s no replacing what James Harden brings to the table.
&gt;Giving Harden as a similar example for Beal is just insane  Harden had actually lead his team to the playoffs every year and to multiple conference finals. Beal hasn't done shit in comparison.   He was there for 8 contract years. Most players dont even last that long with their rookie deal included. How many times has Lebron James signed a second contract with a team after using up all their assets? You just wanna paint him that way so you'll spin it anyway you can.
"What Harden has to do with this? Here is what Harden did in Houston:  1. He said that only him and Howard are important, everyone else was replacable 2. He feuded with Howard 3. He feuded and played major role in the sacking of his coach 4. He feuded with CP3 which let to his trade 5. He feuded with Westbrook.  6. He publicly said that the team is not good enough   The whole organisation's main goal was to please James and he still wanted more.

I've been watching the games. He shoots them like he's James Harden out there.
Pretty much how I feel every time Kyrie ISO’s when James harden is on the same court multiplied by 1000 lmao.  Actual question though cause I’ve had limited opportunities to watch y’all play; have they started using Kyrie for catch and shoot/drives off of James Harden kick outs yet? Cause that really just sounds disgustingly efficient
"Yes because the rockets only wanted Herro for mvp winner James Harden 🤡🤡 you're a casual  [The Rockets asking price from Miami for James Harden included Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, two first-round picks, and 4 pick swaps.](https://twitter.com/LegionHoops/status/1349806703513100292)"
I mean... just last week they didn’t want to trade herro for James Harden lol. You tell me.
James Harden is about to COVID protocol himself out of ASG duties
Y’all really fina have the strip club king James Harden in the strip coin capital of the country
"He told us to fuck off after not getting out of the West.  You children are dumb, we catered this team to him, got him cp3, he didn’t like that, hemorrhaged our future to get him Russ, he didn’t like that, then the second he realized it wouldn’t work he was gone.  Let me repeat, FUCK JAMES HARDEN!"
"While Book + Luka Makes a very big guard lineup and gives a team two playmakers that can do everything offensively, they would suffer horribly defensively.     Neither of them are great defenders and both generally rely on using their size to switch and defend guys that won't shoot, so that better wing defenders can guard whoever the attacker is on the opposing team.    Suns would need to rely on Mikal Bridges even more than they do now and wouldn't have Ayton to anchor the paint. They'd probably have to keep Baynes, who is good, but generally relies on drawing charges rather than defending the paint; which will be more vulnerable with Book/Luka getting blown by every once in a while.    They'd look like early James Harden Houston Rockets, but presumably with more movement in Monty's .5 offense."
Imagine being the miserable fuck who feels like they have to defend James Harden from people joking about him wearing a rain coat inside.
Yeah but vetoing having James Harden on his team just to up his reputation and legacy (if he were to get the ring) would've been extremely dumb.
I've said it before but I rather watch James Harden throw 40 FT per game if it means the Lakers losing
"No, he didn’t. He said that *style* where James harden was averaging 40 PPG for a month where hardens 2nd, 3rd, and 4th best players were out wouldn’t be able to win a chip. And he was right, so much so that harden even literally agreed with him on camera lmao  https://youtu.be/3kmKftGsUbs  So next time maybe try listening"
"It can definitely bridge the gap. I mean James Harden just went for picks and Caris LeVert lol.  So sure it would take Wiseman, the 4th pick, and possibly some other picks/players but those two assets would be the highlights of the trade package."
"Kobe Bryant: Rockets can't win championship with James Harden dominating ball. ... ""I'm not a fan of in terms of winning championships, I don't think that style is ever going to win championships,"" Bryant, the former Los Angeles Lakers star said in a clip released from an upcoming episode of ESPN's ""The Jump.""  Yeah he pretty much said exactly that."
"&gt; If we're emphasizing lowlights, Harden has lost to SA in the 2nd round when they were missing their best player.  bruh you're conflating an issue we both agree on: harden and Durant have both had massive choking series' in the post season lol   &gt;KD put up 30ppg on 65ts%  Exactly which fits my narrative nicely:he can shoot well in single coverage *but he doesn't make his teammates better because of his lack of playmaking, basketball intelligence, and ball handling* which is evidenced by them getting absolutely throttled in 5 games lol  &gt;has James ever led a team to the finals?  No. But harden didn't take the easy way out even though curry smoked him every year since 2015 *unlike Kevin Durant*  &gt;This isn't going well for you.  Ya sure thing buddy"
"James Harden's defensive inefficiencies are not of a small sample size. Also, James Harden disappearing in the biggest games is not of a small same size. LOL."
"When you need a little help getting Keven Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving over the top! You know between the 3 point shot being mastered and exploited analytics also player made super teams. I would take 80's, 90's, 00's and 2010's ball over this current 2021 version.  Color me old and soggy."
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
James Harden
blake's going to coast to the final against the phoenix suns and with 2 seconds left in game 7 and down 183-182 steve nash will put him in and he's going to get a side line lob from james harden and smash the best dunk we've seen in the history of basketball and his knees will explode and he'll be carried off the court to lift the trophy
This is still his [best outfit for me](https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/james-harden-neon-suit.jpg)
TIL:  James Harden doesn't play the game the right way which makes his resume incredible.   Imagine if he played the right way?
so do James Harden and Karl Malone
"&gt;Rockets GM says argument could be made for James Harden to be called best offensive player ever                    Is this wrong? I think you *could* make a good-faith argument that Harden is the best offensive player ever, especially during his MVP season when Morey said that. There's obvious arguments to be made for MJ, and maybe Kobe, LeBron, KD, but Harden has a case."
Fuck no. If you wanna make the argument in the regular season then go for it. When it matters though? James harden had a game 7 against a Spurs team missing kawhi and out up 10 points on 18% shooting and fouled out lol. They aren’t on the same level
"&gt;	Tougher question (maybe). Who do you take to start a franchise, Durant or Harden?  Not a tough question. Which player contributes more toward winning basketball games? Which player has led historic offenses? Which player has done well (from time to time) against top 10 defenses? Which player increases his players’ shooting effiency? Which player always rounds out in the top 5 of impact metrics.   All the  answers to these are james harden.   Harden can create, he can be trusted to initiate the offense, his playmaking holds up in the post season. Yes harden has had tough playoff performances (who hasn’t?) but the issue is that Harden didn’t join a 73 win team after getting his ass kicked them the prior year     This is being harsh but him joining the warriors is the weakest move in all of sports history. He couldn’t beat Curry so he *joined him*"
That’s exactly what I think. He had harden/WB in OKC. He had *stephen fucking curry* in his prime creating and doing all the heavy offensive lifting. And now he has james harden.   Ive said it before but this was his year to prove he can be a primary ball handler and elevate his teammates but now he has harden.
&gt;	What evidence is there to that? The year Westbrook was injured KD won MVP leading his team to 59 wins on .63 TS.  Any of his post seasons in 2014-2016. WB played half the year and then Durant almost *lost to the grizzlies in the first round* if Reggie jackson didn’t bail him out.   &gt;	But KD was leading a bunch of star 22 year olds and LeBron the Heatles.  Nah that was James harden creating and being the focal point of the Heat’s defense.   &gt;	I think KD’s relative value has gone down because its a lot more common now for players to have high efficiency and combine that with playmaking.  Ya unfortunately he does not have the playmaking the other greats do. And it shows: he’s never had team success really as the primary ball handler and creator

"its James Harden, Kyrie, and some amazing pieces like Harris, Brown, etc. It's an insanely good roster. This idea that he had to ""do it from scratch"" is beyond ridiculous. It's 2 MVPs in their prime and Kyrie who might end up being the greatest 3rd option in basketball history."
"&gt; It's just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan...You give James Harden the ball and before you're giving up the ball how many points do you generate, which is how you should measure offense, James Harden is by far #1 in NBA history."""

"AS weekend made me forget for a few days that Durant, Kyrie and James Harden are playing on the same team, like, how did we get here"
It had little to do with Jarrett Allen leaving. It's mostly due to James Harden being on the team who knows how to get him his looks
"Almost like James Harden gaining weight to force a trade, then beginning to lose it once he gets traded."
*happy James harden noises*
"Imagine having to be a Brooklyn fan right now, what an absolutely embarrassing group of players put together.   Kevin ""Lemme just join the best team so I can check this box"" Durant  James ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas, I give up"" Harden  Kyrie ""I'm an Actual Genius"" Irving  Blake ""Detriot? More like Deez Nuts, lemme know when the game is over"" Griffin  Thank god for the people of NY the Knicks are playing well right now."
Bro you have james harden. Any bigs who can catch the ball will have more than 10 points per game
Yeah I'd still for sure give all that up tbh. Not saying it's a small price but if Herro is the best thing you're giving up in a trade for James Harden you just gotta do it and figure out the fallout after. Besides if there's any coach who can turn some fringe rotation guy into the next Duncan Robinson or Kendrick Nunn it's Spo. Not to mention the guys you'd get on the buyout market looking to ringchase. I think you'd reload your depth a lot quicker than you think.
They did it with James fucking harden you think they won't do it for griffin. Lakers fans when harden got traded bought the memes and said lakers in 5 now they are saying nets are op and its unfair.
"Well honestly it just seems a little ridiculous that the Nets would think they need more people after acquiring James fucking Harden. So that has something to do with it. But like someone else said, I don’t think people have been watching Blake this season and how ineffective he’s been."
Has any player looked worse playing James Harden?
Add a couple more pieces and you could’ve had James Harden..
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"So bcs he is the second best he is supposed to play with ymca players, he second best player when he was Young was mo Williams now compare that with not wanting to play with westbrook. I dont know if You are insane enough to argue that Durant is better than lebron but for me he is top 20 if he won this year would just kyrie i would have given him Credit and put him top 10 but adding james Harden a top 30 player in league history is yet Again not fair and i dont give a shit if its brooklyn who never won."
Paul Pierce - Egocentric asshat.  James Harden - Egocentric asshat.
I know this is an all star game but James Harden literally reverting back to James Harden.
You mean James “spend 250k at a strip club” Harden isn’t a role model?
Wow james harden trying his hardest on Def per usual
"They just missed the point of All-Star completely. KD chose a bunch of ISO guys who focused on getting shots like what they can normally get in games.   LeBron chose guys who would play off each other well and they were getting crazy opportunities as a result of it. He had all the best playmakers and off-ball players.   They had facilitators like:  * Luka, CP3, Jokic, LeBron - 4 generationally great playmakers  And then on the end of those plays they had:  * Giannis, Curry, Gobert, Brown - Really efficient off-ball players  And then you've still got Lillard and Paul George in the mix...   Hell, the reason Giannis went 16/16 is because he was mostly being fed good opportunities and he's so good on capitalising on them. CP3 + Giannis was killer.  Whereas Team KD came down to ISO ISO ISO. Even at the end you could hear Doc saying ""when Kyrie and James [Harden] get the ball clear out and give them space""."
James Harden burner???
You're forgetting this rather obscure player named James Harden who was also included in the Jarrett Allen trade
How does ESPN still have James Harden listed as a Rocket? https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden https://imgur.com/a/6VLyUbX
"I know it’s James Harden for team Durant, but which player has the fat suit on team LeBron?"

He got the james harden step down already lmao
Some classic James Harden defence on display there
People thought small ball tucker with James Harden and Westbrook was going to beat them.
The biggest obstacle to the Nets chances will be if James Harden or Kevin Durant want to mention the earth is round in front of Kyrie.

I appreciate that the fake fans are just as excited for Vucevic as they are for James Harden.
"Everybody knows Harden is a dumbass, I guess people expect a little more from James, for some reason. I certainly don't.  Being a freak athlete and shooting the ball gud doesn't make you an expert or role model on anything else."

Why james harden is not in this contest ?
"Let me get this straight, so KD signed with a 73 win team that took pay cuts to form a literal starting 5 of all stars. Now he's in brooklyn where in the span of two years he has another damn near starting 5 of all stars in Irving, Harden and Griffin.   Kevin Durant is the best player in the world and LeBron James needs help to win? Bro, the hypocrisy on the internet is getting out of hand. Keep that energy consistent for fuck sake, this shit is weak."
"&gt;Dont see a scenario where Nets lose to the Lakers with everyone healthy.  It's not hard to figure.  Los Angeles has an effective FG% of 54.3.  Brooklyn is at 58.8% -- and this will drop if they let Griffin shoot.  The Lakers have the best defense in the league, holding teams just about 2% under the median.  Brooklyn's defense is not good, and getting worse with this signing.  So that will narrow the gap to probably around 1%, maybe less.  Let's say the numbers are roughly 55% Los Angeles to 56% Brooklyn, going head-to-head.  That's a difference of 1.6 points per 80 field-goal attempts.  Free-throws are about a wash, with Brooklyn making 1 more per game in the regular season -- but the Lakers foul less than the median team.  And last year, Harden alone saw a 2 FT/game drop in both attempts and makes from the regular season to the playoffs.  The Lakers are the best defensive rebounding team in the league, and better than the Brooklyn on the offensive glass, too.  Specifically, the Lakers grab 80% of defensive rebounds vs 78% for Brooklyn, and 23% of offensive vs 21% for Brooklyn.  That yields a few additional possessions per game, which is opportunity to make the one additional basket the Lakers need to overcome the 1.6 point Brooklyn advantage from field-goals.  These numbers are obviously estimates, but it is easy to see how the Nets can lose.  Also, just for the record, Harden, Irving, and Durant all see drops in eFG% from regular season to playoffs, as most players do.  The first two see large drops.  Meanwhile, James' eFG% drops only slightly in the playoffs, Schroder's stays the same, and Davis' actually goes way up ( in the smallest sample size of the 6 )."
Basically my point. Yes the coaching helps this team but with kd kyrie and harden on the floor at the same time is their all time best offense isn’t due to the sets they run. They could run whatever set they want and James harden will still nail a step back three in the other teams face.
"The Pelicans have the most efficient offense in the league the last month or so and that’s without an all NBA player so SVG is doing something right on that end. James Harden and mediocre shooting has proven enough to have a top 3 offense historically. Add in Kyrie, a healthy KD, and the shooting the Nets have and you don’t need much to get historic"
it's KD's fa fault his GM traded for James Harden.
Hold James Harden hostage..
This was the James harden vs Russell westbrook mvp debate to me.   Two less rebounds vs 6% better true shooting and more wins
"What's stopping Minnesota or Charlotte from offering a better package for Harden than what the Nets offered? What stopped the Cavs from acquiring Amare at the deadline that year?  I find it hard to believe that small markets don't have a trade package to acquire superstar players. I find it much easier to believe that they do have the packages that could acquire those guys but they're scared that those players would want out very soon or that they wouldn't want to go there at all.   I'm sure that Wolves picks would be much much more attractive to the Rockets than those Nets picks. Maybe one day one of those small market teams will have the balls to say hey, let's go get this superstar and we'll pair him with KAT or LaMelo or whoever the star is that they currently have, and they'll go get that James Harden or even a Bradley Beal type of player and say fuck it.   I'm just using those two teams as an example. I don't see why you couldn't go get a star that might have one or two years left on his contract and say hey, we're acquiring you, figure it out with KAT or don't, you're going to be here for the next year and a half.   There was no guarantee that AD would have stayed with the Lakers, but they said hey, we have LeBron and the assets to get AD, we're going to acquire him with no assurances that he'll re-sign with us and let's see what happens. I don't think that's some once in a lifetime scenario only available to the Lakers because they play in Los Angeles. The Lakers had one star and the assets to acquire another star who only had 1 year left on his deal and made it anyway.   What's stopping the Twolves from getting one other than fear? All these small markets do is luck into one star, surround them with garbage (assuming they don't luck their way into another star or two in the lottery), piss away their careers for 7 years then trade them in year 8 and complain that stars are always leaving them."
"&gt;""Trae Young is the 19th most popular player in the league"" is hardly a flex.  I would say being top 20 without being on a playoff team counts as pretty popular.   &gt;Also, last year, he had 2.8m votes on a team that was outside the playoffs.   Yeah, that's hard to do. Last year was his breakout and his team was complete garbage, this year he had a better supporting cast and was held more accountable for their underperformance.   &gt;His popularity is declining as a result of all the controversy with his playstyle.  This is a fun narrative, but I don't think it's actually true from a fan perspective.   He plays on a mid-market team that's performing poorly, and his stats aren't better than last year. His conference also got more competition at the Guard spot, with Kyrie being healthy, Brad Beal leading the league in scoring(and having snub sympathy from last year), Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown breaking out, and James Harden joining the conference.   If you somehow put Trae Young's perception from last year in a time capsule, and open it up this year, he still gets way less votes.  If the Hawks were where the Knicks are Trae makes the All-Star team pretty easily."
"MVP is subjective, so ""robbed of an MVP"" is destined to remain in the shadowy but obnoxious realm of opinion and speculation. But James Harden had some very MVP-like seasons in HOU, that's for damn sure."
The players across the league disagreed  [https://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/21/nba-players-awards-james-harden-mvp-stephen-curry](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/21/nba-players-awards-james-harden-mvp-stephen-curry)
"The three main issues are that  * MVPs drop into lower seeds whenever the distance between various top-level seeds is small. This is how Jordan won MVP with the 7th best record in the league, why Embiid was in contention for MVP despite being in 5th best record in the league, and why there are more contenders this time around. * ""Unlikely MVP predictions"" are much more reasonable when the season is only halfway over. James Harden wins the 2019 MVP if Giannis doesn't exist, but the Rockets were still only 6th in the west halfway through the season. Players can be in contention for MVP even if they wouldn't win it if the season ended that day. * Past precedents are kinda silly. Every WS leader was a top 3 MVP candidate after 2005, BPM leaders have won 10 of the last 12 MVPs, every MVP was top 3 in VORP after 2006. Does this last statistic disqualify Embiid (6th in VORP) from the MVP? No, because all of this is just trying to construct various narratives to exclude people we don't want challenging who we think is the MVP."
I mean there's really not much to say about Oscar Robertson being in your top 10 other than its just wrong. It's like saying James Harden is top 10. It's just wrong
Lebron. You could make highlight reels of clutch defensive stops Lebron has gotten in his career. Like he blocked Rose's game tying 3 point attempt in Game 5 2011. Have you ever seen Giannis *block* a 3 pointer? Heck Lebron last playoffs blocked a James Harden floater. Who blocks a *floater*? There aren't many players in nba history who have the ceiling Lebron has defensively. He might even have the highest defensive ceiling ever.

Who is James Harden?
"Steph and James Harden are a better shooters, and Chris Paul has an argument for being able to elevate a team beyond its potential on the floor. But with Dame's ruggedness, willingness to carry a team in the final moments, and loyalty, I think he has a good case for being the first pick for any franchise. Plus, he tends to add new wrinkles to his game every year, working on any barriers to team success."
"It's hilarious, last night Rockets doubled James even with Kyrie on the floor, because Harden is that good. They'd rather have Kyrie and company play 4v3 than let Harden go 1v1"
There’s smart players and dumb players.  James Harden arguably knows the rules better than any ref.
You gotta keep people on their toes and go with Jim Harden and James Butler from time to time. Mix in a Tony Davis every now and then as well.
"Like OP's example, using only ""Kevin"" to refer to Kevin Durant. Same for any player with a relatively common name and a relatively uncommon other name. If you said ""James"" then we'd ask ""LeBron or Harden?"""

"Pointing out that Mitchell played like shit down the stretch isn't dumping for the refs. We all know that the refs suck, it's always been that way even before Mitchell was born. Also, Mitchell gets 3 free throws for pulling his best James Harden impression - bitch needs to look at his own damn he before criticizing someone else's job. Maybe Shaq was right."
"&gt;Simmons hooking Mitchell's arm and Mitchell getting the foul when he pulled it out probably as cleanly free as was possible  I think this is probably one of those problems where we'll see what we want to see, but to me it looked like Mitchell intentionally locked his arm with Simmons in order to draw the foul. It doesn't look like Simmons moves his arm to create the hook. If Mitchell initiated the contact, then the call on the floor was correct. However, there's zero question that James Harden would have gotten the call on the defender. Some players just get calls and others don't. (I would put Simmons in the category of not getting calls because he gets called for a lot of ticky-tacky offensive fouls.)"
"Plus Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were both draft picks in the 20+ range, which don't exactly have a very high success rate, and they ended up being the centerpiece of a James Harden deal. Marks did a crazy good job turning minimal resources into this team."
"KD and Draymond together in the parking lot after, calling up James Harden."
What do we think about James Harden?
https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/4/11/15261172/russell-westbrook-clutch-highlights-buzzer-beater-mvp  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2689037-nba-mvp-race-analysis-russell-westbrook-outrivals-james-harden-in-the-clutch  Let’s not act like I’m the only person on earth who’s said this
is james harden a PG?
"The rebounding stat alone means dick.  So it's really all up to each possession.  If say Steven Adams is clearing out and boxing out and the rebound is uncontested, Russ getting the rebound provides no value, same goes for anyone who grabs the rebound.   If the rebound is contested and Russ gets it, then he's improving the overall rebounding of his team which adds value.   If the rebound is long and Russ gets it, more value because the threat of transition offense is higher.  Offensive rebounds yield the most impact and value by far.  Westbrook's offensive rebound numbers are pretty phenomenal, especially for a guy his size. On that alone you can assume that his rebounding IS very valuable.  James Harden is the other guy with good rebounding numbers, especially during the MVP race between Westbrook and Harden. But all you have to do is look and see that Harden's offensive rebounds are completely mediocre despite having good rebounding numbers."
"The main issue isn’t the lack of pick &amp; rolls (although that number could be increased), from the 30+ warriors games I’ve watched this year, it’s the strict adherence to the offensive system. The motion offense is good for getting players involved more but when those players can’t capitalize, all your doing is throwing empty passes.   Why do you think the rockets switched to a mainly slow-it down, iso team with Dantoni? As seen with his stint with the suns and to some extent the Knicks, Dantoni is more than fine with speeding up the game but his personnel on the rockets just didn’t fit that scheme. So what did he do? He adapted it to make the most of what his players could do while using his star (james) to shoulder the weight of the other guys couldn’t do.   This is a similar situation. Dray can’t fire from 3 Willy-nilly and Oubre/Wiggins both have a tendency towards tunnel vision that limits their abilities to be consistent playmakers. So asking them to do so is only putting the team in a more compromised position. You have to coach the talent/players you have available, not the ideal players.   We saw Dantoni do it with harden. We saw pop let go of his heavy passing Schemes to make the most of Kawhis ability in iso. We saw Cleveland do it with Bron and Kyrie. Boston did it with IT who got most of his points attacking defenders. Portland does it with Damian and CJ.   I think Kerr has to realize at some point, he just has to let go and let Curry Carry the team in iso. Does it make currys job harder? Of course it does. But that’s what he’s theres for. He’s a superstar and a top 3 player in the world. He’s expected to do the heavy lifting when his teammates aren’t up to par."
James Harden
"""Kevin Durant claims that James Harden and Kyrie Irving aren't good shooters"""
"Yeah its kind of interesting how teams perceive whom opponents worst defenders are and how they attack them. It matters in the sense that their strategy and whom they decide to attack can influence the outcome of a game. It's not necessarily a correct evaluation of that defender they are going at though.   Everybody tries to attack James Harden and very often because they have him defend bigger players it translates to trying to post up vs Harden. Which is useless. Clippers just tried to go at Devin Booker whenever they could last night they basically told you what they think of his defense. But I dont think directly attacking his on ball defense like that is the way to exploit him. And that's the case with alot of these guys, many bad defenders are adequate on ball and trying to hunt them that way is fools gold."
I dont think Moses Malone and James Harden are at all similar.

"Khris Middleton got picked 39th overall and is a 20ppg scorer with a career 40% shooting percentage from deep.   One of the last things I'd try to bring up with the Bucks is their drafting. Because everyone knows it's a shit show. All that matters is you end up with talent when you have picks, when you go all in and trade picks? You get talent. When you have Free Agent money? You get talent.   I really don't even think talent is an issue for the Bucks. They have enough for Giannis to win. If he wins though, it's Giannis' title. Nothing like the Nets or even the Lakers where Bron and AD share equal responsibility.   I am torn on whether or not they could have leveraged their picks and their prospects to get James Harden, or if he would have agreed, but other than that I really don't like the tone that the Bucks have been mismanaged to any degree. They've done really damn well."
to think he was traded for James Harden
"He is an average to bad defender, Thompson usually takes care of the opposing PG, he can’t guard guys like Harden, Westbrook, Irving, Lillard, etc.  He’s a good passer, but not exceptional. His best average was 8.5 APG, while his career average is not even 7 APG, hardly something to be proud of, when there are guys right now that can score over 30 PPG and still manage to average 10 APG (the mentioned Harden and Westbrook).  But the worst thing is that he has been 3 times to the finals, and he hasn’t been the best player. Top players always increase their performance in the finals, just check the averages of Jordan, Shaq, Kobe, James, and what Curry did. He didn’t choke, but he wasn’t good, not even regular season good. And with Durant in the team taking over, he might never get the chance of being the best player in the Finals."
"A ring isn’t needed, but if we’re being honest it definitely helps to have played on such a big stage and won it all. Especially if you were [arguably] the best person on your team. Looks great on the resume and it just kinda sounds weird to call somebody a legend with no rings. First ballot HOFer sure. But people feel a lot more legendary when they’ve won it all multiple times. For example, both James Harden and Steph Curry are easily entering the HoF and I wouldn’t even be surprised to see their jerseys retired.   Their career stats are both quite similar as well   James - 25.2 Ppg , 44.4 FG%, 5.5 Reb, 6.5 Assists. 9x All star and 1 time mvp. 0 rings.   Steph - 23.8 PPG, 47.7 Fg%, 4.6 Reb, 6.6 Assists. 7x All star, 3 time mvp, 3 rings.   Who are you more likely to call a legend? Stats are the same, accolades are close, but those rings make a difference for sure"
I made some OC a couple of weeks ago that hit the front page. Check out the video if you want:  4 ways the James Harden - Bruce Brown pick &amp; roll can beat teams https://youtu.be/5vMrF8DuF_c
"Sounds to me like he needs to get with the James Harden ""at the rim or beyond the arc"" program because looking at the shot data he has been pretty awful from 3-18 feet or so, and pretty good under 3 feet and beyond the arc. Hopefully the coaching staff can work with him on playing to his strengths more.."
"&gt;HE's TALKING TO JAMES HARDEN, KEVIN DURANT, AND KYRIE IRVING. FIND OUT NEXT EPISODE ON.............  Dragon ball z"
"Well guess you got your answer lol, James Harden playmaking is top tier he can single handily lead a offense. Kyrie couldn’t do that on the Celtics so I guess if you take away playmaking from harden Kyrie is the better player but overall Harden is better because he has what Kyrie has with the handles, 3pt shooting, finishing but he’s just not on kyries level when it comes to those things but he still has it in his game that’s why he’s a superstar."
"I think the idea is you trade Wiseman and picks (Minny pick?) for an established (possibly disgruntled) star.  Hell, throw in some future picks way off in the distance to acquire an older disgruntled star, and the other team hopes you suck 3 or so years later - see James Harden (altho in this case probably not someone quite on Harden's level)."
"Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steven Adams?  Seriously though they have something like 17 or 18 FRP over the next 7 years right? I think given they have the contracts and good young players in Shai, Dort, etc they could realistically get 3 all star/2 superstar caliber players pretty easily."
For James Harden probably
"They're the Blazers of the east, they have decent pieces, but they're so iso heavy that they're not making it far unless everyone turns into James Harden"
ask James Harden which city he would rather visit on a road trip
Did OP forget that James mother fucking Harden is in the Eastern Conference and is playing Point guard for the Nets now
"&gt;Not like he already had great teams around him, good enough to be up 3-1 on the warriors  They still traded their 3rd scorer and never replaced him with anything close to the level they needed. KD was always mad that it was just him and Russ doing everything, and I'm sure that shit got tiring.  After trading James Harden they tried to replace his production with Sefolosha, Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Reggie Jackson, Dion Waiters, Roberson, DJ Augistin etc."
"HE's TALKING TO JAMES HARDEN, KEVIN DURANT, AND KYRIE IRVING. FIND OUT NEXT EPISODE ON............."
Your favourite team wouldn’t trade Tyler Herro for James Harden
&gt; Lots of players (especially in today’s NBA) would’ve done the same  Do you think LeBron James after being beat by the Warriors went and texted James Harden right after the game?

James harden somehow got a foul call for that one
"He won't because you can't analyse plays in basketball like in football, first off in football there is time to do it and actual plays  In basketball there is no time and most of the game is ""Well James Harden just used a screen and drove to the rim hitting DeAndre for a alley oop"" yeah what is there to analyze"
James harden literally averaged 36 PPG on 62TS%... he’s definitely a better scorer. Show that man some respect
&gt; most complete scorer in the game  Counterpoint: James Harden
"&gt;Can't blame the supporting cast when the Nets are 26-5 without KD.  The nets have James Harden and a complete team. If you really think the benches and role players are comparable, then you might need to reevaluate how you think about basketball. Anyways, as we know, this years warriors team without curry is one *of the worst offenses in league history* and with Curry they're top 10.   &gt;Those Warriors teams had way better defenses than this Nets team as a result of having a DPOY in Dray, Klay, FMVP Iggy, and , KD. But here you are funneling all the success directly into Curry's stock as if the lineups he played beside weren't insane.  Funny thing is. We have the data to back it up. Do you like data that correlates with winning basketball? If so, you're gonna want to change your position.  We have 3 years of data showing that the offense goes from historical to meddling once curry is removed  https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612744&amp;Season=2016-17,2017-18,2018-19&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201939,202691  TS% also shows that Durant, for example, dropped ***7 percentage points*** the moment Curry left the floor.  Curry is the best offensive player by a large margin and we have lineup data, we have RAPM/RPM/PIPM/RAPTOR/teammates shooting efficiency. Curry leads all those players sizably by all the impact metrics."
"That’s true, James harden has had trouble finding other stars to play with"
"Ah okay, adding jordan clarkson must compare to losing james fucking harden, adding harden/kd/kyrie, losing Ibaka/gasol"
"Ive literally watched every single wizards game this year. Via the data posted above, Beal  runs about 40% off ball stuff, 35% pick and roll. Straight iso is about 8%. That tracks with what I watch. He is not going at dudes like James harden."
"Some players like Chris Paul are predominantly multiplier players. Others like Kyrie (and probably Booker at this point in his career) are excellent additive players.   Every now and then you get a Lebron James, Michael Jordan who are damn good at both and can single handedly carry team. In my eyes 2021 James Harden or Nicholas Jokic come close too.  Chris Paul is probably the best multiplier in the game even as he ages. However no doubt if he didn't already have excellent teammates like Booker to help multiply, theres no way the sun's will be doing so well. To me it's just a great media narrative around a redemption arc that happens to be the perfect piece to unlock potential."
"I think the closest is James Harden, who played with MVPs Westbrook and Durant, former top 3 MVP finisher Dwight Howard, and former top 2 MVP finisher Chris Paul"
The 2018 Houston Rockets went 50-5 when their 3 best player were healthy.      They also had James Harden and Chris Paul...
Until James Harden murdered him.
"Well it can go both ways, I picked 6 years thinking about the James Harden situation- traded after year 3, but then signed a 5 year max once he got to Houston, and would have 6 years by the time that deal ended."
cant believe casuals say he isnt as good a playmaker as someone like james harden or some shit just bc he doesnt average the same amount of assists
"Lame that Sam Presti traded James Harden with year left on his rookie deal, at 22 years old, the offseason after they'd reached the finals with the youngest team ever?      Yes, that was lame. Ruined a potential dynasty!"
&gt; worth noting that there are still a number of NBA players that are unsure about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Donovan Mitchell and James Harden among those who today said they haven’t decided what they’ll be doing as far as the vaccine is concerned.
I will die on the Hill that James Harden should be AT LEAST a 2 time MVP and arguably a 3 time MVP.  Russell Westbrook won MVP for the novelty factor of averaging a Triple Double.  Westbrook got the Thunder to a 6 seed. But Harden took the Rockets to 55 wins and a 3 seed with the most used lineup including Beverly and Ryan Anderson.  He also had 11 games with over 40 points and 22 triple doubles which obviously wasnt Westbrook's amount but was still crazy high at the time
"Last season wasn't one of James Harden's best seasons? avaraged 34? 7.5 assists? I wasn't talking about okc Harden, I'm talking about Harden the year after he was second in mvp voting? I'm not being disingenuous, OKC Harden wasn't in his prime, Housten Harden was. Please at least research before saying such blasphemy."
"None of those teams really had the cap space, roster, or momentum to make CP3 worth it.  The bubble suns looked good and like they were one point guard away from being dangerous.  CP3 proved that right.    Boston and NO still wouldn't be contenders and would have to give up assets better than Oubre and Rubio.  Nugs are pretty good, have Jokic running the show, and don't want to sacrifice much.  Miami is the only one that somewhat makes sense, especially considering they ended up with Oladipo instead.  Granted they didn't want to make a serious offer for James Fucking Harden so who knows what they're thinking."
Under the sixers segment: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/18/22236679/nba-power-rankings-james-harden-trade
"Yup. Even as a high volume player at full health in 2019, Griffin only had 37 dunks, because he was shouldering the Pistons' entire offense from the high post and perimeter all season (and did an incredible job, hence the All-NBA Third Team honor).   Blake couldn't play off of guys like Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant in Detroit. Instead, we kind of needed and expected him to be all of those dudes on his own."
"During the 51-point loss to the Mavs.  ""I hope Kawhi isn't mad at us.""  *(James Harden enters in a Clippers jersey)*  ""Ok he's mad."""
"A few months ago Nick Wright was saying there's only 4 players that can guarantee a playoff berth: Lebron, KD, Kawhi and James Harden. Chris Paul is also a guaranteed playoff berth too imo."
"I wouldn’t say “from nothing.”  The Nets clearly have the advantage of being Kyrie’s boyhood team, being from New York City, and not being owned by James Dolan.    But Marks did build something.  He scooped up LeVert who was the 20 pick and picked Jarrett Allen at 22.  If those late first round picks don’t work out they don’t have the pieces to get Indy and Cleveland involved to make the Harden trade happen.  He picks up Joe Harris, who looked like a bust but is now nearly 50% from 3.  And the Nets wouldn’t be in first place without guys like Nick Claxton and Bruce Brown.  Marks has been lucky, but he’s been adept at playing the hands he was dealt."
"what kind of question is this? Harden is top 2 floor raiser in this generation .. and one of the best in history.   The only person arguably better than him in this generation is Lebron James and even Bron couldn’t take the lakers to the playoffs before AD came along.   Harden led teams has never missed the playoffs, and he was the entire engine during Houston’s days and he never had a stable in their prime super star for co star.   Don’t think CP3 has ever brought much success without a in his prime co star. In fact, he has never done much in the playoffs even with a superstar costar. But I will give him props for elevating the Suns"
Of course they were fun they were amazing  but truthfully they had a lot of first round exits that shouldn’t have happened Idk what more you could want from an mvp then to drop 28 points per game and 7-8 rebounds you could say he could be a better passer but to who? They have to make the shots for it to count as an assist i will say his defense was lackluster but even James harden isn’t as ridiculed and he legitimately doesn’t try
We tried but Fertita would have absolutely gutted our team for us to have James Harden. Our base offer of Ben Simmons alone is better than what they had easily but you get the drift.
Y'all really let Tyrese Maxey be the reason you didn't get James Harden lmfao. Wild
"He built the grit and grind team with smart moves like joe Harris, dinwiddie, trading for dlo, drafting Claxton and JA. That made the Nets a playoff team and a reasonable team to sign with as a FA. Then for some reason teams didn’t wanna sign James Harden, so we leveraged all that building for something new. I think he’s done a great job and deserves a lot of credit."
Yeah I mean looking at the trade now Houston basically traded James Harden for 4 first round picks. Is it the Nets fault the other teams front offices are incompetent?
"&gt; That wasn't KD's initiative   Really? Because it's been well-reported that Durant was recruiting Harden and discussing a trade :    ""The idea of playing together again came up during Harden and Durant's offseason workouts together in Los Angeles. Sources said the players talked openly about whether the combination could work and how a trade facilitating it could work."" [Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30324693/sources-brooklyn-nets-top-james-harden-list-trade-destinations)   In addition, you'd be naive to think that Durant wasn't pushing for it internally, given that information.    &gt; They won the deal, by a lot   So did the Lakers with AD. They literally got a championship, so not sure what your point is.    Second point illustrates that Durant didn't need to have his team of choice trade anything away to accommodate him since he lucked out with the cap spike. But that move was soft enough that it doesn't need any explaining."
"&gt; The Nets literally just traded the house for James Harden lmao. Do you even know what team you're talking about? &gt;  &gt;   1. That wasn't KD's initiative 2. They won the deal, by a lot. No future was leveraged  &gt; Then he was able to join the Golden State Warriors in 2016 (after blowing a 3-1 lead to them in the playoffs) by virtue of a cap spike, meaning the team wasn't required to give up anything to fit him in.   ..and?"
James Harden can literally carry any offense into being a top offense. KD and Kyrie can score whenever. Harden with EITHER of them and the solid surround pieces in Brooklyn is a top 3 offense come playoff time. You have all 3? Unbelievably good.
Dont put MJ against some scrub. Give him at least a James Harden.
"The Nets literally just traded the house for James Harden lmao. Do you even know what team you're talking about?

"Disagree with him being the best player in the game. If I had the option to plug in Lebron or KD on say, the lowly wolves, I would take Lebron 10 out of 10 times. He is the ultimate floor raiser who can elevate a basement team to playoff and even championship contention. I would not trust KD do the same thing.   Put Lebron on the nets or warriors super teams instead of KD, and what do you think would happen? Similar results. I would have also trusted Lebron to not relinquish a 3-1 lead over that warriors team ala OKC.  KD as clear number 2 though. Rounding out my top 5 is James harden, curry, and Kawhi."
WHO NEEDS JAMES HARDEN?? /s
he took more shots per game than james harden and then he said he wasn’t allowed to be himself in houston lmfao
I don't care what anyone says KD is the best player in basketball when healthy. He took the throne once he joined GSW.  Players around the league seem to respect him more than LeBron. Look at all the players demanding to join him on the buyout market. Harden joined him.  James Wiseman said KD is his mentor.    KD runs the league now.
"Kyrie proved that take against the Bulls the other night. I know harden,  kd, and I think DeAndre Jordan too, were out but the rest of the nets aren’t total bums. Kyrie put up some big numbers but in the end a loss is a loss.   Also the only time Kyrie really has a “winning pedigree” is with LeBron James on his team who is the modern day GOAT so I totally buy that take."
"If you told me D. Jordan, Kyrie, KD, Blake, and James Harden were all in the same team being coached by Steve Nash 5 years ago I would have thought you were insane."
It's hilarious because Houston could be on both sides of historically bad James Harden trades.
James Harden is so good he could win the championship without even playing a playoff game this year. I'd love to see Steph Curry's team win the championship without him.
They almost made me forget Harden isn't even playing....who they got for Caris fucking Levert and Jarret Allen btw  CARIS FUCKING LEVERT AND JARRET FUCKING ALLEN FOR JAMES HARDEN  Adam Silver needs to be assassinated
"79 points and up by 20 at the half without James Harden and with KD playing only 8 minutes.  Shamet and Johnson are out too. Obviously not great players, but both being out means that G League Chris Chiozza is the only other ball handler aside from Kyrie."
And they still have James Harden.. What the fuck man.
James Harden dressed like the guy who eats the buffet at the strip club. He's not winning MVP🤦🏿‍♂️
"Dude c'mon. Patience doesn't turn a score-first, awful defender like Coby White into an elite assist-giver and defensive stopper. Neither of those things are even remotely likely for Coby.  For a realistic answer to your question, the Bulls need Patrick Williams to be a legitimate elite defender, a true point guard who can efficiently distribute while adding 15 ppg (like a CP3-lite), Coby White needs to develop into an *efficient* 6th man who scores without hurting the team. All that plus they need a top 10 player. The contenders right now all have at least 1, the top teams commonly 2 (Lakers have 2, Nets have 3) top 10 players, or are built with insane depth/skill (Jazz).  Either PWill turns into prime Kawhi in the next 2 years, another top player wants out and we somehow trade for him, or Lavine becomes James Harden"
"In the playoffs everybody not named Russell Westbrook fucks Dame up, people just like his loyalty to much to see it.  Dame has played in 11 playoff series in his career, 4 of those he shot under 40% from the field and twice he shot under 20% from 3. The argument that he gets double teamed is also so stupid it doesn't make any sense, James Harden and Steph get doubled in 99% of the possessions they play, they still don't shoot 18% from 3.  Portland fans on this sub love them some CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic until they have to defend Dame's struggles, then they hate them and say that Dame doesn't have enough help."
"Definitely. Gotta assume losing Harden factors in. By the way, I have to keep pointing out what a brilliant signing James Harden was. He's barely played with Durant, and he didn't really start playing with Kyrie for a long time, yet they still won. He might have saved them from a big chunk of losses."
"it goes beyond his tenure in Boston, I hated him on the Cavs as well.  He's the most overrated player in the NBA and has done literally nothing without LeBron James to piggy-back off of (and soon to be James Harden &amp; KD), yet he gets treated like a god because he has sick handles, a signature shoe &amp; hit a heavily contested 3 in Steph's grill.  Add to that all of his anti-science, conspiracy theory bullshit, the fake-sharp/tortured artist act and it's just overwhelming.  I'd sooner root for Eli Manning or Derek Jeter than Kyrie"
James harden
"Thank you, ofc he flops a bit, I can't point a player who doesn't, but people act like he's peak Marcus smart level or James Harden."
yeah i love watching james harden too
I think it’s Larry Bird. Most people love him.   James Harden is the most hated
"Obviously not, look at Kobe in the mid 2000s, Wade in the late 2000s, Westbrook in 2017, AD in the mid 2010s, Cousins in the mid 2010s, Allen on the Sonics, KAT on the Wolves now, Beal on the Wizards now, Steph on the Warriors.   Rockets-era James Harden is not in this category lol. He had a team built around his strengths with solid scorers filling the lineup."
"but with James Harden &amp; Kevin Durant, lololol."
"Kyrie is better at playing with LeBron James &amp; James Harden than Dame is, but Dame is better at just about everything else."
James Harden burner definitely spotted.
James Harden or Chris Paul
Ugly and does the James Harden foul baiting shit.
I don't have to do it much anymore because he is gaining public favor but James Harden
"&gt;James Harden functioned as Houston’s point guard for pretty much his entire time there.  Yes, and not with multiple other allstars.  That said, when he actually.had an allstar teaate and PG in CP3 they were beating the KD Warriors with quite LITERALLY half the talent  You can't even find a Rockets lineup where he had TWO allstar teammates to make a table with, let alone 3. No shit his ratings would increase when he's ALWAYS playing with at least 2 allstars."

"The point is that Trae doesn't even play respectable defense. Nobody is saying he has to be a Lu Dort level defender, but even if he becomes an average defender like Steph Curry it would make a huge difference. Even James Harden grew as a defender over the past 2 or 3 years.    Personally I think the hate is due to his foul baiting more than his poor defense. At times it looks like he isn't even trying to make the shot, just draw the foul.  That's honestly what makes Trae so hard to watch sometimes.   It's still early in his career so i think once he proves he can win meaningful games with his playstyle it'll quiet a lot of the critics."
"In 2006 Dwyane Wade was the first perimeter player to take full advantage of the new rules prohibiting hand checking and blocking.  Long before James Harden, Wade drew foul after foul.    And since the rules were new, the fans not only didn't like the style of play, they thought the officials were crazy to even call the fouls.  They also weren't used to players exaggerating contact in order to make sure the foul was called.    In other words, Wade innovated some of the least-loved aspects of today's NBA game."
"Did you seriously just use james fucking harden as an example of a guy who *doesn't* get shit for foul baiting?  You know people call him hitler, right?"
"Here’s a question. Is he having a better season than James Harden?  Harden has been his teammate this season and was perceived as a MVP candidate, and was bringing the team to a great record. When he got injured the teams record dropped significantly. This season Harden played 9 less games too (Kyrie also missed a lot of games, especially for personal reasons).   Now you think of all those factors, and the fact Kyrie at best would be 3rd team. It is easy to find faults in why you would pick him, especially if he insulted your profession"
"&gt;In the offseason, the NBA plans to address the unnatural shooting motions of star players like James Harden and Trae Young that get foul calls under the rules in the NBA -- but would get eye rolls on the playground.  Lets goooo"
"&gt;I know it exists because Lakers hate supersedes logic  Oh yes, woe is me, the victimized Lakers fan.   &gt;It amuses me and makes me laugh.  I mean, yes, that tends to happens when something amuses you. What's amusing is just taking a look at the preseason posts about how the Lakers supporting cast was so much better than what he got in CLE, yet ya'll failed to make the playoffs with Lebron fuckin James.  Complain more about injuries; a lot of good teams were injured. Harden didn't have CP3 and Capela for like half a season and still carried that team out with his 50+ point games.   Laker fans always have an excuse for everything. But keep going. As you said, it's amusing and it makes me laugh."
"Two major things I think get overlooked by people who doubt the Nets.   Number One is that James Harden is an offense all by himself.. The idea there is no chemistry is a little overstated because Harden has the ability to just say I got everything and I'll get everyone their shots. And while the big 3 havent played much together, all the role players have with each guy, and there's no visible case of anyone not understanding their role, which brings me to number 2, their role players are kinda underrated.  Joe Harris you all already know and recognize what he brings  Blake Griffin is averaging 10/5/3 on 51/40/78 shooting. He serves as an additional playmaker and veteran presence that can knock down his shot.   Nicolas Claxton has been great. He's a very versatile big defensively and has really good on/off splits this season.   Bruce Brown is also a solid guy off the bench. Plays hard and solid defense and is a tremendous rebounder for a guard."
Celtics weren’t a contender? You obviously started watching this year bud  Also not everyone can be gifted James Harden and have KD sign with you cause he wants to be in NY for business reasons
Bad take bro. Harden did shit for 8 games in Houston before demanding a trade. Also what are the records for the Nets without Harden and the Lakers without James?  /Classdismissed
"If the big 3 are healthy, they are winning it all. Match ups, gameplans, etc. Throw that out the window when James fucking Harden is the second best player on the team. League fucked."
"Historically, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. All three had very high bars for their teammates albeit Duncan was a different more introverted leadership.  This season? James Harden. Looks at yesterday's play he had with Claxton. He managed to even inspire dour faced Kyrie Irving an get him to laugh early in the season and build chemistry."
&gt; So 82 games should just be ignored?  How come all anyone cares about is playoffs until the second James Harden is mentioned
"""In the locker room, James Harden is watching Hustlers when he calls over Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving: ""You see this shit right here. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the strip club. It’s about making it rain."""
"Ah yes, the Rockets big 3: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Eric Gordon"
James Harden and Luka’s playstyle have a lot of similarities. So I’m not sure how/why you think Luka’s playing the “smarter” basketball of the two.
"Such a bullshit narrative. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to team up, and they thought they would cute in black and white. They also convinced James Harden and Blake Griffin to quit on their teams to come join the bandwagon. None of this has to do with skill on the part of the Nets' front office. As long as they were better than the Knicks, they were getting KD and Kyrie."
“That takes no skill”  -James Harden
James Harden was like 22 dude and was already making huge impacts against all time great teams like the Spurs in the playoffs at that age.

"Didn't say that it was. Insulting people and questioning their ability to read for disagreeing with you is what I was referring to. Apparently you weren't okay with people having a different opinion than you.  For the record I don't take issue with James Jones winning, makes sense to me. However, all he did was trade for CP3, who wanted out of OKC, no? Not that different from the Harden situation, really."
In an alternate timeline James Harden just dies right there on the court.
"Also... ""allegedly fleeced"".   How was trading guys on the verge of retirement for two perennial All-Stars not a fleece?  Like does KD signing with Brooklyn mean that 37-year-old Garnett is now a better asset than 22-year-old Tatum?  Maybe she means Boston would rather have 36-year-old Pierce instead of 24-year-old Brown?  The Warriors have a better record than us right now so I guess that means they won the 1980 trade where we swapped Joe Barry Carroll for Robert Parish and Kevin Mchale.  OKC actually won when they traded James Harden for Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams."
"I think it would be a grind for two games. Then the Nets blow them away. I think yall are forgetting that, when healthy, they have James Harden and Kevin Durant playing together. That's egregious."
I mean it is James Harden in the playoffs 🤷🏽‍♂️ not a guarantee
"They traded away two players of value, Allen and LaVert and that's it.  Prince was not good and Kurucs barely played.  The Nets have pretty good depth in terms of quality players, their problem is that Harden was their only true playmaker. Mike James helps (he's meh, but he can facilitate) but the Nets would have had the same playmaking problem pre-Harden trade as well."
Beating the Nets would be the ultimate f*ck you to James Harden
"that's exactly what star offensive players practice. When a defender gets their hand in there, you catch so that they're forced to make contact on the shot up. James Harden is the master at this."
4-1 whooping orchestrated almost entirely by James Harden.  This isn't the dunk you think it is man.
"&gt; When was the last time someone referred to James Harden as the top scorer in 2015/2016, or Lebron in 2018?  As often as someone refers to MLB's hits leader in a season."
"Except baseball actually counts all of those measures individually; there is a hits, home run, and batting average title.  In the NBA, the scoring title is more a measure of per game average. When was the last time someone referred to James Harden as the top scorer in 2015/2016, or Lebron in 2018?"
"This is the punk who was gonna ""school"" James Harden."
James Harden was Anthony Edwards before Anthony Edwards
"Guys, who would you rather have on these teams, James Harden or Prime Shaq?  Team 1: Hakeem, x, x, x, x  Team 2: Kareem, x, x, x, x  Team 3: Wilt Chamberlain, x, x, x, x  Wow OP what a revelation. This post deserves a segment on First Take."

"He also was shooting half as many shots as Harden, and like a third the amount of FTs and 3s, both of which he’s a better shooter than James.   Harden’s an elite offensive player, but the reason he posted those ludicrous seasons is just as much a result of his usage as it is his ability.   There’s a good handful of guys who could average mid-30s if you gave them 40% usage."
"Mostly for being in the league all season.   I just looked through the last 30 years of MVPs. Only Westbrook finished with a win % &lt;.600.   But when you look at the teams winning a lot of games this year, almost all of them had their best players out 15+ games. Jokic almost has to get it for being great and being durable. Giannis would have had to sprout wings and fly for him to get it. Harden, Durant, Embiid, James, Kawhi have all missed too many games. Curry’s team isn’t good enough. Jokic starts winning by attrition."
"Idk if we’re going off their career in general or just their time with the Nets, but here’s a rough list  Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving/Deron Williams  James Harden/Joe Johnson/Vince Carter  Kevin Durant/Dr. J/Paul Pierce  Kevin Garnett/Derrick Coleman/Kenyon Martin  Brook Lopez  If it’s just about their time with the Nets, then you can go ahead and replace Pierce with Richard Jefferson and Deron with Drazen Petrovic. I’m sure I may be forgetting some people.   Honorable mention based on career: Sam Bowie, Buck Williams"
"100% false man, sorry  The Mavs are a worse defensive rebounding team with luka on the floor (72.9% vs 74.0%)  Furthermore, there are 31 players in the NBA with 8 or more rebounds a game. Among those guys, he's ranked 30th in contested rebound percentage, above only James harden (and one spot behind Russ). Aka, the 3 biggest rebound stat padders in the league lol.  Hell even if you go down to 5 rebounds a game (so that a bunch of guards are in there, like Curry and Lavine) he's ranked 110/121."
"I don’t like James Harden. Fuck however many points he scores, I just mean that from all evidence I’ve seen of who he is as a person I don’t like him."
There’s no such thing as an elite low usage offensive player. If it was you could break them into tiers. James Harden is elite. Chauncey Billups is elite. Alex Caruso is elite.  That usage actually proves that his TS is not that impressive. Ray Allen did that too on 10 more shots per game.
I assume James Harden is in the running for all the young down on their luck single mothers he supports.
"Yo good luck in the playoffs Kevin! Can’t say I’m a big fan cause I try not to be fake. But, I do hope Harden is able to get healthy enough to carry your bitch ass to another title since you don’t have Steph to do it this time 💯. Also, James deserves a ring, even if no one else on your team does 😂😂"
"&gt;I've never seen a single person say ""James Harden wasn't a part of 0/27  It's about the phrasing. It's always spoken about in conjunction with CP3's injury as something that stopped him from winning. That was a colossal failure and I place most of the blame from those missed threes on him."
Maybe the more accurate take is he’s one of 5 guys capable of making a pass like that every game multiple times.   Yeah it’s cool some rookies are adding difficult passes like this to their game but you got like 4 highlights for Killian Hayes and you’re trying to compare ppl like that to Harden. James does this multiples times every single game. What’s a career highlight for another player is just another play of countless many for playmakers of his caliber.
"""You will rue this day, James Harden!"" - Dejounte Murray probably"
"&gt; I think he did okay vs GSW, but it's certainly not the achievement people claim it is.  in 2019, the series that I'm actually talking about, he averaged 34.8/7/5.5 on .44/.35/.82 splits with a TS% of .594.  That's really fucking good, especially considering volume.  &gt; People talk about the 0/27 like Harden wasn't a part of that  What?  Literally nobody says this.  They say that it wasn't *just* him, which is objectively true.  I've never seen a single person say ""James Harden wasn't a part of 0/27."""
James Harden is a despicable human. Complete trash in the playoffs and the greatest flopper in NBA history!
Negative  James Harden literally cost KD a ring by shitting the bed.
James Harden is a an asshole
"That seems to be what people are saying, but I disagree. Hardens foot is flexed and moves towards a tripping motion like a half second before Murray's leg hits it. This is James Harden, the master of subtle movements. I think he knows exactly what he was doing, but was subtle enough to fool people"
"KD, Kyrie, Harden, Joey, Blake, Claxton, Shamet, Bruce, Green  TJ, Mike James, TLC all probably get phased out if we're fully healthy"

"Steve Nash 2-Year peak (2004-2006) vs. James Harden 2-Year peak (2017-2019):  Harden: 33.4 PPG | Nash: 17.2 PPG   Harden: 22.4 FGA/G | Nash: 12.4 FGA/G   Harden: 11.7 3PA/G | Nash: 3.6 3PA/G   Harden: 36.7% 3PT | Nash: 43.6% 3PT   Harden: 54.1 EFG% | Nash: 57.1 EFG%   Harden: 61.8 TS% | Nash: 62 TS%   Harden: 8.1 AST | Nash: 11 AST   Nash absolutely could have averaged in the mid 30s. Nash was notoriously unselfish, at times to a detriment. Despite taking far, far fewer 3PT and FTA, he still has better scoring efficiency metrics than Harden, while averaging almost 3 more assists per game. Saying he couldn’t come “even close” to 36 is downright incorrect."
What are you even on about ?   Almost every comment about those games were “this would make a great 7 game series in the Playoffs till I remember Nets have James Fucking Harden” or something along those lines.  Does r/nba just make up random shit to argue about now ?
"This man just said a 34-year-old Chris Paul, Eric Gordon and James Harden is a superteam lol this sub cracks me up sometimes"
"“What superstars has been traded for pennies on the dollar in the past decade anyway”  There is a guy called Demarcus Cousins, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler (TO YOU GUYS FOR CHRIST SAKES) Westbrook was literally for a hampered Wall and a protected first...James Harden 2x...  But okay...and Holiday isn’t on that level of any star I just mentioned. Dude is a 1x all-star.   And what do you mean, wut? I said actually compete. What have y’all done these last couple years? And if you blame it on injuries, why don’t you go checkout the Bulls injury history and I’m 100% you won’t be tooting that horn.   So like I said, since you’re all for trading stars. Why don’t you send Embiid to Sac for Hield and a 1st, just like they did to Cousins...because stars almost always get traded for pennies on the dollar."
Old role players like him don’t get to dictate where they get traded. He was stupid for thinking he deserved the same treatment as guys like James Harden.
[HOU] James Harden
Yes that is definitely equivalent to James Harden and Kyrie hell even Joe Harris would be considered a second star on a lot of teams.
saying James Harden’s game rely’s on being dirty and getting away with travels is one of the most braindead “I only watch highlights instead of actual games” r/nba nephew comments i’ve ever seen posted on this forum and I don’t even like James Harden.
Ok hear me out. Let's put a team together with Russel Westbrook Keven Durant James Harden. And let's put Serge ibaka as a rim protector.
But ad hasn’t overtaken lebron yet and no if the lakers get more help it doesn’t just make the ring for shits and giggles lol. The nba is an arms race. Bkn just added James harden to kd and kyrie. Lebron doesn’t get to not add help just cause he’s lebron. He needs to be the best player for all the rings though for sure.
I used to get downvoted on this subreddit for pointing out James Harden is perhaps the greatest bounce pocket passer of all time.
"Have you heard of this James Harden guy on the Nets? He is really good man, dude got a big ass beard too , &amp; makes his teammates better"
"To think the OKC Thunder once had James Harden, Kevin Durant and JEFF GREEN on the same team. Just imagine what could have been."
Only behind Giannis? Since when? James Harden and Giannis were in the running from what I remember while LeBron creates narratives that he somehow deserves to also be part of the conversation.
"Chris Paul, James Harden, and Clinton Capela is a really solid big 3. I know Clint will probably get some hate to put him in a big 3... but if lebrons second run with the Cavs is considered a super team with kyrie and Kevin love, then so should that rockets squad."
"You know dude if you don’t think one team with kd, kyrie, and James harden isn’t better set up than a team with brown, Tatum, and kemba then we can just end the convo there."
James Harden “Not to brag or anything I am really really really good at this”
"James Harden is probably the best offensive player in the league, if not the best player period. He has all right to state that lol"
Yeah James harden is really really good at this game as he studies the timing to trip others

"Exactly, people saying Harden &gt; KD don't appreciate that a player's post season performances are several factors of importance greater than their regular season performances. Harden has shown on several occasions that when the pressure is at its greatest, like elimination games 'win or go home' scenarios, he has wilted. KD has been dominant in the Finals and there is no greater stage than that. Dude has averaged 32/8/5 across three Finals series on 55/43/90 shooting splits which is a ridiculous 67% true shooting. If I ask you to show me modern players with better career Finals numbers, the only names you are going to mention are Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Shaq. And these people are going to pick Harden over him? Crazy."
"Do OKC fans regret drafting Harden over Steph? Or Clippers fans regret drafting Blake over two top 25 all time players? I don't think so. In the end, there's only so much you can do when scouting talent and developing players. Had Lebron never left the Cavs and Denver somehow got into their streak of drafting amazing players with mid 1st round and 2nd round picks a few years earlier, we could be discussing how letting *""3 time MVP, 5 time finals MVP Carmelo Anthony""* fall to 3rd was a huge mistake for Detroit, but Cleveland wouldn't exactly be laughed at hysterically for picking a multiple time MVP in James themselves."
"I don't know about everyone else, but I'm taking the guy who steps up on the most important stage. KD has been huge in each Finals series he has contested while Harden has routinely wilted in big games. KD averaged 31/6 in his first Finals, 35/8/5 in his next and 29/11/7 in his third. For the brief 11 minutes he played in 2019 the Warriors looked like a completely different team and the dude was playing on one leg. In the end, regular season domination means squat if you can't dominate in the playoffs and more importantly in the Finals. Harden was horrendous in his first Finals series, sure he was young but KD was just a year older, he was coming off the bench but still played 33mpg and averaged just 12ppg....meanwhile one year older KD was out there dropping 31 a game. You go ahead and take James, I'll go with the proven performer..."
"This is absurd.  If you put James Harden into Lebrons career, I can confidently say Harden will no way achieve the same level of success as Lebron had, not even close.  Now if we put Lebron in the Thunders with KD, Westbrook.... oh boy, that’s rings right there."
"A bit heavier and slower, but still James Harden. Played the same as he usually does and gave us the W (like he usually does)"
"&gt;is this sub gonna start respecting james harden or is this sub gonna keep looking stupid  Warriors, Rockets, and i guess Nets fans will continue to respect Harden.  Everyone else will continue to say ""lmao FT flopper hitler"" until he gets a ring."
"It could be a deadpan joke. Not a joke based on the idea that it's not true, a joke for the ""no shit factor"".  I mean, if it is true. I'll have to check that point. I'd say give me a second but it's a text post, you don't know how long I'm taking to finish this.  Okay. After some exhaustive research and fact-checking, I can in fact confirm that James Harden is indeed, like, really, really good at this game."
Luka creates more point per possession than Trae this year. And the Ast/TOs ratio is not all that define a playmaker and it is not too far by the two!  Last year when Trae had better stats was worst than Luka as overall creation so I assume this year is the same. That's the article about that: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/24/21079412/points-creation-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic-lebron-james  From last year I think Harden and Jokic have improved in playmaking and also Steph would be in the mix. Last year Trea was 5th by Points created so this year he should be top 7 as I said.
&gt; Will people look at Steph or James Harden 20 years from now and say their scoring was inflated because you cant play physical defense like in the 90s?  Why wait 20 years? I will say it today :)
"I don't think there's any real way to measure the inflation of stats. Even if Wilt had weak competition, he still had to be good enough to be dominant enough.   Will people look at Steph or James Harden 20 years from now and say their scoring was inflated because you cant play physical defense like in the 90s?  Are MJs stats de-flated because offenses weren't running at a 2018 pace and teams didn't shoot a lot of shots?  It's a very arbitrary way of asking who might be overrated. How many ""good stats bad teams"" guys are out there? How do we know they still wouldn't be good if their team was better?"
"I wouldnt say Curry is the second best player in the league in general though. Although he is definitely an interchangeable Top 5. For me, it would be:   1-Lebron  2-KD  3-Giannis   4- Kawhi Leonard  5- James Harden  My reasoning for why I put KD as second is because he has always been second to Lebron for his entire career. At KD’s full health you can even debate that he’s better than Lebron( I dont think that, but people do and thats their opinion), but I see it like this. You have Lebron James and Kevin Durant right next to each other on the same pedestal , and then there’s everyone else below them. They’re that dominant.  Now on my list, I put James Harden and snubbed Curry. This is the part where the two are switchable because they are so similar in effectiveness, that you wouldn’t be wrong to choose one over the other. I got Harden, but I think 80% of people would take Curry over Harden."
"James ""Pistol Pete"" Harden"
You mean James Johnson or Magic Harden?
"in the last 12 hours I've been reading some of the most absurd hyperbole out there about James Harden.   He's a great player. Let's wait til his career ends to start stacking him up, especially because he hasn't won anything yet."
James 'Nolan Grayson' Harden
James Harden is fun to watch
This is fuckin’ incredible. This is my all time favorite James Harden highlight tbh.
James Harden = Hitler  Everyone knows Hitler was a stat chaser too
Lu Dort owns James Harden
"If you're the sixers all you can do is blow it up and rebuild. James harden looking at this one and screaming "" choke job"""
"Naw this one made me laugh.  Reminds me of all the ""rockets are x-0 when Chris Paul, James harden and Clint capela play together.""   Then they lost and someone posted   ""rockets are x-0 against teams not named the pelicans when Chris Paul, James harden and Clint capela play together."""
like james harden on one leg in a game 5 low intensity cardio session
"I think the only chance is if he comes out big dick swinging and Philly makes a deep run with Simmons playing *real* well so we forget about this game.  Which is about as likely as him hitting 60% of his FTs - not very.  In fairness to Morey, I think he probably put together a good trade offer for James Harden, but the Rockets probably didnt want to trade with Morey after he dipped on them. Or at least I tell myself that as a coping mechanism."
Jaylen brown. Not close. Only philly fans think Ben Simmons can net someone like James harden/dame kind. Like the other side will hang up asap
Should have figured out the trade for James harden tbh
"Dude is literally the biggest James Harden nuthugger and is probably angry that people critique Harden's defence, so now this clown just hates on defence in response."
"Yes tell me more about how your role players are equivalent to Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Kyrie Irving or Chris Paul."
Your argument is an entirely compromised James harden was the reason KD had 50 lmfao
Don’t let the Sixers game distract you from the fact that the Bucks lost to the Nets without Kyrie and with James Harden vein 1/8 from 3 with only 3 points
Remember the rumors that they wouldn't trade him for James Harden.  Lmao.
"OKC was so good at drafting, and that team could have been so scary. Reggie Jackson was Westbrook back up. Their bench backcourt was Reggie Jackson and James Harden…"
Remember when they could have traded him for James Harden? Trust the process.
"The funny thing is every playoffs Ben continues to tank his value, it happens every year and 76ers fans expect him + 2 picks be enough for James Harden, lmao."
Bro James Harden who is just coming off an hamstring injury played more than Giannis last night lmao
James Harden worthy flop
James harden has played as a point guard for the last like 8 years.
This Jazz team looks like the James Harden Rockets. Chuck 3's and pray they go in and if they don't you lose. Proven to not work...
"They need a CP-like PG, a guy who's playmaker but can also shoot. You know, kinda like Lowry, or maybe someone like James Harden  It baffles be that Heat and 76ers rathe have Herro and Simmons respectively than Harden"
"If both Harden and Kyrie are out, the Nets really aren’t that scary  I’d take the Hawks over them. KD is fucking amazing but there’s no way he could have 4 games of the type he had yesterday in a single series. Plus they’d be playing Mike James and Tyler Johnson a bunch to their already weak rotation.   Now if Harden’s hamstring heals, shits over in 5"
Fat James Harden with one leg and no guarantee he will ever be able to run and jump again.
Just imagine Trae Young isoing a hobbled James Harden with no good rim protector behind him 5 times in a row until Steve Nash calls a time out.   3 times a game.
Trae winning a chip after taking down his mentor James Harden would be incredible
Better than James Harden yesterday.  See good thing they didn’t make that trade!
James Harden
To think the Sixers could have had James Harden but decided to keep Ben Simmons
"Yes if they had James harden, an mvp, and he was doing all the crunch time work, they would be better than with Tobias Harris.   That’s my point. KD, lebron, Kawhi don’t need someone else to take care of crunch time because their post ups don’t work"
"&gt;Bucks are, IMO, better than the Nets with just KD and the corpse of James Harden.  Evidently not lol  But I get what you mean. Better on paper and should beat them"
Imagine not trading for James Harden because they didn’t want to include a rookie
"Bucks are, IMO, better than the Nets with just KD and the corpse of James Harden.  Still think the 76ers is worse since at least with the Bucks you can point to KD going god-mode."
"WE COULDN'T. Ffs of course we would rather have James Harden, holy shit"
I'll take a one legged James Harden.
ah maybe someone like James Harden right? If only they had the chance to get him earlier in the season :(
James harden would’ve been the perfect fit for this team
2019 James Harden type statline
This team was one petty move away from replacing Ben with fucking James Harden lmao
They really kept Ben Simmons over James Harden LMAO
We're really about to get a Hawks-Nets ECF without Kyrie and half of James Harden.
https://i.imgur.com/cE365c3.jpg  When your GM could’ve traded Ben Simmons for James Harden but didn’t
Sixers fans fought me saying they wouldn’t trade Ben Simmons for James harden. Yikes
Lmao sixers fans rlly couldn’t trade him and tyrese for James fucking harden
Imagine not giving up Ben Simmons for James Harden lmaoooo.
#SIXERS FANS DIDNT WANT TO TRADE BEN SIMMONS FOR JAMES HARDEN.  DONT FORGET
Trae Young evolving into James Harden
I don't know.. He couldn't even outplay James Harden on 1 leg.
"&gt;It is like you are not thinking things through before posting them.  Okay, let's recap real fast.  &gt;read the box score FFS...  Your rebuttal to someone who you felt didn't watch the game.   &gt;In performance he can be better under the right system.  You claiming he can be better than Lebron and KD if he just had the right system. Any team you build around Giannis would be worse than just swapping him for either of those two.  &gt;Bigs do not need a bag  Lmao spoken like a true casual.  &gt;Giannis is and plays like a championship calliber big  Yet he has never even carried to the ECF and has had better teams than players like Damian Lillard or James Harden had in which they also carried in a more difficult conference.  &gt;Nobody else his size is as skilled in the current league.  This is really where you exposed yourself.  &gt;Most ultra athletic people are not volume scorers from 5ft in.  No amount of bball ref scouring will support your idiotic claims. You are the one reaching and you have not disproven a single claim of mine. All you did was expose yourself as someone who either has no idea what they're saying or someone who is trolling. Either way don't bother replying, I've had my laughs and at this point, it just feels like I'm bullying you so I will stop now. Have a nice one!"
"Coasting on athleticism that he worked his whole life on lol... what’s the difference between Giannis spending years to perfect this body and optimize himself for finishing through contact and defending amongst the best of them, and James Harden spending countless hours everyday of the year practicing dribbles and hitting difficult jump shots? Why is skill viewed so positively, and athleticism isn’t, when both of them were honed in the same manner and provide similar benefits? Since when was it a bad thing to rely extremely on athleticism.  “Coasting” is such an unfair term for something he works on 24/7, same with Dwight"
Bruh what ?   Jamal Murray - WCF   James Harden - 2nd round   Kawhi - 2nd round   Embiid - 2nd round   Lebron and AD - Finals   Brown and Smart - ECF   Conley and Mitchell - First round   Can you spot the trend here ?
The same argument that keeps popping up between Kevin Durant and James Harden lol.
This was payback for that Giannas quote. “We just went to whoever James Harden was guarding” harden is strong and is wine of the best post defenders and is good in the passing lanes getting deflections and steals. His offense is so great people just say he’s a bad defender but he’s solid. You can’t back him down he’s too strong. Giannas had no choice but to draw a foul or fade away. We know he doesn’t wanna shoot free throws 58%
"It seems like James Harden has the ability to mind fuck Giannis into playing like shit. It probably stems from when Harden said that Giannis has no skills a few years ago. Now, Giannis is constantly trying to prove him wrong instead of just being Giannis and bulldozing people like no one else can."
"I mean you straight up just clearly didn't watch the game. Even during the 0-27 streak from 3 Rockets players that weren't James Harden made buckets, including layups. There's nothing hyperbolic about your statement, you're just incorrect."
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
With like 5 minutes left in the game PJ poked James Harden in the eye. This should have led to the police arresting him.
"How can you compare this to the clippers? The bucks just had the most pathetic performance I’ve seen from a team in years. From the top to bottom it was an absolute mess.   The coach doesn’t make any adjustments or have a gameplan, Giannis is running into 5 people over and over again, taking fadeaways in the post and not demanding the ball when Joe Harris is guarding him, Brook Lopez is shooting threes with Mike James on him and nobody was repeatedly attacking Harden on offense. Don’t even get me started on Giannis dropping a handoff pass and not guarding Durant."
James Harden was right all along
"Hope you’re happy Adam Silver. Lebron, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, CP3, etc. etc.  Just had to rush back didnt ya"
Take last night just for one example. Coach bud I’m sure is a great guy and solid coach but he ain’t that guy for this team anymore. James harden was out there practically on one leg and there were never any plays for players to attack him. They did it once and got a easy layup but never did it again. Coach bud should have adjusted to this immediately and have players go at harden till they are forced to take him out. It really just comes down to the fact that for years coach bud has rarely done any adjustments in the post season.
I don't blame Harden for his offensive performance. Everyone knew there was 0% chance that he would be effective except to serve as a decoy. The illusion of James Harden is enough to make you guard him. But how the fuck did the Bucks not run him off the floor???
"James Harden but only in Games 5-7, bonus points if it’s an elimination game"
Kareem is the greatest post scorer in history. Imagine him watching James harden waive off a double team and defending giannis in the post
"Lebron james when he was playing, played without AD, James Harden came to a new offensive in the middle of a season, Conley and Donavan Mitchell share the ball-handling duties, Memphis moves the ball around. How many hawks players missed games?"
"not to re-litigate the Harden trade as tends to happen every time it's brought up here, but I'm sure it was a little more nuanced than ""ownership forced Presti to trade James Harden"".   If Presti knew that Harden was a future superstar or even 75% of what he's become, there's no chance that he allows ownership to ""force"" him to trade Harden. Presti traded him for a package that he thought would allow them to bolster depth while staying out of the luxury tax. Fast forward a few years and it's obvious that it didn't."
"Still have James harden though, and KD is absolutely capable"
Being able to do things besides run and dunk on offense.   Chris Paul is skilled. James Harden is skilled. Khris Middleton is skilled. Embiid is skilled.   Giannis is just insanely athletic (and tall) with basic guard skills. If he was as skilled on the offensive end as any of the other guys listed he’d be the best player in the world without a doubt.  It’s also the reason IMO why defense shouldn’t dictate  or influence MVP candidacy as much as offense bc you see how useless individual defense can become against individual offense in the playoffs. Limited offensive games get exposed in the playoffs.
That was when I just knew that they weren’t going to win despite Nets being down in that first half.   They were doubling and at times even tripling one legged James Harden. Like wtf are they thinking lol. Force the guy with *one bad leg* to beat you not KEVIN DURANT lol
"Kyrie during the regular season, Harden, AD, Jamal, James Wiseman, John Wall, Kawhi (It was contact but not enough to warrant being the sole reason of the injury) Conley, this is are all players who I think have all just gotten hurt playing, not because someone hit them or a bad landing."
"I'm more pissed off about James Harden not making it. LeBron missed a substantial amount of time yet still made all NBA, as did Embiid.  James harden put up 25 8 and 11 on his best  shooting splits and carried the Nets when Durant was injured."
"James harden, just look at how he played against the Lakers in the 4th quarter last playoffs"
"but part of that was because james harden is a 6'6 wall, and giannis doesnt exactly have the quickness in the half court to get passed people"
The 2015 one cracked me up lol. I have no idea how “James Harden had 12 turnovers in game 5 when the Rockets were eliminated” has anything to do with the rest of the reasons on this list lol. The famous air conditioner taking out Lebron might actually take the cake tho
Luka has stated he models his game off of James Harden.
"Yeah I love Presti but it's probably Buford. Also ownership forced Presti to trade James Harden man, it wasn't Presti's decision"
Kyrie played only 20 games last year and only 54 this year.  Kawhi Leonard played only 57 games last year and only 52 this year  James Harden played only 44 games this year and intentionally came into camp out of shape.  All players got three months off last year from March to July and then another two months off after.  Sometimes people just get hurt.
"Yea I agree I never got the Steph comparison. He plays more like Harden to me than Steph with the stepbacks, the playmaking, and notorious foul baiting  Also while im on the subject before this year James Harden. He didn't magically change his game or become an elite passer in Brooklyn he was always like this"
Harden in his current state is a much better PG than Mike James the chucker
I’m not I’m mainly praising James Harden
"James Harden? With a near 25 but almost 11 assists with slightly better efficiency, well except for his time in Brooklyn, of course, he was way more efficient."
"Yep, i cringed when he took a fadeaway on James Harden with one leg late in the ball game low BBIQ."
"Yea, and he still has ridiculous gravity because even if he's at 60%...he's still James Harden"
Gotta agree with Holy here. Giannis looks super awkward out there. Does he even have post moves? Why is he shooting fadeaways over an injured James Harden in the paint?
"As terrible as harden was in the first half, mike James would have been worse"
"To be fair Luka is out, james harden was hurt, lebron is out, Conley is out, curry is out, ja morant is out. His only competition is ben simmons"
"I totally agree with you. So many ppl are trying to say Mike James should have played the second half. It's ridiculous. Mike James is far too prone to mistakes to be in there at the end of that game. Harden wasn't anywhere close to 100%, but he made some big plays on defense and was able to settle down the team in crunch time."
"I have so much god damn respect for Harden.  Granted he's my favorite player so of course I do, I just think him going out there obviously nowhere near 100% and trying his best to positively impact the game and give his team their best chance to win (I'm not convinced Mike James would have been better in his lieu) is really admirable."
"James Harden came to the East to bully Giannis in the playoffs, change my mind."
Donovan running on one ankle out there. Kyrie steps a little funny and sits out. James Harden basically crippled and suits up. Kawhi's favorite stripper gave someone else a lap dance so he ended up getting one from the chick who sits on your knee too long and sits out. CP3 also out there playing through some shit until uncle covid came around.  There are two types of stars out there. Probably really frustrating for Harden to watch first hand. Surprised he and CP3 didn't work out a little better
Anyone who says this just didn’t watch James Harden play for the Rockets. He’s playing the same style he played in Houston with the Nets bench unit when he’s healthy…
"&gt;	 His back to the basket game isn’t bad.  Except when he’s guarded by one-legged James Harden, the defensive juggernaut."
Still can’t leave him.. he even drew a few doubles. He’s still James Harden
Bill Simmons made me realize that Luka’s assists are like Bird’s... they’re not cheap assists like the James Harden type of assists
Jrue didn't play well? It's not James Harden who had the all time night lmao. Jrue was brought in for his defense. Sorry Giannis ain't have the clamps on a legendary KD performance.
The James Harden can't play D stigma has to go
"If there was no regular season at all and we just had playoffs, Kawhi wouldn't have gotten injured.  Anthony Davis and James Harden injuries were non-contact."
James Harden scored 5 pts and PJ Tucker played for 33 minutes with 0 pts.   Thats tough.
"If healthy yes, nobody is beating them:   Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid"
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
Maybe he didn’t realize that was James “You want me to play D?” Harden that was defending him…
"yeah you’re right, dude tried to drive in a couple times and it looked like he was walking in the paint. but i suppose 45 minutes of hobbled harden still demands more attention than mike james"
"I mean, the NBA did suspend Amare Stoudemire AND Boris Diaw for Robert Horry. Kind of affected the series there.  And i hate foul whining. BUt Steve Nash probably shouldve shot FT’s at a James Harden rate. NBA just *has* to tighten up their refereeing. Complaining is an instant tech and **call what you see** no matter what. IDC if Jokic gets 40 FT’s, teams will adapt."
01 LeBron James.   02 Kevin Durant.   03 Giannis   04 Jokic  05 Stephen Curry.   06 James Harden.   07 Kawhi Leonard.   08 Anthony Davis.   09 Luka Doncic.   10 Embiid  are your superstars in the league (honorable mention Dame)
"Totally agree. Anthony Davis, James Harden, All these guys missed major time in the regular season. Kawhi is load managed because he’s injury prone. It’s not like Cal Ripken suddenly missed games here."
"&gt;The are a few people saying Oladipo for best SG, which is sad seeing how much he fell off because of his injuries  Wait... Even for 2 years ago, that's a crazy take. Isn't James Harden alive?"
JAMES HARDEN THE FLAME THROWER
"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.   There was just a level of [delusion back then](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat) with these Harden trade ideas that even for homer fans standards was absurd.   &gt;Framework of the deal: Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker + 3-4 first round picks to Houston for Harden.  And the Pelicans writer said no in response to this offer!   Heres another one   &gt;Framework of the deal: C.J. McCollum and Zach Collins + a couple first round picks to Houston for Harden.  &gt;""Giving up CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, and picks is a big ask from Portland’s perspective. As things stand, I wouldn’t give up a single player from the roster in exchange for Harden, let alone two key players and two first round picks""  Do people even hear themselves when they talk, this was an actual sentence someone said like 6 months ago."
This is actually true. If James Harden shot 0% from the line he would have 3+ rings
Kawhi had an injury which was kept a mystery by his camp. James Harden was just out of shape
"This isn’t context it’s just rationalizations, word context is just devoid of any meaning on here. The rockets had James harden under multiple years left. Not one multiple. Hell Jrue holiday only had one year left. Contenders overpay for stars LAC did for Paul George also which is part of why this is such a joke yhe nets are a win now set up you have an advantage there and instead you get back this junk. Harden had 2 years left 2 years is a lot plenty of contenders can role the dice on 2 years suggesting otherwise is foolish. His list doesn’t matter nearly as much when it’s 2 years left   All teams who trade super stars have compromised leverage to an extent. Houston wasn’t unique. Hell Paul George asked OKC for a trade and they still got a good return. All this is Tillman kicking the can down the road giving himself years to sell false hope and duck the tax. By the time it’s like 2028 all the picks are in and people can see how much this deal sucked nobody will care anymore and people will have moved on. He knows exactly what he’s doing"
"&gt; Front-office executives say that if the Blazers eventually move Lillard, they can expect a return rivaling or surpassing what the Nets gave up for James Harden: multiple young players, plus three first-round picks and four first-round pick swaps.  The Heat do not come close to having any of these assets, especially the picks.   Unless the Blazers trade Lillard to Miami for Bam (which would be a 1 step forward, 2 steps back deal for Miami), there isn’t a package that makes sense for them."
The harden return was beyond a joke so they better hope for more it’ll likely go down as the worst return I’ve seen for a superstar in my lifetime. People are just badly overvaluing future nets picks because of the nets/Celtics trade. Literally getting one more pick and one more pick swap than Jrue holiday got back for James harden lmao
"&gt;Make it more obvious you don't watch games  You're right. I havent watched every single game James Harden has ever played so I might have missed the half a dozen times in the 82 games last season where he was double teamed for a single possession at the halfway line.  But if you think that compares to being doubled as soon as you pass half court in almost every game you play, multiple times per game. You're delusional."
Chris Paul played with James Harden...
Devin Booker  Jordan Clarkson Ben Simmons Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tristan Thompson Kris Humphries  You can fill the rest ;)
Are you saying that James harden could be even better if he just trained enough?
James Harden has entered the chat.
"“James Harden, Flame thrower”  “He made Jusuf Nurkic a screen saver.”  “The Blazers win a series for the first time in 14 years.”"
"Devin Booker can certainly act. So can James Harden.  Khris Middleton, on the other hand, hams it up terribly."
"I mean it’s unlikely. Actually highly unlikely, but dude is right in saying if dame *really* wants Lakers he’ll make it work. If you need an example literally the same thing happened with Houston Brooklyn this year. James harden had multiple (3..?) years left on his contract and at the beginning of the season the rockets even shut down every trade offer and basically said they were keeping him for the year or at least until someone overpaid…. Then harden threw a tantrum and *got moved to the team of his choice* the next day for peanuts compared to what value he should’ve commanded"
"You're taking it too literal. That's not what he saying. Those players are not even close.  What really makes is Giannis better than Nikola Jokic or James Harden or Damian Lillard or whoever? What separates him?  You could say defense, but what about about some people who don't value individual defense as highly as you or I do?  What if offense and shooting threes and getting assists is more important?"
James Harden
He had the corpse of James Harden playing full games. The next best player was Bruce Brown lmao
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"
"Not disagreeing, and it is why Phoenix, Utah were the top seeds this season, and the Bucks previous 2. But u/spyson said that it was because the Lakers were based around 2 superstars that they lost the series.   Bucks traded their depth for better players and were better for it. (Bledsoe, RJ Hampton, George Hill for Jrue) (DJ Augustin for PJ Tucker) People say that Bucks wouldn't have made the finals if Nets were fully healthy, which could be true. But Bucks also could have won the Nets if the Nets didn't do the trade for James Harden."
"James Harden.  He can drop 40 pts while dishing out 15 assists on any given night. Hes an absolute basketball genius, and you'll be able to see all kinds of crazy defenses against him, such as being guarded from behind, getting doubled at half court, or having the help defense clogged up in every driving lane.   Some people will say hes not fun to watch because he draws so many fouls, but that will be for you to decide."

Yes jokic reminds me so much of James harden you’re right
"[He was awful in his 1 Finals appearance because he was too busy visiting strip clubs, per his own teammate](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/kendrick-perkins-reveals-that-james-harden-was-awful-in-2012-finals-due-to-partying-in-miami-strip-clubs/)  [Outplayed by Klay Thompson when Curry was out in 2016](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-western-conference-first-round-rockets-vs-warriors.html)  [Rockets up 3-2 in the WCF up 17 at the end of the first.

"Anthony James, Anthony Durant, Anthony Harden, Anthony Antetokounmpo, Anthony Leonard, Anthony Doncic, Anthony Jokic, Anthony Curry, Anthony Embiid"
"I'm not saying he absolutely is better than Harden, but James tends to often underperform in the Playoffs while Mitchel almost every serięs he played so far he was incredible so I'd say ther is a case for Spida being a better Playoff performer than the beard"
"It's possible, but it would take more than what you listed and it's far from guaranteed that he gets even that.    But yeah, it's not impossible, in the same way that it's not impossible for James Harden to become the GOAT if he rattles off 8 straight championships with 8 FMVPs and wins 3 DPOYs and 3 more MVPs and plays til he's 50 and also steals Beyonce.  It's not literally impossible, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it happening."
Yes I’m watching Giannis beat up on a third year deandre Ayton. If harden and Kyrie are healthy bucks aren’t in the finals and you wouldn’t be putting Giannis ahead of Lebron James.
"I never have and never will be ""cool"" with any team thank you very much. james harden is a better whore nets player than anyone in charlotte"
"Bro James Harden took out a full page ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel saying how he should have been MVP. He then went on various podcast and radio shows making the case as to why he should have been MVP. This is before Giannis ever said a single peep about him.   I’m not defending Giannis, I don’t think it was necessary for him to say shit back about Harden but let’s just be factual about the situation.  Edit: it was technically adidas that took out the ad but I doubt they would do that without approval from Harden."
Lonzo is better than James harden
"they been around for just over a decade. missed the playoffs like 3 times?  been to a finals, been to 4 WCFs, were a serious contender for half the decade. Had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and more play for them. Now they have promising young talent in Shai and a huge number of assets to work with. yeah they never won, but compared to other newer teams they’ve been spoiled."
Not the club that gets James Harden excited.
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
Rockets/Nets is the James Harden Trade  Thunder/Rockets is The Trade^TM
"hmmm, ill take the one where okc's ownershit decided that they couldnt 'afford' james harden"
James Harden
He'll just sign with the Nets and rejoin James Harden.
"This has to be the dumbest take I have ever seen. Kd + kyrie win by like 40 points in one of the first two games. James harden yes choked in game 7 against the kd steph klay dray warriors but how did he even get to game 7 in the first place. Healthy James is a guaranteed 20 points and 8+ assists minimum per game, but in the series he was an absolute liability due to his health. If you don’t think the nets would’ve scored 1 more point in regulation game 7 with a healthy James there is no saving you.   “Kyrie never performs in playoffs” I guess the 2016 nba finals no longer exist then. Maybe he can’t do it as a number one option, but on the Cavs with lebron he absolutely performed and maybe even outperformed Steph curry in that series."
"I don’t know why you are getting pushback on this. James Harden is on the record saying Giannis is unskilled and you know if Harden said it, that there are several other top players in the league who feel the same way."
"Basketball playoff games are not won with assumptions, and what ifs...they are won by fighting on the court. The Bucks would probably win in 6 if Kyrie played. Because Kyrie is a player who always fails in playoffs, who doesn't play defense.  The player(s) that replaced him would do better for team play. Kyrie's antics would not work against top teams in the playoffs.  You should have learned from his performance in his last year playoffs with the Celtics.  He was healthy, no excuses, but his performance was hortible. On what ground would you expect him to do better two years later? A team player like Jrue Holliday would erase Kyrie's offensive effectiveness.  James Harden? When was the last time you saw James Harden performing successfully in the playoffs? You can't tell because it never happened. Bringing together three iso players does not make a championship winning team."
so James Harden? Also Luka isn’t slow like Jokic.
They basically got 1 less pick and 2 less pick swaps than James Harden returned for houston. I'd much rather bet on the upside of picks 5 yrs down the road than trying to get some decent starter now to swing me 3-4 extra wins at the moment. That upside 5 yrs down the road could also easily end up being a letdown that's the risk but Id rather actually take a gamble on something with the potential to be a significant boost for your franchise than some reasonable starter right now.
Yall sleeping on Ron Artest's elbow smh. Ask James Harden about it

"In addition to the three you mentioned there was also Jimmy Butler and James Harden. How many do you need before you feel like it's no longer a ""false narrative""? These are some of the best players in the world who were available, Ainge had all these assets and he got precisely none of them. At some point you gotta have the guts to pull the trigger. He didn't and that's why Boston is in the situation they're now in as opposed to playing for titles."
Current  Chris Paul  James Harden  Tatum  Zion  Jokic
Chris Paul  James Harden  Carmelo Anthony   Karl Malone  Patrick Ewing
Well most players at the most congratulate the winner.  Harden says that giannis won the award because of a narrative created by the media.   https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/22/james-harden-nba-mvp-race-giannis-antetokounmpo-media-narrative
"&gt; These teams should be lauded for creating the structure to capitalize on it  This is exactly right imo. If you are not a traditional power and/or a desirable market, then you simply cannot expect to have a team full of in-their-prime superstars. That simply doesn't happen for 24-25 teams in the league.  What a ""small"" market team (any team not in the list of 5-6 that can count on a regular influx of superstar talent) *can* do, on the other hand, at least in this era of collaborative superstardom, is commit to being very good for a long enough time that eventually things break right and you can steal one.  That's how Dirk's Mavs did it; that's how the Raptors did it. Those teams hung tough every year, making deep playoff runs, developing world-class chemistry, and ignoring the noise about how they were ""oN a tReAdMiLl"" and would never, indeed *could* never, break through.  Ironically enough, that's exactly how great teams had tended to be built for decades before MJ broke everyone's brains: the GP-Kemp Sonics, the Stockton-Malone Jazz, even the Hakeem-centric Rockets: those teams all lurked around the fringes of contention for an extended period of time. It just so happened that when MJ was healthy, he snuffed them all out. That, combined with Shaq's relatively shocking move to LA and the fluke Spurs season that gave them Tim Duncan, put everyone in the NBA into dynasty-building mode and licensed multi-year tank jobs in the eyes of the public. Front offices could ask their fans: ""How can you expect us to beat the Duncan Spurs or the Kobe-Shaq Lakers without multiple superstars of our own? We *need* to be bad for many years to accumulate the necessary assets, which we will then magically develop into contenders down the line . . . Do not ask us how our young guys will suddenly understand how to win and please do not ask us about why we aren't winning and signing good veteran players in the meantime, either!""  Never mind that there was plenty of evidence that this approach to team-building was cynical at best and a complete farce at worst--evidence in the form of the '04 Pistons, or those tough mid-aughts Pacers teams, or the CWebb Kings, or even the Shaq-Wade Heat--it was easy to sell long-suffering fans in non NY or LA markets on the prospect that a dynasty was always around the corner, on the other end of the tanking rainbow.  Combine that with a wised-up Obama-era basketball fandom that had newly welcomed in thousands of professional-managerial class career strivers from homes in the suburbs, a group of (overwhelmingly) white men who had been trained since childhood to conflate efficiency with absolute moral good and uncritically to accept unlimited asset accumulation as the way of the successful, and you had the perfect storm. This group had cut their fandom teeth on immersive video games that offered the opportunity for bored kids to play God with roster construction and rewarded them for signing players at below-market rates on long-term contracts, exchanging expensive veterans for cheap kids, and accumulating draft picks like free lottery tickets. They could play the games and the Game beyond the game; could be the superstar and the manager in the C-suite that their parents and teachers had prepared them to become.   Of course, a video game can't simulate the toxic effects of perpetual losing and of a lack of locker-room leadership; it can't foresee Kevin Durant and James Harden leaving OKC for their own autonomous reasons any more than it can predict that creating a culture of unlimited entitlement for blue-chip prospects will produce a ""star"" player as fundamentally broken as Ben Simmons.  If the Bucks pull this off, then I'll be all the more delighted that they did so despite their own botched tank job, which produced lottery picks like Brandon Jennings and Joe Alexander and Jabari Parker and ""major"" free-agent signings like Greg Monroe. Despite themselves, the Bucks have built a contender the old-fashioned way: through chemistry and determination, through a culture of winning forged out of years of steady, unheralded improvement, and, most of all, through a heaping portion of luck. Luck gets sneered at around here, and in most of the other self-satisfied neoliberal hell-holes that constitute the majority of social media in this country, but no portion of luck can make a bad team NBA champions. It can make a *good* team into champions, and I think that ought to be enough. Imagine if we had thirty teams trying desperately to be good every year, and holding out hope that, one bright day, everything would break right and their steadfast determination to improve and persevere would finally pay off. I think it'd make for a much better league."
"Semi-related, but on that last point…  James Harden wasn’t the instigator he’s been framed to be. The “beef” started with Giannis’s comments during the All-Star draft.   In 2019, Harden never went out and said that Giannis didn’t deserve MVP. Obviously he’s going to say he himself should be MVP, but he said nothing to discredit Giannis’s season, or him as a player. During the All-Star Draft in 2020, Giannis said Harden doesn’t pass the ball, and slighted him by picking “crossover killer, step-back master, Kemba Walker” over him. Naturally, Harden went out and defended himself. Only then did Harden call out Giannis’s “run and dunk” game.  And objectively, on offense, Giannis’s playstyle requires magnitudes less skill than Harden’s, most wing shooters, or bigs with post moves.  Giannis is still an incredible player, and he’s insanely gifted and skilled in different aspects of the game than Harden. But Harden’s comments aren’t as outrageous as people make them out to be."
Should’ve planned for James harden to be hurt for basically the first time in his career I guess
"2011 Mavs beat Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Dwade, and bosh. Giannis beat a nets team without Kyrie, a crippled harden, trae young, and Chris Paul/Devin Booker they can’t be compared"
"They weren’t “great” lol they were a 51 win team that year with an awful defense. Offensively a team with LBJ Kyrie, Klove and JR was behind that of James Harden and Co that year. They were meh"
PG: Kyle Lowry   SG: James Harden   SF: Zion Williamson   PF: Cristiano Felicio  C: Nikola Jokic
"I remember a few months ago Skip said that Curry wasn't a top 20 player of all time due to him ""choking"" in the playoffs. Then he lists off his top 20 and it has James Harden in it lmfao. Dude's the ultimate troll and living the dream life. Shitposts on national tv for 8 million a year."
Nah he 4PF with Lil Baby and James Harden
People whine about guys like Kyrie and James Harden half-assing on defense and then shit all over Jrue when he struggles to get his legs under his jumper.
Wdym i thought lebron was a literal nazi and james harden was actually hitler.
"Not all of them hit, but there are a *lot* of James Harden looks that are fucking amazing imo."
You legitimately trying to say the James Harden that played in the Nets/Bucks series was as healthy as Giannis is right now?  Harden was at best 25% that series like dude for the first game and a half he came back he literally didn't even drive.
"I mean, the only reason they had Hames is because James tanked his value by not taking care of his pre-season prep like he should have because he was trying to make the Houston situation unsustainable. There is probably no reality where Harden is both 100% for the end of the season AND on the Nets, since (in hindsight) he sacrificed the one to be able do the other"
"Depends on when, today? Not that much, not dame for sure, but like during the jimmy butler situation in Minnesota that could've gotten him, could've maybe beat Toronto's offer for kawhi, probably not James harden last season but that's more value then the rockets ended up maintaining so"
So if James Harden didn’t play in that series then by that metric Giannis isn’t playing now right?
While guys like Russell Westbrook and James Harden and Dame Lillard and I want to say John Wall kept getting the bag every single year they could none won a championship. While Giannis is going to get the bag every chance he has now and will have a ring to show for it.
james harden is hitler so he's a righty
"The Nets don’t operate effectively with all (3) playing together. If so they sweep an empty Celtics team. Bucks likely win regardless, keep in mind with all (3) there’s virtually never going to be key offensive contributions from the bench and role players given they’re so ball dominant and they don’t seek out setting up teammates as a priority. Hence Joe Harris, Mike James, Bruce Brown, Shamet, and further a Jeff Green 27 points (7/8 from 3) in game 5 wouldn’t happen with all (3). Brown and Griffin were the only two who could exist off of lose balls and put backs. That team wasn’t setup for all 3 but did best with 2 stars. Don’t discount Harden as a facilitator in game 5 either. But as he looked more for his offense it hurt the team when he didn’t make or get to the line.   And for once understand that a team assembled of (3) health question marks is gonna be risky. Kyrie injury history is very lengthy, Harden was so out of shape to begin the year and never recovered. And they had a plan for Durant but had to sacrifice at the end of the regular season just keep the #2 seed due to Kyrie (8) game sabbatical, was great to him finish how he did."
"Finally someone brought up this question!  Like what others have commented, I kind of have this feeling that Giannis is generally viewed as an outsider having played in Greece before coming to the NBA. In many ways, the NBA is still very much like a fraternity. And Giannis does not conform to that. Couple that with his ultra-competitive nature and the success he’s achieved, I’m sure it doesn’t sit well with a lot of players.  Think about this, there are way less likable players in the league that get more respect from other players than Giannis (think players like Boogie Cousins, the Morris twins, or any other “heel”). In fact, I’d even argue that Giannis is the opposite of that.  To add to this, when Giannis made those comments about James Harden during the All-Star Game, I think he wasn’t trying to throw shade at James. I’m willing to bet that his comment got lost in translation. I don’t speak Greek but if you’ve ever tried to learn a foreign language late in life, it’s super difficult because you’re taking with you your cultural mannerisms. You can’t expect to sound American when you’re thinking like a Greek, for example. That’s why you get funny moments like Giannis saying he “wanted to take a tinkle” or that one tennis player who said she has no problems “taking it from behind.”"
I understood the joke and I am here for this James Harden slander!  Love to see it
"I agree with what a lot of people have said in this thread about Giannis not playing AAU ball and not being friends with other nba players. I also think a lot of players probably feel the same way James harden does towards Giannis’ skill set when he said he’s just out there running and jumping. I think other players just have more respect for players who can hit difficult shots like a deep 3, step backs, or have nice handles. There’s nothing flashy about Giannis’ game"
"Curious about the players you hate for being ugly. Mine's Anthony Davis,  Montrezl Harrell, James Harden. DeRozan's got a pass bc he seems like a nice person."
The way the bucks handled James harden and kyrie being hurt was really commendable
Lebron james and Anthony Davis &gt; james harden and… Patrick beverly?
"Football has worse flops in the quality of the flop. Like some seriously no contact delayed reaction sniper shots to the players. However these happen once or twice a game and we move on. If that much sometimes.  However, NBA has like 10+ flops a game. If you like certain teams or players even more. This is one of the reasons that no matter how good James harden is I just can't watch him. It's boring and egregious. Meanwhile Giannis goes to the line even more at times and takes longer yet I don't mind watching him.   I also don't mind when bigger players flop a bit cos they don't get as many fouls as they should. LeBron, Embiid, Jokic etc, get beat up and no fouls are whistled. Not nearly as many as for smaller players who yank their head back, getting a whiplash while someone walks past them."
"It’s what James Harden said… let’s be honest, his body is unbelievable and he abuses that to do some amazing stuff but (mainly due to how he’s officiated so he doesn’t have to be) he’s not actually that skilled. Downvotes are welcome, man can’t hit a shot if he’s not within 3 feet of the hoop.  And for those who compare this to shaq, Shaq went toe to toe with his defenders and dominated. Not his fault, but giannis gets bailed out by the refs, the rules make it almost impossible to defend him and therefore it’s less impressive"
These are grown men. No one is giving Giannis the cold shoulder cause he made a joke about James Harden.
"I’m not arbitrarily deciding, when the bucks got taken to 7 games vs Kevin Durant and 25% of James harden that’s when I decided.  When the suns lost 2 games to the clippers without 2 starters and kawhi that’s when it because obvious to me. Let’s not act like the bucks weren’t about 1 inch away from getting knocked out in the second round. Not trying to rain on your parade, but be real. The two remaining teams are simply the healthiest."
"right? you think history is going to be kind to jrue fucking holiday taking over this game? no shit if multiple top 100 players and a couple top 20 all time were playing in the same finals, and it was going this way, people would be all over it. You cant compare khris middleton to james harden or devin booker to even kyrie"
Devin Booker &gt; James Harden
"There’s this guy called Luka that makes this invalid.   They don’t like Giannis because they think he’s not skilled, literally the shit James Harden said is how a lot of them feel."
James Harden must have had quite the following
"Right.... you mean the nets that had Kyrie, Durant, and Griffin, and then when kyrie got injured, they put in james harden, and they still lost. That nets? Ohhhh, I get what you mean. You're saying you wouldve stomped the bucks if you had 5 superstars rather than 4. Nets are a goddamn superteam, and they still lost. ""bucks would have got stomped"", man get the fuck outta here. Other than Nets fans, no one wants to see the Nets in the finals"
James Harden was hurt
"yeah why we only talking about suns lucking it out with injuries? harden got injured 3 minutes into game 1, kyrie a few games later. won on a game 7 ot thriller against kd and a hobbled james harden.  thats a big ass * for milwaukee too"
James harden would be out of the NBA if that happened
"I don't think anyone's denying this is a flop. To go through Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Trae Young - all to pull this off in Chris Paul's face and get the call? Legendary."
That pass where Giannis was about to shoot a fader and unloaded it to a driving Middleton was special   Thats a basketball player man  Fuck James Harden bruh
James Harden played 2 games on a bad hamstring. It was solo Durant the whole way.
The Bucks stood tall against James Harden and KD they not getting scared against nobody after that. 100/10 mental strength.
I wanna see Giannis bounce the ball of money guy’s dome like James Harden.
NBA needs to adopt the FIBA goaltending rules and kill the foul baiting. This would mostly fix their product. Chris Paul and James Harden have really made the game hard to watch at times.
I remember people were saying it was a flop when Ron Artest elbowed James Harden.
"Kinda like Curry, James, Harden.... Etc etc?"
A guy with a James Harden username saying something Giannis did isn’t impressive?   Shocker.
[James Harden](https://imgur.com/a/Wdq7h8H)
Also James harden is the PG and kyrie is SG
"He must have beaten Dwade a bunch, James Harden once. Those two are in the mix for top 25 as much as CP3 and Kawhi."
james harden is the dave grohl of basketball lmao
"2009 got to be the worst; James Harden, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday and even Jeff Teague (had an all-star appearance!) and the only one he went for was Ricky Rubio."
James Harden - he’s a hard-on
"&gt; Given that it's been proven he would go back and edit his pre-draft rankings/projections 1-2 seasons later once we've seen how good or bad the player was, I don't know how much I'd trust anything pre-2014 or 2015  If he had done this, he would've been wise to pick one of the four future all-star PGs, especially since two of those are Steph Curry and James Harden for 2009."
Dawg James harden is a choke artist in the playoffs
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
LeBron James - his first name is James   Shaquille O’Neal - he is actually Irish   Pete Marovich - he is an anthropomorphic pistol   James Harden - he is a metapod
Nah I’m actually saying kyrie is a sg because kyrie told James harden you’re the point guard I’m the shooting guard and they play those roles now🤨
Lol James harden wasn’t held back in 2018 or 2019 he just went up against arguably the best team ever and lost in 7 and 6. Then James lost to the lakers because russ was horrendous because he like you was blinded by his love for russ to see the Blatant flaws in his game. Ft shooting which is always a bad combo for a guy that can only eat effectively in the paint and that he can’t hit a jumper to save his life even the mid range shots he’s supposed to be good at he shoots under 40% on.
Lebron James is James Harden
I asked James harden about how much Russ held him back in the 2018 and the 2019 playoffs but he never responded.
"No but AD not being able to lead his team is exactly why people don’t put him over Joel and Jokic. My point makes perfect sense lol. And no Russ isn’t Russ is very inefficient 51% true shooting while Trae is above league average at 59%. Russ is also detrimental to his team when he doesn’t have the ball because his isn’t really a three point threat players leave him open and dare him to shoot. Ask James harden about that one. He is a good player but Curry, Dame, Trae, Kyrie and CP are all clearly better than him he has an argument for 6-8 not any higher."
I was impressed by that one video of James Harden draining floaters from three.
Where is James Harden
"You have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden on one team. The only thing that would make it fair is if the Lakers had Kawhi instead of Westbrick.    But for all we know, Kyrie could just end up injured again lmao"
"Yes, James Harden is a good shooter"
"The problem with just looking at blank 3PT% is it gives no information on the quality of shots. Less than a quarter of Harden's 3's are assisted, a lot are contested, and some are quick chucks when the defender is being too aggressive and he wants to draw a foul.  I think James Harden is a good 3-point shooter; though I'm not sure if he's a great one because it's so hard to quantify what that looks like."
Sam Presti also traded James Harden and cost OKC a ring or two....
"*Immediately after 2 minute montage of pure emotion*   “Oh yeah, and standing 6’3” guard James harden”   Lmao"
"Hmmm that happens when you play with James Harden, PG and Kawhi"
It’s not like James Harden has won anything lol
"The league has gotten so goofy since 2016. Westbrook is not supposed to be on the Rockets (in his physical prime) with James Harden or wearing #4 on the Wizards. Harden, Kyrie and Durant playing together on the same team in New York. This era is wierd."
"There’s two main things you can do as this defender.  1. Make post entry passes more difficult. You can basically prevent the bounce pass into the post, which makes it slightly more difficult to get in.  2. Harassing ballhandlers. I don’t expect anyone to really get steals or apply significant pressure, but if you apply the utah jazz james harden defense as the 6th player, you can make the players constantly aware of you, and less relaxed with the ball."
Let's leave James Harden out of this
Yes. We should get rid of Westbrook who just averaged 27/6/6 in the finals for James Harden who completely disappeared 😴😴😴
We'd be talking about James Harden trying to get traded.
"Which is insane because in recent memory, even seeing James Harden finish top 3 every year for the last 6 years feels crazy yet Larry finished top 2 for 8 straight. Crazy."
"It's crazy that since then Ray Allen's record has been surpassed by Duncan Robinson, Damian Lillard (2x), Buddy Hield (3x), Klay Thompson and James Harden (2x). And then there's Steph, who's done it 6 times."

"In a universe where Joe Harris doesn't disappear in the playoffs I'd put the Nets over the GSW. A lights out shooter as your 4th option after Kyrie, KD, and James Harden? It's hilarious."
"&gt;magine if Iverson had Harden Rockets rosters around him. A ton of shooters inc. stretch bigs (Tucker, Ryan Anderson), lob threats (Capela, Dwight, Montrezl), and a 2nd banana like CP3 like James had around throughout various seasons. I'm guessing AI gets a couple of chips at least  You really think he'd beat KD's Warriors?  I'm not even sure he'd beat the 2000's lakers with that supporting cast. It's a great supporting cast, but Harden's second best player was an old CP3. Not quite Kobe+Shaq or KD+Curry level talent"

"This is... not a good take at all. Recent evidence shows the exact opposite if anything, with the massive proliferation of 3 pointers and a guy like Kuminga falling in the draft  All unathletic players have to play ""with a slow pace"", but not all people who play with that pace are unathletic. And plenty of unathletic nba players end up out of position every game, even in the air. Far more so than players with the athleticism to correct for minor lapses  Doncic is athletic, so was rocket's James Harden, as is any iso scorer who's had a modicum of success. You're confusing limitations with intentionality, at best"

Off the top of my head? James Harden is a shooting guard who averages more then 6 APG   6.7 APG isn’t a shooting guards numbers? Better tell James Harden that. For the last few years he’s been hovering around 10 APG. Last year was the only year where he was the de facto point guard.   Ok so you can’t link anything. Got it. That’s all you had to say. I like how I’m talking clear and not insulting anyone and yet here you are. Shows you who’s really mad   Your views on those other players make you a hypocrite because you don’t hold the same opinion for them. You already said Bird is a SF because of the way he played but won’t hold the same for West.   Oh look another insult. Wouldn’t expect less from a Celtics fan.    West is a shooting guard in every great shooting guard list for a reason. You’re in denial. I get it. Anything to remove a Laker from any great player ranking. How many former Celtic greats make the top 10? 2? I’ll let you count how many Laker greats make the top 10.  It’s English. You just don’t want to admit you made up a lie.   So all I got was that you’re Celtic fan who can’t accept that West is a great SG because……honestly I don’t even know. You’re probably trying to prop up Harden if I had to guess. But I’m tired of you. All you do is insult people with out adding anything to the conversation. Internet tough guys like you are boring. Go find another hobby

"He relentlessly used to attack the basket every single game. Was very crafty and creative too. And in the fourth quarter, if it was a close game, his midrange became automatic. There are some players that numbers don't do justice. There is no way anyone can convince that James Harden in his prime was better than prime Wade. He was a menace on offense and defense."

"What do you think happened when Chris Paul first arrived in Houston? Do you think James Harden met him up for drinks, played pickup B-ball like a normal human being? Fuck no. That's human. James Harden is inhuman, the embodiment of transcendence that occurs only when a spirit truly slips the surly bounds of his human enclosure. Rather, Harden invited Chris Paul over. He lit candles, put on a nice song. Poured some wine. Laid out some bananas and a boat. I know where you think this is going- but Harden doesn't have any sexual desires. He's immune. Not erect. Chris Paul entered the house, visibly shocked at the internal decor of Harden's Houston pad. Harden remained straight-faced.  Suddenly, Poker Face by Lady Gaga blared over Harden's disco speakers. Harden closed his eyes, seemingly falling into a dormant stupor of a drunken comatose paraplegic. Without moving his lips, he invited Paul to sit near him. Telepathically. Paul, visibly shaking, moved over to Harden. He was suddenly captured by an unspeakable force. Paul realized he wasn't in the world anymore. No. He was... he was sitting atop a mountain. He glanced to his right. James Harden was nude in a bib and apron making pork chops and broccoli. Perhaps it was stir fry? A fitting dinner for Paul's first night out? ""You see, Paul, this is how I make connections with my teammates"" Harden spoke, without turning around. ""Do you think Dwight was willing to watch me cook stir fry nude on a mountaintop? Fuck no. Do you think any of my previous coaches were willing to have a candlelight virgil while Pokerface played? Fuck no. But you, Christoffer, I see potential in you.""  ""Come over here. Touch my fucking beard.""  So Chris Paul walked over in a state of amazement and vague apprehension. He extended a single finger as James turned around, eyes and mouth zipped shut. His face became utterly expressionless; all that was left to notice was the beard. So Paul grabbed it. Suddenly, they were transported back to Harden's pad in Houston. Everything appeared normal. Harden spoke one last time to a visibly shaken Paul.  ""You don't even want to know what Russell makes new teammates do.”"
James Harden is hands down one of the best defenders in the league!

"How are you telling me it’s factually incorrect when you don’t even have access to the stats?  And win shares, BPM etc are extremely outdated  stats. Jokic apparently had a higher peak than Shaq by several standard deviations. Paul George is apparently better than Kobe. I just don’t think harden was as good as Kd in the playoffs, kds defense on tatum, scoring and efficiency were a lot better.   And here’s an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."
"There’s different calibers of MVP. Peak MVP caliber Russell Westbrook was not on the level of MVP caliber James Harden, or MVP Giannis was not on the same level as MVP caliber KD."

"Mahomes also has a stake in Sporting KC.  Russell Wilson has a stake in the Sounders. So does Ken Griffey Jr.  Kevin Durant owns 5% of Philadelphia Union IIRC.  James Harden also has a stake with the Houston Dynamo.  Steve Nash is one of the owners of the Vancouver Whitecaps.  Magic Johnson is also apart of the LAFC ownership group (and the Dodgers ownership group as well).  Though he's not a ""hyperelite athlete"", Mark Ingram owns a 1% stake in DC United.  MLS franchises have been attracting athlete investors more than MLB has in the past few years."
"Ran out of James Harden choking post, on to Kyrie!   We’ll finish out the Nets with KD and Blake soon!"
As it stands Nets roster looks like this:  Harden - Mills - Carter Irving - Brown - Thomas Harris - Bembry Durant - James Johnson - Alize Johnson Griffin - Claxton - Jordan - Sharpe  That’s fifteen. Would need to move someone. A lot of fans keep pointing to Alize Johnson as the odd man out but if I were Marks I’d stick Sharpe on the Long Island Nets for the year. The two have a similar skill set (rebounding) but I trust Johnson’s ability to defend more than Sharpe’s.

Dude is clearly suffering from some kind of obsessive disorder lol. I wonder if they realize that if James Harden saw all this he'd probably just be hella creeped out rather than instantly falling in love with his white knight.
You're averaging one James-Harden related comment per minute over the last 15 minutes.   Please go outside lol.
"Ahhh makes sense. I was gonna say, typing all that out is some major lunatic shit. Good to know you're not crazy, you just have a repository where you archive diatribes in defense of James Harden.   So who was the original author?"
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"

James Harden loves it but the fans don't
Lmfao James Harden played two games and was basically a pylon because of his injury. Kyrie Irving missed half the series.
What.  No way.  Middleton all the way.  Don’t undermine your dudes to make the win more impressive.  The Bucks players stepped up when it mattered most but that Nets team past Game 4 was Kevin Durant and nobody else.  One leg James Harden is terrible.  He could only dribble and pass.  James Harden is a terrible spot up shooter and an even worse defensive player and that’s when he’s healthy.  Now imagine that guy injured and not being able to do the things that make him special off the dribble and with the step back.  It was a great win but hardly an even series.  Frankly that counts on both sides too without Divencenzo  but the Nets not having a healthy Hrden and no Kyrie for the final 3 games is a much bigger loss.  The Bucks had 6 of the best 7 players in the series by the final 3 games.
They sure as shit aren't James Harden or Kyrie Irving

"Look at James Harden? How can you miss the guy who is fat as fuck, with a horrendous hairstyle that obviously took some effort to get?"
LeBron James Harden
Some FACTS about HARDEN   \- 9x Hot dog eating contest champion   \- 4x lost in the 1st round   \- 4x lost in the 2nd round   \- 27 missed 3's   \- Needs a superteam   \- Owned by Curry   \- Biggest playoff choker of all time   James HarFatAss is NOT top 50 all time
"He's one of those players you initially think fits the Modern nba but I wouldn't be surprised if he's in a Lou will kinda role in 3years. He can shoot but he's not an elite shooter kinda streaky. He's got size for a guard but he ain't athletic and he's not stopping any one on D. Dangelo Russel is a mirage, people see a James harden type player when all there is great sixthman good starter."
"Man that press conference early in the season when he just sat there in silence for a few seconds and had to compose himself was so sad.  Guy took his lumps and paid his dues for years before finally getting a shot. He came in expecting to coach James Harden and a legitimate playoff team. Then James demands out, shows up fat, the team gets a mediocre return for him, and they end up terrible."
"The 1947 Washington Capitols finished the season with a 49-11 record (67 win pace) with 0 All Stars on their roster (the concept of the All Star hadn't been introduced yet).   Apart from that, the answer is the 2018 Rockets (James Harden).  Source: https://www.landofbasketball.com/statistics/best_seasons.htm and bball ref."
"James Harden.   Luka is young, very likable, and flashy - but Harden has consistently proven year after year that he is one of the strongest, quickest, and most versatile guards the league has ever seen"
James Harden getting fat is what got him injured.
Idk why it feels so weird to see Harden referred to as James   Maybe cause I think of LeBron first idk
"&gt; Assuming both teams stay healthy,  Big ask. James Harden the ironman getting injured on the Nets was a bad omen."
People just care about it. These 2 clearly don’t anymore.   James praised Giannis &amp; the Bucks after the series and Giannis said Harden is one of the toughest people to guard on his live.
"I value availability in the playoffs, should have specified. I'm sorry that you seem offended on behalf of James Harden."
"He's made *some* attempt to squash the beef before, [he said Harden was the hardest player to guard](https://twitter.com/DimeUPROXX/status/1243599529858998275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1243599529858998275%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2883381-giannis-says-james-harden-is-the-hardest-player-to-guard-in-the-nba-on-ig-live)"
"“I want somebody that's going to pass the ball.""   “Offensively, we were just trying to find whoever James Harden was guarding. That's who we thought we'd have the opportunity to score on."""
James Harden
Idk because I feel like Curry gets away with a lot of stuff other superstars wouldn’t. Like if it were james harden who lost two straight games (one of which was to a young grizzlies team where steph only had 1 shot attempt in OT)to be knocked out of the playoffs y’all would be calling him a choker and saying he shys away from the moment but with Steph we act like it never happens
"""James Harden catching strays from hunter Giannis yet again""."
somewhere out there James Harden turns his head towards Philly
Ben Taylor made a box creation stat to measure playmaking value  James Harden kind of broke it in 2019 but its still good
Harden. James Harden. It's right there.
Step 1: Move team to Vegas  Step 2: Use city to lure James Harden to Kings  Step 3: Relevancy
* The Hawks will disappoint  * The Bucks will disappoint just like they did multiple seasons before 2021  * This season will be better from a Covid perspective but there will still be annoying hiccups (this isn't that bold)  * By the end of the season the Lakers and Lebron will both be way better than people expect/want them to be  * James Harden MVP  * Hornets will look really dominant until Hayward gets hurt and misses 50 games  * The Knicks won't regress a ton but they definitely won't improve  * Spurs and OKC make the playoffs  * Klay is gonna be an absolute shell of his old self and be sad to watch (really hope this one is incorrect)
"Man, I loved watching him play and he's funny as hell! His game was so loud and silky. Got that James harden body build too lol"
James harden. In 2019 in particular when everyone was injured it was fun to watch him ballhog and drop like 40 every night. Maybe not the best winning style of basketball but really fun
James Harden seems to think so
"I may be biased because Harden made me fall in love with the NBA all over again.  But.  Can anyone tell me what make Luka a better basketball player than him?  Harden has him beat in pretty much every stat. Even this year where he suffered his first real injury.  He took worse teams further in the playoffs than Luka has so far, and in his major flaw everyone points to (defense) he's still light years ahead of Luka.  Hes a better offensive player, better defensive player, better scorer and (this is arguable i get it) a better playmaker.  I like Luka. A lot. He's exciting to watch for a lot of the same reasons Harden is. I just don't get in what aspect of the game that matters (likeability isn't one) where he's ahead of James Edward Harden Jr."
Or elbowed James harden in the face. What a let down
Yeah James Harden is at least 200 places too high.
Some context  Luka has played 11 playoff games  James Harden has played 137  Luka has also shot 54% at the FT  #Harden &gt; Luka
"In no particular order: James, Curry, Giannis, Doncic, Durrant, Harden, Embiid, Jokic, Lillard, AD, Kawahi, Tatum, Booker, PG, Mitchell, Young, Randle, Bam, Middleton, Butler, Gobert. If he returns healthy, Klay.  All players I would take on a team before Kyrie and trade him for in a heartbeat. He is injured frequently and has never led a team in the playoffs as it's best player. He has only made the playoffs on teams with LeBron and the Nets to an extent. In Boston he was pathetic and in Cleveland before LeBron he was a stat stuffer that couldn't lead a team to the playoffs in a weak east outside 2-3 teams. He is also a terrible defender, worse than anyone on my list.  He is a top 25 player when healthy, but not top 20."
(Sad James Harden noises.)
"""And I took that personally.""  \- James Harden"
- Lebron  - Kobe  - Duncan  - KG  - Dirk  - Nash  - Durant  - Steph  - Chris Paul  - Allen Iverson  - Paul Pierce  - James Harden  - Kawhi Leonard  - Giannis Antetkounmpo  - Dwyane Wade  - Jason Kidd
Man it’s such a shame we never got James harden with embiid in philly. That would be such incredible basketball and make the east so interesting.
James harden teams up with jokic to take down Giannis with the ultimate anti-run-and-dunk team.   For real though idk if it would be totally optimal just because harden excels playing with an athletic lob threat that jokic very much is not but the playmaking and shooting with those two would just be bonkers.  Surround them with three competent players and the defense would be totally flummoxed. I would love to see that.
Nothing kills basketball more for me than watching James Harden take 3 fucking foul shots in a row.
"Aight so this one summer my boy TDub and I hit up Montreal for the strip clubs right, we get to this place downtown. Holy moley, everything people said about strippers in Montreal... was true. It was truly... a buffet for the eyes. The great thing was in Montreal it can also be a buffet for your hands... no fingers, though. Duh. Clean underneath your fingernails if you digging for treasure frequently.  So anyways, I got a few dances from a few different dancers, just to test out the waters, and out of nowhere comes this five foot nothing Moroccan girl (I asked, true or not who knows) around the corner as I'm leaving the private dance area.  My eyes were drawn, which was unusual because if she were pasta, she'd be angel hair. Slim frame, but something was different because her hips didn't lie at all, Shakira ain't wrong. After about 5 dances I thought about propositioning this young lady, but I thought better, tipped her a few more greens (20s this is Canada) and walked out towards the dance floor area.  Lo and freaking behold James Harden is walking in draped in what I can only explain as the ""drippiest of drip"" outfits because this dude could barely walk. Shirts too long and shit, even got caught in the limo door, fortunately one of James' boys got it before the driver took off. That woulda been a TMZ moment for sure, bud. Anyways he strolls in with some kind of Kanye-esque sunglasses (Bruh it was 1am) so I knew this MF was fried somehow. Like that Jim Jones song, ""They can't see my eyes, unless my head is bent"".  James sits down at the VIP booth and within 7 seconds half a dozen bottle girls come out with Cristal, Crystal Skull Vodka, and oddly enough Beef Eater Gin and a bunch of other hard liquors. No one turned the music up but that club just got that much louder after this guy came in. Anyways, TDub and I stuck around for a bit but we wanted to dip cuz we were spent. $160 dollars was getting close to another type of money for me.  So for the 15 minutes that we were there James was like cashing step backs. Literally. He'd grab a rack from his homies fur coat and throw it into a basketball rim a dancer would grip with her thighs. HIGHLY doubt it was regulation, but in my opinion a strip club is a dangerous place for a tape measure. So we were like wow, this cat comes to strip clubs to party and actually still works on his fundamentals. Like how some people study better at a cafe, and some at home.  My boy had a slightly different experience from James and I as it turns out the girl he made out with actually had just gave dome to her previous client, bro kept saying he had this grapey bleachy weird taste and feel on the tongue. I told him ""Fuck that noise bro wash it off with some poutine"" then we got some and fucked off."
"Thank you for asking.  Defenses are not in full control of whether a foul gets called.  Nowadays, flopping is more than exaggerating contact. We used to mostly see defenders exaggerating slight contact in order to influence a foul call. In some of those situations, fouls were the technically correct call. But skilled floppers are now more skilled at manufacturing foul calls while initiating contact.   We have seen floppers be rewarded for initiating contact on, or faking contact with, a player in a legal defensive position. Thus, your comment “don’t foul someone if you don’t want them to get free throws” shows a lack of understanding for what’s going on.   I don’t know any notable floppers on the Raptors. However, I’m sure you all have faced James Harden or Trae Young enough to be able to understand that defenses don’t always control whether a foul is called. Players are now manipulating officials and getting awarded for it. And for the most part, all defenders can do is flail their hands in the air after the call. And if they show too much emotion they’ll get a tech.  It’s becoming more difficult to play defense in the NBA."
"&gt;Harden has never scored more than 31.6 points per game in the playoffs in his career  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/james-harden-stats-vs-warriors-2019-playoffs#:~:text=James%20Harden%20averaged%2034.8%20points,the%202019%20Western%20Conference%20Semifinals.  just give up dude"
"It's a byproduct of having James Harden. Once you're put in the position of defending his playstyle, defending other stupid things comes easy. It quickly spreads through the fanbase like cancer."
"?? i never typed a word about James Harden what are you on about lol  But if you think Luka doesn’t fall off in the clutch you clearly don’t watch Luka. He was wayyyyy worse in the second halves vs the Clippers. He had a better regular season this year, but the year before he was absolutely terrible in the clutch"
Jae'Sean Tate's mother was killed by her boyfriend. KD wore 35 in honor of his coach who died at the age of 35. James Edward Harden Sr. was in prison for most of James Edward Harden Jr.'s childhood if I remember correctly
"The KD thing imo is more in terms of skill. He has no weakness in his scoring, surely you wouldn’t argue Jordan is a better outside shooter than KD?  But skill is different from will, so Jordan was obviously skilled as a scorer but his will to keep his foot on the pedal and continue scoring is the difference. I don’t think James Harden is as skilled a scorer as KD at all, but some say he’s a better scorer cause he keeps shooting. So the KD thing is more skill, and I think that argument has some credibility cause he can shoot from 2, 3, free, drive, dunk, layup, post lol pretty much everything. And Idk if he’s the clutches player ever but he definitely isn’t “unclutch”."
"Potentially.  But Luka is trying to improve to where James Harden has been the last few years.    At their respective ages, Harden is more likely to stay at the level he has played at than Luka to reach that level."

"We’re talking all-time or the previous two seasons? Also you have 4 guys ahead of James Harden that shouldn’t be, why pick Luka specifically?"
"Tried to post this Just my two cents in the discussion...      Going through the initial list from NBA 50th anniversary and Simmon's Pantheon (given that he is/was the basketball savant)... seems that there are 27 players in the Pantheon (not on the 50) AND have ended their career later than 96:         Rank Player	               Rank Player	Rank	Player	Rank	Player   7	  Tim Duncan	39	 Dirk	69	Dennis Rodman	85	Arvydas Sabonis   8	  Kobe Bryant	41	 Gary Payton	72	Chris Webber	88	Shawn Kemp   20	  Lebron James	43	 Jason Kidd	74	Joe Dumars	89	Vince Carter   22	  Kevin Garnett	47	 Paul Pierce	77	Tracy McGrady	90	Chris Paul   28	  Dwyane Wade	55	 Dominique Wilkins	78	Dwight Howard	93	Kevin Johnson   36	  Steve Nash	62	Ray Allen	82	Chris Mullin	96	Tom Chambers   37	  Allen Iverson	63	Reggie Miller	84	Robert Horry		   IMO, all the names up to Rodman should be included in the 75, as well as Tracy, Dwight and Chris Paul - total 18 players      Of course the Pantheon doesn't include current household names as KD, Steph, Harden, Leonard or Giannis (could also add Westbrook in that list for MVP and number of All-NBA teams consideration). - other 6 players, bringing the total to 24.      That leaves one extra player to add in the top 75. Perhaps Jokic due to his late MVP, dunno.      The tough question to answer is whether we are keeping the initial NBA 50 list intact or can we remove a few names and create space for more current players?  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||"
He averages 17.5 ppg over his career without free throws. No other star in NBA history is as reliant on flopping as James Harden
James Harden is officially underrated
Well James Harden and a rim running Center will get you pretty far so fuck the small ball we doing whatever Harden wants
"Entirely different scenarios. Isiah and Kawhi are basketball/business related decisions. This has to do with public health and in a way, morality. This sub had the same energy when James Harden was acting foolish at the beginning of last season, not for screwing over the Rockets, but going to the strip clubs during a pandemic!"
"there is literally no lineup you can put together that would be ""hell in a handbasket"" with James Harden and Kevin Durant on your team. In fact, it's like the best possible scenario fro Simmons."
I don't think you need to be that worried about shot creation with James Harden and Kevin Durant on your team....
they got james harden and fucking kevin durant to be the shot creators and volume scorers hahaha
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."
"Might get downvoted for this but harden gets no sympathy from me - he did carry the team yes. But he refused to make any of the adjustments or sacrifices a true #1 guy does. Front office bent over backwards for him, got him Dwight, didn’t work. Ok, got him Chris Paul, one of the top point guards of the generation. Harden, a natural 2 guard tells Chris Paul “nah you play off ball, I’m the PG”. Doesn’t work out. They go get him one of his close buddies, Russell Westbrook. You mentioned them trading capela - that was a move in part influenced by James harden. Because harden’s offense and game is spacing and kicking. Trading away that pretty good asset in capela was essentially the org saying “fuck it we’re all in on harden and Westbrook”. Of course that didn’t work either. Not to say that losing capela was all on him, but harden certainly influenced that move and didn’t mind it.    Over those 8 ish years harden never really sacrificed or stepped back. A player who’s growth I compare him to is Kobe in the mid 2000’s when the Lakers basically were stalled. Kobe, like harden was averaging stupid numbers and dragging his team. Like harden, Kobe dominated the ball and the offense, they basically were the offense. Except Kobe was willing to take a step back, let others play their game, and be a part of the offense, when they had a few more pieces because he recognized that forumula where it’s one guy is the offense and controls everything cannot win you a title. He stepped up his game as a leader and boom, 2 chips in 09/10. Harden has never taken that step back. Part of that is coaching, d’antoni built a system that’s basically harden or bust, but at the same time, harden, with all the tools FO gave him, never took a step back, try to develop as a leader, make necessary sacrifices or adjustments to his play or his he fits in the scheme of a team offense that might benefit the team in the long run. Mf had Chris Paul on his team and said no stand on the wing lemme be point"
Did he not have james harden? But i Digress. This year everyones takes have been this Kevin Durant&gt;Lebron James James Harden&gt;Anthony Davis Kyrie Irving&gt;Russell Westbrook So my take is this if lebron wins with the “Inferior team” alongside the guy Kevin Durant couldn’t win with and Kevin Durant has a guy who Lebron did win with. I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron
"Oh I guess I missed the part where they forgot to send me my portion of the profits. I should call up China tomorrow and let them know I’m missing a cool hundred million or so.   I didn’t. LEBRON literally holds HIMSELF to that higher ideal. Guys like James Harden &amp; Lou Will out there at every titty bar in America. Most of these dudes don’t market themselves the way Lebron did. “More than an athlete.” “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. How you gonna quote the great Martin Luther King JR and then absolutely take a giant shit on his words like that.   Yes I want him to stop working with and empowering the authoritarian Chinese govt that has been running a literal fucking concentration camp. Let’s say the Nazi’s were still around. I’d bet you would be saying the exact same thing now if Lebron was working with Nazi Germany if they made cheap enough shoes.   Yes KD, MJ all these dudes should stop. But most of all the dude who’s always fake virtue signaling should put his money where his mouth is instead of damaging the cause, empowering and emboldening racists and just being a plain old hypocrite. Don’t market yourself as the next social messiah if at the first sign of your money being threatened you tell another dude to stfu about human rights abuses. It’s just pathetic and says EVERYTHING about who Lebron has always been as a person."

"My guess is Yes, if they really put the effort into being a good General Manager + President of Basketball Operations. Also, having bad ownership might hold them back.  I'll give you an example. In 2009, the Timberwolves drafted Ricky Rubio #5 and Jonny Flynn at #6. The GSW take Steph Curry at #7. Blake Griffin, Hasheem Thabeet, James Harden, and Tyreke Evans were also taken ahead of Curry. I think the average hardcore NBA fan goes with Curry, a super good shooter and son of an NBA player over Flynn.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m"
"Wade is better and there’s five reasons IMO, first Is playoffs, he won one of the most impressive rings ever, I think in terms of carrying a team it’s right on the same level with 2016, and in general he was a great playoff performer. 2nd with Lebron he was a superstar fir 2 years, and would’ve won finals MVP if they won in 2011, but he didn’t so ppl don’t give him as much credit as he deserves, third is rebounding, I think wades a better rebounder, 4th is a higher peak, maybe individually harden peaked higher then Wade, but I consider Wade the best player in the world in 05-06, I’ve never considered harden that level of player, and 4th is defense, I think Wade and harden are pretty comparable in most individual categories (shooting I’d give to James easily though), but James Harden is nowhere near the defender Wade was, and yeah that’s one category but it’s also half the game, Harden has always been a one sided player who was at best decent on D, Wade was a DPOY level defender at his peak"
"Tough to evaluate this move fairly because the team's been consistently hurt ever since he took over. There are a lot of questionable move he's made. Actually for me, he's only made 2 positive moves so far and that's taking Ant #1 overall, and selecting McDaniels with the later pick. Aside from that, his signings and trades have been pretty bad. His roster design has been a try-hard of those James Harden Rockets, but without a James Harden and viable 3 point shooters. Honestly, for a guy who was touted as a protege under so many great GM's, his time here has been underwhelming."
"yea the professionalism is terrible, but at the same time look at the picture.  The nba window of play is a career that is 10 years and thats lucky to have not considering injury issues, then the culmination of your life work is gone. You are often judged by team performance and if you are a great and you don't win, it falls on you. Yet every one who knows hoops, outside of ESPN, know its not played 1-1.     There is a reason that MJ demanded help after 7 years of dominating including get DPOY and MVP.  THere is a reason Lebron JAmes left after 7 years to get help. There is a reason Mr. bleed yellow and gold Kobe  asked for a trade when lakers weren't giving him help.  And more recently, frankly there is a reason that Harden left the Rockets after new ownership began to cheap out on margins and role players and non-headline making moves to make his job harder, likewise with the pelicans with Anthony Davis.  They had their best year, he sang praises on Rondo making a difference in the playoffs for him and Rondo said hes willing to even consider a discount because he liked what they built, they replaced him for Elfrid Pyton who may make sense if all you do is read box scores.    So I agree, they handle it the wrong way. The truth is the NBA is more of a mom-pop business that grew to billions rather than your traditional billion organization and teams are trying to change that, but its just a unique make up where the players have 51 percent of revenue and its predicated on marketing on them.  The owners may be more replaceable than the stars in most cases.  So with the culture of things, I don't mind players who go above and beyond.  Including your boy giannis last summer and they want an organiation that matches that level and they have to get it right.  No one cared the son of Chicago Derrick was kicked out when he couldnt stay on the court, no one cared that hakeem was sent ot kick rocks in Toronto because he wanted to play.  Loyalty are a few anomaly situation, its a results league.  Somehow the ownership has taken the teams and conjoined it with fans who don't get the profits or to enjoy the wins if they cheap out but have put the onus on the players of betraying a fan base and cityeven if the organization doesn't do them right.  Most players love the cities and fans, evne if they dont like the owner.  I can't imagine any other industry where you are at the top of your game, high income, producing high revenue yet you're more stuck and not able to move aroudn if your company makes your job harder.  The 'loyalty' thing is another hilarious undefined non consistent theme they billionaires have pushed on fans to hold accountable the millionaire players, either way with the next media deal salaries themselves are going to be covered just with tv rights, with some creative accounting, the owners will still be crying and pointing at the finges and saying look at them!  Now I agree, its tough with contracts and I agree players almost never handle this the right way, but the organizations often get off scotch free for making their employees jobs harder. I can't imagine if you're a star employee at any job, new owner comes in cheaps out, gives you mroe on your plate, makes your job harder while you make a lot of money, then blame you for wanting more help or wanting to leave"
"He shoots 37% from the field &amp; 22% from 3 in game 7s. If we were just talking regular season maybe Harden stans have a point, but the playoffs matters. He’s not ahead Wade.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/james-harden-in-game-7-stats"
"Was he coasting when he was down 2-0 and 2-1 prior to Kyrie’s freak injury against the Nets series and the whole world was crying for him to guard KD and he was settling for fadeaway jumpshots with James Harden guarding him in the clutch? Also he was shooting 5 3s a game at 19% and 38% from the line through the first 4 games vs the Nets, thats not coasting"
In the chaos that is now ensuing in Minny who knows! Logically speaking you are correct. But the NBA is a league full of dumb/bad trades made every year. Both sides in a Minny/Philly deal are on a time crunch to get a deal done for different reasons. I'd just be worried Morey is going to try and rob whoever takes over for Rosas while playing it off like he's helping the Wolves. He tried that same strategy with James Harden last year and it almost worked.
"Yea this guy is a real top notch analyst. “Scores fewer points than SiXtH man James Harden”. I mean that sentence alone just exposes this guys bias lol. I don’t accept this cherry picked post, I can go compile some cherry picked playoff games Westbrook excelled in easily. No one is saying Westbrook is Tim Duncan or something , the ultimate winner , this is just a hate post. Let’s see how it goes this year with the lakers"
James Harden not being a better playmaker than kobe and mj is one of the worst takes ive seen on this sub.
"I mean superstars nowadays just sign the big extension and force a trade, Ala Anthony Davis or James Harden. At the end of the day they're still choosing their trade destination  Boston was really good, probably more well-positioned to win with AD but AD still didn't wanna live in cost ass boston"
"While I agree that Doc is no longer an elite coach, it's not that he won't ever bring the Sixers to the finals. It's that he *can't.* And that's Morey's fault, in my opinion.   To wit: Morey refuses to ""lose"" trades and has a reputation of trying to fleece everyone. He was given a golden opportunity to pair Embiid with a disgruntled Top 5 player in James Harden. Now obviously the Rockets aren't going to deal with Morey for the same cost as other teams, but if he had swallowed his pride and overpaid for Harden, he could have gotten rid of Simmons and acquired the perfect running mate for Embiid. Reporting at the time suggested he was unwilling to give up Maxey/Thybulle. IF losing a young prospect or even role/starter in order to get Harden would've been all that it took (on top of the other assets Brooklyn ended up giving), the Sixers organization had plenty of information to know that Simmons wasn't the answer and that they could do much better with Harden/Harris/Embiid than with Simmons.   To make matters worse, it was well known that Harden's other primary suitors were Miami and Brooklyn. Either case would create a juggernaut in Philly's own conference. And sure enough, after plenty of time to bring a package together, Morey fails to make the overpay since he refuses to ""lose"" and ends up holding the bag on Simmons while Brooklyn becomes a superteam that will last through Embiid's prime.   So yeah, Doc sucks, but no coach is going to get Philly past Brooklyn (let alone Milwaukee) at this point. And that's Morey's doing. But let's pat him on the back because he got Seth Curry or some shit."
"I really don't see how Giannis went from a guy who couldn't score on a crippled James Harden in the post to best player in the league and ""better than KD"" by winning a ring when literally every legit contender was injured. Are people even watching games?? He's still the same player, he still is garbage in the post, he still sucks ass in 4th and can't create his own shot."

The answer is obviously Kobe.  James Harden would probably be the next possibility.
2008 Wade  Or  James Harden
&amp;#x200B;  2016: Kevin Durant or Derozan/Lowry (surprised no one mentioned it)  2017: Kyrie Irving  2018: Jimmy Butler  2019: James Harden  2020: Paul George  2021: Ben Simmons
bro no one was considering IT for james harden
"I think you’re missing the point, you’d be picking players based on their play for your specific team. You’d be getting Kevin Durant from his time as a net, not as a warrior. So Dwight Howard wouldn’t really count and Kevin Garnett would probably be taken out considering he wasn’t that good on the Nets. Also how can you call yourself a Nets fan and leave Dr. J on the bench lmao.  C Kenyon Martin  PF Kevin Durant  SF Dr. J  SG Vince Carter  PG Jason Kidd  James Harden only has 1 season on the Nets, I didn’t really think he’s done more for the franchise in that 1 season compared to Vince. I think if harden has 2 or 3 more great seasons and brings a chip to Brooklyn he’d have that spot in the Nets all time team."
"Difference was that almost every team would take James Harden on their team. I am less convinced every team would take Simmons on his current contract, even if they had to give nothing up to get him."
"still think it's crazy how ben simmon's trade value went from james harden to tyus jones, jarrett culver and a couple srp's"
"I don’t know how he did it but Ben Simmons soared past James Harden on my “least favorite player” list.  A man that makes more than 99% of the world, the biggest crybaby in the league that refuses to take accountability for his actions.  There’s only 5 PGs in the entire league that make more $ than Simmons. Yet he plays like that and curls up like a fetus when he’s called out.  It’s pathetic. It’s embarassing. It’s shameful. It’s Ben Simmons."
"J  John Stockton, James Harden, Julius Erving, Jermaine O’Neal, Jack Sikma"
Well yes then james Harden came. Who is a superior playmaker. Kyrie is a great sg but he's too small to play great D which the nets could use as KD is their best defender currently.
JAMES HARDEN A FLAMETHROWER
"James Harden and Jimmy Butler couldnt net you a star, what makes you think Ben is?"
I feel so bad for James harden man literally plays his soul out and the goddamn avengers were assembled
"C Dwight Howard (was on the Nets one day in 2018 before being waived)   PF Kevin Garnett   SF Kevin Durant   SG James Harden   PG Jason Kidd  Julius Erving, Kyrie Irving, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Andrei Kirilenko etc on the bench."
Well their value would be higher and the return more palatable to the team trading him.  There’s no self awareness by him or his agent by demanding a trade in this way.  Even James harden showed up to camp.
"His coach and team mates had clearly lost confidence in him. The GM was trying to trade him for James Harden, Philly fans are completely fucking psychotic and they pretend its cute.  Fuck yeah I wouldn't want to work there."
"Isn’t this what Anthony Davis, James Harden, and Paul George all did?   They forced themselves out of their contract early. This is nothing new."
Ben Simmons got outplayed by Kevin Huerter and Danilo Gallinari in game 7 and he’s acting like he’s James Harden.
"*Write a couple sentences about what you like about* r/nba *and what is something you would change?*      I love how r/nba has a diversity of content, when I'm bored of ben simmons or kyrie irving rumors I can read in-depth analysis on [The Impact of Strip Clubs on James Harden](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/) or [The Charlotte Hornets have a transgender mascot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/joovqq/the_charlotte_hornets_have_a_transgender_mascot/)     *Where would you currently rank the your team (must have flair) in a Powerrankings today?*      I would rank the Kings **17th**. Even though they don't have any superstars(or a competent coach), they are still sitting on a 2-2 record in the west with wins over the Suns and the Trailblazers . However, I also wouldn't put them in the top half of the rankings since they haven't made any significant additions besides Davion Mitchell this offseason and they finished a distant **23rd** last season(**12th** in the west)  *How often do you come on* r/nba*?*   I browse r/nba multiple times a day, from bathroom visits to bedtime reading I'm also on it for most of the day.      *How many games of your team do you watch on average per week during the season?

So just because only three guys have won championships as a top pick means that it’s pointless to get a top pick? So Indy shouldn’t even try to get a Dwight Howard or a James Harden or a Kevin Durant because they didn’t win a chip with their original team? You didn’t even mention Kyrie Irving btw or how a ton of those top picks have brought their teams to the conference finals or finals… It’s better to be a first round exit every year and take a gamble? You’re mentioning Giannis and Kawhi but it’s just a fact that it’s a lot easier to get star talent in the top ten every year than in the 15-20 range.
I always used to ask a simple question.  Would you send your child to the James Harden school of basketball?
"Since he entered the league Harden has (a lot) more 3 point fouls drawn than any entire team in the league.  Other guys do it some, but it really is primarily a Harden problem.    https://netswire.usatoday.com/2021/09/01/james-harden-has-drawn-more-3-point-fouls-than-any-team-since-2009/  And I 100% completely disagree that the outstretched (to the side) arms which Harden grabs are in an illegal position.  That's literally how you are taught to play defense.  It's not a ""you reach, I teach"" situation because the defenders aren't reaching - Harden is lol.  Definitely agree on the Trae foul baiting being annoying though, but Harden is worse."
"lowkey didnt even know lbj #1 was number one so i had to check.  some interesting facts:  westbrook has always been in the top 3 highest TO average per game since 2013-2014 season. in those 7 seasons he was number 1 twice, and if not he was second only to james harden.  in the top 100 TO leaders ever in the nba, the current lakers have 5 of them: lbg #1, wb at $9, dwight #24, melo at #24, rondo at #59. probably not surprising since these guys are old time vets, but what is intriguing is that only 12 people still playing in the nba only made the top 100 list lmao. lakers almost have half of it. oof."
"James Harden shot 45% or better from the field exactly 1 season on the Rockets, 2013-14. He shot 87% or better from the free throw line exactly 1 season on the Rockets as well, 2018-19."
What nonsense is this lol  What NBA defender sagged off James Harden? Any NBA player thats in foul trouble is gonna be more careful about initiating contact defensively  It's not some concept exclusive to Harden  Harden's struggles are because of the fact that he's playing himself into shape after rehabbing the entire offseason
"KD is showing that he's in a tier below giannis, steph, and lebron.  boy can win with dem cats, even when one of those cats is james harden"
"I think your fundamental assumption isn’t the shared world view you present it as.   “Defensive players are expected to beat the offensive player to the spot and go straight up to contest shots” - why? Why do they have to “beat them” to the spot? What if they are both going to the same spot? If a defender jumps and a player moves their legs / limbs to their path, why is that a defenders problem?  You could be correct, that’s certainly a way to call the game. But we see what that generates.   It’s perfectly acceptable for the NBA to allow a defender to be entitled to the space and the immediate path their momentum brings them (I.e. if they jump in a direction, they are entitled to that position in the air). Therefore, moving an arm or leg in to their path becomes an offensive foul (or no foul at all).  There is no definitively correct way to adjudicate basketball. The NBA has tried more or less what you suggested, and it lead to stopping in front of running defenders, flailing limbs out in front of jumpers defenders, and James Harden. People don’t like it (or at least that seems to be the sentiment), so they’re changing it up a bit, which appears to be better."
"Personally I really enjoyed him, he seems to have the deepest understanding of getting to the ft line of anyone in history.   The only thing that would make me mad is when refs would gift him free throws when he didn’t deserve them. But seeing someone just completely school a defender into an obvious foul has always been one of my favourite plays lol.   The idea that he knows where your hand is gonna be, and can *naturally* put his arm in your way for a legitimate foul is fucking beautiful.   Refs made it fucking lame by not being able to tell the difference between when he’s flopping and when he’s making an incredibly smart play.   I’m a high school ref, I’ve always thought the rule book is so damn arbitrary that it could be gamed pretty easily, I’ve loved seeing James harden just shit on the rule book and make the whole league change. It’s the games flaw, and it’s been one of my favourite evolutions to watch."
"I never blamed Harden for his foul baiting. While I didn't enjoy it, it was the refs fault for letting him get away with that nonsense. Harden just took what they were giving him and played to his strengths as an excellent FT shooter. Now they're not calling it and the onus is on James to adapt"
"James Harden is the only NBA player in history with more free throws made than field goals.  Wade, Manu, and Dantley were similar. But nothing on the level of Harden."
He went James Soften… gonna take some time for him to return to James Harden
East  Harden Young Giannis Embiid Durant  Lavine Beal Tatum Bam Butler  Randle Ball  Middleton/Sabonis/Brown first ones out  West  Curry Doncic Davis Jokic James  Lillard Mitchell KAT Gobert Paul George  Morant Paul  Booker/Edwarda/Ingram first ones out

"Like most of the starting lineup. KD himself will tell you all about how much he hates dealing with Jrue Holiday despite the size difference, meanwhile we were wasting him on a one-legged James Harden.  It’s not like PJ played bad defence, he didn’t. It was good. It just didn’t matter, because KD is one of the greatest scorers the world has ever seen and poured it in anyway. We have plenty of guys who can have jumpers hit in their face all day."
Same reason I hate James harden. These dudes play some Weevil Underwood type of basketball
James Harden did iirc
&gt; James Harden is better now than he was in 2013  17 PPG on 3FTA. Not sure about that.
"James Harden is better now than he was in 2013. Kevin Durant is just as good.  Patty Mills is still great, too."
"And many many many other super-stars who played with agility first, avoiding the contact, and making the play. Harden, James, Melo, Curry, Durant and others were more interested on attacking the rim, closing their eyes and call the foul, every 40 seconds, it was really annoying. But hey, NOT this year"
"He also traded a reasonably cost-controlled, young James Harden for a roast beef sandwich, and the sandwich didn't even come with chips and a pickle."

"&gt;Lol. Impressive. Nephews really out for blood tonight.  Did... Did you unironically call me a nephew for asking a question? Are you 12? That's something a literal child would say.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Yeah - dude didn’t respond but averaging 25 a game Jordan is enough to get an 8 seed if he had another star like Kevin Durant and James Harden. They’ll have each other (granted they stay healthy). This is Lebron and Melo’s 37 season. Which will be Durant’s (Harden will actually be 36)     Did 37 year old Jordan playing in the NBA exist? What about 38 and 39, when he was with the Wizards? Ten seed twice. You're arguing for a player that literally doesn't exist.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And Jordan won a chip at 36 then averaged 22 when he was 38 -40.     Jordan was 34 according to BBRef, turning 35. You made 36 up, which is a complete lie.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And I never said lead. I said “produce enough”. But you did get me with KG. So I’ll replace that with Wilt and Tim Duncan. Sound good?     You said top stars and produce enough to be 8 seed, implying they're getting the team to the 8th seed, implying they're the leader and best player.   Yeah, Wilt and Duncan are better examples. The dude you were arguing against was still right with the 3 players only tho.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I do appreciate you going through all that work and digging through my post history. See anything else you want to discuss?     Nah.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Side Note: I also said “off the top of my head”. This Warriors fan funny enough decided to leave that out. Also the way the other guy responded didn’t sound at all like this warriors fan made it sound. And finally Warriors fan listed 2 not 3 and put words into the other guys mouth for him.     Why would I have to include you saying off the top of your head? That was in your 2nd reply which I didn't quote.  If you aren't confident in your options, then don't say them lmao. Don't blame me. You listed 6 guys and proceeded to say ""Do you not know the guys I listed?"" after the person challenged you..  &amp;#x200B;  The way he responded didn't sound like how I'm saying?  ""Ok so 3 guys ever. Not looking good for a guy with an achilles surgery under his be  That's what he said. The only time I referenced ""what he said"" is when I said ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but, he seems to be correct?"" which literally has nothing to do with ""What he said."" It's about whether he was right or not.  &amp;#x200B;  Finally, me listing 2 and not 3 doesn't change anything, it's me demonstrating that you're even more wrong than the guy implied. Only 2 of your examples work and the Bucks fan was generous and said 3. Again, doesn't change anything. You could include a 37 year old MJ that doesn't exist or a 37 year old Lebron that doesn't exist and he'd still be right."
I'd still take top 101 James harden over westbrook
Meanwhile James Harden seems to be struggling a bit with the new rules.
James Harden 🤡

"But this is later in the same play:  [https://imgur.com/a/5movGmE](https://imgur.com/a/5movGmE)  That's James' arm, hooking the defensive player and pulling his arm up.  The refs aren't supposed to call incidental contact that doesn't disrupt the ball handler. Here, the guy's arm was out, but Harden, instead of dribbling through, grabbed the guy's arm and yanked.   Obviously, there are degrees of judgement call in all of this, but here Harden was clearly more interested in increasing the amount of contact than in making a basketball play."
"Blame him for wanting to team up with Kyrie who everyone knows is batshit crazy and flighty, and then after Kyrie took a vacation mid season last year he gets fucking James Harden, how could anyone feel bad for him?"
"&gt; you implied that the rule changes aren’t affecting his game at all  No I didn't lmfao, I clearly said that people who think that James Harden is playing the way he is now (i.e. trash) *because of the rule changes* are idiots."
Me: People who say James Harden is playing like trash because of the rule changes are dumb   You: Replies implying that people who believe that are not dumb   Also you: I didn't say that!!!
"Watch, people are going to interpret this as ""James Harden admitting he's washed because of rule changes and age"" just like they interpreted Lebron saying he'll never be back to where he was as him not recovering from the injury ever, not him saying he's just not in his prime anymore."
James Harden without the grift is Tyreke Evans.
It took me a bit but he really is the closest thing to James Harden.
I'm concerned that you're not concerned about James Harden.
“Is it time to be concerned about James harden?”
He’s getting the same calls Derrick Rose recieved for the past 6 years and he doesn’t know what to do. This is not suprise James Harden  has always had the most padded/shallow stats of all time. Look wht happens when he doesn’t get free throws all those “missed shots” are no longer counted as fouls and now his % is in the gutter and his ppg is cut in half
“harden too fat to play good harden can’t score without free throws funny james harden in strip club joke 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂”
They have James fucking Harden.   This sub hurts to read sometimes man.
The James Harden Concern would be a good 90s metal band name
"I’m sorry but this take is so crazy dumb. If you honestly believe this is who James harden is and he just can’t do well without the calls you simply don’t know anything about basketball.  He’s one of the 10 best scorers in nba history, like him or not."
"If nets wanna win the championship, they need the 2018-19 James Harden back and Harden should try to be as aggressive as possible because that's the only way to benefit other shooters as well.  Just like the rockets good old days."
"Hello, i am here for some James Harden slander please."
James Harden confirms he “can’t do that” with new NBA rules
"James Harden: ""My career, I've been blessed just not having any surgeries. That process last year (dealing with injury) was really draining... I'm finally slowly getting back to it.

It was all rehab.""  https://twitter.com/MattBrooksNBA/status/1453544818689380356  James Harden said given his durability before his hamstring injury this is uncharted waters for him where he has to play himself back into his old self and build up his confidence. https://twitter.com/Alex__Schiffer/status/1453545646259163138  Keep in mind this was someone who regularly played 38 minutes a game, and basically never got hurt, and he got hurt twice in the span of 3 months with an injury that takes away his best skill (hamstrings are key to acceleration/decceleration). I hope it will get better, but maybe he has to pull a CP3 and go on a different diet. It's ironic this same injury made CP3 miss the Warriors series, then affected him for the first part of the next season, which made Harden go supernova, and probably played a factor in the Westbrook trade."
James Harden got nerfed with a single rule change and now he forgot how to basketball.
"James Harden to Michael Jordan:   ""They changed the rules in my era so that I couldn't dominate. they changed the rules in yours so you could dominate."""
Don't look now but offensive superstar Rudy Gobert is averaging more PPG (18.7) than elite post defender James Harden (16.0)
PJ Tucker outscoring James Harden eh?
Is It Time To Worry About [James Harden]?^(TM)
Is it time to be legitimately concerned about James Harden?
Direct correlation between how many quarters James Harden tried to score in and how many the Nets won
"james harden washed, upvotes to the left"
"All james harden is doing is to wait for kd to come off a screen and pass him the ball or he just goes in the corner and watch, the man doesnt want to be part of the game in the last mins of the game in any way"
&gt;James Harden went from one of the best offensive players of all time under the old rules to a fringe allstar under the new rules.  Can we please get past 4 games. Let's see the whole season and then we can have these overreactions.
James Harden went from one of the best offensive players of all time under the old rules to a fringe allstar under the new rules.  Trae and Luka are both fine under the new rules.
It's like the inverse of clear path rule. Dumb as fuck but whatever. Meanwhile James harden still traveling like a motherfucker.
the issues that come at the rim when James Harden has to be your 4 defensively in help defense
"The calls were definitely a plus before, but James Harden is top 5 with or without them"
Bro do you even hear yourself?  &amp;#x200B;  Not complaining about foul calls because hed rather get back on defense?  im convinced youre not entirely sure who james harden is
James harden…WAKE UP OUT OF YOUR SLEEP
I’ve seen enough James Harden is officially washed unfortunately
"It's interesting to see how the rule changes affected the flow of the game. Don't get me wrong, it actually flows so god damn better. I agree those fouls are annoying and take away from potentially explosive highlights, but I also don't have to watch guys jumping at someone hunting for fouls or James Harden ""getting shot"" at every other possession. Let's see if they keep at it - seems like they will, and that will affect a lot of the game dynamics during the playoffs. Less time stoppage during the playoffs already sounds amazing."
James Harden never choked that bad. He always has a few great games then shoots 5/30 with 9 turnovers half the series. He wins you some and loses you some in the playoffs. Lebron pretty much just disappeared that finals and took a back role seat.
I don’t remember James Harden being better then that in the Finals Or even the playoffs
&gt;James Harden is a better scorer than Lebron.  LeBron's resilience in the playoffs says otherwise.
James Harden is a flopping weasel who relies on free throws and cheating.
"He's not even close to the goat scorer, c'mon. James Harden is a better scorer than Lebron."
James Harden wants more whistles.   We all want things that aren't happening.
Idk what I watched but this just proves to me that a healthy James Harden will be blowing by defenders more easier when you see how effortless his hesi can create space on a elite defender in Thybulle.
"[Curry being Curry, and Harden doing things like this.](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1127057378451644418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1127057378451644418%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldenstateofmind.com%2F2019%2F5%2F11%2F18566495%2Fnba-2019-warriors-rockets-game-6-steph-curry-james-harden-chris-paul-klay-thompson-kevin-durant)"
He doesn't have a flair. Did you really look in his comment history to find out who he was a fan of just because he doesn't like James Harden?
"The counting stats were good but not enough clutch scoring and too many turnovers in key moments. He had some bad turnovers in the 4th in game 6 (in houston), including this one with 1:30 left: [link](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1127057378451644418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1127057378451644418%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldenstateofmind.com%2F2019%2F5%2F11%2F18566495%2Fnba-2019-warriors-rockets-game-6-steph-curry-james-harden-chris-paul-klay-thompson-kevin-durant)"
"CP3 was pretty bad. No Ariza or Mbah a Moute (Warriors always had better depth), remember Morey had to trade a pick so they could get rid of James Ennis so they wouldn't be BARELY over the tax. Harden didn't hit his normal free throws in game 6. And the Warriors still had Kevin Durant for 4.5 games."
"&gt; Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  Rudy Gobert is top 1 lol"
"- Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  - Kyle Kyzma is top 5 in RPG (rebounds per game), higher than his former teammate Anthony Davis.   - Kevin Porter Jr. is averaging 6.3 turnovers per game to start the season, by far the league leader in this category."
Anthony Davis is washed up and lives at the free throw line.   There are certain players that get special treatment in the league and he is one of them. James Harden KD AD LeBron Giannis Luka Probs Dame
James Harden
"Alright then a lot of guys aren’t winners. Chris Paul, Dame, James Harden, Westbrook. They’re still great players tho, going down in the history books"
"Maybe this isnt too unpopular, but James Harden has never won a game that mattered. Most overrated player in league history"
"In short, James Harden manipulated the refs for several years"
"James Harden was averaging like 35ppg a little over a year ago. And this team still has KD, who many consider to be the best player in the NBA. And even without Kyrie, the Nets will have an amazing shot to make the finals and win the title.   Kyrie (an all-time great, who hit arguably the greatest shot ever) is just willingly sitting at home because he's stupid, completely physically healthy, and the Nets don't even need him to remain at the top. That's how stacked this Nets team is."
"I remember when Kuzma came into the league and had a unique style. He used a jump hook and played like a 1970s PF. It was pretty cool to watch. I saw his highlights from the other night where he scored like 30, and now he’s just doing the James Harden step-back 3 that everyone does. It’s a good move, but it’s boring when everyone does it."
Markelle Fultz will be James Harden with elite defense
&gt; James Harden: 3 FTA  Absolutely delicious. Love to see it.
Someone hide James Harden III
"Thank fuck LeBron is actually willing to play offball some, unlike James Harden."
"&gt;A professional would have said he’d work hard on his shot over the summer and come back better next year.  He says in the post game presser after the series that he had to work on everything including his free throws.  Why is that you ignorant fucks don't acknowledge that?  It didn't help that he gave the media a sound bite right afterwards but he did admit that he needed to do better. Picking on him for the things he don't do or don't do well is already really fucking stupid of you and petty enough as is. Don't add ignorance to the list. At least make an effort to be informed.  And don't bullshit any of us saying you knew that because at that point you would just come across as a liar. I absolutely despise people who perpetuate false narratives or lies. None of you would like it if others did it to you, right?  Lack of common sense and empathy on this board reached new lows this summer. If it weren't for Simmons opening up about his mental health being in a bad place right now, y'all would still be ripping him, even if its a tired topic at this point.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Instead he decided to sabatoge the team that has supported him throughout.  Where was the support before it became apparent Morey couldn't get a suitable or favorable trade for him the two months before that?   Even if Simmons is using mental health awareness as leverage (and honestly shame on him because I've personally been affected with my own struggles of depression), it actually shows just how much his FO really gives a shit. Realize all the hit pieces stopped for the past few days, right? It would be poor optics (not just from our FO but for the reporters thats been covering the entire ordeal) to continue to rag on him after that. For bloody sake my guy, use your goddamn brain.    Maybe Simmon's teammates care, I wouldn't doubt that. But the FO? To them, the players are just pieces. And this has been shown time and time and time again throughout the years and the fans STILL eat whatever is released. Ironically this situation could have been avoided had the Sixers acted significantly sooner but instead they waited until all the negative feelings fester with Simmons as the target, completely removing them from any responsibility.   Only problem is that this time, Simmons decided to be spiteful and I don't blame him. Why the fuck should he be cooperative with our front office after everything that had transpired? In between Morey's seemingly ridiculous requests and the crazy summer he's had, there is no way he was going to respond the same way he did last season when James Harden to the 76ers was a real possibility. Simmons doesn't need to worry about his trade value because his value is already set. You think GMs don't know why the situation is what it is? They know EXACTLY why. Its not on Simmons to convince other FOs, its on the Sixers FO to convince the GMs.   So now the Sixers have to wait a bit longer and hope Simmons comes back, plays well enough so that Morey can have more breathing room to negotiate a possible trade later this season. It does serve Simmon's interest to do so but like I said, organizations in the league already know his worth. Unless he breaks and starts splashing from deep or the line (would require to actually try to finish around the rim with convinction, he's too mediocre in that area, for how athletically gifted he is), they know exactly what they're getting in return. If he really did kill his trade value as so many of you claim, we still wouldn't be getting offers. The problem is what we want in return. Simmons as he is was never worth the king's ransom in Harden, Beal or Lillard. He's a legitimately good player but Harden is an all time great and Lillard is on his way there and Morey's offers were just... laughable. (if the reports are to be believed at least)  I want Simmons gone as much as his haters do but our FO don't deserve a fucking pass for how they handled the entire ordeal. Wanna act like players don't have feelings and make an absolute circus of ourselves this off season? Go for it but good on Simmons for sticking it to'em the last month. A little more working in silence and a lot more less of feeding everything to the media in an attempt to make Simmons fold under the pressure might work better for us next time.  Lastly, fuck you."
I thought dion waiters would be like James harden.
"""Is it time to be concerned about James Harden? Forget the hamstring injury that cost him his entire offseason I think the rule changes that turned him into a role player. He's nothing without free throws!"""
"Counter argument: James Harden is even more overrated and is only discussed due to astronomical usage and exploitation of rules which allow traveling, double dribbling, and foul-baiting."
"When I think of James Harden running in to people and getting calls, I think of Poeltl. Poor Jak was doing everything possible to get out of Harden's way in their first matchup when Jak was a rookie and not fouling him at all, but Harden would just jump into him and start walking to the free throw line practically before the whistle was blown. It was sick."
"Being defended by Mikal does that. Same thing just happened to James Harden. That said, I fully expect Steph to exact his revenge later this week."
"They are a part of the post but they arent the main topic. If after that win streak i said, James Harden and Chris Paul led the Rockets to a 17 game win-streak would that be wrong? No. There is just no reason to include James Harden in a post about Chris Paul"
"&gt; Obviously James Harden was an integral part of that team but this post is about Chris Paul not the 2017-2018 Rockets.  Bruh what? The 17-18 Houston Rockets are literally part of your post.  It's not my fault you said he ""led"" 3 different franchises when he pretty clearly wasn't leading that Rockets squad in the regular season"
Teams can be led by more than one player. Obviously James Harden was an integral part of that team but this post is about Chris Paul not the 2017-2018 Rockets.
"This sub is so annoying lol. Idk why I keep coming on here, I must be in some way attached. Like didn’t he barely play any basketball over the summer because of his hamstring? And aren’t hamstring injuries notoriously difficult for athletes to deal with?   Like I get that Harden benefitted from the old foul rules but anyone with a pair of eyes can see that even without the foul baiting, the man is a once in a generation scorer and facilitator. Doesn’t he deserve the benefit of the doubt, coming off injury in the first 1/4 of the season?   It’s almost like people are trying to speak “Harden being washed” into existence because they got nothing better to do. And this is crazy to me because I’m not even a James Harden fan, I’ve just seen what he’s capable of in the past"
Welcome to Mikal jail you can take a seat next to James Harden

"Bruh strong dudes are literally supposed to be the ones getting FTs lmao how is this man a ref  Giannis, Embiid, Butler, even James Harden is able to absorb contract since he's built"
"I’m sure over the course of a very long career Westbrook has been attributed similar rebounds he didn’t deserve. It’s not like tipping the ball is automatically a rebound. There’s an assumption of control. Just seems pointless to correct, especially when important stuff, like a James harden dunk that was not counted a basket in a game the rockets lost by 2, is met with “tough shit” by the nba"
James Harden: So I took it personally
Except James Harden has looked like a random all star this season. The only “pretending” that’s happening is coming from people that act like this is the same Harden from 2-3 years ago.

You just gonna ignore that James harden type offense was actually incredible and would have won a chip if it wasn't for the warriors lol
"Joe Harris is out. Claxton is out. LMA is decent. Injuries to key players and Kyrie not playing is hurting their depth. They really aren't scrubs like you make them out to be. If Harden can just play like James Harden, there bench won't even matter in the regular season."
"Hmm... The top 5 guys were   1) Blake Griffin   2) Hasheem Thabeet   3) James Harden   4) Tyreke Evans   5) Ricky Rubio  I gotta think maybe he jumps to 3, but Blake was so electric as a prospect I don't see him losing that spot."

"Children cried when Harden got traded to the Nets. We thought we were past the Warriors era of ""damn this one team is clearly the best."" That trade happened and it instilled fear in our hearts.    Kyrie isn't there, and they just look sort of human. They are still a great team and a championship contender. They just aren't whooping everyone's ass day in and day out like people expected them to do.    It's probably likely people are just getting their jabs in while they can. Once kyrie gets his jabs in, and Claxton/Harris/the real James harden come back... It's not gonna look good.    Knicks gonna win tonight tho"
"I wouldn't say over. They are still a focal point of a team.   As long as the floor spacing and rules don't change. Pgs will continue to dominant.   The only position that took a huge swing of things was the shooting guard position. Went from Ray Allen ,Tracy McGrady , kobe, Vince Carter, dwade, Allen iverson , Reggie Miller to just   klay Thompson and James harden were the only consistent shooting guards.  As of writing this. There isn't a dominant shooting guard anymore a team is built around"
2017 you can argue he should've been better...then again is MDA supposed to do something about James Harden being outplayed by Jonathon Simmons ?

"14th? That’s bad to you? Just, middle of the road for a first option?  Yeah I’m sure playing basketball did “contribute to his demise”, it’s also what he got paid for. That’s his job. He wasn’t James Harden or Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic in this bitch."
"In 2009 he played 7 games and shot 36%. In 2010 he played 5 games and shot 40%. That's hardly a sample size to go by.  He may put more emphasis on the 3 point shot but there is hardly any guarentee that he would be anything more than 35% shooter. Westbrook, AD and Lebron all try to be better but they can't or aren't able to sustain it for someone like James.  Kawhi effiecincy is up there with KD/Steph and even trumps them at moments. He is also a DPOY when he feels it. Wade's playmaking hardly cuts that gap. In a League with KD, Curry, Lebron, Giannis and Harden - Leonard was considered the best at certain moments. I don't think that Wade could do so."
James harden not coming back wdym
The narrative probably started with Harden’s [awful performance in the 2011 finals](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1231796-james-harden-disappearing-act-costs-thunder-nba-finals.amp.html) but… that was a decade ago and the media should probably update their story
Don’t tell James harden
We'll take James Harden for him
The James Harden comparisons from last year were correct.
I certainly don't love him but I definitely don't hate Russell Westbrook and James Harden like I used to
"Wild how a roster of KD, James Harden, Joe Harris, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills being the 1 seed by one game over the Wizards is considered impressive this year lol"
He's shooting like he's playing on a James Harden team.
James Harden punching the air rn
"I just feel for Silas coming in thinking he's got James Harden playing for him, and now he's more likely to hit 100 losses before he gets his 25th win."
This strategy is like defending James Harden by putting your hands on your back to avoid fouling him.
"It absolutely was. Take a look at how that team performed when Curry was off the floor. You sound like a casual with your point about James Harden, talking about name value rather than actual performance.  Stephs team had a pretty disgusting net rating of -4.7 without him on the floor. Hardnes team in 2013 was 6.4. 2014 it was -0.5. In 2015 it was -2.0, etc. Historic may be a stretch but it was a very bad team"
That’s my point lol. And it wasn’t historical. James Harden took a team to the playoffs where Lin was his best teammate lol. To see his supporting cast was historical bad points to not knowing history lol.   Also you can have quality teammates who don’t fit. So it isn’t just about how good the players are.
&gt; There is a glaring lack of decent defence in Brooklyn.   Nets are top 10 defense in the league lol. Their defense has actually improved from last season and last season's worse defense almost sent the Bucks packing without all 3 players.  The offense has went down unfortunately. James Harden not playing as well as he did and of course Kyrie sitting on his ass.
I mean they have one of the best regular season players of all time in James Harden no matter how he’s playing this year and they also still have Kevin Durant who can basically make everything out of nothing
I do.    I have money on KD as MVP &amp; love James Harden but I just really feel like they need more on the bench and I’m not sure how they get it.
Fuck James Harden
Because James harden looks like a player on your local softball team and is playing basketball about as well as the same guy
"different players can succeed in different situations and teams need different things. nets regularly run  a rotation of mills - bembry - brown - james johnson- millsap. We could swap mills out and put more of his time with harden and durant, and put kemba there to take a couple pull up mid rangers and try to do something in that time.   I am under no delusion that kemba is a good player. but our guard rotation is virtually non existent of ball handling right now. patty cant really do it, harden is our only point guard on the rsoter right now."
"""Is it time to be legitimately concerned about James Harden!?"""
No kyrie and the corpse of James harden
"Ok other scenario then.  You don’t offer him the contract, you then have some internal beef. He balls out and continues second half all star play, doesn’t get hurt.  Due to that lowball offer, he leaves and becomes a James harden level player. You lose a 23 year old 6’11 wing that you drafted 13th as a small market for almost nothing.   All signs pointed to him being an all star someday, this is hindsight at its finest"

Trae wouldn’t get it so bad if he didn’t remind us so much of Harden. And Harden had pissed people off for years before Trae came along and reminded us very much of James. Trae inherited some bitterness towards those that are great master manipulators of defenders and refs. Trae has so much in his bag I’m glad he’s now gonna get more love
Trae is Harden whereas Ben is Draymond. I love Draymond but he wouldn’t be an all star over James lmao.
"There isnt any valid argument. People saying jokic giannis kd are at his level are biased. I dont know how many ring he need to win, how many record to broke, how many teammates he needs to boost his level….  Is a gravity machine like the league has never seen. A fucking black hole. Steph plus 4 random nba players make a team. Giannis with 4 randoms? He cant shoot, is a beast is both ends but he doesnt make everyone better, he needs shooters around, steph doesnt need anything just nba quality players around and he makes them look like fucking all stars.  Some dumb people answered in that topic: place jokic kd giannis with klay… please he is not even playing. And as good as klay is, how good is his leagacy without steph? Imagine klay on pistons rockes hornets…  Steph makes looney from average to good, makes poole from random to 3p god, made harrison barnes look like all star, makes draymon from a complete all around player to all star ( draymon in any other team isnt all star in his life) and makes klay from all star level to superstar level.  Also, changed the game, the way its played. Jordan was the best on his era. Kobe on his era. James on his era. But who changed the rules and evolved the game of basketball? Chamberlain and steph, the difference is steph did in a more professional and harder era. His only problem is he is athletic but not by nba standars and is not very tall so people thinks is an average dude you can find in the streets that just shoot pretty well and cant defend ehem ehem… and with tons of different stats and metrics people try to claim he is not the best and usually forgets 1 thing: that game is about who SCORES 1 point more, not who is better 2way player, or who rebound more, or who can dunk oreos better or more easily because is a freak god, is who is better at scoring. Basketball is an offensive game where offense always have the advantage over defense , assuming both are equaliy good at his respective roles. And i saw a lot of god scores like kobe iverson james durant harden… but nobody generates an 5 man offense on his own as steph, just by breathing on the court with his insane range and gravity is making 4 players better. Someoe said the same about messi. He walks instead run and still is positive for his team. Steph is the most underrated player of the nba by far. And got robbed 2 mvps. Iguodala didint play better than him. And kd had better stats but steph generated all pressure and gravity and is the piece that makes the warriors unbeatable. You cant change hin for any player. Any other top player in his team and he barely makes playoffs on the west. His teammates except klay who didnt play in 2 years are at most average. Tell me giannis or kd could make wiggins look good? Please……They just look godly cuz they play with the best player of his era who draws 3 players defending at half court.   He changed basketball"
"Who has better constructed teams in the east?   Brooklyn? They basically have KD and James Harden that plays better compared to the ECF last year, but is nowhere near his MVP worthy form. Other than those two, they are really thin. Of course, if Kyrie comes back the offense won't be a problem.    Heat? Great culture, balanced team and Robinson doesn't even shoot well by his standards. Defensively they are great, no doubt about that.    Bucks? Yeah, injuries happened and they should be back near the top in the future.    Am I missing teams that could be considered better constructed than the Warriors, Suns, Utah?   Mavs aren't at their best yet, but they play winning basketball. Clippers miss one of the best players in the league. Lakers sure have their fair share of problems, but they have LBJ and AD. Denver got fucked by injuries but otherwise their roster is pretty solid top to bottom."
Curry is playing at a different level compared to the last 3 years. One of the biggest surprises is how well his teammates are doing.   KD is at the top of the East and even James harden has struggled this year. Lebron consistently took poor teams late into the playoffs.   Giannis took Brook Lopez to the championship.   I’m not doubting Curry can put up numbers on a bad team. I’m talking about wins.
James Harden is about 100x more insufferable than Curry.
He picked up the ball while taking a step back.  What is there to even argue?  This is 100x less annoying that what James Harden was doing with a double step back.
James Harden isn’t going to hold KD back from winning MVP. Harden doesn’t have that kind of respect in the media any more.  I’d be more worried about injury and Steph being better preventing KD from MVP than Harden.
"as long as james harden is on the court, KD will not win MVP. don’t delude yourself"
"tbf Wilt records are more absurd then Steph's. 50ppg, 27 rpg, most assists averaged by a center ever. Steph is a marvel but even James Harden came close to beating his 3 point record in a season."
"I expect harden to adapt and still put up a good season, probably not as good as his others but still good nonetheless. He’s simply too talented not to. This is James fucking harden we are talking about."
If the Nets finish ahead of the Warriors it would mean James Harden is himself again. He and KD would take votes off of each other.
It will never be a Lebron like carry when you have James harden as your second player. Lebron had Kevin love in 2018. Let that sink in.
&gt;James Harden  &gt;Less help  Ok
"People never seem to consider by far the simplest and most reasonable explanation which is that James Harden is legitimately fouled a whole lot. Especially considering the rather hilarious alternative that he’s apparently the only NBA player in history to figure out how to bamboozle the refs every time. What a gift.  Maybe the big guard who is one of the best ball-handlers we’ve ever seen and has the greatest step back we’ve ever seen is actually very difficult to guard without fouling. No? That’s a step(back) too far, I guess."
"So what you're saying is, they need to just ban James Harden. You've got my vote"
"As much as I love CP3 James Harden ""peak"" was leagues above CP3 and harden just as an overall player is just flatout better"
James Harden special
Peak James Harden is (was?) ridiculously good. I think CP3’s longevity is what really stands out
He gets calls when he gets breathed on. Big James Harden.
"&gt; Lmao. Trae? Harden is a better playmaker than all of those. CP3 is a better passer but you would rather want Harden running your offense than CP3.  That’s true though. The best version of James is a better option, I mean shit they were on the same team a few years ago and that was the case   &gt;  Have you seen the Nets play this year at all? They're very stagnant, and Harden's capability to run the offense is part of the fault. Durant constantly bails them out. Even he said that he's often confused regarding what he should do on   Just curious, what was your thought process during the 19 semi finals?"
"Lol, had to reply one last time because this comment is a perfect, hilarious encapsulation of just how sad your life is.  ""Tapping out"" - You believe you've won ... something ... because the people you argue with/cry to have a life outside of constantly commenting on Reddit.  Congrats buddy, you're the champion when it comes to having literally nothing to do other than defending James Harden on social media!  You won!"
shit Embiid even said it he's the James harden of Center
Nets fans in here posting shit like this cause James harden is playing ass lol this stat isn’t flattering but he’s playing better than this alone shows. He’s not shooting the jumpers well but he’s also not shooting as much of them. You guys are corny
Can we acknowledge that James Harden still almost has a 60% ts
"People go after guys like Trae Young or James Harden, but Embiid and Butler have the softest whistle in the league and have had it for year."
"Sorry, my thoughts were poorly worded.  I was more trying to say that I understand that not every post can be as high quality as the analysis of [James Harden performances in cities with the best strip clubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/), but I do think that we can aim a little higher than a binary discussion of who's better.  Ranking players isn't that deep, which is kind of my point.    But also might I should lighten up ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"Hey I hope you're doing ok. I genuinely mean this. Your comments are a bit...off. Are you really this emotionally affected by James Harden? If things are rough for you, I hope they get better soon."
Why do I feel like James Harden is gonna get another elbow to the face next time they play boston...?

The reason he can’t do that shit anymore is cause people aren’t afraid to defend him these days. Why? Cause he can’t do his best offensive move: insurance fraud. That hamstring injury has had more than enough time to heal and yes he does actually seem to be out of shape. But mostly it’s because for the first time in forever James harden is facing people’s actual best defensive efforts instead of a water down version so that he doesn’t get them into foul trouble.
Playing like James Harden is an insult?  lol
Is that James Harden or Westbrook? Can’t tell the difference
"I feel like they'd be perfectly compatible. I picture a completely baked James and Kyrie just sitting around and shooting the shit, and Harden just eats up every word of Kyrie's nonsense cuz he's high as fuck  Just seems like a good duo tbh"
James Harden is ~~fat~~ *phat*.
Makes one trade for James Harden and suddenly the “Nets” fan is out of pocket.   Lillard averaged close to 30 last season asshat
"How did houston give him eberytjing? Is that just repeating what you heard screamed on ESPN rather then Are you aware of the actual facts.   Afrrr the 2018 season Tillman’s first offseason where we got one game an an injury possibly from the finals, had a top rated defense.  We had our bird rights to every player  We had mid level  We had trade exceptions worth over ten million  And we still had our picks.  We didn’t use any of those, We replaced ariza who was our bet and glue guy who actually kept harden and Paul in aligned, ( Here is Chris Paul recently on a podcast :  “People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”)  There’s a reason Mimi pay haslem even thought he doesn’t play, culture matters  Im fine with replacement but get a proper one; especially when your in contention. Rockets signed James ennis at a minimum, then traded him while he was in our thin rotation. For a 2nd round swap.  We used two first round picks And multiple seconds over two year to...get under the tax, that’s not a saving that provides cap flexibility for the gm, no wins for the players fans or coaches. Just savings for the owner.  I’m assuming Your saying harden pushed the trade   Here is from the Lowe post ““That trade was made because Tilman Fertitta wanted it made. He thought Chris Paul’s contract was the worst he had ever seen in business or sports.  And because James Harden wanted it made. Obviously there was a personality clash. I still believe that, if necessary, they could’ve still managed that situation, alot of people throughout the organization thought that.”  Daryl confirmed that while harden wanted Westbrook when he told him most likely we’ll rebuild as is with this squad he was fine.  Ok fine, fake news? How about Tillman’s mouth himself ?:  I was in Europe, and so I was six or seven hours ahead of them. So I’m talking at 2, 3, 4 in the morning. And we just decided to do it. They ran different statistics by me.  My basketball ops [operations] got maybe a little weak at the end, and I just said, ‘We’re doing this. We are going to make the change. We’re going to go after it and roll the dice. We’re going to find that 5 percent.’  The one thing I believe you do in business, and you do in basketball, is you never sit still. You always keep it exciting.  That’s from Collin cowherd.   So if you think while harden was playing high minutes useage and games in a time when people load manage, leading league in assists then points over four season of a crazy marathon and whxih take focus and grit on another level against elite nba talent and during that all he wanted to do was safe the owner money based on the FACTS above?  Look at Daryls trading history before and after Tillman.  The trajectory and dominos started wit Tillman  That said I’m glad the drama ended. Rockets have two nice pieces and are hoping there picks will be valuable hopefully in half a decade almost. It’s a tough rebuild but good for stone finding young talent as a silver lining.  Nets got two years just like clippersz heat didn’t get it done in the forest year, it’s reasonable. So Clippers gotta get it done this year, Nets have this and next.  Will be exciting to see"
"i mean i love the salt, but don’t worry, i get your frustration too. must really suck having to go through your post history and change all your “Miami is a contender” comments into “Miami is a pretender” comments.    y’all are worse than the Knicks now, right? 1.5 losses from top three lottery seeding? and now you’ve even whiffed on James Harden, your only chance of saving this mess of a season?   sheeeesh, must be a tough time to be a fan. i can totally understand why you’re lashing out. but don’t worry bud, at least Tyler Zero is here for you lmfaoooooo 🤡   ...oh wait, he was ruled out for spasms? yikes. tough break."
"The full list ahead of Dončić:  O. Robertson, 181  R. Westbrook, 150  M. Johnson, 138  J. Kidd, 107  L. James, 95  W. Chamberlain, 78  L. Bird, 59  J. Harden, 46   N. Jokić, 46  F. Lever, 43  B. Cousy, 33  R. Rondo, 32   J. Havlicek, 31  B. Simmons, 30  G. Hill, 29  *L. Dončić, 28  M. Jordan, 28"
You say that like James harden has a history of winning and coming up big when his team needs him
"Hell, even Kyrie and James Harden would be a hilarious conversation. Harden literally closed his MVP acceptance speech by saying “Swag” and walking off. Kyrie would close his speech with some confusing anecdote or something."
James Harden giving hope for fat guys all around the world
"Woods is special, tate is fun. But that team was so thin, it was not a contender. It has the marks of a chip on a shoulder team that surprises people, but in playoffs the depth and talent and harden knows that.   He’s seen his owner cut costs roster staff during his prime and as he said after the gm ledt 25 million on the table after he spent three years rather then using the assets he collected to win, jumping loopholes to save the owner money EVERy trade deadline   The coahc and associate head coach Jeff bzdelik went and ran else where for assistant jobs without even negotiations again with Tillman after he duped them the first time.  All while Tillman lied in public when saying getting under the tax was an”accident”  Titles take depth, role players and any one who isn’t “worth the contract” can make a difference  -raptors paid 50 million salary for two years of a 34 year old Marc gasol. - jr and Tristan getting crazy Cavs contracts. -Robert horry in his 20s and 30s typically inconsistent and going throw motions, but hits big shots. Like fisher, kerr, paxon None of them would be known as guys who will take you over the top yet year in and out the margins of winning are so close every bit of talent makes the difference.  They blame harden but the glue guy for harden and Paul was ariza, here it is from Paul’s mouth :  ““People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”  If you watch too much ESPN/tmz, you might think basketball is won and lost 1-1, that’s how the marketing structure to works and it sells, but it’s about cohesion and the stars know it and don’t want these owners Making 100 million on their backs while cheap if our on the roster and staff and then they also get the blame while over performing individually. Reason pg left Indiana, ad left New Orleans, reason kobe almost left and demanded a trade from lakers, reason Michael Jordan demanded help late 80s.  The narrative to these blog boys is different, but the guy so many respect in Jimmy butler   https://www.google.com/amp/s/larrybrownsports.com/basketball/jimmy-butler-guard-james-harden/487192%3famp  That’s why the players gave their mvp even though everyone finds his fouls frustrating while media gave it to Steph that yeae(steph deserves his share too)"
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
James Harden even came close to the quadruple-double with his 9 turnovers.
"That could have been James Harden. Thank you, Sixers."
"James Harden is more of a cancer than Kyrie, come on now."
I don't think there's a single person on the face of the planet that ever thought that James Harden was the most athletic player in the NBA
0) it’s James fucking Harden
"""My life a quibi""  \- James Harden"
James Harden looking positively scary in Nets blue.

Remember????  Actually read the articles and realize how there was nothing there other than speculation.  I get it, you actually believed you were in it. You actually believed you were the favorites. You even believed that there was already a deal.  But the fact is the sixers got played as a leverage but were never genuinely on the table to begin with, which is what the Pompey article said.   It's like you read stories that the Pope died, then newer stories came out saying he's alive but you're here still arguing ""HE'S DEADDD DO YOUR RESEARCH"""
"Even if pascal was doing well from the beginning of the season, I'm not sure we had the pieces to get James Harden and still contend. I don't think lowry fred and harden are... even good tbh."
Are you seriously saying Kyrie Irving is more ball dominant than James Harden? Kyrie was 22nd in time of possession in his most recent healthy season and Harden ranks first in that stat consistently

"Yep. The New Jersey ""2019/20 Los Angeles Clippers"" Nets. Starring James ""Pandemic P"" Harden, Kevin ""Kawhi Leonard"" Durant, and Kyrie ""Pat Bev"" Irving."
"I think we only make that comparison because of the term “owners” in the league. If a routine physics was given ( and probably is) for Olympic athletes who are expected, and claim to be by virtue of applying/trying out, then it wouldn’t seem as slave like. As much as I believe players should have the ability to govern their own legacy and futures, the recent James harden situation makes me a bit more sentimental to organizations that’s are trying to succeed as a smaller market so I’ve got mixed emotions."
"&gt;  so how exactly were we overvaluing them when the rockets thought the same thing just tilman said nah because we have morey?  Oh the problem here is that you're so sure this is what happened  Are you one of those people who only read the title of [this reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ky490f/pompey_the_sixers_thought_they_had_a_deal_for/)?  Because this is the content of that Pompey article:  Title: &gt;Did the Houston Rockets use the Sixers to secure the Brooklyn Nets’ best deal for James Harden?  Content:  &gt;After analyzing the information surrounding the Harden trade, yes, the Rockets did play the Sixers.  &gt;Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta did not want to make a deal with the Sixers due to Morey leaving Houston to become the Sixers president of basketball operations, as reported. And if he made a deal, Fertitta was only going to make it for Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal.   The last sentence is hilarious. Reminds me of the fans that are hesitant at the thought of giving up Maxey too to get ""a guy who insists the game revolves around him and has never put it together in the playoffs"", as one sixers fan put it."
So lebron made such a strong lakers team that harden felt the need to be traded so this mri was done  espn: lebron james saves caris levert's life
James Harden is the best player on that team don’t @ me
James “Reverse Shallow Hal” Harden
Who calls KD and Harden Kevin and James?
27 straight missed 3s in game 7... as i said KD shows up when it matters... It's a fact that James Harden doesn't.
"Dominant personality isn’t what I’d call it. He’s the loudest, yes.  Point guard is just a thing that shows up on the box score when you play with James Harden."
 Demarcus Cousins and James Harden
"Uplifting/empowering African-American athletes, let them be a symbol for progress and the good that shall come.  Kids, look at James Harden...  I guess I point them to Bill Russell instead."
Like opposite James Harden
It is sports.  A competition.  James Harden softer here than when he folds in the playoffs.
James Harden got an ass that will make angels cry
"True—James, Davis, Caruso vs Durant and harden...  Not scared of the nets anymore  Also fun fact—Caruso is in the top 5 in 3pt% league wide! KCP #2"
"They weren't willing to send Herro and a few picks/other young players for James Harden, that's a start."
"Seriously, fuck tilman fertitface for trading Harden to a team with KD and Kyrie on it, in essence personally creating a super team.   In order to spite Morey, he done fucked the parity of the East. Oh well, its hella fun to watch Brooklyn this game, and since Raps r likely not contending this year, I'm okay for at least 1 year of this Brooklyn squad just dominating shit. Playoffs are gonna be hella fun to see if any team can stop them.  I'd even venture to say they don't necessarily even need Kyrie. Just KD by himself makes a team a contender, then you add fkin James Harden to it?   If they can stay healthy, its gonna be tough to beat them"
KD and James Harden (and Vuc and Ross) were all lighting it up but Bill Kennedy was the most entertaining person on the floor tonight lol
James Harden and light blue name a more suitable duo
James Harden is ironman
DWade’s tweet: *Let’s talk about this narrative: James Harden looks happy and there’s no price tag for that feeling. Could he have handle things better. YES! but couldn’t we all. Im happy for this black man* 👏🏾
You can’t objectively look at James Harden and say he’s pass-first.
"Yeah, that is one report. Here's another which claims that despite that report, the Sixers were genuinely in the running until the very end. it also includes a tweet from Rafael Stone's wife disputing that, for what its worth. https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/14/report-rockets-owner-tilman-fertitta-was-adamant-about-not-trading-james-harden-to-76ers/"
"Lol, every team this year except for maybe the Lakers have red flags, that's nothing special. The difference is is that this team has enough talent to offset those red flags.   What I saw was a doughier James Harden and Kevin Durant mesh impressively well considering the fact they have yet to practice with each other. You really can't draw any conclusions from the first game, especially considering their missing an all-nba point guard."
Holy shiiiit! Seems like KD and James Harden played on the same team before.
"Oh yeah, James Harden is fucking good at basketball."

"Fucking hell, I can’t believe we didn’t trade for James fucking Harden because of Tyrese Maxey"
Kevin Durant and James Harden are the best duo in the NBA. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the second best duo in the NBA. James Harden and Kyrie Irving are the third best duo in the NBA.   The Brooklyn Nets have too much talent. Would not be surprised if they go 16-0 in the playoffs. The Brooklyn Nets are very fun to watch.
James Harden and impressive debuts. I will now commit seppuku.
"They were talking about James and Kyrie working together. Talent-wise, it was a never a question. That much talent, it's hard to fail...but someone is going to sacrifice and many in the media said that they didn't think Kyrie or Harden would want to sacrifice. That was their perspective."
James Harden is an amazing player
"Wow, shout out to James Harden for saving dude’s life"
I hate James Harden with a fiery passion but it would be nice to see someone compete with the Lakers this year rather than Lebron getting another lay down title from some eastern team that has no business being there to begin with.
James Harden is pretty good at basketball
Josh Boone walked so James Harden could run
"This is why when superstars the level of guys like James Harden get traded, the team that gets the superstar always wins."
"Harden really just walked on this team, no practice, and instantly became the best passer. KD and others got so many clean looks off James today. Truly incredible. Can't wait till kai is back.  Not all shine though. Team defence is something that needs to be fixed very very soon. Orlando(and many other teams) was consistently getting clean looks off screens early into the shot clock and Vucevic was having his way with everyone in the paint. Honestly could not see us dispatching Boston or Milwaukee in a playoff series with the way the defence has been playing as of late.  All that said, we finished strong. Gg Orlando"
James Harden and Kevin Durant are good at basketball. That is all.
James Harden forcing this trade saved a mans life. Kawhi forcing a trade got the Raptors a ring and AD forcing a trade gave Zion the most possible help for any young star. Stars forcing trades is both good for the league and saves lives.
The world is gonna learn why James Harden is a top 3 player in the league this year. Stop sleeping on this man 😤   P.S. KD is also top 3
"I love how the media has to act like James harden isn't going to make the nets better, like chill lol"
James Harden 32/12/14 triple double. Kevin Durant with 42. BROOKLYN STAND UP. WE OUT HERE.

James Harden
James Harden can play wayyyy better. Nets fans in for a treat :(

Reminder the sixers chose Tyrese Maxey over James Harden

Y’all forgot who James Harden is lol
Damn James Harden looks homeless.  Looks good though.
yeah we don’t have kevin durant and james harden
Not Kevin Durant or James Harden but Bruce Brown with the dagger 3 lol
Steve Nash is thinking about the long term.  Playoffs and beyond.  He knows Harden has a reputation for disappearing in big games due to fatigue.  He expects his squad to make a deep run and wants to make sure James has his legs at the biggest moment.
Bruh imagine if our best players were in the start the fourth quarter so that Vuc didn't have to drag us from an 8 point deficit against James Harden and freaking Kevin Durant.  I'd want Cliff fired if a better option existed.
James Harden switched teams and it looks like he's wearing the same jersey as last game
Hey guys that James Harden guy is pretty good at offense where did he come from
"James harden was a Rocket a few days ago, wasnt he?"
James Harden man...
I forgot how good teams are when you give James Harden good players lol
James mf Harden
James fucking Harden. y'all disrespect him way too much
JAMES FUCKING HARDEN IM GONNA COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
https://thesixersense.com/2021/01/13/sixers-rumors-james-harden-philadelphia-over-brooklyn/amp/
James Harden may have indirectly saved LeVert's life
James Harden is perfect for Steve Nash type offense.
2 rebounds and 3 turnovers away from a debut quad double. James Harden is such a don.
also way better thaan james harden
It was reported by Woj that his first choice was to be sent to the Nets and that he was planning to join KD for months.  Source: https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/261177/Kevin-Durant-Very-Much-Wanted-Nets-To-Trade-For-James-Harden
way better than james harden
Will James Harden actually become liked now?  He hasn't even had a good game by his standards.
play like what? like james harden?
[James Harden seeing posts like this](https://i.imgur.com/MpvhXt5.jpg)
it is just tantalizing to think there is still a domination version of James Harden somewhere in there.. and if he wants to.. he can fuse this playmaking style with the GOAT iso echelon he displayed in Houston
Nets legend James Harden is all I know him as
Can you imagine if James Harden is *not* an All-Star? That would be bonkers.
"Imagine drummond trying to iso and put up 20 fga a game while kyrie, KD and James harden are forced to watch"
James Harden balls like a lawyer
"Somehow, we lost our GM, our coach, our second best player, and then our franchise superstar, and I’m having the most fun I’ve had watching the Rockets in 3 years.   Wall - What a fucking guy. Natural leader, makes no excuses, uses every chance he gets to gas his team up and stand up for them. I would die for John Wall.  Wood - Rockets fans knew. We knew last year at the trade deadline that C Wood was gonna be a killer. When we didn’t get him, I thought we’d really never sign him. Now he’s putting up [Giannis numbers](https://i.imgur.com/J5avEqq.jpg).  Oladipo - I was worried he didn’t wanna be here, and maybe he still doesn’t. But I can’t fucking tell. And he was talking about how much fun he’s having with this team in the postgame interview.   This whole team, top to bottom, is so fucking awesome. I loved James Harden, but I’m having fun."
"**Guards:**  Starters will probably be Beal and Kyrie (if Kyrie doesn't go AWOL again for weeks).   Trae &amp; Brown will be reserves, followed by Levine and Harden (it could go to Brogdon tho), but Harden will get a boost just because he's James fucking Harden.   **Front Court:**  I agree that Embiid, Taytum, Giannis and KD are locked in.   Reserves are a lot more interesting because there are a lot of really good frontcourt players that deserve it.   To me, Hayward, Sabonis and Bam are the most deserving after the top 4."
"Yeah. I’m as big of a Harden fan as you could have found in this sub over the last couple of years, but damn it feels so fresh to have a new squad with a new personality than “James Harden and the Rockettes”.   Team “chip on your shoulder”, “the Undraftables”, whatever you call them, I just want to get to watch them play together. No pressure for rings or awards."
The Sixers would vastly improve with CP3/Embiid.  Now that's a fucking deadly combo. I've always said this. Don't care about no James Harden or Beal to play with Joel. CP3 would take Embiid even a step further.
"&gt; Imagine had James harden actually tried with this team.   Crazy as it is, at this point I am happy he didn't - because I want to see what team chip on their shoulders has in store for us."
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of James Harden The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Nets would tell you. It’s a Rockets legend. James Harden was an MVP, so powerful and so wise he could use the ISO to influence teammates to give up on life… He had such a thirst for dribbling that he could even keep Russell Westbrook from contributing. The dark side of the ISO is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught John Wall everything he knew, then Wall killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could give others the keys to a title, but not himself."
"There’s no team in the nba that needs a playmaker less then the nets. They already have James harden, possibly the best overall playmaker in the league, along with Durant, a top 5 iso scorer and a solid playmaker, and Kyrie who’s a very good iso scorer and a pretty good playmaker. This offense should have zero issue being one of the best offenses of all time. Really all they need to do is patch the defense up into being league average and this could be a pretty unstoppable team."
Damian “James Harden” Lillard
Imagine not going after James harden cause u think Jared Allen is a dealbreaker..lol
"There’s no team trying to compete for a title that would prefer Oladipo, Allen and picks over James Harden. Come on guys!!"
Oladipo would be interesting on the nets however he is not close to as good as Harden and even if he is slightly better than Levert giving up Allen and a handful of picks is with it if it means getting another top 10 players to pair with Durant and Kyrie. Jarrett Allen is good but what he does can be replaced at a lower level by Jordan and by free agents like Dedmon or Vonleh who have had solid seasons within the past two seasons. Now that they have more depth with Shumpert and should look to pick up RHJ and MKG for more depth then a lot of their problems will go away. Another big thing other than depth is that Nash is not an amazing coach and does not stagger his star minutes as much as he should. Oladipo would be interesting on the Nets and would be a slight upgrade over Levert but is not worth the value of a James Harden player.
"lmao imagine being this butthurt/insecure about an obvious joke...   OP was very clearly being complimentary of the rockets and making light of the fact that this houston roster actually has a decent amount of talent/depth (contrary to what this sub was circlejerking about the first few weeks of the season) and if Harden had actually bought in and not made up his mind to go full on clown car circus act before he had even played a single second with this roster, they actually would have had the chance to make some real noise in the playoffs.  he was doing the whole ""wow, imagine if you were to add an MVP level player like, say, James Harden to this team, they'd be unbeatable!"" bit"
Allen asked for 4 X 90$. We couldn’t have afforded him with or without Harden after this season. We could have probably let go of Harris or Brown but JA would have then walked for nothing.   Aside from that we’re 6-2 in the games Harden has payed for us. This sub is straight clowning us tonight. And that’s fine. It was an ugly loss to the Wiz. But Harden didn’t even play. We didn’t lose that trade. If you can get James Harden you get James Harden.
"Dude should just take less per game, he shooting them like he's James Harden out here"
I blame James Harden for that  Russell Westbrook is the exact OPPOSITE of a Morey Player
On the bright side at least they didn’t give up Tyler Herro for James Harden right ?
Show me your evidence or don't put this type of misinformation out their. Either way one possession is not difference between James Harden or Bron being the best player in league
Who exactly are you talking about? Im talking about James Harden
"Who's better: James Harden, or Eric Gordon when he's having fun?"
Now its just a regular game for James Harden
SHOOT 3S HOUSTON TEXAS  not 'shoot 3s James Harden'
LeBron James Harden dribbles the ball for the entire possession and hits the stepback 3
"Relax, I love James Harden, but his exit still has left us all salty - if only momentarily."
What James Harden does himself is worth more than anything the rockets could do collectively  The team wasn’t good enough for HIM...
Imagine had James harden actually tried with this team. Oh well I hope if not us then I hope he wins a ring. And KD is cool again in my book
"&gt; ""This team isn't good enough""   - James Harden"
Trae young taking the Hitler role from James Harden at an astonishing rate
*James harden
I'm still getting used to the Nets' James Harden part
I mean that's also a criticism of James Harden as well. Does that also mean he isn't an elite shot creator? Same thing with Karl Malone. Those Hornets teams didn't come up short because of Paul not being an elite shot creator. It was because the rosters were not good enough
"Against teams over .500 the Brooklyn Nets have an ORTG that would be 2nd in the NBA &amp; a DRTG that would sit 12th.  The 7.88 Net Rating would rank 1st.  Confirms that BK’s struggles on D are largely effort based. Like Kyrie Irving &amp; James Harden, BK only defends against good teams"
"This fucking James Harden guy knowing the rules and shit, unreal"
Timberwolves if they had James Harden
So what part of basketball does James Harden need to expand on to be more valuable? Because I hope recent doesn’t just mean one guy
"How is James Harden....  \- who has had multiple different all-star teammates and a system in Houston built around him to perfectly fit his playstyle  \- Had a genius coach who gave harden all the keys, in a team that essentially tried to mimic the warriors, yet still choked in the playoffs  \- missed his one chance to beat the warriors with no kd and get to the finals  better than curry.    I hate when people compare curry and harden and say ""well curry had a better team"" when James harden has literally played with pretty good teams as well with significantly less success. Let's say we don't even look at the kd warriors, Steph still had back to back finals appearances in teams where he was the #1 option, and if we look at the personnel between those warriors teams and harden's Houston teams, they weren't all that far off. To sum it all up, if we ignore the KD Warrior period, Steph was still successful, and Harden still wasn't."
"James Harden on his 'Welcome to the strip club' moment: ""Candy Darling. It was seven minutes of a lap dancin' she was giving me. She gave 17 erections, all on me. I got tagged out, I ran out the club so damn fast, raining bills on my way."""
This is like a signature James Harden game
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
James Harden has to be one of the highest IQ players in NBA History
I think he should  All star game to me is about individual success and not team success.  As an individual Beals put up numbers the entire time  I’m iffy on Harden getting the start only cause at the beginning of the season he was playing not James Harden like until after he got traded.
It’s been James Harden since 2017-18 Imo. Hardens been absolutely next level since that year.
East player of the week: James Harden   That is so weird to read still ;(
James Harden
The Harden trade situation and how there werent more serious suitors is a classic ex of how teams do it also.  [Oh and the fans......dont even get started on that](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat). Saying there's no way they can trade Lonzo NAW and picks for Harden
"Once that seed of hate is planted, it's difficult to completely uproot.   I think part of it is the James Harden Ejection Fraction   Borrowing from heart pumping terminology, the JHEF is what percentage of your teammates can you eject from your team.  If you are, in fact, a star -- then it _is_ your team.  And one of the quickest, least destructive ways to prove you are a star and the de facto leader of your franchise is to bounce one of your teammates.   All you have to do is pretend everything is truly actually really cool again, then keep your mouth shut when the team asks your agent -- 3 minutes before they fax the papers over -- if you have a problem with the team ejecting the problem player.   Which is what will happen here, of course.   The only way to _potentially_ stop this type of breakup is to have the star player publicly, repeatedly, forcefully,  and genuinely call out for the team to stay together, for persona non grata player to not be traded, etc.  And that's a big 'potentially'. It probably would not make a difference outside of some extraordinary circumstances. The problem player is already gone, whether they know it or not."
"nope, because everyone at the time called them a supeteam. it's revisionist history to act like they weren't.  just a few examples:   https://grantland.com/features/year-superteam/  https://grantland.com/features/how-miami-heat-went-historic-winning-streak-came-dominate-league/  https://allucanheat.com/2013/02/11/heat-vs-lakers-postgame-grades-and-analysis-for-the-miami-heat/  https://www.brewhoop.com/2013/4/18/4239362/nba-playoffs-lebron-james-heat-vs-bucks  https://www.captaingambling.com/thesportsfanjournal/sports/basketball/shock-the-world-miami-heat-vs-houston-rockets-lebron-james-james-harden/  http://www.thebowse.com/2013/03/heat-balance-star-power-and-winning-in-todays-diva-nba/"
James Harden is that you?
he's not second to none lmao ever heard of james harden? it'll be even harder for beal this year since harden moved to the east and jaylen brown got much better and actually plays defense. to me brown and harden are the starting guards but you could make a case for kyrie and harden instead
The only MVP that he was close to winning is the James Harden one and it was really really close. Other than that he wasn't the MVP any other season
"I thought Beal and Russ would be one of my favorite pairings (I've liked Russ + PG the most), but Beal is just...not the caliber of player that Paul or James Harden have been. Shit even Melo *tried* out there with Russ at times.  I have no clue what his deal is. Idk if they're just taking the year off but Beal impacts the game almost nowhere other than points scored. And his points scored do not end in wins.   If Russ is really back to MVP Russ form, I think the only way Wiz have a chance at playoffs is letting Russ be the guy. I know...crazy...and I know...Beal is the scoring leader...but...he's just not an impactful guy and his body language and defense since GAME 1 has been awful.   He's just not it."
It's regular season stats. James Harden is better than LeBron James for the past 4 years if we go by that standard.
Lol this isn't some unique story in sports. Entire cities will vilify athletes all the time. It's kinda fun.   - Rockets fans probably feeling pretty conflicted on James Harden right now  - Cavaliers fans probably feeling the same towards Kyrie  - Celtics fans probably feeling the same towards Kyrie - Celtics fans are also probably pretty divided on how they feel about Ray Allen  - Jays fans hate Rougned Odor  - Canucks fans hate Mark Messier  - Everyone in the all-Canadian division hates Matthew Tkachuk except Calgary
"I don't know if they were ever the favorite again. Contenders? Sure. Any team with those versions of KD and Westbrook would have a chance to win it all. But, we're talking about James freaking Harden. An MVP. I don't even know how there's an argument against saying OKC would have been much better off with Harden. Russ gets injured? OK. KD and Harden still sort of could score some points. KD gets injured? Russ could control the drives while Harden controls the perimeter. Ibaka gets hurt? Go small ball. How many teams would have had a 4 or 5 that could guard KD, still have enough down low to handle Westbrook's drives AND have someone to guard Harden on the perimeter?"
"They had Thompson, JR, and Shumpert (who the Nets just signed). James Harden is way better than all that."
"It's paywalled, but it goes mostly like this:  &gt; It's too early to proclaim this the end. Westbrook is not far removed from a 30-game, pre-bubble stretch in which he averaged 30 points on 51% shooting. He is recovering from both the coronavirus and two quadriceps injuries.  &gt; It has been hard for the Washington Wizards to gain rhythm given how virus protocols gutted their roster. Thomas Bryant's knee injury robbed Westbrook of his most explosive pick-and-roll partner.  &gt; But for years, executives within the league warned Westbrook might be one of those players -- reliant on athleticism, without a reliable jumper -- who falls off fast. What we have seen in Washington is either the beginning of that accelerated drop-off, or a blip of severe underperformance.  &gt; Every Westbrook stat is down, save perhaps the most alarming: turnovers. Westbrook is coughing up a ghastly 5.2 per game, putting him on pace for the fourth recorded five-plus-turnovers season in league history. (Westbrook has one of the prior three, along with James Harden and DeMarcus Cousins.)  &gt; And the passes. My god, the passes. Unable to get to the basket, Westbrook resorts to impossible thread-the-needle jobs that either end up out of bounds or in the hands of opponents.  &gt; Only 27% of Westbrook's shots have come at the rim, the lowest share of his career, per Cleaning The Glass. Westbrook is shooting 31% on 2s outside the restricted area.  &gt; None of this has deterred him. Westbrook leads all players with 15.7 isolations per 100 possessions, according to Second Spectrum. Those isos are producing 0.725 points on average -- 98th among 110 guys who have recorded at least 20 isolations.  https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30776920/ten-nba-things-like-including-pelicans-tricky-table"
counterpoint: I would not.   Downgrading from James Harden to Jrue Holiday for a median level starting C who plays a replaceable as hell role is not good
"No Jrue Holiday will win you playoff games, James Harden will win you championships."
Lmao seriously. The nets lost 2 in a row. Is it time to trade everybody and rebuild?? Safe to say the James harden trade was a fail am i right?
The rare occasion that James Harden gets posted up does not negate the dozens of layups given up by the Nets every night.
That's not true it all. He posts up a lot of bigs. There's a reason he's always near the top in post plays defended and it's not because guards go at him. Mediocre bigs tend to go at him hard because he's James Harden and it often backfires. Rockets were happy to settle for Whiteside or Draymond taking 10ft fadeaway hook shots. Obviously he's not going to shut down elite post players like Embiid or AD.
i looked at the box score. seems that James Harden did not play.
I'm not sure how many more times I have to reiterate it. James Harden is the best player on this team. The Nets need him more than he needs the Nets.
"And KD *wanted* to play with Kyrie, that’s backstabbing to a whole new level.  ‘I wunt to play with my bestest friend in the whole wurld’  -James harden joins the team 8 games after you’re back from your injury   ‘Trade Kyrie, James is my bestest friend’"
"Tbh i feel really bad for rockets and how harden went down.  i never had anything personally against the rockets, just james harden"
James Harden has contributed to the team the same amount as those 3 combined in his only 8 games played according to advanced stats.
"Don't worry, the Nets defense will improve when defensive anchor James Harden returns to the floor."
"Does this really count since we didn't have our star PF, James Harden?"
James Harden came at a cost...but they need someone who can defend.
Don’t worry guys Nets will be fine when their DPOY James Harden comes back
they're missing their entire bench and initial roster prior to James Harden
"Calm down haters, Nets didn’t have their DPOY James Harden today"
How would James Harden have kept them from giving up 149 points
Go to show how important James Harden is to this team
"This was predictable tbf. You have Kyrie and KD who haven't cared about defense for most of their careers, than you have Nash who never played defense and MDT who thinks defense is dumb. Now we have the crown prince of not playing defense, James Harden, and got rid of our best defensive player instead of DJ.   These finals about to come down to the final shot every game."
They shouldn't even be needing James fucking Harden to get past this season's Wizards.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are only 5 miles away lmao"
Might?!?!! They are allowing like 130 ppg (outside of the one game the Heat scored 84) since the James Harden trade lol.
"""For years, executives within the league warned Westbrook might be one of those players -- reliant on athleticism, without a reliable jumper -- who falls off fast.

"Nets need their real MVP, James Harden."
Too bad James Harden decided against 2020.
JAMES HARDEN IS GOOD BUT HE ISNT IQ
Can you imagine if Bradley Beal asks for a trade?  On Russ's resume:   played with Kevin Durant in OKC -  Durant wanted out  played with James Harden in HOU - Harden wanted out  played with Bradley Beal in WAS - Beal wants out  Talk about a legacy.
IQ is good but he ain’t james harden 😭😭😭
Embiid  Lebron  Jokic   KD not in the discussion because James Harden will probably steal votes from him.
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
James Harden tweeted in 2017 he'd retire a Houston Rocket
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić."
"This right here, we essentially knew for a fact James Harden wasn’t leading the Rockets to a championship.  I’m 100% more invested in this current Rockets lineup then anything Harden could do.  Regardless if we even make the playoffs or not."
"Sounds like James Harden for the last 8 years. Nobody wanted to hear it then, though."
"The good ones IMO :  \- Hornets (not even sure I have a reason but I never heard them say anything stupid, they praise the opponent often)  \- Nets, Eagle is amazing, Kustok is good, Jefferson is funny  \- Knicks : Breen/Clyde are amazing  \- Pelicans : I really like Antonio Daniels as an analyst  \- Kings : Mark Jones is great  \- The Hawks when they don't play James Harden, I liked them a lot but last year I watched the game against Houston they were really really pissed at him it wasn't good. Idk how they handle the whole Trae foul drawing stuff, but they were so against it when it came to Harden that I worry that they are hypocritical about it  &amp;#x200B;  Those are the main ones, others are okay (Pacers, Raptors). Honestly there are less really terrible ones than a few years ago"
James harden would have been lethal with embiid. Its unfortunate tillman has a hate boner for morey.
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"Lots of people just want the Nets to implode, they have Kyrie &amp; KD two of the most hated players in the league in recent history, James harden with the way he left Houston and his style of play also gets lots of hate. So people look at the one huge flaw in this Nets team, which is their defense and simply dismiss them.   This sub and NBA fans love drama, and the Nets have the stars who usually bring the most drama to the league."
James Harden 30/10/10/10
Some people say the KP trade was our James Harden trade.
Fuck James Harden
"not when he finds James Edward Harden Jr in the paint, big boy"
"""James Harden in his Bagley"" against the Kings.  Love his Ian busts those out regularly."
"Lol it’s not just first take anymore, undisputed are taking the piss too nowadays. Did you see the take they had on Kyrie telling James harden “you play the point I’ll be the 2 guard”... I didn’t know if it was a joke at first. Now I see they are fanboys. SMH"
I'm just going to go if sports never existed.  Pau Gasol - Surgeon  Gordon Hayward - video game developer  James Harden - strip club bouncer  Kyrie Irving - curator of a Ripley's believe it or not
3p% is pointless without accounting for the difficulty of shots. Last year Serge Ibaka shot a better % than James Harden.
klay is no james harden.
Love how OP just says everything the organization has done in the last 7 years was done specifically at the behest of James Harden lmao
"&gt;  teammates that could actually carry the same way he did last night  I'm honestly not sure either of them could consistently do that.  I would have more confidence in KD but Kyrie almost certainly couldn't, he's not a good enough playmaker.  Part of what makes James so special (LeBron is like this too) is that he makes the correct basketball decision the vast majority of possessions.  That doesn't always mean creating his own shot, and he was that way in Houston.  I think Kyrie and to a lesser extent KD lack that skill to the extent that Harden has it."
*heavy breathing* James Harden is a better player than Steph Curry *heavier breathing*
The Rockets org was actively puffing their chest talking about how uncomfortable they were willing to get and then got shockedpikachuface when Harden simply said the truth about the team. And Boogie/Wall honestly have no business acting like they had anything to do with it - Harden wanted gone before they showed up. It isn't up to James to drag them to the playoffs.
https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/report-kyrie-irving-was-convinced-lebron-james-camp-tried-get-him-traded  While Lebron has never requested a trade he has never stayed loyal to a team for 8 years. At least harden let Houston get 9 picks from him.
Is that really what D'Antoni espoused?  Do you have some quote with him talking about it?  I thought he was more focused on 3s/layups/FTs.  It wasn't until Steph that I saw a player consistently take 3s off the dribble and I never heard people really talk about it being a good shot before him.  D'Antoni seemed a lot more focused on catch and shoot 3s -- and James Harden was the only player during his coaching run that I saw consistently shoot 3s off the dribble.
"Yeah, I’m not sure what rule changes people are proposing. Is this debate really just about whether you ought to make disparaging comments about James Harden or not?"
"Well, this is how we gonna do this: Fuck James Harden!   Fuck The Rockets!  Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!  And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!"
"I'm not a Houston fan, but it was bad for them. Even though he was a cancer to the team, they still traded James Harden for Levert and 3 picks.   They should have traded for Simmons or waited until the offseason and got a haul. They ended up with Jrue Holiday value for a top 5 player."
"James Harden did his best to get them a ring, he failed, eventually both of them will realise it, it's just harden who realised it first"
"So everything both Harden and the organization tried didn’t result in a title. Couple that with the current outlook of the roster and Harden’s age, maybe it was just time for a split.   James was just the first to make a move"
"I would never joke about something this important. James Harden might be able to, but for me black lives matter is no laughing matter."
"I think you and OP are taking crazy pills because it’s pretty clear a lot of what Green was saying was directed at our, fans and media, reaction to this stuff. Only some of it was directed at the NBA rules structure. When he says James Harden was castrated, it is very obvious to me he isn’t claiming the fine castrated him, but that he was under intense scrutiny for the way he was trying to get off the team. He’s absolutely right regarding the one sided manner in which we see this business.   The OP intentionally leaves out the heart of Draymond’s sentiments. There’s this “the media is a different discussion”, but it’s not, it is the discussion. Another thing here is this is a rant, although I’m sure this was on his mind before, I’m also sure he didn’t write out that he wanted to include he was annoyed they had Drummond dress for the game. It’s a rant, you’re going to miss stuff."
"I dislike James Harden, I like Houston fans"
"He literally didn't mention players leaving in free agency at all in the clip I watched. He was talking about how players get dragged for requesting trades. He said harden was castrated for what he did. I don't agree with that at all. I think Harden got off pretty light for how egregious his actions were (Dray completely ignored how Harden ignored COVID guidelines and didn't show up for camp) . By the way I'm a rockets fan and huge James Harden fan, but that doesn't mean I'm cool with that. I'm happy he's doing well in NY.   As a fan you are allowed to not like it when a player leaves or wants to leave. Dray thinks that somehow organizations and owners don't get criticism for what they do. I'll shit on Tillman Fertitta any day of the week, fuck that guy, and I think that sentiment is common among fans. Who TF you know likes James Dolan? What happened to Donald Sterling? Do you think a Cleveland fan likes Lebron or Dan Gilbert? Who won that PR battle? Jeanie Bus?      Also the whole premise is that he is HORRIFIED that Andre Drummond has to sit out a few games? What is so terrible about that? A team doesn't want to risk and injury before a trade, and he knows that he's on the trading block. That seems like a win-win. Dray simultaneously complained about players not knowing about a trade until it's a done deal, and then also about how Andre Drummond got a huge advanced warning of being traded and has to sit. What's up with that? Is he really worried that players are required to stay in shape? Like that's a problem because he missed 20 or 30 minutes of play time?     I think that there have been plenty of problems for players in the past, and I usually side with labor. Dray is being really dumb right now. I really don't understand how he has these impassioned morals in between kicking other players in the dick, especially when his take is so garbage."
We talking about the same James Harden who hotdogged his way out of Houston?
"Adjusting for pace/era:  Bron - 36/10/10 per 100, +6rTS%, All-NBA defense, 58-24 W/L  Harden - 31/9/14 per 100, +7rTS%, Terrible defense, 18-12 W/L  There is no comparison between James Harden and Lebron James, especially when you consider Harden isn't even the best player on his team."
"I'll get downvoted, but I think its wrong to expect parity between organizations and individuals. I think its also wrong to expect parity between individuals and individuals.    Fans are generally fans of teams and not individual athletes. So fans are right to be biased in favor of teams. If the Timberwolves have the opportunity to trade Jaden McDaniels for Lebron, of course the team should take the opportunities even if the players would be unhappy.    I also believe the more talented players are and should be granted more privileges than scrubs/role players. If LeBron wants to trade Lonzo, Ingram, and others for Anthony Davis, yeah, the Lakers should take that opportunit as well even if the players are unhappy.    I have no problem with with James Harden did to get out of Houston. I think he did everything in his power to better his situation and I would have done the same. But I also don't have a problem with Houston fans clowning on James Harden as well."
"&gt; He's just saying that teams can do whatever they want in regards to a player and not be criticized  I don't even think he's right if he said that.  Teams, owners, GMs, get blasted all the time.  If you ask people who follow the NBA who the biggest moron in the league is, with anyone eligible - players, coaches, front office, refs, etc - I wouldn't be surprised if James Dolan got more votes than James Harden."
"James Harden. As league scoring numbers continue to rise, his regular season numbers will grow less impressive. While considered a top 5 player now, most people already rank him around 30-40 all time and that will surely drop as new players ascend.   He won’t be entirely forgotten but his lack of playoff success as the main guy will ultimately keep him ranked lower. Nobody in 20 years will give him as much credit for almost beating us that they give him now."
efficient James Harden would have been a laughable phrase 2 years ago
"Go read the athletic or ESPN piece that details it all, James Harden burner account"
We can't support James Harden getting castrated?
"Here you go, NBA uniform player contract, section 5, clause B: ""The Player agrees: (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees""  Section 5, clause C: ""For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance with the terms of the CBA.""  So yes, when James Harden happily signed on the dotted line for $40 million a year he happily signed up for that too."
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"I think Sean Marks and Kenny Atkinson/Steve Nash have to be in consideration. Obviously, jury is still out on Nash, but Marks came into a Nets team laden with boat-anchor contracts and no draft picks and managed to build a playoff team with cap space with other team's cap space. Atkinson was crucial in developing those guys into the players they are now; DLo hasn't hit Brooklyn levels since he left. Then Marks was able to reel in KD/Kyrie (largely because he built such a cap friendly playoff team, he could afford to sign them and he'd want to join) and pulled off a trade for James Harden. Obviously, going without picks is dangerous, but the Nets are now more relevant than they have been since they went to the finals in the early 2000s. And when/if this whole experiment blows up, Marks has proven he can find dime-store talent."
"House wasn't even a replacement. We got him from the G-League on a two-way contract. Then his 45 days were up and Tilman didn't want to pay him so he wasn't on the roster for half the season over a contract during the most injured stretch of the season.   We replaced Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute, who was imo the better defender that season, with Melo, MCW, and James Ennis. Only minimum players allowed because Tilman didn't want to pay the tax. Chris Paul played much worse and Capela wasn't as good on switches. Gordon was inconsistent af.   Harden and Tucker were the only constants and Morey managed to find other guys like Austin Rivers, Kenneth Faried, Iman Shumpert, Gary Clark Jr, all while being mandated to stay out of the tax. This is why it's infuriating to hear that the Rockets gave Harden everything he wanted, that roster wasn't even close to the same."
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
If the jazz could get James harden for Donovan Mitchell they’d do it 10/10 times. Stupid argument
James Harden.
You think James Harden would be outcasted? Lol
"In the '89 season, Jordan played point guard for 34 games and averaged 30.4/9.2/10.7. He could have been an elite point guard if they wanted to put him there.  His offensive game was basically like if James Harden also had a Kawhi/KD-level mid-range pull-up game."
"If those were enough, the team wouldn't have leaked years-old negative stories about Harden to [team-friendly reporters](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30528130/inside-james-harden-houston-rockets-breaking-point)."
"Where did you get it from that Pat Riley wouldn't trade Tyler Herro for James Harden? He'd do it in a heartbeat if he could. Ultimately, I don't think we had the necessary assets for the trade because we don't have picks. But if we could match what the Rockets asked for, Pat would do it 100/100 times."
"It's completely different because he's not exactly as important as someone like Harden, but the Niners did that with Robbie Gould (our kicker). I honestly think that's partially a football vs. basketball mentality thing though too (although there are football players like AB who have basically forced trades).   But Robbie Gould said he wanted to go back to Chicago and basically said either trade me or I'll retire. Niners just said fuck it and ignored him. This was a few seasons ago and he's still here kicking for us. Like I said, it's different when it's James Harden doing this and you're risking a lot more picks that could have huge impacts on the future of your franchise, but it was still awesome as a fan at the time to just watch and be like fuck yeah force his hand."
James Harden on his way to become most likeable player from most hated player wow.
"seriously tho, it’s a bit late for the james harden narrative to start. unless he turns into houston harden again and the nets are the 1 seed, no mvp. its a shame tho, because i believe he should win it over bron."
I disagree on this point though. James Harden forced his way off of a Houston team that had given him everything he wanted. Drummond is getting benched/traded by a rebuilding team where he is getting paid $30 million to be arguably their 4th best player. I don’t think their situations are comparable.
Yes there is because he transcends the sport into media. James harden can only make it to measly gifs
"James Harden touches sweaty dollar bills and sticks em in the used g-strings of jiggly black women, licks his fingers and proceeds to eat seasoned chicken wings from the buffet. Wipes his hands hastily on his pants, takes a piss outside by a tree, calls a cab to the game. Plays 40 mins and hits the game winner.  Dude never washes his hands cause goddamn, the absolute *filth*"
There’s no way that’s true. I refuse to believe an NBA front office can be so stupid as to turn down James fucking Harden for just Herro and Robinson. There had to be a bigger demand from Houston considering the haul they got from Brooklyn
"With Herro, nothing. He’s a sophomore that has had incremental improvements. With Duncan, his numbers are down all across the board. And even if he didn’t regress, it’s not that there’s anything wrong with them, but rather this is James Harden we’re talking about. Perennial MVP candidate, proven possible first option on a title contender, and drops 40 in his sleep."
Nah man you just don't understand how good Tyler Herro is /s  (I like Tyler Herro- he's a damn good player- but you gotta trade him for James Harden lmao)
"He might love James Harden, that doesnt mean he was willing to trade for him"
"Point is, whatever he’ll be in the future it won’t be James Harden caliber"
He went to Philly because they really wanted him and Daryl hated Fertitta and didn’t want to work for him anymore. Multiple times Daryl was liking posts on Twitter about Harden and had a Harden anniversary post on there that he got fined for. He absolutely wanted James Harden on this team. He loves Harden.
"&gt;It’s a nonsense take. You can’t talk about Curry choking when Harden is THE serial offender. It’s bad faith to hype up Curry’s teammates (pre-Durant) **without acknowledging the very well constructed teams Harden has played on himself**.  Stopped reading here, that's how I know you're just talking out your ass at this point lmao  'Well constructed team' and Fertitta, Morey and MDA don't go together at all. The only stars Harden had were all 1 at a time and came in form of an older + injured Dwight (especially come playoff time), older + injured CP3 (especially come playoff time, they win it all in 2018 if CP3 is healthy) and an older + injured Russ (especially come playoff time).  Even if CP3 just plays the last 2 games, the Rockets win it all with just James Harden and older CP3 vs Curry, Klay, KD, Draymond and a shit ton of depth. Your argument only helps me; when Harden had just a semblance of a star that fit him in CP3, he got hurt and they lost it all but woulda won if he was healthy."
"This kids arent dumb lol, just like Jarret Allen said, they probably get that too. Is not a bad thing u get offered in a trade for james harden."
"Why? Daryl Morey would absolutely take that risk, he’s an aggressive GM.  Yes I do. He’s petty and cheap. Nets deal isn’t that great despite what everyone thinks of it. It helped Fertitta save money too.  Listen man, Morey is not that type of GM he absolutely would do this for James Harden. He’s very aggressive with stuff like this ."
IDK what was going on with the sixers because there were rumors fertitta did not want to trade with Morey but the heat and some of their fans on this sub were just embarrassing. Like Herro and Duncan Robinson are more valuable to you than James Harden foh.
"I feel like James harden is still a ridiculously good player. Hot take, I know"
You really think Daryl Morey who loves James Harden more than any other player would offer up Maxes??? No way. Fertitta absolutely didn’t want to trade with him. and Chris Haynes is the one who reporter that story so it’s not like it was from some bum source.?
He will most likely be in the Malcolm Brogdon tier of players. I would easily give him up and whatever else for James Harden
James Harden is the man
"You don’t understand true shooting if you think 48% is anything other than dogshit. League average is around 56%. He is equally far below average as James Harden is above average, for comparison."
"Lowe been having bad takes on Harden ever since he predicted the Lakers series to be close and it wasn’t. Which is dumb as hell, if you’re gonna be upset at anyone about that series James wasn’t it."
"There's no way you're getting negative karma for saying Stephen Curry is a better player than James Harden. Even if Harden was better, is he THAT much better?"
I just look at the body of work of what James has done in Houston(Harden can be a really good defender when he tries) and now in Brooklyn and Harden is just more impactful than KD. Kyrie if I’m being honest has been better on offense this year than KD too.
James harden
James Harden pretty good at basketball
"Yes, the Suns *should* have won, they were up 24 points. And yes, Nets went red hot, but the Suns deserved to lose that one after that second half performance. They took their foot off of the gas for an entire half defensively against James Harden and stopped moving the ball offensively.    Countless blown coverages with absolutely no help at rim and several miscommunications. The highlights they showed on TNT had three instances of Nets players, including Harden, being wide open because guys didn't switch or seemingly know who they were guarding.   Unfortunately, they have blown a lot of games this year. In six of their last seven losses, they had a lead with 2:15 remaining."
James Harden is good at basketball
"James Harden is James Harden, but Tyler Herro could be anything! He could even be James Harden!"
"Even then though, I still feel like you make that trade in a heartbeat as Philly. I really don’t think that’s too much for James fucking Harden"
Right. Most players don't have the same concerns as James Harden.
"This is what I've been saying since Day 1 but got downvoted by the nephew circlejerk.   How the fuck do you not give up Thybulle or Maxey to get a guy like James fucking Harden.  Same goes for Heat, Tyler Herro? WTF?! You are going to keep Tyler Herro over James Harden?!"
Herro will never be James Harden.
"Down the stretch  * 5:33 left - James Harden enters the game, BKN 108-113 PHX * 4:37 left - Jeff Green 3, Harden assist, BKN 111-116 PHX * 3:57 left - Joe Harris 3, Harden assist, BKN 114-118 PHX * 3:07 left - James Harden floating 2, BKN 116-121 PHX * 2:21 left - Jeff Green 3, Harden assist, BKN 119-124 PHX * 1:39 left - James Harden 2, BKN 121-124 PHX * 59.2 left - Jeff Green 2 - BKN 123-124 PHX * 31.4 left - James Harden 3 - BKN 126-124 PHX * 11.3 left - James Harden 2 free throws - BKN 128-124 PHX"
But heat is still no 1 in culture so it's okay and herro has the potential to become James harden while James Harden is James Harden.
&gt;Like wtf  #JAMES HARDEN
Ain’t no stopping James harden
‘Kets and Nets fans united as one in the James Edward Harden fan club
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with James Harden. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to James. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
Say what you want about James Harden...the dude can flat out ball. I had my doubts with how he’d fit with Brooklyn but the dude is proving that he can play any style that’s needed for a team to win.
James harden and Bron do the best carry jobs I’ve ever seen
James Harden is good at basketball.
Put James harden on the mvp ladder right now.
James Harden is a NET
can't believe james harden is the 2nd best player on this team
"There were fans who didn't want to trade the likes of Tyler Herro, Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam for James Harden. It's almost like people forgot the man is literally a one man offensive system as we saw for years in Houston."
I really don’t understand why the Suns didn’t slow the pace down with a lead in the beginning in the fourth.   They instead decided to get into a shootout with james harden??
"There will be a highlight thread of James Harden at the top of r/nba tomorrow, like Lebron and Steph right guys? Right??"
My mom passed James Harden at a store once and he looked at her and gave a friendly smile I will support this man to my grave
Its obvious the Draymond was mad about the “James Harden with the obvious pre-game meal” comment
JAMES HARDEN IS MY DAD.  METH CURRY IS BACK.  SHAMET SLANDER NO LONGER ALLOWED.
James Harden is out of his mind. Amazing clutch three. 12-0 run. Down 21 at the break? No problem. Nets CAN play D. Resilience in their blood.
I’m so glad there’s another fanbase learning how to fuckin dick ride James Edward Harden
"It’s just shitty that a team can openly have a player on the trade block and there’s no repercussions, but the moment a player expresses a desire to go somewhere else the league cracks down with huge fines. Here if you want a solution: players should be able to openly  speak their mind and voice grievances with the team without the threat of a penalty. Whether the player decides to play, or whether the team decides to play the player is up to them to decide, but you can’t get upset/fine a player because he openly expresses how he feels. The point draymond is trying to make is that players get demonized for expressing how they feel. Now is it shitty sometimes? Yea, James harden kinda fucked over Houston and that wasn’t cool. But so is what Cleveland is doing to Drummond. It’s a double standard"
"Speaking as a Sixers fan, if I was the Houston Rockets I simply would have kept James Harden"
Imagine not trading for James fucking harden. Appreciate this guys greatness man.
Put James harden on the mvp ladder right now. Dude plays every night back to backs 38 mins a night and just balls out.
James. Harden.
"A lot of these are about the media and not the NBA like the perception of players who request trades. But in general:  1) One of these situations involves an entity discussing something they have a contractually negotiated right to do (a team has the right to trade a player) and another involves a an entity discussing something they do not have a contractually negotiated right to do (a player has no specific right to trade themselves). Obviously it gets a little silly at times, and I have no idea why players/teams aren't allowed to discuss future free agency plans under that understanding, but it applies more than well enough to trades in my mind.   2) The way Harden is viewed is not something that the NBA directly controls, but in general it makes sense that we don't continuously get Harden's opinion on destinations, because once again, he can't trade himself. Why fans and the media portray decisions a certain way is a longer and more difficult conversation, but it probably just comes down to ""it makes the NBA more enjoyable if stars don't do the whole James Harden thing.""  3) Players not showing up is not a right they've negotiated beyond retirement and trading players is a right teams have. Moreover, I don't know what anyone wants - sometimes trades happen very quickly out of necessity and sometimes a team isn't the source for a player learning they've been traded. It makes sense that teams should, whenever possible, keep players in the loop, but it's easy to imagine how that won't always happen and that's the nature of the business at moment (the players are welcome to re-negotiate next CBA).  4) Once again, not really a double standard when it comes to trades. You can talk about what you're allowed to do. I think the rules around free agency tampering are pretty damn silly though.   5) Agreed.   6) Still not really a double standard. The NBA wants teams to be handling trades and not players, and has collectively negotiated for that privilege.   7) People should be more patient and overall are pretty dumb."
James harden is just wow
Folks forget James Harden is a top 10 offence alone
"Pop is amazing he would have won a title with the celtics, Sixers already. Derozan is great he just needs a shrink to shake his James Harden play off legs"
"How did they massacre their whole depth prior to the Harden trade...for Harden.  Also that’s not a good rotation or anything lol. That is James Harden making players look better then they are. Did it with PJ Tucker for what, like five years?"

So you’re telling me James Harden has more triple doubles than 12 NBA teams do in total? Wow
James Harden winning a championship the first year he leaves the shithole Houston is....W
That is literally James Harden my guy… When he was in Houston the man couldn’t and still can’t play defense and took so many shots that it limited everybody else on the court. So you can’t make that argument with LaVine especially since LaVine isn’t as bad on defense as people say.
James Harden.
James Harden.
James Harden.
James Harden.
"Damn, when I look at the matchups, it seems like the Nets will do a better job guarding the Sixers than they will guarding the Nets. Mattyse might hold James Harden to 30 whilst putting up 6 of his own. There isn’t one extremely lopsided matchup in favour of the Sixers aside from Embiid."
"James Harden is heat culture personified. He works harden than basically everybody else, man does not sleep and ofc would make great use of miami's extracurriculars."
“James Harden the flamethrower!”  One of my favorite calls of all-time.
"Watching the rockets tonight for a bit and it felt like they played like they still had James Harden on the team, just no ball movement and john wall and oladipo isolation"
James Harden is loudly the MVP this year and it isn’t even close.
"I'm guessing the NBA put out an APB that basically said ""Yo people are complaining about all the players whining after every shot.  It really is getting out of hand.  Start calling everything.""  If this dampens Giannis, Harden, James etc. throwing up their hands and whining after every single shot, I'm gonna say let's see how it plays out."
"James Harden would fit in with the heat culture. Not every fan thinks he wouldn't and if you go to our sub, you will find us arguing with each other about it a lot"
"Great analogy only problem I had was while reading I thought, idk if Kyrie is that much better at finishing than Harden. I looked up the stats for shooting within 5 feet and Harden and Kyrie are at 60.5 and 60 percent respectively, which goes to show how good James Harden is"
Could it...be...that James Harden just wants to be a team player and be in the MVP talks?! I feel like the man is earning his respect this season.
"At the end of the day James Harden should have more then one MVP, crime the man doesn't."
James Harden is an elite basketball player and an elite human

"A proper roster that hasn’t won a game in a month lmaooooo. That losing streak seems to have really taken a toll on your brain cell count. You’re dead on though, utterly brilliant decision to turn down a 24 year old All-NBA player and DPOY candidate (who, once again, you could’ve easily turned and flipped for another massive haul if you didn’t want to keep him (ROstER bUilDiNg BRuH) because NBA teams aren’t as stupid as r/nba nephews like yourself and know how good Simmons is) to instead take on a washed up, checked out Oladipo who you’re gonna get a pile of dogshit for at the deadline Lolol.  Your owner destroyed a contender he inherited damn near immediately and intervened in the Harden trade process to make a decision based off spiting someone else he had some petty beef with instead of doing what was best for his own team. Sound familiar at all? If it doesn’t, check my flair.  Your owner is Western Conference James Dolan who doesn’t even have Dolan’s one redeeming quality because he won’t spend money lol. You’re in for a long run of watching absolutely horrendous basketball. Hmu if you need advice on how to cope, I’ve been doing it for 20 years. You’re in for 5+ years of watching Ben Simmons make All-NBA teams while y’all get picks in the late 20s from one of the best run organizations in the league rn who isn’t gonna bottom out any time soon. That’s gonna require Olympic level mental gymnastics and homer rationalization which I’m also very proficient in so again holler at me whenever."
James harden definitely won't be partying during the break. That would never happen and there isn't precedent of him making bad Covid related decisions......
"This guy has obviously never played basketball lmao. James Harden has never thrown a pass without knowing exactly who it was going to. You don’t have to be staring straight at the guy to think “oh that’s KD! Guess I’ll throw it to him because he shoots approximately 42% from the left corner!”.   I’m Harden guarding someone at the top of the key, and KD is guarding a guy on the left wing, we get a defensive board and I leak out for the outlet pass. As I push the ball up I hear a guy yelling “trail” to my left, I slow to hesi and shake my defender for some space to throw the pass, and whip a no look to someone streaking to the left corner... huge shocker I know it’s KD!!!! Because he was on the left side of the court 1.4 seconds ago!!!"
Look what James harden went for lol who is twice the player dbook is
That didn’t answer my question..wtf those that mean ? ..are you saying it’s just a cool little stat ? If so then I understand but op said it as if it was a testament to his greatness or some shit ...Kobe won 5 for the same team and played 20 yrs that’s a testament to greatness ..12 all defensive teams (most by a guard) while being an all nba player and top scorer is a testament to greatness but i guess lol ..I just hate the narrative that’s brewing up Bc you have ppl who really thinks James harden is actually better than Kobe but won’t factor in inflation ..usage rate ..or any logical context ..again that’s why I dislike these bullshit stats bc what does it actually means ? It’s just meaningless accolades
James Harden almost died from Metta World Peace's elbow.
This stat means James Harden eventually left his team and faced his old team to get all the teams
"I fucking hate that guy.  Honestly, I had this same reaction when I first started watching Dwyane Wade back in '03. I didn't like that he did it so much and I thought it was lame. My younger brother--12 years my junior!!--was like what the fuck is wrong with you big bro. Then I started paying attention and I realizedv why players do that. You gotta fight for your space, and if you're not willing to work for it, you're not gonna get it.  James Harden can suck a dick though that guy's lazy as fuck and I honestly dislike him so much."
"People adore Curry it won't change anything. I mean look at KD now he just got James Harden, and almost gets no hate now. It was just a unique situation."
How can you say that when people were yelling James Harden is not efficient in 2019!!  Some sports people really are that dumb
"&gt;Giannis  I'll give you that, he wasn't really that well known by North American commentators until he was drafted.  &gt;KAT, Kawhi, Harden  ???? KAT was on an almost undefeated Kentucky team that was much watch TV for people who didn't even like college ball. Kawhi Leonard was dragging a San Diego State team to a 2 seed. James Harden was a college first team all American his sophomore year which led him to being a 3rd overall pick. These guys were very popular in college ball, they just played before the current social media era of having viral highlights by the time you're a HS freshman."
"&gt; In real-time, James Harden can't really tell whether it's Kyrie (41% 3pt) on his right and Bruce Brown (26% 3pt) on his left, or vice versa.  lol what   i'm going to give mvp-level players the benefit of the doubt on this one, telling people apart from 10 feet away is not very difficult"
"That only really works in videogames and hindsight, though. In real life you have a drill a system so that players will know if their teammates on the wings are going to cut to the hoop or spot up at the arc. In real-time, James Harden can't really tell whether it's Kyrie (41% 3pt) on his right and Bruce Brown (26% 3pt) on his left, or vice versa. Obviously Kyrie is more likely to spot up for 3 than Brown is, but all Harden sees is 2 BK-colored jerseys through his peripheral vision.   Option routes might work in football, but football teams have an entire week to practice between games, and it still takes a long time to build up that connection to where QBs and receivers know how the other is reading the defensive keys. And they still mess it up regularly."
Him ripping into James Harden a couple weeks back was cool
"Because you are saying something that isnt factual. Lebron does not get more hate than other superstars in this sub. Rondo SPAT on Chris Paul and people up voted it. That is one example among many, stop this nonsense.  I dont dick ride anyone, I like James Harden because he's the second best Rocket of all time and I want to see him win a ring. I would never tell you anything delusional like he's better than Lebron or he's been MVP over  Embid this season or that he's most liked superstar when he istn. What you are saying about Lebron is you stanning him and wanting him to be number 1 in hatred for some weird ass reason."
"""I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with James Harden. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting fadeaways on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to James Harden. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.""  - Mike Dan Tony"
"Yup and if there were fans to boo or cheer or react at all I would agree with you. All we have now is James Harden going back to play his former team, and seeing some guys he used to play with for various lengths of time. It's basically a regular game without the fans."
Yes and so is James Harden. Getting steals and deflections don't mean you are a good defender.
"So assuming first and second in the West are some combo of LAC and UTAH then no player on those teams will win. Then I'm assuming all the players are playing at the rate they are now, more or less.   -Jokic will not win from the fifth seed. Whether he should or not isn't what's being asked. He won't be considered a serious contender.   -Nets players won't be considered either. James Harden and KD and Kyrie, there's just too much talent there to give one of them the award for doing what most people expect them too.   -Giannis will not win the award. Again, maybe he should? But the voters won't consider it giving him the award for his dominance season. They will consider it giving him MVP three years in a row. That's not happening under any but the most extreme circumstances. And even then it's not very likely.   It's between LeBron and Embiid imo. Both the three seed. Embiid dominating in stats but LeBron has the narrative and support of the voters. If the Sixers were second seed it would be easily Embiid but that's not the question posed. I honestly think they'd give it to LeBron since everyone has something against them. He will also probably play more games than Embiid and that will be used against Joel. The only way Embiid wins is if he finishes with 30+ ppg, the first center doing so since Moses Malone."
"What James Harden did in 2019 was the definition of what MVP should be too, but he was a victim of voter fatigue.  I agree though, it's stupid as fuck."
I hope I find someone who loves me as much as you love James Harden
"&gt; That being said Harden did kind of throw his team under the bus for ""not being good enough"" when he got frustrated things didn't move forward which is where I thought he was wrong but at the end of the day who the hell cares what I think  So this is an interesting read about the trade [here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934230-the-2-month-trade-request-how-james-harden-forced-his-way-out-of-houston) that came out today"
"I literally have no idea what constitutes a foul in the NBA anymore. If a player doesn't move out of the way when a person shoots and they land on his foot it's a foul. If James Harden grabs your arm as he goes by and then throws a up a shot, you get the foul. But on the other hand we see straight up muggings go uncalled every game. The NBA had peak viewership in the 90s and the 90s was a very physical style of basketball. It was expect that you would have to touch people in a game where you shove 10 people inside a 25 foot semi circle. Look at the Jordan Rules and how the Pistons played Jordan. Isiah Thomas is quoted as saying ""we don't know how he got out of [playing the Pistons] alive"". It was a very street game. If Lebron was defended like that he would start a social media campaign denouncing the NBA as racist for jot protecting Black players from violence. Jordan took it personally and won 6 chips and is still the biggest brand in basketball because of it."
"&gt; James harden was a 6th man at that point. Was never all team or all nba untill he went to Houston. Prior to then, he was coming off the bench and averaging less than 17 a game.  Yes I know. Hence why I said ""as far as people's opinions went, no""  &gt; Harden’s transition into superstardom did not occur until his time in Houston. It’s ridiculous to act like he was prime/peak harden his first go round with KD in OKC, which is what the previous person was trying to say. No he was not.  That is not what I said. I said Harden was a top 10 player in 2012 despite being a bench player, and there are stats that prove it.  Harden was 2nd in the league in TS%. Only Tyson Chandler had a higher TS.  Harden was 3rd in ORTG.  Harden was 4th in WS/48 and 6th in overall Win Shares, despite averaging only 30 minutes a game.  Harden was 8th in BPM and 13th in VORP (again, a result of playing fewer minutes)  What this shows is, Harden was absolutely already one of the best players in the league even in his final season in OKC. He was a better player than Westbrook, and OKC fared far better with Harden on/Westbrook off.  The reason he wasnt seen as a top 10 player was purely because of his status as a bench player, and the fact that advanced stats hadnt caught on yet. Not many people understand he was a bench player by choice, not necessity.  Even in the playoffs, he balled out every single series until the finals, and Miami made a point to target him during the finals.  As far as impact goes, there werent 10 players better than Harden in 2012, regardless of his status as a player."

"The best ones have a great grasp on x and os in both leagues.  LeBron James and Chris Paul know the game inside and out too.  When you see a next level player, they are almost always smarter than their opponent along with athletically gifted.  Yes, there are exceptions, but guys like Harden and Curry break the game because they know how to.  Put chris Paul's brain in kyrie and you have the greatest pg of all time."
PG - Chris Paul 6’0  SG- James Harden 6’5  SF - Jordan 6’6  PF - Barkley 6’6  C - Wes Unseld 6’7
D wade &gt;&gt;&gt; James harden
Nah I’d take the Warriors big 3.  Prime Steph&gt;current James harden/pre Achilles tear KD&gt;post Achilles tear KD/ prob Klay&lt;Kyrie but Klay also doesn’t need the ball to score which is better for offensive flow with two already ball dominant players in my opinion.
"It disgusts me honestly.  I haven't enjoyed basketball as much since seeing Harden throw a tantrum, treat his organization and teammates like shit, and just stop giving a fuck all because he wanted to go to form the best super team in the league.  It's fucking absurd that he got his way and isn't even villainized at all, yet KD just moves in free agency and still gets murdered...even though James made an even more broken team than the Warriors...  All of it is just so fucking dumb from how he got his way while being a terrible person to the fans just being completely fine with it.  KD didn't actually do anything wrong as a person and got crucified.  Harden was an asshole to people."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/rocketswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/29/james-harden-asked-why-the-russell-westbrook-trade-was-taking-so-long/amp/   Yeah   It’s on Tilman and Harden  They equally share blame. CP3 might even catch some blame too for playing so poorly and not getting along with Harden
"&gt;Kawhi 3% higher true shooting percentage and a higher player efficiency rating.  LeBron's higher rebounding &amp; assists make up the difference and then some. LeBron's playmaking is also so much better &amp; more valuable than the total assist numbers indicate compared to Kawhi that it's not even close. That's why him and guys like James Harden are the best floor raisers in the league.  Also, PER is a useless stat with no validity to it whatsoever, so mentioning it is a non sequitur.  &gt;Lebron also has 3% higher usage rate and plays more minutes which also factors into why blindly looking at counting stats is not helpful.  LeBron has to play more minutes to carry his injured team (missing 3 top players and then 1 getting injured midgame). His playmaking alone is insanely valuable  LeBron's also arguably playing better defense than Kawhi this year, as crazy as it would sound to say if the year were 2016. 1st in Defensive Win Shares and Net Rating, really high opposing FG%, leading the #1 defense in the league (by far) on a team without their DPOY candidate.  There's a reason LeBron is ahead of Kawhi."
James Harden and/or Steph.
Yes all of that but also James Harden is James Harden.
James Harden is the clear MVP right now
"That's two time Excel model champ, James Harden to you."
Yeah I can tell why your kids don't respect you and it's not because of James Harden
Then why are you claiming harden to be better than LeBron fucking James
"Come on now Jrue holiday had no chance as a guard getting into the all-star game in the west Curry,Westbrook, Lillard,Chris Paul,James Harden,Klay,Kobe Bryant, ect. Plus he missed a year dealing with his wife."
James “6’5” Bol Bol” Harden
"&gt;Sure I can   &gt;   &gt;LeBron James, Stephen Curry, KD   &gt;   &gt;All **worse** than Harden  Fixed"
"Sure I can  LeBron James, Stephen Curry, KD  All better than Harden"
"Haters will say why not just rename the Houston home court FT line the ""James Harden Free Throw Stripe"""
&gt; Iso ball is real ball. Change my mind.  Is James Harden your GOAT and Savior?
"He likes rockets style James Harden, wait....."
Those two things have nothing to do with each other... Harden is the reason that team was historic. If any other player did that everyone on reddit would go crazy. If steph pushed that type of team to 7 games you'd never hear the end of it. But because its James Harden everyone continues to disrespect him.
I'm using the official height chart from the NBA site:  G: CP3 (6'0)  G: Stephen Curry (6'3)  F: James Harden (6'5)  F: Zion Williamson (6'7)  C: Bam Adebayo (6'9)
"You don't think James Harden (who should've won the mvp that year) with two all-nba teammates and a bench consisting of igodula, barnes, that australian center whos name I can't remember, and other great bench players couldn't beat a Lebrong +g-leagers? Remember irving played one game and love didn't play at all."
"I'll fucking kill someone for James Harden, fight me bitch"
We lost to James Harden and a bench mob when up by 20. NO LEAD IS SAFE!
James Harden would've won a championship if he didn't go 2/13 from 3 in a game 7.
"And? What does that have to do with anything? Whooopty doo he’s the franchises most second talented player..   Yao Ming in terms of importance is easily the rockets #2 most important of all time, what he did for the game of basketball to help it expand it globally is far more important than what Harden had done for that franchise.   Daryl Morey, is the #3 most important rocket of all time, he’s the mastermind behind bringing James to Houston as well as deciding to go at the Warriors instead of backing down.  This sub LOL"
"Yes... he does. A rookie hitting the series winning shot over James Harden after scoring 30pts and playing elite defense to hold Harden to 17 pts on 27% FG, his worst game of the series.  Whether you want it to be or not... that's legendary stuff."
.... is it crazy to say James Harden?
"Championships are not the end all be all of jersey retirements. Not every franchise is the Lakers or the Celtics. On top of that, Harden spent 8 full seasons as a Rocket (which is a longer tenure than most players have on one team). James Harden is the primary reason our team was relevant for the last 8 years. He won MVP as a Houston Rocket. Without James Harden, we probably spend most of the 2010s as a bottom tier playoff team or a late lottery team. From 1996 to 2012, the Rockets won 4 playoff series. In the Harden era, we won 7 playoff series. There is a reason that Rockets fans cape for this man so hard. The divorce was terrible, but he gave the bulk of his prime to us and we appreciate him. I feel like you guys have this opinion specifically because it’s Harden. If Dame was traded tomorrow, everyone would be saying his jersey deserves to be retired by Portland (and it does)."
Like a jersey retirement is a huge deal. If every James Harden gets a jersey retired there could be a jersey per team retired every year.
"That is such a hilariously dumb argument. Dort had that game because he was getting left completely alone and ignored on the perimeter because he had been so so so bad. Kawhi didn't get left alone despite playing with multiple hall of Famers because he was too good.  And Kawhi in his rookie year played in the WCF and primarily guarded ***KEVIN DURANT*** and... oh yeah James Harden lol. And put up an 18/10 game in game 2.  You'd think someone with those names in his username would remember that, but you only made your account like a month ago so I assume you're just a child"
Lololol what?? In ten years they will say “Back when james harden led the team to the playoffs” wow james the playoffs! What an accomplishment.
Everyone in this thread is saying this is premature but strip clubs have had his jersey retired for years.  Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportscasting.com/james-harden-spent-1-million-at-a-strip-club-and-got-his-rockets-jersey-retired/%3Famp
"I’m with you, I literally shouted laughing.   As if James Harden made some huge impact on the Rockets franchise, with those titles and showing up in playoffs, oh wait.  One MVP, a boatload of money for the PREVIOUS owner who sold, and disappointment in the playoffs. Sounds about the standard to get your number retired."
"It's all relative re: winning tho.    Think of it this way - retiring player #s is good PR.  Not every team is blessed with a history of winning handfuls of championships.  They aren't going to forego good PR merely because they weren't capable of winning a ring - which often times is a function of ownership, not the player.  There are only 8 teams in the league that have won 3+ championships.  If Harden doesn't deserve his number retired simply cuz he didn't get a ring with the Rockets (which appears to be your case here), you're basically saying that 2/3rds of the league is going to go multiple decades without retiring a single player number.  There is not a more compelling case from a guy that didn't win a ring than James Harden.    Ultimately I think you're seeing this from the perspective of a fan that roots for a team that has 17 titles.  It's not a realistic threshold for the majority of the league.  Otherwise you'd have 3-4 teams retiring dozens of numbers and 26-27 teams retiring just a few numbers every few decades."
"He had a 3 year stretch where he was basically all NBA. He was the prototype of how we think about the modern NBA guard.  As for Comp? On BS Book of basketball 2.0, they did the 2001 redraft and basically came away with Gilbert was James Harden before Harden. Shot with major range before it was mainstream and averaged damn near 30 when scores were 94-85.  Today, a Hybrid of Dame and Harden is probably what reminds me of prime Gil, just the ability to get to the rim, with range where you needed to guard him 30+ ft beyond the basket.  I also still have an irrational hate of Gerald Wallace because he's the one that fell into Gils knee, 8 games before the playoffs and we had home court in the first rd atleast, then we lost Caron and fell all the way to 7, then got pity swept by LeBron in the 1st rd. We had the best record at all star break and Eddie Jordan was the ASG East coach too. Ugh."
James Harden and Rudy Gobert
"WTF, I mean James Harden was a beast in Houston, he won the MVP while being there, but retiring his Jersey number? I wonder what Rockets fans are thinking about this"
"If we're being totally authentic, the first thing James Harden would need is a coach who'd buy into allowing him to fire at will from the 3-point line and beyond. He'd need a Don Nelson type who was open to ideas that seemed odd and unusual at the time. Otherwise, if James is transported to, like, 1986, there's a chance he lands with a coach who really, really hates the 3-pointer and wouldn't even want to hear anything about some new guy pushing to shoot from 30-feet plus all night.   Assuming Harden *did* find a spot that'd let him fire some trey balls, here's some other things to consider:   1. Carrying rules were much tighter. Even as recently as the late 90's and early 2000's, folks were still debating whether Allen Iverson's crossover was a carry and [Rafer Alston was getting lit up the moment he dribbled between his legs twice in a row.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgZp38dF9B0&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  2. Today's gather step was an easy travel call. The Euro-step wasn't even a known commodity; it was more of a quirk you'd see pop up every once in a blue moon that'd make you say, ""Oh, that was kind of a weird side step. May have gotten away with one there."" Guys like Sarunas or Archie Clark busted it out from time to time, but not nearly as elaborately as the modern version.   3. The step back was much less elaborate. [Your dribble was generally expected to be live until that last step.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKwKquEgn78&amp;ab_channel=FlyingKing)  4. Shooters weren't as much of a protected class. This doesn't mean shooters were roughed up or anything, but defenders were more readily able to close out without fear of being whistled for incidental contact. Shooting fouls near the 3-point line generally involved contact with the arm that affected the shot, not from shooters kicking their legs or leaning in.   5. [The rule of verticality had a bit more of a strict interpretation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7PjxQM4GAk&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen) If an offensive player left his shooting pocket intent only on initiating contact, it was often a no-call or offensive foul.    6. The game's rules interpretations generally didn't favor the offensive side of the ball quite as severely as we see today. Charges weren't *quite* as sensitive by the late 80's [but here's an example of what could be considered an offensive foul a couple years prior.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ovAC1IxxU&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  Have said all of that, virtually all players in today's game would have found a way to make it work. Really, we all have to tweak our games depending upon where we're playing, whether we're in the NBA or not. It's basketball code switching. There's things Harden would have to get used to not being able to do (just as he would when shifting to international ball) but he'd still find a way to be great."
"True point worth considering.   Most players from today would adjust their games over time if somehow transported 30 years into the past but certain modern evasive maneuvers pasted right into, say, 1988, just wouldn't fly. What was once considered an obviously illegal third step back then is now often considered a mere gather step. Even in the late 90's, young Allen Iverson's crossover spurred debate regarding whether he was carrying or not. Then there's the modern stepback...  In addition, shooters weren't quite as protected in previous eras. That doesn't mean it was open season on a dude mid-shot, but you were generally able to close out without fearing of being whistled for incidental contact you didn't create. Moreover, the lean-in fouls were a tougher whistle to draw and generally speaking, there weren't as many offensive escape valves when players had nothing cooking.   On the flip side, if James Harden ended up playing under an open-minded coach from that era - say, a Don Nelson - his ability to pull-up and hit from super deep would have really shook up the game back then; the same could be said for any of those mega-bombers today (Curry, Lillard, etc). We could sit and talk about hand-checking making that difficult (valid) but no era would know what to do with one of those guys pulling from 30+ in transition and hitting consistently."
And James Harden was 15th. Jersey sales are a horrible way to see how popular someone is.  My casual parents know who Harden is. His beard is hella recognizable.
"Meet James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Dirk and Derrick Rose!"
Except James Harden has been to the Finals before...
Yes. Forget about their roster and just remember that they traded James fucking Harden for Levert and picks.   The franchise is hopeless until the FO changes.
&gt; The physicality in the 80s  Only a handful of teams in the 80s played actual physical defense and the Pistons were fielding guys the same weight as James Harden at center.
"i know simmons was on the trading block earlier, but thats literally just for james harden. unless someone of that caliber becomes available again, imo its not worth it"
"I think you're underselling his physical tools a bit. Yeah he's not an elite run-and-jump athlete, but he's super flexible, very smooth, and good at changing speed and direction. Sort of like an SGA with elite passing skills. And like you mentioned, he has the frame to put on a good amount of muscle, which can be an underrated physical trait in evaluating talent.  People forget that when James Harden entered the draft, he was also viewed as a crafty but athletically limited player. Then he got into great shape once in the league and turned into a superstar.   [Jonathan Givony in 2009](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/College-Road-Report-Arizona-State-vs-UCLA---USC-3111/): ""The first thing that stands out about Harden is the fact that he is likely to be considered a below average athlete for the NBA level. His first step and pure explosiveness are nothing to write home about, meaning he has to find other ways to make his presence felt."" I'm not calling Givony out or anything. This was pretty much the consensus at the time."
Rockets are literally a lottery team without James Harden.
Trading Terry is James Harden all over again. Ainge fleeced!
Well you can say same about James harden. He was part of those wins.
"The fact Curry had a better career because he has been surrounded by an all-time team doesn't make him a better player than James Harden. He's still the best shooter of all time, I give him that."
Who has said that other than just redditors slurping the guy? He’s a clown and hates James Harden. Dude really carries his nose in the air breaking down basketball. Leaving James off the All-NBA teams should’ve exposed him to y’all.
&gt;Clippers never played the Jazz in the playoffs during the CP3 era  might want to double check that bud  houston had james harden and was just a better team. the suns arent better and the jazz will wax them and your precious captain
Tough choice as there’s no good comparison for Lamelo so it’s hard to tell what his ceiling is. While for Edward it’s pretty clear he’s going to be in the mold of James Harden (very ball dominant scorer with well above average playmaking) if he actually reaches his potential
maybe i've just been spoiled by James Harden but I'm surprised the Heat record is only seven straight. I would've imagined James or Wade had longer streaks
"I think James Harden had a serious point. Granted Christian Wood has been injured, and I think they’ll be much better with him on the floor, that team sucks pretty bad."
Bro you’re joking right 😂 James is better then Dame Kyrie and Dame are closer then Dame is to Harden and CJ 😂 he’s solid but isn’t even a factor harden and Kyrie by a light year.
\[Stephen A.\]: James Harden and Lebron James are clear MVP favorites.
"&gt;Its crazy how James Harden has proven the haters that called him a selfish ball hog wrong and completely reinvented his game since coming to Brooklyn    Yes, now he's basically just Westbrook   But wait.. Westbrook still got called a selfish ball hog and one dimensional ISO player that never works in the playoffs. But Harden or someone else getting a lot of ""Triple dubs"" apparently means something completely different, eh?   &gt;  Funny irony  &gt;  **Edit**:  And don't forget. The Nets franchise really has no competition, when it comes to breaking ""franchise records"".  Clippers are the same. CP3 was the best player in Clippers franchise, and for the Nets.. I don't even know"
If James Harden stayed with the rockets and they go on like this imagine the hate.
"It’s not inner city, but it’s LA county! I crew up in Cerritos lol. Crazy to think I saw Harden dunk on my HS team (Gahr). Same school district, so it happened plenty. Almost went to Artesia. Lived down the street. Missed out on going to strip clubs with James Harden.   Weird that the school is not on Artesia or in the City of Artesia.   All them players, play like Kobe."
"Curry Lillard LeBron James KD AD  Curry and Lillard are excellent floor spacers who you can't leave open. Check the 2021 ASG; I think they'd be a better fit than Curry and Harden. LeBron will be on-ball the whole time because he makes the right decision pretty much every time on offense. If KD buys into making quick decisions and playing off-ball a la 2017 Warriors, then this team will have really good synergy. AD and Curry are scalable to any team and do not need the ball to be effective. So it's a well-balanced onslaught of jump shooting and off-ball movement, from a heliocentric, LeBron-lead offense. Can't go wrong.  I would consider adding Jokic, but I don't really want to have the ball outside of LeBron's hand all too much."
One of my older classmates in college told me he worked with James Harden’s hs bball team when harden was in hs. Can’t remember if he was an assistant coach or a just a general assistant with the team
[miles bridges ](https://youtu.be/77Tz7eCPXXI) [James Harden](https://youtu.be/gRyKJVcZKPY)
James harden makes any big look good.
"Luka is really more like James Harden than any other player. I can see Jokic in Bird, but Bird operated primarily from the perimeter which makes a huge difference."
PG: James Harden  SG: Kyrie Irving  SF: Matisse Thybulle  PF: Giannis  C: Embiid  This team would be extremely good lol
"Oh for sure lol. I still follow D-Mo but as a fan you gotta understand where it's coming from in terms of campaigning for awards and boosting your guy.   I remember watching him on [Nadeshot's podcast](https://twitter.com/Rockets_Insider/status/1162108073399463946) when he said ""It's just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan..."". He wasn't being hot takey at all and used a PPP/stats based argument to big up Harden, but the fact that he made the case for it at all was wild lol. He just deeply believes in his guys and rides harder for them than any other GM, especially regarding awards and honors. Same goes for Doc"
"Well, Jeff Green shot 56% from the floor and 37% from three (43% in the playoffs) in Houston.   I think there's a component that is related to playing with James Harden, as Rivers, Tucker, Faried, all had career highs across the board playing with him."
"The only difference is Randle jumped higher than Harden.      I don't expect referees to be perfect, but Scott Foster literally made the hand signal for ""contact with the ball"" on the James Harden play AND THEN ADMITTED there was contact with the ball to the pool reporter asking about the Randle play.      This isn't a guy being inconsistent or blowing a call and getting the other one right. He literally changed his interpretation of the rule during the game."
"Kawhi Leonard, I do find his dry way of interviewing to be hilarious at times, he let his personality whether it was intentional or not show a little bit starting in Toronto but I do not find his game enjoyable to watch even though I respect the skill           Anthony Davis and James Harden as well, again I respect the talent, respect the skill just certain things about their game don't translate to me as far as being entertaining"
I mean James harden is leading the nets in rebounding and is 4th in the league in RPG
THE NARRATIVE FOR JAMES EDWARD HARDEN CHANGES DAILY
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"James and Russ were never a good fit. Phenomenal players individually but just a god awful fit.  Houston trading for Russ was the beginning of the end for the Harden era. They were my west team and was hoping they would win it all if Celts didn’t given I’d love for Harden, Russ &amp; PJ to get that ring but alas."
"He may do It sometimes but I can't objectively tell, since I haven't seen James Harden basketball that much to say so. What I am sure though is that he definitely doesn't need to do It to be an amazing player."
Foul waiting almost makes the nba unwatchable.  That's why I don't watch james harden play. It is soft and instead of rewarding good basketball skills. It rewards exploiting foul rules. I'll pass on watching that.
More like James harden can borderline do anything aside from acquire motivation to play high iq defense  Edit : and stay away from thots
"Yes because the MVP is only won by defensive masterminds such as the likes of *checks notes* James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Stephen Curry"
"That team was loaded Prime KD, Westbrook, ascending James Harden, and Serge Ibaka."
"Whenever I saw people say “reinvented” or “Wow James Harden is not a ball hog” I just laughed. Dude has been doing the same thing year over year in Houston, literally. He didn’t change one bit now that he’s in Brooklyn. Just nobody paid attention, but they had no problem hating him, it’s freaking hilarious."
"&gt;Its crazy how James Harden has proven the haters that called him a selfish ball hog wrong and completely reinvented his game since coming to Brooklyn.  He averaged more assists and more points in 16-17. He's always been this guy, he's just taking less of a scoring burden."
Why pick on Joe Harris?  The exact same thing happened with James Harden a few moments before and no one criticized him.  It was a trap play and the Knicks did a good job getting hands on the ball for the jump.  Joe Harris didn't fuck up.
Yup and then he got to fuck James Harden over against the Warriors every year. Fun times.
This dudes insufferable and likely just a troll. KDs nets were a pedestrian 7-6 and then they traded for James fucking harden. There’s only so much one player can do. That’s why it’s a team game.
James harden is and always has been the poster boy for phantom calls
I have never seen anyone use that many words to be that reductive and myopic.   If the system is as rigid as you say it is James Harden is almost 100% certain to win the MVP. True or false?
[Same ref called it completely differently when James harden did it earlier in the game](https://twitter.com/PhilipDamiano/status/1371656606287601668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1371656606287601668%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2Flists%2Fknicks-vs-nets-julius-randle-kyrie-irving-travel).
"Now that all 13 are out I'll bite the bullet and rank my personal peaks based on these videos alone.  1. Lebron James, simply put that version of Lebron is quite literally unstoppable on both sides of the court.   2. Shaquille O'Neal, I would have him #1 but in terms of offensive dominance only Steph really rivals him but in other avenues.  3. David Robinson, yes really, criminally underrated stretch for him that gets overshadowed by Hakeem. In those years he was either scoring leader, blocks leader, DPOY, or all of those.  4. Steph Curry, really wanted to have him higher and don't get me wrong Steph is an underrated defensive player but the 3 ahead of him brought it both ways at a high level but Currys offense alone catapults him over a bunch of 2 way guys in this list.  5. Kevin Garnett, another one that's probably a head scratcher but hear me out. At his peak he was an MVP, first team all defense, first team all nba, and was able to drag a lifeless team to the WCF as a supposed not #1 option. We can have the debate about Duncan being better all time which is not debatable imo but I've always said I'd take peak Garnett over Peak Duncan.  6. Michael Jordan, this isn't to say Jordan isn't better than these ppl, just that the stretch Ben chose (although valid) I personally would have gone back a year on each to account for 1988 when he was DPOY, MVP, but to each their own.  7. Tim Duncan, again like Garnett you had someone who was MVP, First team all nba and defense, and was winning finals MVPs. I guess I underestimated his defensive value because I only watched him 2010 and on when (to me) it seemed like he was just a post defender.  8. Hakeem Olajuwon, really Hakeem should be higher but like Jordan, his PEAK wasn't much better than his career (which is a compliment) so he falls to the wayside.  9. Larry Bird, now this is tough because Larry was god tier on both sides of the ball but not quite dominant in the sense that ppl like Shaq or Hakeem were.   10. Kobe Bryant, this is tough again because the game was different and Kobe's game was heavily ""mid 2000s"" with tons of mid range jumpers and contested fadeways. The fact that he was first team all defense while averaging 35 a game says something though.  11. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tremendous peak but really he was good for his entire career even until his 40s which hurts him IMO. 6 MVPs with his first being in 1971 and the last being in 1980 means his career was basically a peak, much like lebron.  12. Magic Johnson, wasn't too impressed with his video and this is me being young and not understanding his impact. Very good offensive player but very poor defensive player on anyone who was laterally quick and didn't play in the post.  13. Bill Walton, least impressive peak by far but not someone I even expected on this list. Never knew how good of a passer and shot blocker he was.  He didn't post these but here are some good honorable mentions:  - 08/09 Dwyane Wade - 17-19 James Harden - 15-17 Russell Westbrook - 90-93 Charles Barkley - 16-18 Lebron - 07-09 Lebron - 75-78 Julius Erving"

James harden had a similar play happen earlier in the game and they allowed him to play on
"Well from the words of another promising young player Jarrett Allen ""I would have traded myself too for James Harden"". In the end, both teams are happy cause I doubt the Nets could have gotten away with resting KD like this without Harden"
&gt; It’s one game you’re talking about. You can’t use outliers like it’s the norm.  James Harden does shit like that all the time though lol
"&gt;All players who were 1st in VORP without winning MVP have a J in their name (LeBron James, James Harden).  they also have an A,M,E,S in there somewhere"
Six 9 ass snitching lebron always crying to the refs him and James harden akin to69
Jimmy “James Harden” Buckets
"I mean bro, Lakers are a strong team, but not a super team. We don’t have three absolute stars, just two.   If you told someone that the nets would have Kevin Durant, Kylie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan with Steve Nash fucking coaching them they wouldn’t believe it. They probably would try to send David Stern into the future to stop it."
"NBA's headline right now ""**Nets hold off Knicks' late push to win 5th straight**: Kyrie Irving scores 34 and James Harden gets a triple-double as red-hot Brooklyn survives New York's rally."" It's all about the narrative now"
"Spurs, but that 2017 defense was already so bad removing Lebron there would make it worse but the offense will surely skyrocket it was already a historic offense but adding James Harden there would've been crazy."
It’s the James Harden school of basketball and he’s been teaching his entire team.
James Harden is very good :(
Seeing as how he deferred PG duties to James Harden I'll say Harden is the 2nd best PG behind Steph
"I mean I think it's definitely something that is considered. I think narrative is just a way of contextualizing their situation. You could say James Harden won't win the MVP this year because of the narrative that despite amazing stats and (potentially) a ton of wins, because of how he left Houston &amp; the fact that he has KD and Kyrie on his team, voters won't really consider him."
"Memphis could have had James Harden, Steph Curry or DeMar DeRozan if they hadn't drafted Hasheem Thabeet"
If that’s the trade I agree that they passed on James. No way i’m giving Herro and Bam for Harden. Always thought it was just for tyler and pieces.
Make sure you post this in a lot of places because by only posting it in a thread about James Harden you are skewing your results to only survey people who would click on this thread.
"James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook  The first basketball I watched was the OKC 3"
So now you’re telling me that James harden SHOULD win because he very clearly isn’t the best player this year? Now I can see your argument
"Nah, if I looked back and saw James Harden won MVP 17, 18, 19 I’d think it was a useless award too. Yes it’s regular season but there’s obviously added context. Otherwise Lebron would have 10 of them"
When coaches game plan do they say “okay guys today our game plan is to stop James harden!” No. They say “okay our game plan is going to be trying to stop James harden Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving.”  Edit: and harder shots?? That’s just straight false
"Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, Lebron James, James Harden"
"Ah yes, because it was just James Harden that missed all 27 of those 3s"
James Harden turned down 50m to no longer be with you. And you got SHIT in return.   Shut the fuck up
"James harden, Joel Embid for now"
James Harden should be the MVP frontrunner after Embiid went down. He's been unreal.
James is James he went to a team with 2 other stars and instantly became the daddy. Because he's the fucking man soon to be leading the east hell fuckin yeah he deserves to be top 3 hes JAMES FUCKIN HARDEN
watching james harden orchestrate a flowing offense is so fucking fun
"Thank you Sean Marks for trading for James harden. We could have 3 MVP candidate players on the floor at any point, any game"
Who knew the only thing that Jeff green needed to be consistent is james harden
"James Harden, Omer Asik, chandler parsons and Jeremy Lin went to the playoffs  edit: coached by Kevin McHale"
"Because he only really has too elite offensive seasons. Lebron has a bunch, MJ has a bunch, arguably Harden has bunch too. You could argue Currys one-two year peak is outstanding at no one will deny it, but if you look at stats like OBPM Steph has one season in the top 20, Jordan has 7, James has 3, Harden has 2. One good season doesn’t give you the title of best all time anything."
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"A team with James Harden and Chris Paul was the only possible combination of players that could get more people to root for the Warriors instead of against them, that’s honestly an achievement in itself"
"It’s disgusting that Stephen Silas had to inherit this. Black coaches always have to get rebuild jobs to start their head coaching career. I still can’t believe Fertitta really traded James Harden to the Nets for nothing, he should be a 76er rn with Ben on the Rockets."
"This is gonna sound nitpicky because I agree with the spirit of your comment (James Harden should have made an All NBA team that year), but how does being two assists and four rebounds away from a triple double qualify as averaging ""near"" one?"
"James harden- Doesn't matter what anyone says. You can put him on a team full of bums and I'll be like, ""Yeah, he's taking them to the playoffs."" Plus him rarely being injured/out for games makes him so valuable imo. Nowadays it so common for stars to be missing games constantly, that its actually nice to have someone as durable as him on your team.   Chris paul- helping the suns grab a top seed in the west this years just shows how big of a difference a traditional point guard can still have on a team. Although he's getting up there in age after the suns if he willing to take a back seat and help mentor a young high draft pick point guard....I'll throw him some cash."
"Nobody is pretending otherwise. That being said, James Harden is way better."
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"When James Harden said they weren't good enough, this is what he meant.  Could you imagine Harden on this team, putting up 40/11/11 just to lose by 10 instead of by 20"
"Brooklyn’s super stars: KD, James Harden, Deandre Jordan"
They had James Harden...
"If there's a guy that can make Mason Plumlee look like a good basketball player, it's James Harden.  That being said, I've never been a fan of Plumlee."
James Harden
Where did you see James Harden throwing a tantrum? And where did he quit on fans and teammates? He was still out there playing like he was contractually obligated to.
Problem is Lowry isn’t James harden and Lowry also isn’t on a contract with more than 1 year
"&gt;Houston, Dallas, Denver and Golden State have also expressed notable interest in Gordon dating back to November's draft. Orlando's asking price appears reasonable, seeking a combination of picks and young players. It's uncertain what youngster the Timberwolves would have sent the Magic, but before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure."
"also did you [see this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2936163-rival-nba-execs-see-major-trade-opportunity-in-orlandos-available-stars), werent you the one who months ago said you would trade Caris LeVert for Aaron Gordon. Apparently the Nets tried! Article says ""before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure.""  So it sounds like they wanted LeVert and more than a bottom 2020 first perhaps back then.   Also sounds like he's generating more buzz than Vucevic: ""Vucevic's market does not seem nearly as vast.'"
"Hey buddy message me when the Sixers make it pass the second round, [don’t forget even your own team doesn’t think they have enough](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/76ers-were-so-sure-of-james-harden-deal-that-ben-simmons-was-told-to-expect-a-trade-per-report/amp/)"
Kevin Durant would absolutely have been made to bulk up to play the 4 and be an injury risk from day 1 after having stayed at Texas for two more years. James Harden would be made to play off ball two with his creativity restricted to mid range jumpers. Every NBA owner of 1990s is just as dumb as the OKC owner who traded him for peanuts. The real statement is can you imagine if the NBA had decision makers like Darryl Morey in the 90s. The NBA had a very tough time transitioning from a big man’s league. 1999-2007 are some dark days. Harden and Durant are lucky to have hit the league when they did in alot of regards.
&gt; Y'all had a front row seat to Steph eliminating Harden four times in the last six years yet you still have doubts?  Title of the thread:  2021: Who's better Steph Curry or James Harden?  End of the thread:   &gt; So who do you think is better in 2021?  Feel free to pick Curry but what has happened four of the last six years doesn't matter at all in the context of the thread.
"Haha dude that is trolling. Idk what else to say here and you can describe it however you want, but you are being an online troll by “sarcastically and facetiously” saying things online to generate a response. As long as you can see that is what you are doing, nothing wrong with messing with strangers on the internet. All I’m saying is that you aren’t really having a discussion with me, and also that James Harden is actually an ass NBA player who wouldn’t even start if not for poor officiating."
"I mean, yeah, that is what I said. That it’s not as impressive for him (or anyone else) to be “great at drawing fouls” when it’s being done with refs who aren’t the best at their job. Is that a take you disagree with? And if so, why?  Then you chose to read that as “James Harden is only good because of NBA ref nepotism” which isn’t what I said.  This is genuinely textbook straw man arguing. You changed the initial discussion from “ref nepotism is bad” to “James Harden isn’t only good because of the refs”. And now that we are discussing your newly interjected topic, you are resorting back to my original comment (which wasn’t really about Harden at all) to validate your view."
"Smh at people who refuse to actually read what others have wrote and instead interject their own straw man argument into any post. No where in my post do I say anything even close to “Harden is only good because of the refs”, but glad you were able to read my mind.  If you just enjoy being a troll, have at it. As long as you realize what you are doing is more or less arguing with yourself about how right you are. Two things can be true at once- James Harden is an elite ball handler, finisher, playmaker and shooter. And he also egregiously baits fouls in a way that is unmatched across the league. Which is a discussion that has been had on this sub hundreds of times. But glad we got to rehash it here."
"Don't get me wrong, when I saw that James Harden was available for a moment, I thought the same thing, ""If we had Harden instead of Mitchell, we would be title favorites."" Unfortunately though, those things are just a pipe dream for small market teams, because players like James Harden are never going to force a trade from their team to go to a place like Utah. I feel like even if the Jazz won 3 titles in a row, that'd still be the case."
"The Hawks have been missing Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Okongwu for the first 20 games, now we are missing John Collins, before we had Capela go down, then Bogdanovic and then Gallo.  Heck, when we had Rondo, he barely played and we STILL haven't played a single minute with Dunn.  Every club has injuries.  Even the Lakers and even the Celtics.  The core of the team is Tatum first and then Brown.  When you have those two all-stars, most teams don't need more than that.  The problem with the Celtics is that they are top heavy.  After Tatum and Brown, you don't have any starter caliber players.   Fournier is not a star.  The Magic with him, Ross, Gordon and Nikola Vucevic still looked bad.  Then IMHO, they trade for Fournier but should have traded for Vucevic.  The problem is your GM, Danny Ainge.  Outside of Tatum and Brown, nothing.  Could have had James Harden."
"Its almost like one team has multiple top 10 players in the league and the other doesnt.  Oh no, Kevin Durant is out.... guess we just have to settle for James Harden."
"RIP James ""Lonnie Walker IV"" Harden"
Harden's option isn't until the following season [according to Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/james-harden-6312/)
"I've said it for a couple years now and I'll keep saying it: He's the 7ft James Harden. Handles, shooting, ego, foul baiting, and how it's simultaneously fun and not fun to watch both their games."
He is refereed differently  Cause he’s the James harden of big men   He knows how to draw fouls
"His playmaking is under rated. Its not james harden or chris paul level but it's better than what people give him credit to.   He's not really good at scoring and dribbling though. He's elite at it and is very efficient when it comes to his shot making ability.   If I need a bucket on the nets, I rather give the ball to Kyrie, than Harden."
"James Harden with Jrue Holiday as his primary defender the last 3 seasons: 17/49 from the field (34.7%), 22 assists, 23 turnovers, 6 shooting fouls drawn  2017-18: 7/16 from the field, 18 points, 13 assists, 5 turnovers, 1 shooting foul drawn  2018-19: 8/27 from the field, 27 points, 6 assists, 11 turnovers, 2 shooting fouls drawn  2019-20: 2/6 from the field, 7 points, 3 assists, 7 turnovers, 3 shooting fouls drawn  [Matchup Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201950/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*HARDEN)"
"People love to tout accomplishments of players when they're playing, but the first and most important ability is availability.  Steph and especially KD are not durable players.  The Warriors lost the 2019 NBA Finals primarily because their best player, Kevin Durant, got injured in game 1.  The Nets were a 7-seed in 2020 because their best player, Kevin Durant, was out for the whole season.  The 2015 Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs because their best player, Kevin Durant, was injured for most of the season.  In the 2016 playoffs Steph Curry's play regressed a fair amount from his regular season MVP performance - rolling his ankle and being injured for 6 playoff games likely didn't do him any favors.  James Harden has **never** had a significant injury - I was legitimately shocked to see the news that Harden will be out for at least 10 days with a hamstring injury.  I would bet that if the playoffs were today, Harden would play through it.  But I cannot remember a time where Harden had to miss more than a week because of injury.  Sure, when they play at full health, Durant and Curry may be better than Harden.  But the only player in the past 10 years anyone can argue is anywhere near as durable as Harden is Lebron.  Doesn't this count for something?"

"Ikr? The players who are or have played in the league usually put James as the king.   Next in line to dethroning would be in its own class and consists of Durant, Leonard and Giannis in no particular order.  Everyone else isn't in the same tier as those players, according to most of what I've seen from nba players in media.  Maybe Davis and Harden are close to this list and maybe Embiid.  They don't mention Curry until after those names are mentioned.  Probably something to consider, regardless of how much you agree or disagree, it's very interesting to see how much they value physical talent before anything else.  Again this isn't so much about jealousy as it is physical limitations and scheming around it in the playoffs from what I gather anyway."
James Harden being #1 in win shares for the previous 4 seasons is incredible wtf.
James Harden to the Pelicans?
"I hate James Harden so much, but whenever he touched the ball in the Rockets series I felt like 5e Warriors were absolutely doomed"
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31204977/james-harden-miss-least-10-days-brooklyn-nets-kevin-durant-likely-return-wednesday  You were saying?
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31204977/james-harden-miss-least-10-days-brooklyn-nets-kevin-durant-likely-return-wednesday  Did I stutter?
"Yeah I guess there’s like 20 guys that could make any given top 10 lists based on different criteria. I think history will view his career more favorably long term as more and more guys move to stacked teams to contend. People are somehow still more upset about KD going where he wanted in free agency than James harden and AD forcing their way off teams while under contract. Taking away front office and contract moves, his career is spectacular and his accolades numerous. He’s been an all star (11x) and all NBA (6x 1st 3x 2nd) every year he’s been healthy. 4x scoring champ. League MVP. 2x finals MVP. R0Y. 27/7/4/1/1 over a 13 year career on very good shooting splits. That’s a lot of buckets and production and it’s been sustained over a very long period of time through different eras. He’s been a top 3 player in the league for over a decade. Kd is the most lethal and unstoppable scorer ever, and at its core basketball is about putting the ball thru the hoop. Kd does that, and can get it at every level: inside, post game, driving and finishing at the rim, midrange and from deep. He can just shoot over everyone and there’s very few he can’t also get by. He’s also not done, being currently very well situated to make another finals run and continue adding to those accolades. If he can stay healthy there’s no reason to believe his game won’t age very well either as his size will always allow him to get shots off and the shots will always be pure."
"I dont give a fuck about these useless stats everyday im seeing a post saying some shit like ""James Harden is the first person to have 16 points 10 assists and 11 rebounds balhdasbdasj15 r8343 u23i4u 234 9392 j""""""""""""""?""""???errorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
There’s a guy saying he’s happy the Nets will beat the Sixers because he doesn’t like Embiid getting so many calls. Wait till he learns about James Harden
"Rodman is insane, dirty, and assaulted a camera man  Garnett is my all time least favorite player other than Pedo Malone. He was a dick to everyone, even mocking Tim Duncan's dead mother on mothers day  Lamar Odom was a criminal that would do anything to make money  Metta World Peace is insane and tried to murder James Harden   Iggy is a really good guy, no problems with him  Rondo is an arrogant bitch and a stain on the Celtics history  Jimmy Butler is fine  Magic Johnson is one of my favorite players, but also one of my team's biggest rivals   If he replaced Butler and Iggy with Karl Malone and Blake Griffin this would be my all time least favorite players list"
MJ shooting more 3's would be a fucking travesty. He's Michael fucking Jordan not James Harden.
Joel ‘James Harden’ Embiid
"The only realistic dark horse I could see is if Luka keeps this hot streak up and somehow gets a top 3 seed. Outside of that, I don’t possibly see MVP going to someone not naked Giannis, James Harden, or my favorite to win it, Jokic. LeBron and Embiid missed too many games, and I don’t see the blazers winning enough games or Lillard having an impressive enough season to warrant winning as a lower seed."
2009:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Demar DeRozan  Blake Griffin  Taj Gibson  6th man: Jrue Holiday
"It’s not dumb at all. It’s actually completely logical and anybody who knows literally anything about the sport would agree. You’re fucking wrong, sorry.  Do you think Norman Powell is a better isolation scorer than James Harden - yes or no?"
They went from James Harden to a legitimate virgin
That's James Harden for you.
James Harden doesn't exist?
Injury Report: James Harden (Had to carry two divas for half a season)
PG: DJ Augustin / Steph Curry  SG: James Harden / Bradley BEal  SF: LeBron / kd  pf draymond / rudy gay   center embiid / nick olayokich

"I’d add harden to that list, unless he was what you meant by ‘James’ instead of including LeBron’s last name."
both james harden and nikola jokic are good rebounders. what are you talking about lol
James Harden is easily the biggest
 James Harden has asthma
"Chris paul height, zion weight, jokic vertical, curry wingspan, Giannis shooting stroke, james harden belly"
"James harden, dont care what he did in Houston, his play in brooklyn has been completely absurd. Jokic not far behind though"
you consider Simmons a better passer than Jokic? I wouldn’t even put Simmons in the same tier as James Harden (whose a top 5 passer)
Nobody can lockdown James Harden
"Nobody can ""lockdown"" James Harden anyway"
James harden and trae young are just unbearable to watch now
Lol clearly didn’t watch that season. He won 56 games and finished 2nd in the west with Dwight out 41 games. Did you watch the playoffs? Using raw stats it’s clearly James setting up Dwight constantly and getting east buckets. 16 a game is an extremely weak 2nd option. That’s what Oladipo put up on the “trash” 16-17 aways you okc fans always go on about it. So what is it? Dwight wasn’t trash but Oladipo was.  And once again you don’t know your basketball history and are confusing years. Harden beat Russ in ‘17. Russ has never even been good enough to get smacked in the 2nd round by an old man Manu because he couldn’t get out of the 1st even with All NBA Paul George.  Keep the mental gymnastics going buddy.
"[Steph Curry: ""I talked to James [Harden] in the back...obviously complemented him on what he's done. First thing he says is, it's fun, but I want to play different. Playing by myself or w/e, heroball -- he don't want to play like that. A system where they can actually play beautiful basketball.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jtat8t/steph_curry_i_talked_to_james_harden_in_the/)"
"It depends on which Era of rules the game will use, back in Jordan’s time, players would get into fist fights and only given personal fouls.... sure hardens a better shooter, but if Jordan can play physical defense and harden doesn’t get to score 20+ point from the free throw line it would be closer than u let on....   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1902401-james-harden-scores-27-points-despite-making-only-2-shots-from-the-field"
"Hitler, James Harden used to get compared to him a lot."
"Kyrie is 6th in the league in scoring, doesn’t sound like Alfred to me.  He averages 29.0 when playing next to Harden, 26.5 next to KD.  Durant averages 25.3 when the big 3 plays together, Kyrie averages 26.3, Harden averages 20.4.  I really wish people would stop with this “Kyrie is a 3rd option” talk. He has just as much offensive say as James and KD do, and he scores more then both of them when they are all on the floor."
The James Harden special
James Harden Is Literally Hitler
And they changed the continuation calls after James Harden played the refs so hard with it.
"There would definitely be guys scared of playing LeBron, Harden, KD because of how hard they can embarrass them. There aren't many enforcers anymore for players to fear physically though. Probably just James Johnson but it's not like he's ever actually socked anyone"
Wait till the nba finds out about James harden...
"That post was very misleading. Many of those games without Harden were without the big 3 and the ones with Harden are mostly with Kyrie and/or KD. Also, these two games Kyrie have won when James left the games are gonna count in the win column for Harden despite playing just 4 minutes this game and being down around 15 points in the Houston game when he left."
"The biggest mismatch for us not including the Bucks and Sixers are the Bulls, the Nets biggest weakness is sharp shooting 5's and Vuc is a certified Nets killer.  I'm not dismissing the Knicks defense, but you do realize the Nets had 5 players out this game right... and two of those guys are Kevin Durant and James Harden. Our best and biggest win over the Knicks was with just Durant right after the Harden trade and Kyrie on his sabbatical. If they let up this many points to the hobbled skeleton Nets, it's definitely not gonna be better when the Nets are healthy."
What if you sell a vodka brand that markets exclusively to dancers/strippers/escorts? James Harden is going to make millions off that idea.
He wasn’t drawing fouls like James Harden we were inexplicably walking him on every drive for some reason
"Coming off the bench: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, and Hames Harden."

James Harden. He just wants to take free throws all day
It's so sad that James Harden died of ligma
It’s a shame that James Harden died on national television

"1. Manu Ginóbili  2. Kevin McHale (1 and 2 are interchangeable but i went with Manu on number 1 since i have seen that season live, and from McHales season i have seen only highlights)  3. Toni Kukoč  4. James Harden  5. Lamar Odom  6. Detlef Schrempf  7. Jamal Crawford  8. Lou Williams ( 7 and 8 also interchangeable easily both Crawford and Williams were completely one dimensional as an 6th man)"
James Harden in my top 10 in that case
For James harden who’s a perfect fit for embiid? I think it’s a no brainer
"Foul baiting. See James Harden arm hooks, Lou Will/Luka/Trae jumping into defenders for fouls off screens."

James Harden
Rocket fans are annoying when it comes to James Harden.
"im sorry he cant solo james harden and chris paul (as if anyone can)  the ""run off the court"" shit is just false but w/e bro, you can keep saying it.  i wasnt going to respond but you replied to me twice so i felt bad for you"
AD or James Harden for the Raptors
"I said they became way too predictable not that they were always that way. Also, the Rockets use to go with PJ Tucker and Luc at the 5 all the time that year, especially vs the Warriors. I think Luc was injured which hurt them  It's the next year when KD was injured that Capela was becoming nearly unplayable because Draymond could effectively box him out and take away his lobs because of how predictable they were.   Then in the regular season other teams started doing and this was causing way too pressure on James Harden that they basically stopped running pick and rolls with him even without Westbrook.   Yeah he was injured and the spacing was bad with westbrook, but the rockets were getting increasing low on Capela even without those things pushing them to go over the edge into full time small ball."
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol
"In terms of defending 1-5, it’s just a matter of consistently avoiding biting on fakes for Rob because he’s actually really solid at it when he can. He’s had possessions where he’s locked up guys like Trae Young and James Harden when he stays under control, and he forced terrible shots, blocking Harden and Trae’s being way off, because his length is so disruptive for a smaller guy if Rob can stay close."
I hope this is considered for MVP. I can't think of any other player that comes close to him now that Lebron James is out. If Harden gets it I swear to god...
"&gt;Keep telling yourself that man, go to the lakers sub and not one would rally by your side.   Argument by authority is meaningless, especially when the alleged authority is r/lakers.  &gt;AD and lebron won us a ring and thats all that matters.  That is precisely not all the matters, and this is childishly naive, and borderline stupid.  It is possible to win a ring while losing a trade, and not only has it been done, the Lakers have done it on at least one occasion previously.  You'll be hard-pressed to find even one person on r/lakers who can name that trade, however, unless they search my comment history.  &gt;He was the main recruiter for AD. Dont trade for him? Alryt you are pissing off literally one of best chance we have of even getting a ring.  James was also simultaneously recruiting Jimmy Butler -- who would have been available without that staggering overpayment and whose acquisition still results in a Championship -- and others. That's a serious problem for your alleged logic.  &gt;I'm sure ingram lonzo hart and a pissed off lebron would get us a ring over the clippers and the current nets  And a Davis with a chronic leg injury -- on top of his lengthy list of other injuries -- will?  That same Davis who signed as a free agent in December, which means they gave away all those players and picks to rent him for one season?  Why did the Lakers pay far more to rent Davis for 1 season than Brooklyn did for two seasons of Harden?  Is Davis three times the player Harden is?"
James Harden?
James Harden
"James Harden has the most foul shots in the game, yet he's never been fouled."
"Harden is the Nets, currently. Without him they have no chance of winning either conference or championship.   There is no way KD and Kyrie would carry the team on their own. If have never seen them do that, they are always role players to a James, Curry, etc...  And OKC didn’t count for KD or Harden, as they never really achieved as much as was expected."
James harden
"—James Harden during trade negotiations, January 2021"
"He’s been doing that, people started calling him the 7 foot James Harden for a few years now"
"Well, he'd have to go 14-0 to equal what Harden was doing.  (And James didn't have Allen and LeVert helping him out)"
"You don’t think there’s a difference when talking about high minute players on the same team ...   It’s not like you have any statistical argument besides hey, I like James Harden Lmaoo."
"I mean I hate James Harden and Trey Young as much as the next guy, but you can’t convince me Jokic has literally ever gotten a fair whistle. If he oversells contact now it’s out of desperation and exasperation with the hundreds of egregious no calls he had experienced in his short career."
Is steph going to get the same hate players who put pup stats on loosing teams get lol? Trae was clowned for putting up similar stats on a trash team. Same for guys like booker and  Kat   But really the only two guys I’ve seen consistently take trash teams to the playoffs are James Harden and Lebron James
Bruh how you gon claim one is more important than the other when they have damn near never played together? We don't know what this team will actually look like at the end all we know is James harden is good in the regular season. Which is what we've known for 10 years.
"Lmao, ironic considering how Rockets fans completely fucking absolved James Harden of any wrongdoing in the 2018 WCF and intentionally glossed over his 34 turnovers in that series, hahahaha"
Another MVP worthy season for James Harden. I hope he gets a second MVP to cement his legacy
gotta give morey some props for trying to get james harden with ben simmons   not many gms would have had the audacity
Curry actually has a much higher offensive on/off than Harden. James had a better on/off last year but 2012-2019 were all in Curry's favor.
"Lol did you miss the game 5 and 6 of SAS. 1 minute rest ain’t gonna help Harden.  Harden was playing 36 mins on empty tank, not like he could bounce back by simply playing 35 mins.  Example - Lebron had 29 points and only played 39 minutes. Even if he “run out gas” by playing more, he still won’t be slandered like harden as he had 29 points.  So when people say Lebron has to sit, it’s just typical rest but his team still collapse ([net](https://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/3772/when-lebron-james-takes-a-breather-cavs-continue-to-fall-flat) eff, on - +19.5 off - 109.7)"
"I would have put Nets above the clippers, if it wasn’t for the injuries (especially Harden).   Also, Paul George is playing great and has something to prove.   Lakers were always my top choice. They maintained the 2nd best defense in the league without their two best players, and they have one of the top three players of all time, LeBron James.   They just gotta put the pieces together, and they’re gonna have 3-4 weeks to do that."
How about the NBA players are just female. Like we got female anime James Harden going to male strip clubs.
"The fact is that Lebron is the best floor raiser ever according to Ben Taylor's measurements.    The biggest problem with Lebron is that he is such a ball-dominant floor raiser though...    So having a player like Luka, James Harden or Trae Young next to Lebron would be a ' superteam' but they wouldn't work together like a super team.    Lebron has always had a tendency to change the mechanisms of the teams he is on. Even when Lebron was a youngin in his first stint in Cleveland the team literally changed itself around him and in 2009 the team made a huge overhaul for more shooters to surround LBJ.   I feel like Kyrie had the same problem with Lebron."
"&gt;**They could have** a starting line up with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, and Kevin Durant   But they wouldn't"
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
&gt;speculation   “ James Harden has informed the Houston Rockets”   Go take your meds lil bro
"Are you blind????? Tf   Literally in the damn article :  “All-Star guard James Harden has informed the Houston Rockets that the Boston Celtics and Portland Trail Blazers are among his preferred trade destinations, per Sam Amick and Kelly Iko of The Athletic.”"
https://sports.yahoo.com/james-harden-latest-trade-list-013007681.html  Clown
So basically a James Harden stat line
A couple of things.   Klay got maximized because he is the best at the role Bosh and Love were playing. A low usage elite 3-point shooter with great defense. Give Prime Klay Thompson to LeBron James and see what happens.  Bosh and Love suffered their offensive production because they were bigs and bigs unlike the likes of Russ/Curry/Harden/Kyrie etc need to be fed regularly. They can't just get the ball and go ISO mode.
Most overrated stat padder of all time. Imagine if James Harden said this.        This guy is 10 games under .500 for a reason.     Glad KD got out but feel bad for Beal
I'd say James Harden really dogged it in his last game in Houston
"Nahhh  KD, LeBron, Evan Fournier, James Harden, Sabonis, Steph Curry  Those guys tend to murder us  There’s a bunch more"
"Then you have James harden just flopping, both la teams tampering, Blake and this should be the least of our worries"
"""Referee James Harden has gone flying across the court, clutching at his face. Play continues"""
"I just can't see him keeping up with Doncic who can score the same amount as Zion but do it in more ways as well. The only thing stopping him from averaging over 30 a game right now is his passing. Unless they add more talent around him, he'll just get more and more aggressive as a scorer and look off his teammates more. Which is something James Harden started to do the past two years before he left Houston."
"Nothing he said was really outrageous. He's not talking about shutting him down entirely, it's just making it as difficult as possible. James Harden would still be putting up numbers, but with someone like Scottie Pippen guarding you all game, and taking away what's most comfortable for you, you're going to get tired over the course of the game, and especially over the course of a 7 game series.  He knows as well as anyone you don't shut down great offensive players, but you can make them work harder than normal and that throws off their game. It makes every other part of the game that much harder.   Just look up any of the good defenders today guarding him and you can see that someone like Kawhi and put Harden outside of his comfort zone. Makes every drive that much harder, every step back 3, every pass gets harder. Defense on the other end then gets harder. When he says shut him, he doesn't mean completely shut him down. It's shutting down what they want to do the most as much as possible to make it more likely for your team to win."
Man if only he had James Harden with him...
"Trading James Harden to a team with Durant and Irving for a shit sandwich return of Olynyk, Avery Bradley and some swaps they don’t even have full control over has to be up there.   Oh. I forgot 20 games of sub 40% shooting from Dipo."
"Tbh idk if I can see James Harden making the all nba this year as he is probably out for the rest of the regular season. I hope he does as a Harden fan but there are just so many talented guards such as Booker, Mitchell, Beal, CP3, Lavine etc that are amazing this year and def deserving of an all nba selection but would have gotten snubbed had Harden have been healthy as only one of those guys could have made it since Steph, Dame, Luka, and Kyrie are locks.  At the very least, there is no way Kyrie should be below Harden assuming he also doesn't suffer a big injury and Harden stays out until the playoffs."
I’ll trade you all of our shooting guards for a one leg James Harden...
"James Harden has a kid, he's just been super secret about it"
"Sexman is gonna be a James Harden level offensive threat, you heard it here first."
Ten NBA officials were caught at a strip club with James Harden
"???  Where did I say they would be worse? Lmao. You’re reading into hate that isn’t there.  I’m just saying Harden would adjust to the Warriors offense, moreso than the Warriors adjust to him. He would absolutely dominate as a top of the key and high post playmaker on this team.  I even said they have a good shot at winning it all, which they don’t right now. So I have no idea how you’re reading into this that I think they’d be worse replacing Andrew Wiggins with James Harden."
"But bruh they got 20 games of shitty Oladipo, Olynyk and Avery Bradley.  Tell me that’s not an absolute haul for a guy like James Harden."
You’re saying the team would be worse by adding James harden ? Harden is like 5-2 this season when playing without Durant and kyrie. You’re telling me the warriors are gonna get worse by adding him.  Jesus Christ you people love to hate him and jizz all over curry and kerrs motion offense.   Kerr would adjust his offense to harden. If you watch the nets this year with kyrie and harden or harden and Durant playing together it’s not just harden isos. It’s harden handling the ball at the top of the key with Durant and kyrie coming off screens. Or pnr with harden and one of them.
"I could recognize Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden"
"Not with the way Anthony Davis plays in the playoffs historically. 30/10 on elite efficiency and great defense is at the very least equivalent to James Harden. LeBron/KD and Harden/AD are all equals and will cancel each other out.   But yes, Kyrie is significantly better than anyone else we have. Luckily, Nets inept defense and the Lakers incredible defense will keep the series competitive."
"The Thunder arguably didn't do everything right. I know it's well-worn territory at this point, but they traded James Harden a year earlier than they needed to.  Maybe Harden doesn't become the player he is today if he stays as the third banana in OKC, but he would still be miles better than any other player they've had since."
"Cool, the Nets were missing James Harden...  CP3 has missed 1 game all season, Booker has missed 4 (and has played every game since February 1), Bridges and Ayton haven't missed any...  Imagine every other team if it's top 4 players missed a combined 5 games up to this point.  Not sure why you're fighting the point. It's literally just a fact that the Suns have been incredibly lucky with the health of their top players while most other teams have had main pieces miss major time."
"Then these people think that these NBA players are superhuman and don't get tired lol. Everyone gets tired. James Harden, as good and durable as he is, slows down as the series gets longer and at the end of games that are very physical."
Yea I go more in favor of it being an awesome duo.   But it’s pretty wild to see that without KD he’s only made it out of the first round once and that was with James Harden leading the charge.
Not if one of those two is not named James Harden
"&gt;Why Kyrie keeps winning championships  Man, idk perhaps it's because he gets to play second fiddle to a guy in Lebron James and potentially behind 2 guys in Brooklyn with KD and Harden....."
Chris Paul and James Harden. 65-17 team that almost took down the Warriors dynasty. Crazy
and James freakin Harden is sitting on the sidelines rehabbing....the dude who averaged nearly 40 in a calendar year not even two seasons ago             they might very well have two of the top five scorers in NBA history
Reminds me of when I saw a pack of James Harden gummies while on a road trip. Don’t be like me and live in regret go get the movie
Bruh I woke up one morning and KD Kyrie and James Harden were all on my team...... https://m.imgur.com/459yZyH
"Donovan Mitchell has similar numbers to James Harden in 2015 and Harden was a top 15 player then. Mitchell isn’t a top 15 player right now but he’s somewhere between 16-21. There is way more talent in the league now than there was in 2015, so comparing their respective rankings in the league is irrelevant. You can’t tell me that a team with Al Horford as the main offensive threat has an equal chance at the title as a Donovan Mitchell led team. You could also make the argument that Gobert is better than Horford."
"Why does OKC get a pass for failing KD by giving away James Harden with a year left on his rookie deal, surrounding him with no shooters afterwards, and remaining content with bad coaching? If OKC's management had prioritized winning over money, they'd have very well developed into a dynasty. They ruined that themselves, unprompted, motivated by greed &amp; arrogance.      I don't understand why people feel he should've staid with OKC, of all franchises."
Their offense wont hold up. Any offense that relies on role players hitting 3s is bound to fail. Its like the Rockets minus James Harden
This team is missing MVP in his prime James Harden hahahaha
"This might be an unpopular opinion, but if KD is healthy, James Harden could sit out until the NBA Finals and i don't think they lose.  Right now they would most likely play what? Miami in Round 1, Knicks in Round 2 and Sixers/Bucks in the ECF, even without Harden they are the favourites in all series imo. Yeah, with Harden a potential series against Milwaukee or Philly would be way easier, but still."
I never said he'd be 100%. But this is a chronic issue that improves with rest  Hence why you don't see James harden on the court right now.  I'd absolutely sit his ass if I were on the staff. It's the right call
Off topic. The fact you’re a Rockets fan. And now James Harden plays for a New York team combined with your username trips me out.
"Westbrook &amp; Harden were MVP talents at 21-23 years old? Of course not. In reality, after giving James Harden away the off season after reaching the finals, they were a team with poor spacing that lacked shooter, and were badly coached."
"Not one that really stuck as a nickname but the live call of ""JAMES HARDEN THE FLAME THROWER"" is one of the most badass one's ever.. shit gave me chills watching it happen"
LeBron taking heat for passing to wide-open teammates for shots in the crunch.  Kawhi Leonard for missing the 2017-2018 season with the Spurs due to an injury.  I’ve also heard some people say that James Harden comes up short in the playoffs because he “goes too hard” during the regular season.  Carmelo Anthony took extra tens of millions of dollars to re-sign with the Knicks rather than signing with the Bulls or Heat.
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
"He put up 30ppg in the 11-12 finals on 65ts%, the latter he maintained throughout the entire playoffs. James Harden averaged 12ppg in the same series.   KD's a better scorer because he's more versatile, and is therefore more difficult to limit: Post game, pin downs, flares, mid range pull ups going either way, etc. He has it all."
"I’ll make the argument, James harden had the highest pace adjusted scoring season ever in 2018-19 on 61% ts. This season rivals currys very best scoring seasons as the most outlier scoring season of all time. Even if you give curry the slight edge as a scorer, James harden is a much better playmaker who is capable of being a one man offense by himself. Defensively I would say they’re pretty similar, with harden slightly better on ball and curry slightly better off ball, but not too different. Harden’s playmaking boost could easily be worth as much if not more than curry’s gravity advantage."
counterpoint: James Harden didn't play.
It's disgusting you have this Nets team and you can slap James Harden on it. May the league prepare their anus
"People forget James Harden choked when it counts. Not that it matters, KD and Kyrie are OP enough. Just better hope one of them don’t get hurt."
"Why would he return to OKC? He's from DC, and was drafted by Seattle. OKC chose to give away James Harden with a year left on his rookie deal, they don't deserve anymore than what they've earned.      Finally, a players legacy should be defined by how good he or she is in combination with their contributions to winning. NBA fans &amp; media need to get away from these inane Anime narratives, it's hurting the sport."
This team really about to get James Harden...
Man so this Nets team is gonna add James Harden WOW
James Harden has a son.
KD is actually a lowkey James Harden lol. He’s just not as obvious as going to strip clubs but most accounts KD is deffo running through very well known insta thots daily
Lmfao y'all hang on to that. Whatever y'all need to make your pitiful James Harden return seem better.
"You said they really kicked it up a notch against the heat. I’m glad I just misunderstood.   But still, it seems like you’re arguing both that the heat played poorly against you and that it wasn’t until the bucks series that they really got hot. I mean this just seems pretty weak and basically impossible to prove. Even so, if Miami played better against the bucks, doesn’t Nate and the Pacers get some credit for that? It feels like you’re talking out of both sides of your mouth about the heat a little bit. They won 7 straight playoff games.   Your argument also seems to rely heavily on the seeding games, which seems dubious as a sample.   So the bucks weren’t that good because they only beat the magic in 5 instead of 4? The heat 3-0’d them and won in 5. 5! They didn’t get hot until after sweeping us and the bucks are actually not really that good seems like a very weak argument. And it looked really bad when you fired Nate before waiting to see if the Heat were any good.   You don’t rebut any of the points about the roster. I think that’s pretty telling. TJ Warren was hot in the bubble. I still think if you need TJ Warren to be MJ, don’t fire your coach when you get swept. Elite players are very important for advancing in the playoffs, the Pacers don’t have any. The Heat did (arguably 2). Of course you got your ass kicked.  I’ve felt that frustration. Even last year many were mad at Billy D for playing Adams against the micro ball Rockets. And yet you look back on the series and think, they had James Harden, we didn’t. And we still almost won. Billy D deserves some credit for that.   And like I’ve said literally every fan base complains about these things when their team is losing. Literally the exact things you are mentioning -the X’s and O’s, the lineups, this guy we hate getting minutes instead of young unproven player. I trust the results vs  the roster on paper as a method of evaluating a coach rather than the eye test from angry fans. Nate McMillan did about as good as you can do with Indiana’s roster, which is making the playoffs. Same thing he’s doing with Atlanta now. Winning in the playoffs in the nba is much more about talent than coaching. Look at the title favorites, the teams that advance. They have top end talent."
"My prediction  &amp;#x200B;  1st - Harden, Lillard/Curry, Leonard, Giannis, Jokic  2nd - Luka, Lillard/Curry, James, Randle, Embiid  3rd - Mitchell, Booker/Paul/Kyrie, Tatum, Butler, Gobert.     Missed the cut, George (If he continues to play as he played on his last games, I'll consider him on 3rd team for Butler), Zion (He's a freak of nature but they are losing), Durant (He played few games this season), Westbrook or Beal (There are so many guards to consider, their record is also a factor)"

"I went back and searched via ctrl+f. All I saw was someone posting that clip of Harden getting elbowed in the face by Ron Artest which is now a full-fledged meme. Got upvotes and lolz, and that's what this dude is on his fucking soapbox about.  Oh, and a Warriors fan posting the video of Klay going under Harden on a couple threes from the playoffs a few years back...in order to defend James and call out his fellow Dubs fans' hypocrites.   He's full of shit."
&gt;Steph beat a loaded James Harden team without KD in 6.  Still doesn't accurately depict what happened. But whatever helps you prop up that prescious narrative
"Ok,   Steph beat a loaded James Harden  team without KD in 6.  The same Kawhi with a loaded team that could not make it to a WCF.  Happy?"
"Steph beat James Harden without KD in 6, on James' court.  Let's not go there.  The same Kawhi Leonard with a loaded clippers team that could not get to a WCF?"
"And that right there is why if the nets meet the lakers in the finals, James harden will eat them up"
"Nah, we just won a championship. Ya'll never will with Luka ""basically James Harden""Doncic. Refs won't give him these tickets tack calls in the playoffs &amp; he will just pout his way to loss after loss after loss, just like Houston year after year after year. Have fun with that."
james harden is the best new addition to a team
Luka is like James Harden without the generational talent
James Harden with Technical Fouls
Pels need to go Rockets James Harden on him. Just build around him A-S-A-P!
Sir I'm not even sure how many families James Harden has at this point. He may be the most prolific family man in the land once the tally comes in.   Til then its Dwight.
Look I get it. You want to think the Bucks have a chance. But they dont. Just accept it.          Kevin Durant and James Harden are greatness personified. Giannis is simply not good enough. Bucks are not serious contenders so please save the delusion
"I love how Thunder fans are the battered wives of the NBA.   A decade ago, their franchise had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  Their brilliant front office loses Harden then Durant.   The Thunder fans are left with the very least of the three.  Yet here they still are, defending Russell like hes going to come back to them and once again lead them to a sixth seed and first round exit.  Russell Westbrook is incapable of playing with another great player and making them better.  Just ask Paul George, or Kevin Durant or James Harden.     I guess you weren't a fan of the Thunder way back in 2019.  You should look up Oklahoma City and their lone playoff series from that year.  You can tell me some more about Westbrook being better than Lillard."
"Tmac, Steve bash, James harden"
"I've said nothing about guarding Harden.   If you really want an answer, *hundreds* of articles and videos have been made over the years just about his foul baiting. I'm sure you can find one in a few of them. Here, [let me get you started.](https://www.google.com/search?q=James+Harden+foul+baiting&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=780&amp;ei=oXaEYMKuJbrK0PEPwpy-oAs&amp;oq=James+Harden+foul+baiting&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANQ5BZYth5gsiFoAXAAeACAAUOIAfIBkgEBNJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCg67Z05fwAhU6JTQIHUKOD7Q4ChDh1QMIDg&amp;uact=5) Good luck."
"James harden, the numbers are there."
James Harden pretty easily.
 James Harden and anyone
James harden or westbrook.
"I'm not comparing him to a center, I'm comparing him to a playmaking pg. Even James harden has a better passes made to passes received ratio lol."
He says nothing of Houston fans and says nothing of Houston. He says the name James Harden - the most prolific flipper in the NBA today along with Embiid.
"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He’ll probably average 35/10/10 if that’s the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they’re the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"
"I mean, if anyone were to be in our heads it would be Lebron for beating us during the 73-9 season. But I like Lebron and James Harden so I guess they are in my head rent free, because I enjoy watching them."
"As a warriors fan, I can confirm that james harden does not matter to us at all because he has never beaten us in a playoff series. Laughing at people getting injured isn’t cool, that’s Toronto shit."
James harden and Westbrook carried that team
y’all passed on james harden jimmy gonna leave &amp; yohll be stuck with see thru shirts tyler &amp; women beater nunn wow heat culture
"James Harden: 81 GP, 36.8 MIN, 27.4 PPG, 5.7RPG, 7.0 APG, 44% FG, 2.6 3PM, 37.5% 3P, 1.9 STL, 4.0 TOV  Team record: 56-26  Stephen Curry: 80 GP, 32.7 MIN, 23.8 PPG, 4.3RPG, 7.7 APG, 48.7% FG, 3.6 3PM, 44.3% 3P, 2 STL, 3.1 TOV  Team record: 67-15  Curry had sat out the entirety of 17 fourth quarters.   ---  Team record surely must've been a factor, they were the 10th team to reach 67 wins at the time, but there were plenty of other reasons as to why Curry won that year. Chalking it up to ""team record"" is doing a disservice to his performance."
"Superstars lmao, if they are superstars then wth are LeBron James, Curry, Harden Giannis or Embiid and Jokic"
This is what's funny to me.... This thread is a bunch of Warriors fans claiming that James Harden ain't shit to them and they live rent free in his head..... but they're the one's pulling his name out of thin air when something has nothing to do with him and saying 'if we were James Harden this would be different!' who's in who's head?
"Isn't this an example of the opposite? Something doesn't go Steph's way and Warriors fans (commentary) are immediately crying: 'if it was James Haaarden!!' I'm not saying the call was good, but this is definitely Harden being in Warriors heads not the other way around. They're the ones bringing his name into a conversation that had nothing to do with him."
"Dude is gonna die on the sword of Tyler Herro.  Pat Riley really screwed it this year. I think the heat just aren’t sure if they’re a rebuilding team around Herro and Bam, or a contending team around Dragic and Butler so they signed Oladipo instead of Kyle Lowry and didn’t trade herro for James Harden. That was honestly so stupid, and our front office traded Luka."
There was no telling James Harden was even going to be traded until he demanded one and started tanking mid games.   That’s still not mentioning Kyrie goading about how clutch both he and KD were and proceeding to miss several clutch shots to ice a game vs freaking Lamelo Ball.
&gt; disappearing from the start of a losing streak to when James Harden was signed.  Dude tanked his value so he wouldn't be traded as part of a package. He played it right imo.
"Don’t forget saying he could head coach and then disappearing from the start of a losing streak to when James Harden was signed. Or calling reporters peasants. Or taking shots at the on teammate that got him his only ring, while said teammate was in the finals trying to get another ring."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1902401-james-harden-scores-27-points-despite-making-only-2-shots-from-the-field  u/trinidadjerms ain't tryin to talk about this
"Durant literally led OKC from one of the worst teams in the league when he was drafted, a team that intentionally gimped themselves to tank(Ray Allen trade), on top of moving the franchise from Seattle to OKC. By his third year they were in the playoffs, by his fourth they were in the WCF, by his fifth they were in the finals. He won 4 scoring titles, and an MVP(4 2nd place finishes, en route to leading his team to 4 WCF by the age of 27.   This, with bad coaching, poor spacing, and being the only consistent shooter on the team after the franchise willingly traded James Harden for a laundry basket of dirty socks."
"&gt; Nets have been below average in games with KD and no James Harden this year.  Shouldn't you be isolating for games he played no kyrie, low minutes ?"
Because it’s not sarcastic lol James Harden is one of the best in the game
"James ""The most important 2nd best player"" Harden."
"KD doesnt impact the game like Giannis or Harden does anymore. You can put Harden or Giannis on any team and they would instantly be in playoff contention. Cant say the same for KD. Nets have been below average in games with KD and no James Harden this year. KDs obviously the best pure scorer of the bunch, but he doesnt impact the game in nearly as many ways. Current KD does not do enough on the floor to be put on the same level as guys like Steph, Giannis, Harden, or Lebron."
I ran my analysis and would have to agree that he is very very good.  My analysis: Is he James Harden? -&gt; yes.
I have an irrational distate for James Harden but I see that too. Harden's leg doesn't seem to move at all before the contact but it certainly looks like he's tripping him.
"Gets semantic I suppose. There've definitely been weeks or months where, on the body of evidence, one could reasonable say, ""James Harden is currently the best basketball player alive.""   But, expand that range to a year or ten or fifty, and he falls out for the ones you mentioned."
"James Harden is really, really good at this game."
Remember when all y'all fucking nerds hated on harden for being this kind of good when he was a rocket? You fucking nerds. He's always been a basketball genius. The collective nba fan base missed out on some of the best basketball you'll ever see because no one would give him his due.  James Harden is one of the best offensive players to ever grace the court.   Y'all done missed some of the best play because you were out there hating.   Harden is the god
"I said suck in maybe an over exaggerating tone, maybe just disappointing, ala a James Harden who isnt bad in the playoffs but isnt better than he is in the regular season. If the Hawks matchup with the Knicks than that is a very winnable series of two teams that are on a pretty similar playing field, if they matchup McMillan should be expected to coach even better than the past couple of months. Indiana under Nate had pretty damn good rosters, most years better than this Hawks team, and got swept like 3 or 4 years in a row? Thats honestly why McMillan was fired, I get that he wasnt favored to lead his team above the Celtics, Heat, etc. but imo to be swept that many times without making the necessary adjustments to atleast steal a game is pretty disappointing."
That James Harden guy seems like a good bench piece
james harden playing the game the right way every night.  is that what hes known for
&gt; as if Kyrie and KD aren’t also throwing up 11 assists per game  Except they aren't lmfao. Neither are in the same universe as James Harden as a passer.
how can james harden of all people say he plays the game the right way every single night?  does he have amnesia? do the reporters? fans?
"Let's not forget the Nets trade away Caris Levert, Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for Harden, then Kyrie switch to the SG role while Harden switch to PG role.  This all happen when Dinwiddie, the only good PG they have left was injured.  After that trade, Nets sign Andre Roberson (defensive SG), Iman Shumpert (another SG), Alize Johnson (wing player) Blake and Lamarcus (big men). None of them are PG. Until the Harden injury which the Nets sign Mike James as a stopgap measure until Harden return.   So yes, it was clear that Nets intend for Harden to be the playmaker."
"As a Rockets fan, fuck you James Harden... but, good pass."
"I despise Harden, but that’s what it looked like to me, too.   And I hate James Harden even more for making me defend James Harden."
How to get paid as an althetic big in the nba:  1) play with james harden  2) listen to what james harden tells you to do  3) do what james harden tells you to do
How so please don't tell me you think James harden has preformed better than LeBron in the playoffs.
"&gt;The Nets are built around Harden being their main playmaker, of course Harden would look much better when he is playing.  The only player they've added since trading for james harden is blake griffin. Meanwhile they've had KD/Kyrie under contract last two years. What makes you think the team is ""built around"" harden?  He jut figured it out there on the fly"
"The Nets are clearly better, but the Knicks have definitely overachieved more.  Everyone was memeing them just 1-2 years ago for losing the KD &amp; Kyrie sweepstakes to Brooklyn, and you'd get laughed out of a sports bar—possibly even with drinks pelted at you—if you suggested that the Knicks might only end up 1-4 seeds behind those new-look Nets plus James Harden.  If Brooklyn doesn't win it all this season, their fans will brood over missing out on a much better defensive coach in Thibs."
"Your original point was that Harden has had it tougher in the West. LeBron came to the west and fuckin beat James Harden. Beat this year’s MVP too. You can add all the asterisks you want but it is what it is man. LeBron is the better playoff performer and the better overall player and always has been. That’s not a knock on Harden, just respect for LeBron."
BREAKING: Kevin Durant and James Harden are good at basketball
yeah you're right. James Harden off ball is pretty crap. It works on the nets cus kyrie is pretty much a shooting guard and KD has always been great at fitting in off ball
&gt;howcome james harden gets so much flak for constantly losing to the warriors in the playoffs  His biggest and most egregious choke wasnt even against the warriors
James Harden after a playoff loss https://youtu.be/6l2l_4nbUiQ
"James Harden, Humble."
"This is where Dinwiddie is sorely missed in the lineup, but I feel like if he was healthy he would have been included in the James Harden trade"
legendary 6moty james harden
"I will never forget locking eyes with James Harden as we passed in a hallway and he decided to neither engage or look away, just dead eyed and I’m a complete nobody"
I’m sorry lmao you think James Harden is in another league entirely scoring &amp; playmaking wise than Steph Curry is?  I need some of your pack 😂
"Has James Harden ever gotten a 50 point triple double in the NBA Finals? Don't worry, I'll wait for your answer."
"Mike ""Jordan"" ""LeBron"" James ""Harden"
Bro he's so good.  - Top 3 scorer in the league (probably league history lol)  - Top 5 playmaker  - Above average defender  Don't be afraid to say it boiz: james harden is a top 3 player in the world and one of the 20 best players ever
Or say James Harden isn’t a difference maker lmao  “The Nets don’t have harden but how are they stopping the bucks with Giannis??”
To quote the late Jeff Bezos: “James Harden is a dick.”
"James Harden is the most IMPORTANT player on the Nets.   Even if he’s not the best, his ability to facilitate while scoring with high efficiency is what’s gonna make or break this team."
Mike James Harden
James Harden - Back  Landry Shamet - Slump busted  Nicolas Claxton - Fucking beast  Patty Mills - Nets Killer  Our Defensive Rebounding - Trash  Our Defense Against 3rd Stringers - Still Trash  Game Over - W!!!!!
James Harden 6MOY book it.
Nicolas Devir Claxton and James Edward Harden  that is all
James Harden is the best basketball player in the world
"James ""Grayson Allen"" Harden"
"Spurs fans STAY hating James Harden, no matter what conference he’s in"
James Harden has truly mastered the PnR
Yea he would straight up not take open 3’s in favour of getting in the lane this year when for a hot second at the start of last year he was looking like James harden with step back 3’s. So odd to me that his shot has regressed. But his playmaking/passing and finishes inside have improved.

is this sub gonna start respecting james harden or is this sub gonna keep looking stupid
We got James fucking Harden out here playing off the bench while Scott Brooks insists that Alex Len is an NBA level starter lol Wiz fans should be storming the arena rn
"Every single time I've seen Jeff Green play this season I find myself thinking ""huh, he looks better than I thought"". And every single time it happens to be James Harden making it happen."
"If James harden plays a game of basketball but doesn't play 40+ minutes, did he really make a sound?"
James Harden is a legitimate basketball genius
I love watching James Harden
James Harden is unreal.
Should start Mike James and let Harden take over against bench units. Mike is a solid player
"Nets are starting: Mike James, Landry Shamet, KD, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin.    1st of all, ew   2nd of all... 6MOTY HARDEN IS BACK"
"So? He doesn't have a say in what's disrespectful because of that?  Dude go look at every news article from September / October.  Harden wasn't following any COVID protocol and just skipped training camp. He himself said the Rockets were ""just not good enough"".  Listen I don't blame James Harden - he wanted out and was forcing his way out.  And honestly on the Nets he's played at an MVP lvl from what we've seen.  But the fact is those 8 games with the Rockets he was toxic to that locker room and didn't give a flying f*ck.  And it's tough for me to give a guy All-NBA honors, considering how stacked the guard position is, when he's effectively only played 34 valuable games on the season. That's all I'm saying."
"Who the hell is gonna be surprised that a team with KD, James Harden, Kyrie, and Blake stomp the league??"
"a select group of heat fans not wanting to trade our entire young core for james harden doesnt warrant personal attacks on his character and literal slander on his reputation for a full season. Troll posts when he has bad games is one thing, getting false rumors about him committing more to his insta model gf than basketball trending on twitter is another"
"magic dwight is like cavs lebron. they were both by the far the best on their team with the 2nd and so forth bests not being even close.  lakers dwight is like heat lebron. they both had some great teammates, lakers dwight unfortunately didn't last very long though.  lebron got MVP with his nobody Cav's and his somebody Heat's. so im not really sure what wade and bosh have to do with it. Howard has had kobe as a teammate and james harden. not at the same time obviously but if LBJ had those as teammates then everyone would call it a superteam. yet with howard i guess they a bunch of schmucks. lets just be real there are superteams and then there are teams that have LBJ. thats not me sucking his D but pointing out there just arent many teams that LBJ can go to where it wouldn't be called a superteam so may as well just call it a team that has LBJ."
"Russ just had a better season in houston than Wall has ever had in his career playing with James Harden what made you think a guy coming off an achilles tear was going to be better than that?  Hes never been better than Russ you said he ""was better"" thats just a ridiculous statement. Ya injuries did that, not him selfishly jacking up shots for points, not playing defense, or getting his usual 6+ turnover games that wasnt on him right?  Or saying he was a franchise player and completely rocking out after that? I mean your dude just had 28 points 21 assists and 13 rebounds on a decent shooting night what else do you want? I just dont get the hate unless theres a locker room issue russ is involved in lol."
Like leaving James Harden off of a list because he “forced a trade”. Literally Zach Lowes’s words. Just stop dude lol
Are you trolling? Leaving James Harden off of two of his voting lists is absolutely a prime example holding a grudge/ being petty. It definitely doesn’t have anything to do with how Harden has played. Why are you so concerned with how I feel about it anyway? It’s really not that serious? Are you friends with Zach? Are you his mom?
It doesn’t? It’s just a dumb move. When was the last time a serious MVP candidate who was leading his team on a 29-7 run came off the bench in an all-star game? Tatum started over James Harden.   I don’t care. But it definitely highlights how much of a joke the whole thing is.
"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
This is revisionist history   He play with James Harden in Houston thé two where former MVPs in their prime that imo is a stacked team because of Westbrook’s obvious game holes that ended in a dumpster fire.  Westbrook played several seasons with Paul George who made all NBA first and third team when he played with Russ   Westbrook played with KD an all time great and an MVP.  Most MVPs never play with another MVP  Now Russ is playing with a player who will make 3rd team all nba and may win the scoring championship   While Russ has played with two and a first team all NBA player   Plus Russ has played with some great role players Ibaka won a championship with a different cast and was first team all defense when he played with Russ
*james harden has entered the chat*
"It's 2021, Warriors fans have gotten the pleasure of seeing their team win **3 rings** and watching their MVP ball out year after year.  Meanwhile /u/byrockets is desperately screeching on /r/nba about how if his aunt had balls she'd be his uncle, like some curbside prophet to anyone who will listen.   ""*Why does everyone just laugh at me?! Can't they tell that I'm spreading the good word?!""*  When his thankless work on /r/nba for the day is done, he climbs back into bed, life devoid of any other purpose, to furiously masturbate to his well worn posters of James Harden and Chris Paul.  *""Don't worry James, Chris. In my heart we won the championship!"" UGHGHHH*.   *""Damn, gotta remind mum to change the sheets again""*"
See also: James Harden - James Harden and Russell Westbrook - Russell Westbrook
I do think James Harden will go back with Houston. Like LeBron did with Cleveland
Also have two former MVPs still in their prime as well as an all star starter. The names alone make them a pretty big favorite. James Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Make whatever excuses you will that team better win a chip
James Harden is top 5 SG all time. And I only say top 5 so that people don’t come at my throat for leaving others out lol
"I was with you until Carmelo won in 2013.  He had 1 first place vote. Durant already won, Chris Paul already won, Tony Parker already won, Tim Duncan already won.  I'd give the nod to James Harden that year, bumping Melo out.  Then 2018 becomes Anthony Davis."
James Jokic Harden Paul Draymond Russ
So you really think Lamelo has a higher peak than James Harden?
Kevin Durant and James Harden /s  Probably Magic and Karrem
.. Stockton only had one of the greatest PFs of all time for literally his entire career (16 seasons) and CP3's list of allstar teammates is also great as well.. those Rockets teams were just as good as those OKC teams. So we're saying MVP tier James Harden wasn't a good enough teammate for CP3? As well as that stacked rosters..  But Durant was for Russ?   It's just revisionist history to slander Russ. People are willing to make excuses for these other PGs and crucify Russ.
"Boy, wait until you meet James Harden fans."
James Harden and Jeff Green  Nets fans and Rockets fans will understand
"It’s kinda hard to find a comparison for him. But he reminds me a bit of a young James Harden without the shooting. Not as good overall, but you see some similarities"
Has anybody actually seen Lebron James &amp; James Harden in the same room together????
"Bro people don’t actually think that Randle is more popular than James Harden and Kevin Durant. You... you do realize that, right? They just taking shots at nets players."
"I was born in New Jersey and was a Nets fan growing up. Moved to Detroit recently, and there's no way in hell I'm leaving the fanbase with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kai Irving for one with Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes, and Isaiah Stewart. I'll watch Pistons games and hope they win, but they'll take the backseat."
"Love to see Blazers embrace him like that , on the other hand fucking Rockets and James harden almost ruin melo."
"AD needs to chill, James Harden ain't on the Rockets anymore"
"Again, you are making things up.   So yesterday he broke the record. After breaking it, he put up 10/11/6 in the fourth quarter. Was he still chasing numbers then too?   He didn’t average a triple double with fucking Harden because Harden was the playmaker and they used Russ as a scorer. Did he average a triple double? No. Did he average 27 points? Yes. He wasn’t the primary ball handler and his job was too capitalize off Harden getting doubled and then run in transition. Why would he need to put him gaudy assist numbers if they have an elite playmaker already. They made it farther because they had James Harden and Kevin Durant with elite roleplayers. Not Beal and Raul Neto.   Do the Wizards have another elite playmaker? No.   And Westbrook with KD became an immensely better passer between the years of 2017-2019. Not to mention pace.   What makes your argument even worse is the Wizards we’re trash at the beginning of the season. Westbrook was NOT averaging a triple double, he averaged 22 6 and 6 in the first month of the season.   Yet now, when he’s averaging 23/14/14 in the last month, they just happened to go on a crazy win streak?   Everything is telling you you wrong and yet you still refuse to believe it. Like y’all have to understand there are people who are consistently watching these games."
"Next 3 active are Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
LeBron James Harden returns on the same day.  Coincidence? I think not!
"Harden 'purposely playing like shit' in houston still put up better numbers than Randle lmfao dude had 25 points and 10.5 assists on good efficiency, Randle is awesome no doubt and a guy on an nba show forgetting his name is laughable but you are completely out of your mind if you think he's on James Hardens level."
James Harden
He doesn’t know how to use his length on his defense once you see it you won’t be able to unsee it but he’s so bad at getting over screens on ball on defense. Steve Kerr put Durant on James harden in the 2018 playoffs and had to call an audible and ditch the plan 2 games in it was just open season for Harden to get switched whomever he wanted onto him
"I didn’t put any number on it in my original comment, I just said A top MVP candidate. I didn’t say THE top MVP candidate. I never said he was winning the award and it’s not my fault that you’re illiterate.   James Harden eliminated himself from any MVP discussion when he spent the early part of the season playing like shit on purpose in Houston. Now with this injury he has played 34 games for the Nets which is literally half of what Julius has played for the Knicks after tonight. You need counseling if you have Harden ahead of Julius on your ballot."
"Dr J meant more to basketball than James Harden, Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, probably combined, ever will. That's not a hot take, read some history on the Dr.   Man might be the reason most of us had the chance to even care about basketball."
Tbf James Harden has had a much higher peak then Kawhi
"You have it the other way around.  Threes being shot more by everyone in the league is a product of Steph Curry's success in the NBA. Steph pioneered this style of basketball. It showed teams that three point scoring is a viable option and now everyone is attempting it.  But yeah, guys who shoot below 40% like James Harden will probably surpass Ray Allen at three pointers made due to the volume of threes attempted. I also wouldn't be surprised if Curry's record will be broken in the future due to how many kids are molding their game around this style of play whereas Curry had to reinvent the game himself."
"I mean, considering LeBron on his own is arguably the GOAT...I'd say giving him the positive traits of all-time scorer James Harden and also James Wiseman removes the ""arguably""."
"Shaq was very athletic. I am just saying that his style of play would be less dominant mostly because of defense. He wouldn't be able to play the minutes he played back then. Shaq had a 58.5% TS% on almost 30% usg.   Harden, Curry, Durant, James have better USG/Efficiency and are not centers that slow down the pace of your offense, and can be exploited defensively. Most teams can match Shaq's usage and efficiency if Shaq is playing."
James Harden is better than Steph Curry.
"I can’t even find any database that tracks points per possession so I can’t refute or bring specific data to this argument.  But, James Harden averaging more points per possession isolating than one of the most offensively gifted teams of all time is impressive. I don’t care how cherry-picked the stat is or how little actual sense it makes to compare. It’s just impressive. If you don’t see how this “Well Akshually” is nitpicky of you, I can’t help you"
"Dame over James Harden, alright."
Anyone who's played basketball knows how good James Harden really is.
The day James harden ended his career..  RIP wejo
"I’m just curious, why does Steve Nash name always get dragged into everything! I’m not even a big fan I think he ripped Kobe of at least one MVP.  But like Steve Nash is Steve Nash I mean I realize he’s Canadian but he’s a two time mvp and a really humble player. He’s no Stockton or Magic or Steph but a great point guard and a humble guy. I don’t see fish or Kidd getting dragged or guys like that names in everyone’s mouth. But to your point yeah James harden is easily a top five point guard, shooting guard, or even if he wanted to play small forward in or league today."
Harden is one of my favorite players who isn’t on a Knicks jersey.   I like him over my hate for KD and the NY “rivalry” or superteam rhetoric.  Go win 1 James
&gt;Period. That goes to Kawhi or Jokic.  Have you heard of James Harden?
"sure. i didn’t say james harden is a bad player or overrated, and while underperforming he’s still the engine of the team  i just think it’s a little ridiculous to claim a guy as the best offensive player in the league when you have guys who actually get better in the playoffs like lebron who are equally the engine of their teams while actually improving their efficiency significantly in the playoffs"
"I watch James Harden and I'm just like...""how are you supposed to ever stop him?""  If he gets you off balance, it's guaranteed points.  Easy layup or draws a foul.  There was a possession where he got the drop on Fournier at pretty much the 3 point line so within about 2 dribbles past the halfcourt line he had already effectively put points on the board.  I guess you just crash on him and dishes out to........Joe Harris??? Kevin Durant? It's just ridiculous. Oh, or you over compensate for his drive and he steps back for a 3 which feels like he makes 100% of the time."
40% is still elite 33% is not good  and were not talking about steph were talking about james harden lol
I like it but the playoffs would've been 10x better if james harden wasn't a baby back bitch and quit on his team mid-season to form a big 3. The east truly would have been wide open
"Seriously. The only person who's carried a team as hard as Kawhi's 2019 ECSF in the past 10 years has been Lebron. Luka's *obviously* been great so far but he's got a lot to prove before he infiltrates the ranks of the true top tier players.   The correct top 5 players right now are all in their prime and have won titles or are James Harden, who only doesn't have a title because of the Warriors Dynasty and is without a doubt one of the best scorers ever. There's a shitload of great young players who'll be there in 4-6 years, but they've all got to prove a lot before they get the same respect as established winners."
James Harden
"I wouldn't go that far.  We respect his game, but the dude has a history of taking pit shots at cities/teams after he leaves.  He gets a bit of a free pass in Cleveland for hitting that dagger, but there's an element of perverse satisfaction that he has yet to accomplish anything since leaving.  Boston was an unmitigated disaster.  Brooklyn is still up in the air. Kyrie couldn't carry the team when KD was hurt, and was such a basket case this year, they had to bring in James Harden."
"The title that House of Highlights used for the YT video is  &gt;Chuck Says James Harden is the Best He's Ever Seen, Shaq Disagrees"
James Harden finishes the game scoring 22 points with 22 points.
I love James Harden
"People shit on KD for joining GS, but had OKC not dealt James Harden he would've experienced similar success anyway. That team would have been special had they been given the chance to grow together.   Could've turned Westbrook into a 2 guard, eliminating some of his weaknesses as a late game decision maker in addition to having him shoot less in favor of being more committed to defense."
Another great playoff performance by James Harden
Bum ass James Harden the only one that missed a free throw
This James Harden guy is pretty good crazy no one else wanted him haha
"Keeping the stars in isn't necessarily being assholes. If it was a 30 point game, than yeah that's ridiculous. But being up 19 points with 4 minutes to go isn't necessarily a guaranteed win, considering the 3 ball nowadays. James Harden has had the Celtics come back 20 points down against him in the end of the 4th."
Bruh James Harden almost had a 20-20 game. They’re ridiculous
James harden is that guy fr
\\(-_-)/   it's James Harden whenever he is called for a fall
My brain can't comprehend how good the Nets are. Imagine having James Harden and having the luxury to just use him as a passing point guard.
"crazy what Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden wanting to live in NYC can do for your franchise right!"
james harden just having fun now lmfao
JAMES HARDEN YOU ARE RIDICULOUS
The Nets literally have 2 Teams than can compete  KD-Kyrie-Joe Harris-Blake-Mike James  Harden - Shooting Scrub 1 - Shooting Scrub 2 - Tall Scrub 1 - Tall Scrub 2
"After hours of statistical analysis I have determined with statistical significance at alpha&lt;.05 that all Kyrie Andrew Irving, Kevin Wayne Durant, and James Edward Harden Jr are all good at the game of basketball."
Does James Harden ever rest? I swear I haven't seen him out the game.
"Playmaking is overrated in playoffs,especially if the supporting cast isnt making shots.One thing I noticed last game is that Harde gets some generous assists,where we run a KD/Kyrie iso,Harden hands of the ball and then they score and he gets the assist sometimes,meanwhile when we run a James iso since he dribbles it up court,nobody gets the assist even though the play is the same."
"Steve Nash doesn’t get enough credit for developing unknown talents like James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving"
"James Harden is such a flopping piece of shit, man."
James Harden stfu jesus christ
"If you’re the Bucks next series, I say put Jrue on Kyrie the whole series to slow him down, live with James Harden step backs that he may or may not have a good night with, and punish their defense. They really do look beatable."
We all know James harden is fine come on dude
"LeBron James can't take Beasley one-on-one.  He's my GOAT, but he ain't the best at everything.  I still like Jordan and KD over Harden, though."
You would take James Harden over Lebron James...
"in fairness to Chuck he said ""the best 1 on 1 player I've ever seen,"" which is different than ""best ever.""  Also he said ""not Michael or Kobe.""  It's still ridiculous though, I'd argue that James Harden isn't even the best 1 on 1 player on his own team (it's KD)."
"It’s so crazy how it’s actually a debate on who’s the best player on the nets, james harden or Kevin Durant. That’s so ridiculous lol having 2 of the best players the last decade on 1 team."
James 'the best 1v1 player we've ever seen' Harden
Bkn my second home like I'm james harden
"It's literally as simple as I'm a bigger fan of the player than the team. It's a very normal concept. Quit reaching. If I could have a ""James Harden"" flair I would. Nothing bandwagon about it.  Not like you fans of the Warriors that showed up in 2016."
James Harden has big titties
It's James Harden and Fournier is no Lou Dort.
Whiplash from watching NHL to the NBA. Someone will get decapitated on the ice and the /r/hockey comments will be like “Well I don’t mind the officials missed the call but they should at least give that both ways”. Meanwhile in the NBA James Harden farts loud and the refs blow the whistle to figure out what just happened
James harden and kyrie just playing another game
Whoever is guarding James harden is getting rolled
it worked out this time but you do NOT want to abandon james harden at the 3 point line
James Harden getting superstar calls once again
"James Harden, with the 'no skill run and dunk.'"
James Harden
James Harden:  *Professional Scorer*
"Oh yeah, James harden is a hall of famer in his prime"
"James Harden playing the game at his pace, and playing defense. Basketball Wizard"
James Harden is the most important player on the Nets and it’s actually not close.
James Harden
It is better to have James harden then not
JAMES HARDEN IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA
James Harden is a good basketball player
I WANT TO LIVE IN A CABIN WOOD WITH JAMES HARDEN
Must be pretty sweet having James harden run your bench unit
FYM? Joe Harris and James Harden play with our second unit. Harden is basically the captain of it.
Imagine having James fucking Harden running ur second unit
"If anyone in the east truly believes they can beat a trio of James Harden,Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant then I feel bad for you"
JAMES HARDEN
I like how irving left the cavs because he wanted to be a focal point and ended up playing alongside kevin durant and james harden.
james harden is a crappy playoff player
They wanted Bam for sure. It’s James Harden. Trades isnt as easy as throwing all your players and picks and ending up with 2 star players and a bunch of g leaguers.

I guess the best player in the league is James Harden
Or just trade for James Harden
"Lifting the protections on their 2023 pick would've cost additional assets just by that move alone. You think OKC would've been cool with helping Miami trade for James Harden? They don't want a team who's future picks they own to be good. I doubt OKC helps out MIA without serious compensation.   On top of that, I really don't see them beating out BKN in a bidding war. LeVert and Allen are both better than Herro, Robinson or Nunn. olynyk and Iggy would just be there for salary filler - that's it."
"Or maybe James Harden was just so good, that this is what he was left with afterwards."
James Harden beat the curse
Bruh is the Suns only plans like sweep throughs and getting fouled James Harden style or
What is your point in bringing up the James Harden trade? By that time Giannis had signed his super max. Miami didn't trade for Harden because they didn't have the assets. Their best tradeable players weren't as good as BKN nor did they have enough tradeable 1st round picks.
"Okay , I hear you. But were those people that have tried to attack Curry named Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie?   Cause this is a whole different level than someone on a random Tuesday in January trying to iso Curry"
"Every team is, it's regular season they call anything. A top 3 player in the league, James Harden, gets damn near half his points off free throws."
"Heat fans, who would you rather have: Tyler Herro or James Harden?"
James harden leans back for the foul and trae young leans forward
"Lu Dort matching up against fellow asu alum James harden in game seven of the 2020 first round match up between the thunder and rockets. He dropped 30, id say for the defense he played in addition to 30 in a game 7 that could maybe count. Kinda a joke response kinda not."
Gallo got away with a little elbow there. A James harden special
"Not popularity. By actually judging how good a player was. Based on your logic Steve Nash was better than James Harden but we know he wasn’t. If that’s how you do it fine but not everyone does. I guess we will see in 30-40 years if we’re lucky, maybe he falls maybe he doesn’t. Same goes for everybody. Right now you still don’t have an argument why he’s not top 3."
"""James Harden is a playoff choker"" is just ignorant af. Dude didn't have an all star on most teams outside of an out of prime Dwight Howard and you expect him to beat the Warriors who had 3 or 4 all stars??"
"he played with bums in the last 5 years. draymond, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, James Harden, Kyrie Irving. Trash teams but he carried them"
"Any team with James Harden is a well oiled machine the man is an offense by himself  Kyrie was a walking brick, KD was mostly isoing, and none of the role players scored in the second half and he still had 10 assists along with dropping 41 as well"
"Yeah the whole ""buBbLe FrAUd hEaT cUlTuRe"" circlejerk for the last day has been tiring. Its the only thing that really bothers me about this sub; feels like theres a sizable portion of people here who dont actually care about basketball, they are just here to jump on whatever hate bandwagon is currently active. They get their memes and copypasted comments ready and just sit on r/new until whatever team/player that is currently the hate target loses. Clippers, Paul George, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Trae Young etc. It goes way beyond legitimate criticism and just ends up being a circlejerk where the frontpage will be covered with just ""x team/player sucks"" for a couple days and the comment sections are worse than twitter replies. Like when this sub turned into the official Paul George haters club for a week before suddenly remembering caring about mental health. I come here for basketball and memes, not to see the sub used as megaphone for venting your personal frustrations.       Like look at the posts yesterday when Miami lost, literally within seconds I saw people posting long ass hate comments they had clearly typed out in advance and were just waiting to copypaste spam the PGT with. Like how fucking sad is that? We had like 10 different frontpage posts that were all shitting on Miami or Butler in some form. Comment sections just full of insanely bitter 76ers/Bucks/Celtics fans that have apparently been seething since the last playoffs and waiting for their chance to do some hating.  Like yeah it was kinda embarrasing for the Heat to get swept, but did they really do anything that bad to get this level of hate? Saying that you are locked in is too arrogant? Losing against the reigning MVP and DPOY who just added Jrue+Tucker to an already solid roster? I can understand getting some shadeunfreude after getting your ass beat last year, but cmon man it gets embarrasing when you got Raptors flairs out here spamming comments about how embarrasing and trash the Heat are whilst finishing 12th. Even the official Bucks twitter account out here being petty posting cocky fan tweets that hade like 3 likes on em, like thats not something you can dig up from every fanbase on twitter.    If the Clippers end up losing I will prob just unsub cause the amount of concentrated hate in this subreddit will be enough to literally resurrect Hitler."
James Harden. Multiple times.
is better than James Harden
"Harden adds to the presence oversea as I think he is popular in china. The nets can have a big presence as their best three players are famous. Anyone who follows the NBA knows who Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden are.  We will see how long they stay with the Brooklyn Nets.   Knicks will always be New York's team as they have been bad for many years and still have a big loyal following that the Nets do not have in New York."
LeBron and Luka are Forwards that run Point and James Harden is a Guard that runs Point.
"Eh. If that’s the case then almost half the titles of the last decade have been bad for the nba. Stars joining up has been a thing for decades.   The reason I say the nets winning would be lame is because it’s the first time I’ve ever felt like a team is trying to straight up finesse their way to a title.   Kd and kyrie was planned at least a year in advance. Then kyrie complained about the roster last year without kd despite it being a pretty good roster even without kd. Then James harden forces his way out of Houston despite getting everything he asked for for half a decade. Brooklyn absolutely fucking robs Houston because of a petty owner.   Kyrie takes pto whenever he wants. They were injured all year and were about as conservative as possible, which is fair but no other team in the league had the same luxury. Kyrie talks about there being no true coach on their team. Their entire coaching staff is the gang from 7 seconds or less suns, none of which have ever even faked to care about defense. They don’t really play hard on defense outside of kd and the younger players and green I guess.   It just all feels very privileged and very boys club-ish if that makes sense. Like they figure it’ll work out in their favor because they can just score more than the other teams. I know a laker fan talking about privilege seems stupid, but I mean it in the sense of how the team operates itself. No laker contender I’ve ever seen has put flash and scoring ahead of playing defense and grinding.   Even the kd warriors were about getting the best shot possible and emphasized defense. Sure they were overpowered as all hell, but it didn’t feel nearly as gross as Brooklyn feels to me. I want defense, chemistry, and buying in to still matter."
"Heat deserved this sweep and this line big time. Those dummy's should've tried harder to pull off a deal for James Harden. On the Flippy flop, all the best to the Bucks. Watching them go down in the playoffs these past few years has given me some gnarly flashbacks to some first run Lebron Cavs teams."
"Idk I think it's all about having one where you go ""1 man army"" that makes it all worth.  Dwayne Wade has 3...but many reference his 2006 the most if not all the time since it was mostly just him.  Lebron James has 4...but many reference his 2016 the most since it was mostly just him.  Even if KD gets his 3rd, it just won't mean anything more or less than the GSW rings.  Sadly same for Harden I feel."
Mitchel going fulll James harden with the foul baiting.
I mean that's what he said at the time things change was he supposed to go to the front office and tell them not to trade for James harden?
Why does he have a job? The guy who made James Harden a 6th Man should be coaching the nearest high school instead.
"superstars are a different tier. or at least you can't put james harden, lebron james, and westbrook in the same category as jimmy."
I personally don’t care who wins this series but seeing James Harden out there who is already not known for his defense and on one leg and not being attacked would be infuriating if I was a Bucks fan. Coach Bud is an imposter.
"Harden still had 8 assists and was physically on the court doing things (not well, but he still helped the nets), there was a key possession near the end for the bucks that didn't end up with 2 points because of the defense James harden played on Giannis 1-on-1. That's a lot more than he would have contributed by not playing, there's a massive difference   And I know body language matters, but some random redditors trying to read players body language over a screen doesn't matter dick imo. The bucks still have a fine chance to win this thing."
Defensive Juggernaut James Harden
"People just need to accept that Westbrook is a guy who can carry your team into the playoffs but won't win you Series once you are there. He's played with Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden and Bradley Beal throughout his career. Dude just isn't a Championship caliber player in a major leading role."
bruh. There's no way James Harden should be able to shut down Giannis even when healthy. To do it on one leg? I'm just done. I remember this play from the game and I screamed at the TV what the fuck. A shorter hobbled James Harden made Giannis shoot a fade away? Not even going to try to back down the guy playing on one good leg? We're just gonna settle for the jumper? I'm just sad all over again watching this clip smh lol
The Warriors were a great team on both sides. Check the stats for that postseason. They were the #1 defensive team. Strictly in defensive personnel the Bucks are better but the Warriors were so much smarter and also had all defensive players like Klay and Iggy. Bucks have better D but don't underestimate the Warriors. They're comparable.   But anyway that's not even their biggest strength like you said. They were also #1 in offense by far.   KD had to keep up with an offense that can't figure out how to get past a hobbled James Harden to attack a center rotation of Blake and Jeff Green. LeBron had to keep up with an all time great offense that included 2 MVPs in their prime flanked by a top 2 shooter of all time. And he had to go through the best defense of the playoffs too.   KD was unreal but that LeBron performance man. Just something else
I mean the bucks could still win the series. It took a super human effort from KD and James Harden can’t move.
"Ways to prove random Redditor also didn't watch the game: James Harden returning from injury and a shell of himself had almost as many turnovers (4) as points (5) and he played 46 minutes. Bench is over there nephew.   And body language matters because its a window into the mental toughness of a team, of which the Bucks seem to have none."
"Assuming everyone's available and healthy 100%  PG: Steph Curry, CP3, Dame  SG: James Harden, Klay, PG  SF: Lebron, Kawhi  PF: Durant, Zion, Draymond  C: AD, Bam"
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
He should donate his hamstring to James Harden
"lol the hell?  Willis Reed was James Harden.  It was for the chip.  learn some history man.  i get that you need to stubbornly defend a kneejerk take, but don’t be dumb about it"
"Yes, I'll take a 5% Harden over Mike James and Tyler Johnson."
Ha ha I wish buddy.....I returned to India a few months back from the states.....I get up at 5 am to watch Nets and Bucks thinking it will be  the series off the playoffs..... But instead I'm treated with the horse shit play from the bucks....they make the stupidest plays like shooting jump shots when James Harden on one leg was guarding them..... man if the nets had all 3 stars healthy the bucks would have been swept by the Nets with a combined margin of 150 points......It makes me appreciate Lebron even more when he was going against the warriors with Nobody.....those games used to be competitive atleast
Bucks have a 16 point lead at halftime. James Harden and Joe Harris combine to shoot 3-21. Bucks lose by 6. Wow.
But can he do it without James Harden?  Jk jk
James Harden on one leg is better than like TLC or Tyler Johnson even Mike James
lmao James Harden looked older and wore out last night.. Thats what happens when you come back from injury lol. I don’t know why I even try with some of you lol
Yeah Harden was essential despite taking up residence in Brick City. His ball handling and facilitating were a huge step up from what Mike James (and before him Shamet) can provide. No chance KD is able to play that many minutes without a competent facilitator next to him.
"&gt; Clearly because of his injury so it doesn't say anything about him as a player but he was a disaster out there which makes KD's performance all the more impressive (and the Bucks choke more embarassing).  I do agree that he was bad, but I think if Tyler Johnson or Mike James are in the game instead of Harden, Bud doesn't have Jrue guarding those guys and potentially starts trapping Durant.  Bud was respecting Harden to a fault, that opened up for a lot considering Jrue was a nonfactor defensively all night. That sort of impact from a guy with a barely functioning hamstring is unreal"
Bettter to have hobbled harden than mike James
He won’t be great until he realizes you can just post up injured James harden rather than taking a fadeaway
"That's one of the things I hate most about NBA coaches. I don't give a fuck if they are in foul trouble. Sure, you want to make sure they don't foil out and can be in in the last 2 minutes of a close game.  You know what's better than having Jrue Holiday guarding James Harden up 2 with 2 to play? Jrue Holiday being fouled out and being up 10 with 2 to play.  There is absolutely no way that sitting a star with 3 fouls improves your chance of winning. No way at all."
Don’t be a casual. James harden is always a factor just by his presence
James harden could start a game 0-20 and you still can’t double off of him. His presence alone is worth having on the court. That man has heart
James Harden: Skip Bayless is a disaster
"I know it's beyond repetitive at this point, but when it comes to talent, the only team that can stop Brooklyn is the Nets.  Irving out? OK. Harden playing damn near the whole game and yet making one more field goal than you or I? OK. Milwaukee jumping out to a big early lead? OK.   Just didn't matter. Will KD put up another boxscore like last night? I don't think so. If he plays the entire game again, is it possible? Very. He's just that damn good. James will play better. Kyrie will return at some point. Blake suddenly looks like a different player than when he was with Detroit (I know LeBron and KD get knocked for switching teams, but gimme players leaving via free agency after giving it their all over someone phoning it in like Griffin did in Detroit, gut that's a different subject.)"
"I'm going to say no, they cannot get better production from a healthy body off the bench. James still has to be respected to some degree, you don't want him spotting up wide open. And he still dropped 8 dimes and had 6 rebounds. The Nets bench had 6 assists and 4 rebounds combined.   A key play is when James had the ball at the top of the key, KD motions, and then has to blatantly point to Shamet (I think?) to make a cut and James hits him for an easy layup. I don't think a play like this is happening without KD+Harden."
James Harden is being docked for dogging his way out of Houston to force a trade. Some people like Simmons are basically choosing to actually hold his Houston games against him and tbh I agree with that.
"Yeah that is a good question, I think we’re better with 70% of Harden facilitating on offense than Mike James or TJ out there."
Pop would chew the fuck out of Giannis for that fadeaway on James Harden.
"Are you assuming that James Harden being 9 inches shorter would still have to move 220lbs around? His weight would scale down with his height, which would VERY likely make him quicker and more agile than he currently is, which when coupled with his skill, clearly would warrant him being in the league"
"The Bucks are a tale of two halves. They'll come out the gate running plays, moving the ball around, and playing good defense which will give them a lead into the half. Then the next half, they'll just iso the rest of the way, lose the lead, and enter panic mode. You can't be a championship team and lose to this version of the Nets with no Kyrie and injured James Harden. They weren't attacking Harden who had one leg and were letting Durant iso with Brook getting cooked in drop coverage.   Idk how you support this team regularly. This is my eastern conference team cause I like Giannis, but I'd die watching them do this on the reg."
"James Harden looks like a chipmunk, especially if he's screaming and he looks fucking cute doing it."
"As a Rockets fan, it's crazy to see James Harden nowhere there."
Number 3 is on the players. They should be self aware be able to at least punish James Harden. No one has to say anything to 2*MVP about getting advantages over injured players.
"This is KD's ""2012 Game 6""  But no you don't deserve an apology, because as amazing as he was he doesn't have that stat line nor win the game without James Harden and a crazy outlier game from Jeff Green.   You mentioned Joe Harris going off. That didn't happen.  Enjoy your downvotes. If you repost this I'll downvote you again"
"Around the 2020 All-Star Game, Giannis didn't want Harden on the team because Kemba Walker can pass.  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2878413-james-harden-on-giannis-wish-i-could-be-7-feet-tall-and-dunk-takes-no-skill](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2878413-james-harden-on-giannis-wish-i-could-be-7-feet-tall-and-dunk-takes-no-skill)  &gt;""I wish I could be 7-feet, run and just dunk. That takes no skill at all,"" Harden said. ""I gotta actually learn how to play basketball and how to have skill. I'll take that any day.""   &gt;   &gt;While Harden didn't mention a player by name, his comment came after Nichols mentioned Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo's joke about taking Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker over Harden in the All-Star Game draft since he wanted someone who would pass the ball."
He needs to work on having a better coach. Why is he taking 8 3s a game when he’s defended by injured James harden.
"Most comments in this thread are complaining about the Bucks, their coach, Giannis, or expressing frustration which says it all. Nephews don't understand we're witnessing greatness. Lebron/Steph/KD are like Rafa/Nadal/Djokovic we're blessed to witness this.  I don't like Lebron James on the court at all but damn is the Suns Lakers series and Suns Nuggets or even Clippers Jazz night and day in terms of how little I care about the other two series. Any game with Steph, KD, or Lebron playing good minutes and playing to win is must watch basketball.   Kevin Durant is an all time great. I'm still not a fan of Harden or Kyrie but I definitely am pulling for Brooklyn over the Bucks. KD, Kyrie, and Harden OOZE skill and BBIQ. KD takes his physical gifts and matches it with such versatility.  Hope Giannis can develop his post play, play-making, and maybe get a hook or floater, his shooting is just not there and eventually he won't be able to just ram into the opposing defender and dunk it when he ages."
"That’s because he joined Steph and Klay and got success with those guys. What he did tonight he did with Joe Harris, hobbled James Harden, and old Blake Griffin"
*I wish I was 7ft and could just run and dunk but I actually have to learn how to play basketball*   James Harden
"Oh sorry I misread it, I thought he said James Harden is a trash ass player. My b"
"Harden with one leg is still a better offensive threat, defender, and play maker than Mike James. And I think he was playing a safer way, basically no drive and be a shooter and floor general"
"Leadership, pull 1 defender out to guard him at the 3 so KD had more room to operate, and minimal ball handling while they try to get KD open  You right tho, he had no business being out there but just the fact that he had Harden on the back of his jersey forced the bucks to guard him closer than say a Bruce Brown or Mike James"
That's James 'it's easy to be a superstar when you're 7 feet' Harden for you. Looks like he backed up the beef this game.
Every thing I hear coming from that organization about James harden sounds like they are not protecting him from himself. Seems like he shouldn't even be in the floor
If James harden has 6 points and kyrie is out they should win every game no matter if Kd has 50
"If they played Mike James instead of this version of Harden it's a L. Beards shot didn't fall, but his passing was really good"
"Really interesting that the Bucks couldn’t exploit James Harden more on offense. Seemed like they only went straight at him instead of making him move laterally, which he seemed pretty limited at. Their whole offensive system needs an overhaul, or maybe they just need an actual offensive system in general."
"nash made good moves thohugh in the second half. Benching brown and going with jeff was obvious but still done. Also he kept shamet in for extended time, he realized offensively we just desperately needed the additional spacing. Also mike james never saw the floor again because he sucekd on defense. Claxton also never saw the floor because we cant afford him clogging the lane for us on offense since harden wasnt there to feed him lobs. Nash made all the right moves with our personnel in the second half."
"If it was another player that wasn't Harden, they absolutely would have doubled KD all game. Hell, sometimes they had 2 guys on Harden, do you think Mike James could have drawn that much attention?"
"They implemented the ""Harden rule"" because of this a few years back  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-the-nbas-newly-imposed-harden-rule-will-impact-james-harden-this-season/"
Can you....can you just grab someone's arm because it's near you and then hit yourself in the face with it to get a foul?   People talk about Trae and Embiid but the only person I've ever seen grab someone's arm and just hook it into his body until the refs call the foul is James and now he's doing it *off-ball*. And unlike Trae or Embiid or anyone else I have never seen it called a foul on Harden. He always gets it to go his way. This must be legal then right? But how is grabbing someone's arm legal?
I thought James harden open up basketball academy for girls and Pj tucker assault one of the students
A crippled James Harden is still better than Mike James
"Because the Nets are somehow, almost inexplicably, one of the deepest teams in the league. If one or two role players isn't on don't worry they have more. If you told me someone who wasn't KD or Harden went 7/8 from deep I would have said it was Harris. No? Shamet? Really? Well I guess Mike James has been playing we--oh it was Jeff Green. Of course it was.....  You can't just leave these dudes wide open and expect nothing to happen they aren't the Sixers."
He willed himself to play tonight. Honestly if we had mike James out there we might’ve lost. Harden had at least 5 passes for layups tonight that no other guy for us can hit. He also took some pressure off kd in terms of ball handling
Bruh Harden just being out there jogging around firing some bullet passes changed the game. KD didn’t have to handle the ball the whole ass game plus Jrue wouldn’t leave Harden alone..because well he’s James mf Harden
"Harden wasn't close to 100% tonight, but the alternatives are Mike James and Tyler Johnson lol."
"Unpopular opinion time...  The Bucks are never going to win the championship without another superstar who likes handling the ball to help Giannis, because Giannis' basketball IQ is nowhere near that of the other top players/former MVPs.  He is an elite athlete who would excel in any sport, but his basketball decision making is not good.   The two biggest signs of this are his continued insistence shooting bad threes despite being something like 6 for 23 this series, and the second and more disconcerting, his ""tell"" - that thing he does where he takes two steps back at the start of the 3pt line signalling in a manner obvious and clear enough  to be picked up by someone in the next solar system that he's going to drive to the hoop. The second time he did this today James Harden, who was having a horrible time adjusting to being back after missing games and returning from an injury, was easily able to steal the ball from Giannis' giant hands.  Giannis' is an elite athlete, with a gifted physique and nearly unstoppable when he decides to play in the paint, but in terms of time spent handling the ball, if he's the one with the most minutes, Milwaukee's going to have a tough time beating top tier teams with more weapons in the playoffs."
He’s spot on even though he didn’t have a good shooting night I still thought there could be a moment that James Harden becomes literally James Harden.
"Lol I never said that don't make up a straw man.  You said Harden wouldn't be in the league if he was 5'8.  Well if he was 5'8 but he's still James Harden, he will still make the league as there were examples throughout league history where people of such heights having a solid career despite not being as skilled as James Harden."
James Harden is a disgrace.  Refs who make these calls are also a disgrace.
"I lol’d when I scrolled up to see your flair.   Ok I’m the coach, Where you want it Giannis?!? We riding you baby you want it in the post? Cool. How about we get a cross match make it even easier that ok? Do you one better let’s actually get the hobbled guy to guard you would that be ok? Result: Hobbled James harden **waves off help** , Giannis takes a fadeaway. Brick   Uhhh, ok, hmm how about we get Khris Middleton to drive and dish. Let’s get you an easy dunk! Result: Giannis drops a perfect pass hat woulda been an easy dunk .   Hmm. Damn. Ok just clear out! Jeff greens literal nickname is UNCLE! He’s 49 years old surely you can get an easy bucket on him! Result: Missed 1 point blank shot, gets fouled on the other and makes 1 of 2. Shooting 37% from the line for the series. THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT     Mfer please. None of that is coaching that’s on the player"
I can come up with a list of 5 players not on the first team that could beat the 1st team (with only one player even being on the 2nd or 3rd team):      1- LeBron James    2 - James Harden   3 - Jason Tatum      4 - Kevin Durant   5 - Anthony Davis
how the fuck is james harden 1-10 FG and 0-8 3P and still +4  im starting to question the validity of +/-
"I disagree, for a star coming back after an injury they need him to get back into rhythm again. They need the defense to respect that he's still going to take the shot because he's James fucking Harden. He didn't take close to the amount of shots he would usually take with Kyrie out either."
Harden carried the corpse of Faried and James mf Ennis.. That was his MVP I’ve said it before I’ll say it again.
"""I was born in the darkness...molded by it."" --James Harden"
Elite post defender and spot-up point guard James Harden
"Giannis really said this about Harden after losing the ASG using this strategy:  &gt;Offensively, we were just trying to find whoever James Harden was guarding. That’s who we thought we’d have the opportunity to score on.  He's proving Harden's comments about having no skill right and his own shit talk wrong"
The Bucks best player tonight was James Harden
Watching a shell of James Harden call off the double just for Giannis to clank one....
He would be too gassed in the 4th to *checks notes* take pullup 3's and brick fadeaways against James Harden
"Seriously tho, like KD played one of the greatest playoff games ever but it wouldn’t have even mattered if even Jason Kidd was coaching the bucks rn. The fact that James Harden played 46 minutes tells you they didn’t attack the weaknesses. The fact that the Bucks scored only 108 points against a team that’s injured and isn’t strong defensively when the Bucks season average is 120 tells you they didn’t even know there was a weakness on the court. Bucks should’ve won this game on sheer offence. Coach dumbanddumber has to get fired."
Who knows? Kevin durant for some reason just looks better when theres another superstar on the floor. Regardless if they are playing well. It just worked. Kd went off and it could possibly be because he was comforted knowing james harden was in the trenches going to war with him. Confidence is everything in basketball. And kd found his with james harden on the floor.
Hard disagree. I think hardens BBIQ and ability to be a floor general/ coach/ decoy is an understated part of this win. I'll take Harden in a wheelchair over Mike James.
&gt;I guess but that was more like 20% James Harden instead of 50% lol
*1-legged* elite post defender James Harden
Lol that's the funny part. The James Harden we got tonight is still more ideal than whoever would have been playing instead of him.
Giannis would've gotten cooked as well. James harden scored 1 field goal tonight they could have easily afforded to throw more traps and doubles at Durant.
Bucks blew a 17pt lead vs KD and the shell of James Harden. This series is over either in 6 or 7. Nets winning KD is the best player on the court that's all that matters.
About the same odds as Joe Harris and James Harden going 1/15 from 3.
"Maybe I'm spoiled by watching my team flawlessly execute their game plan for two rounds, but how the hell did the Nets get away with playing a one legged James Harden for 45 FUCKING MINUTES?!?!"
"Jonathon Simmons played great defense on James Harden in the 2017 WCSF, particularly in Game 6."
"Guard him 1v1. Go take the matchup despite what your coach says. You’re first team all defense. Or maybe don’t shoot a fade-away over James Harden and take it to the rim. You know, stuff to get the job done"
"Tough era to get over the hump because any given year during his career, him, Kyrie, Curry, Dame, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker, IT, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Kobe Bryant were all in the mix for all-NBA. I think the 2 years he absolutely deserved it were the years he got it which I think were 2015 and 2016."
Look at fucking James Harden over here shooting 15 FT in a middle school game.
Elite post defender James Harden
He was but 50% of James Harden was still a better option as primary distributor than Mike James or whoever would have been next up for Steve Nash.
The point is Jrue shouldn’t have been guarding him like he’s the normal James Harden.  That was the mistake.
James harden was right all along
"Lmao this is garbage.  I'm Team Harden all day, not even hating ... mistakes were made but the team/organization didn't ""quit"" on James Harden."
"He's had the same weaknesses for years, got poetically exposed in the Toronto series (losing in 6 at the 6ix), and has yet to make significant improvements. Anyone who is disappointed in their 2 time MVP and DPOY puts too much value in the regular season. James Harden was right about him"
"Isaiah Thomas was in the league and he was certainly not as skilled as James Harden.  You can bring it down all the way to 5'4"" and there would still be Muggsy Bogues and Earl Boykins (the former a starting level PG and the latter a solid role player) to refute this simplistic, ignorant point."
James harden has a hamstring injury
"He is literally injured. Rusty James Harden can do a lot fucking more than what I just watched. Stop talking to me, you're a delusional bandwagon ass loser. I also got some bad news for you if you think Kyrie is coming back this year 😂😂😂😂 fucking tired of people on here that literally don't understand english trying to argue with me."
Imagine if they played together alongside someone with the caliber of James Harden too
"Why can’t you guys understand this. Yes, you’re right, he could barely shoot tonight. But the fact of the matter is that Jrue fucking Holiday was guarding him the entire time like he was the normal James Harden and this was huge for the Nets. Wouldn’t even matter if he had a broken arm, as long as Bud is getting Jrue to guard him like that, Harden needs to be out there."
"james harden, lebron"
"People keep saying ""there's no way Milwaukee gets back here again"" as if Kyrie Irving isn't injury prone, James Harden isn't fat and out of shape and in his 30s which led to his injury, and Durant doesn't have an Achilles injury in his history. That team is not guaranteed to do anything."
James harden 53-16-17  Hakeem 38-17-6-7-12 is my personal choice though
"Hard to find someone of James Harden's value. An all-time player who will end up in the Hall of Fame no matter what for me.  Nevertheless, James Harden didn't want to stay in Houston anymore.  So the Rockets had to do something about it. With this second pick, there is a way to get the rebuilding process going in the right direction."
"James Harden is James Harden, but the draft pick could be anything! It could even be a James Harden! You know how much we've wanted one of those!"
"Man the #2 pick, maybe you can get someone like James Harden."
"What?  I'm assuming you're saying LeBron has been the best player since 2008 where Kobe was arguably the best.  So by that logic Kevin Durant was the 2nd best other than in 2009 where Dwight led the Magic to the Finals.  Hmm.. thinking about it but I don't know man.  I'd argue James Harden could have been #2 in his MVP year and in the year where Giannis first won it.  Also as a Warriors fan, how can you not list Steph as the 2nd best in at least one of those 5 years during that run?  He was better than KD at least once.  Also KD was injured all of last year, so 2nd would by default fall to:  Harden/Giannis/Curry/Kawhi/etc."
"So you’re just going to assume that next year players will all be healthy and James Harden and Kyrie won’t miss 20+ games? Maybe Lebron will be healthy, but I’d definitely count on this being the new norm with players getting faster and stronger."
Nets suck cuz James harden perennial playoff choker tho
"Yeah the inconsistency of people hating on flopping really bothers me  Marcus Smart can flop and he’s a tremendous defender, Lillard can jump into his own teammate and he’s a killer &amp; the best scorer in the league  Chris Paul can fall down after a hit and everything he’s ever worked for is meaningless and he’s less than a human being, James Harden can hook your arms reaching for the ball and every basket he’s ever scored has been gifted to him by refs  It’s really immature, usually Reddit has better discussions than Instagram/Twitter, but it seems like stupid fans are just always gonna be a part of the NBA"
Imagine if he tried to solve the problem back then by trading James Harden and building around Chris Paul.  Knowing what we know in 2021 that may have worked out really well but imagine the backlash back then.
I dunked on Bam with James Harden a few days ago as well
Unless its James Harden playing the against the Warriors.
"He needs to be more consistent but he plays just like James Harden and has shown the ability to be quite the playmaker. As a Rockets fan who watched every game this season his ceiling Is James Harden and floor I would say something similar to Jordan Clarkson. He has a knack for taking tough/contested shots that are sometimes unnecessary;but that is expected of a young player suddenly thrusted into a primary ball handler role. The Rockets Reddit is leaning Green and personally that would make a dangerous backcourt. Mobley would also help in the pick and roll and overall spacing if he could develop his three. His swing factor, like most players these days is his 3 point shooting. Some games he looked like James harden in the flesh and in others it was clear the ball wasn’t going to be falling for him. Like Harden, his body language can be very revealing of his performance."
"It’s a bit misleading. Harden wanted Chris gone, Tillman had to get rid of him. In explaining the move, what could Tillman say?   - “I am not in charge, I decide based on whatever James wants.” Nope. True, but humiliating.  - “I’m a basketball expert, Chris Paul is a bad player and terrible fit.” Nope, clearly bullshit.  - “I’m a business man, that’s a bad deal!” That’s the one.   What fool."
"James Harden though won an MVP before anyone of them. So, what is the point?"
That he would rather have James harden and be a low seed then have the second pick and be terrible
"Man, imagine if James Harden with all his talent had the humility to listen and learn from CP3."
"I just think they were a little premature on deciding that Chris Paul - who had warranted 160 million only 2 years prior - was on the decline as an athlete. Injury history has always been something to consider with this man but his mvp level play has always been above and beyond when on the court. If we really want to look at the pieces that weren’t working towards a championship for the rockets I think unfortunately we have to look at James harden. I’m not talking in terms of marketability or return on investment from superstardom but from only a perspective of winning I think we can question James ability to win, especially considering he cud not get it done with Kevin Durant twice and the likes of Russell, John wall, and of course Chris Paul."
"It's a mistake in hindsight. In that moment he did what was right for his team. You are looking at things through hindsight.  What I am specifically pointing to is they still thought they could compete for a championship with James and wanted to keep him. There was no indication Harden wanted to leave at that point. I'm saying they were paying a lot of money for a situation that didn't look bright. He is a new NBA owner. I'm simply contextualizing his perspective. Not calling him right or anything, just being aware that hindsight is 20:20 and not pretending I didn't also think it was a good idea when they moved him (although I didn't think Russ was the right piece to go after)"
"I think it's important to make the distinction that, prior to this year especially, Chris Paul's ""way"" of playing basketball was no more successful than any of the stars he played with and he seems really intent on playing that way.  For all of the stuff I'm reading about others having ego problems, it's likely just as true that CP has an ego problem of his own that's just as egregious as the people y'all are talking about (Harden, Blake, etc.).  Chris Paul wanting to play Chris Paul's brand of basketball is perfectly reasonable but it's no more rational than James Harden or Blake Griffin wanting to play their brand of basketball.  He didn't have championship level experience when he played with those guys and with Harden specifically, he was just flat out worse and less successful than Harden had been up to that point."
"So the nets did not have a players that was better than an injured James Harden? You can’t use the excuse “he was injured” when he played all those minutes. If he was that injured he should have played limited mins. Otherwise, the nets are just stupid and deserve to lose for playing an injured player or not having anyone on their bench that’s better than an injured player. You’d be saying the exact same thing if Anthony Davis played 50 mins and the lakers lost and lakers fans said it was because he was injured"
"Did you watch the fucking game lmao. He played because he was better than Mike James, but if you think that was anything close to the actual James Harden then you're either a giant homer, didn't watch, or just a troll"
"LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Carmelo Anthony   Russell Westbrook   All of them could retire tomorrow and would still be first ballot. You have others who’d get in but not 1st ballot because of a lack of longevity(Jokic , Giannis, etc)"
"Who said they were? Of course they werent planning to tank, who in their right mind would with a top 5 player in the NBA such as James Harden"
[lmfao part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-olhd3oG3lI)  [lmfao part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARVAqLtnms)  [lmfao part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLt41_SSxQo)  [lmfao part 6](https://gyazo.com/0339ef3b3f34afc1b4d6820295107de0)  Fuck this sub. This place literally has me defending James Harden and Pat fucking Bev today.
"James Worthy  James Harden  LeBron James  Michael"" Mike"" James  Michael Jordan"
the James Harden effect. Can't believe that man still gets so many BS calls off his flops
I would just like to say fuck James Harden. That is all
We got the 2nd pick instead of being stuck in 1st or 2nd round exit purgatory  It’s James harden that it hasn’t gone well for yet
James Harden: “I know what we need to do. I know exactly what we need to do. We’ll figure it out this summer.”
Regardless in this situation it wouldn’t have mattered. James harden was threatening to leave if cp3 wasn’t traded. Cp3 was forced off Houston cause of harden.
They literally didn’t have a choice. James harden is the reason cp3 was traded. James harden cared more about winning a beef then winning a ring.
James harden looks like a fool right now
James Harden: “I know what we need to do. I know exactly what we need to do. We’ll figure it out this summer.”  https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1127070793471614976  Funny how karma ends up working out. This was before CP3 was traded to OKC for Westbrook. It's funny how the paths of both CP3 and Harden have been.
"Like I said having a hammy flare up in 2018 is bad timing   After that his personality clashed with harden, you didn’t get the same version of him in 2019 but I don’t think harden helped either.. literally was making run an offense 4 v5 caused a strain and honestly that’s enough to throw a team off. Still going 6 vs a healthy superteam Warriors is impressive.   I think context the rockets have to give up on him because of what was happening internally not entirely because his play dropped off.. I think his play dropped off because his and everyone’s commitment was frayed.. obviously why he took his health serious AFTER being traded as a F U to harden. And now he’s in the finals before James and largely because of Hardens commitment to health which is Ironic"
James Harden is as much to blame idiot
"Wish I had this in mind when this thread was first made, but: James Harden is better than Luka Doncic."
"Chris Paul has been let down so many times in big situations, the ending of Blow is about the only way it can end:   ""Throughout my lifetime I've left pieces of my heart here and there. And now, there's almost barely enough to stay alive. But I force a smile, knowing that my ambition far exceeded my talent.""  I imagine his HOF ceremony will just be him walking around a prison yard with James Harden, Tyson Chandler, David West, Blake, DeAndre and whoever else failed to show up in a game 7.   Trust me, someone on the Suns will choke in the finals. I don't know who, but someone will."
Can’t win with these cats- James harden.
"I love this consensus the NBA nephews have reached that just because it was a 3-2 series Chris Paul... James Harden(?) and.... Eric Gordon (????) would have beat KD, Steph and Klay 😂"
"Wouldn't have even been a contender without James Harden, how tf was he a problem lol"
Yeah you’re right.   Usually both KD and James Harden are the pinnacle of health. Especially these last few years and especially at the end of the season.
"I feel like you could brush up on your history a little bit.  Chris Paul left the Clippers, Blake, DJ, and Austin so that he could have a better chance at winning a ring.  It's not noteworthy that he made it to the Finals before them since that was his goal all along and he forced a move that would make it happen.  &gt;Chris Paul and James Harden were determined to play together, and found a way with Rockets-Clippers trade agreed upon today.  https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/880089874094841856?  &gt;""He left because he wanted to be with James Harden,"" Rivers said. ""Let's not get that twisted. I wish him well. I have no problem with that.""  &gt;So the point guard, who wanted to play with Harden, instead agreed to opt in for the final year of his contract to facilitate the trade.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19758509/la-clippers-trade-chris-paul-houston-rockets  What is noteworthy is that he made it to the Finals before Harden could return to the Finals since Harden is the one who had him banished to OKC."
Lmao that has nothing to do with James Harden refusing to move around off-ball
personally I struggle to blame James harden for losing 3 straight to the greatest team ever when he was missing his costar
Lol Projecting a bit? Its not that deep bro. I'm a kings fan I know my team sucks rn. But the celtics are gonna keep making these moves that don't move the needle when championship pieces are in the cards for them if they could just part with their guys. My team didn't pass on james harden. I'd be passed if they did tho just to keep fox or something.
"No, he’s just a harder scapegoat because he’s a sweet seeming little vegan man.  The real problem was James harden, dude is a diva and Burned bridges with too many teammates"
&gt; Everybody agrees James Harden is the most important player on the team.  Who is everybody and do they?
"Yeah man, Trae Young stepping on a refs foot is cause of a condescended schedule. I’m sure James Harden showing up to the season out of shape didn’t attribute to his soft tissue injuries."
"Did some of the heavy lifting to get them there, sure. I mean, its prime James 'leader of none' Harden, it was finally his moment to ascend to greatness. Instead he turned an all time David v Goliath moment into a meme, then traded the guy who almost won it for him for Russ."
"Call me crazy, but I don’t think Trae flops. Now yeah yeah I know that what he does do is a pain in the ass, stopping in a dime, jumping into defenders. He can take advantage of that as long as that’s legal, but when he does draw contact like that, he doesn’t flail around and fall when he gets the contact. You can see James harden do his arm hook and he’ll flail his arms and all, and there’s stuff like this that’s not even part of the play. Trae definitely doesn’t flop when it’s not in an actual play, and as annoying as his ways of drawing contact is, I rarely see him flail and flop and exaggerate his contact."
"Better question, who has the more iconic shot, the James harden step back three or the Kevin Durant pull up fifteen footer over everybody and everything"
"If you compare Durant 2010-2014 to Harden 2016-2020, Durant comes out a bit ahead.  Harden has better volume scoring (4 extra PPG), while Durant has better efficiency relative to league average (115 TS+ to 111 TS+).   Over those years, Durant scored 1460 more points than a player with league average TS% would have with his number of scoring attempts, while Harden scored ""only"" 1170 points more than league average dude would have (this is ""TS Add"").  ||||Play|Leag|Leag|| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|From|To|TS|TS|TS+|TS Add| |Kevin Durant|2010|2014|.617|.538|115|1462.5| |James Harden|2016|2020|.614|.555|111|1171.1|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 7/1/2021."
" &gt;hence why they are playing guys like James Harden on him and why, despite having the worst defender on the floor guarding him, he's still shooting under 32% from 3 against defenders that have serious mobility problems.  I mean even when he was shooting better you could put your worst defender on him."
"The last time he was a lethal corner shooter was in the 2018-2019 playoffs.  Every year after that his numbers fell off a cliff.  I'm pretty sure most teams have noticed that, hence why they are playing guys like James Harden on him and why, despite having the worst defender on the floor guarding him, he's still shooting under 32% from 3 against defenders that have serious mobility problems."
I mean I he wasn't exactly carrying when he had prime James Harden on the team
"That's silly, your comment implies that literally ANYTHING can happen in the NBA, i.e a superstar of a contending team literally dying, but it wouldn't have an asterisk.  6 of the 15 All-NBA players have been injured in this postseason, four of them either missed significant time or were ruled out of the postseason entirely and in those six, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley and James Harden are not included.  All of the Top 8 teams have had one of their top 3 players miss significant time (assuming Trae and Giannis miss more games), the winning team will win because all their opponents got injured. There's a significant chance we get an NBA Finals between Phoenix and Milwaukee/Atlanta where the Eastern Conference champion won't have their BEST PLAYER on the floor.  One injury here and there happens, but every single team that made the second round? 40% of the All-NBA teams? Stop it."
"It’s even more satisfying with Chris Paul in the Finals and James Harden watching it from a strip club somewhere, as Kyrie performs a ritual on a flat earth model off to the side."
Chris Paul &gt; James Harden
"I literally opened by saying I loathe Patrick Beverley. Come on man, grown ass adults need to be better than that “but he did it first😩 grade school business.”  Two wrongs never have and never will make a right. I’m all for playing physical and even hard fouls going both ways.  That’s a part of the game that I love and it really only comes out in the playoffs but the flopping and whistle baiting BS needs to be stopped by all the players. It’s pathetic and I for one can’t wait till next season when players start getting called for offensive fouls for some of that BS. Again, I am a big CP3 fan. Ever since Steve Nash retired he has taken the throne as my favorite point guard in the league, doesn’t mean I can’t take issue with a part of his game that pissed me off when I see it out of any hooper. Can’t stand it when Lebron does it, can’t stand it when James harden does it, can’t stand it when anyone does it. For the record I respect and love Chris Paul and Lebron James but just not that part of their game in the past couple years. Harden made it seem like a good idea with how often it has gotten him free points at the line but even the refs/league are starting to realize it’s bad for the game. It’s a weak ass way to play the game. These guys are too amazing to resort to that stuff. It’s part of why so many old heads complain about the game being too soft these days. Pat Bev is one of my most hated players in the league because he regularly does this kind of bitch made shit."
Houston wins and James Harden gets a second banner hung up at the strip club
How's this for a line up of players with shitty rookie years:  James Harden  Kobe Bryant  Kawhi Leonard  Demar DeRozan  Dirk Nowitzki
"James Harden and Lou Will gonna be snapping at the bits to come to Vegas.   I'd be so torn if I had to root between Vegas and PHX though. PHX has been my team since I was a kid watching Charles Barkley(because Fuck California sports teams, lol), but I live and was born in Vegas, so it'd be hard to root for both."
James Harden is the most annoying and it’s not debatable.
And that has only got him two rings. Kobe was relentless . He would shoot as many shots as it took to get the win. Kd be scared to mess up his percentages. And he’s not a better scorer either. We talking about Kobe bean Bryant. 81 points. Over 130 40 pt games. Averaged 35 for a season. James harden is closer to kd then kd is Kobe
But.. James Harden did go to the finals. With OKC in 2012
james harden really demanded cp3 get traded lmao
James harden didn’t wanna play with this man no more an now gon be the only one ringless
Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns made the finals and James Harden and the Brooklyn Nets did not.
James harden eat your heart out
Nothing but respect for CP3. Getting to the Finals before the Clippers and James Harden (since he had him forced out of Houston) is hilarious and amazing.
James Harden: sitting at home eating ice cream to force a trade back to CP  Kevin Durant: sitting with his agent figuring out which super team he can form now to most fuck Brooklyn  Kyrie: burning sage in the badlands and drinking aloe water  Nets fans: Experiencing another yearly disappointment with a wide open finals
"Chris Paul will be an NBA champion before Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden"
Chris Paul in the finals before James Harden lmao
I have no respect for CP3 anymore dude is the biggest flopping baby I’ve ever witnessed next to james harden 😂
"Honestly, I'm less annoyed by flopping than I am the Trae Young/James Harden shit."
"CP3 is the best lawyer in the NBA. I mean he truly is built differently when it comes to working the refs outside the game, like an inverse James Harden."
Win or lose Demarcus Cousins started the season getting disrespected by James Harden and isn't at home on his couch right now.
"Rain, sleet, snow, death, taxes, James Harden is in the strip club."
James Harden has assumed direct control of Pat Bev tonight
Lebron James&gt;James Harden&gt;Lebron Harden&gt;James James
"I spit out some of my drink when I got to James Harden.  ""Fat Mamba""  ""Porcelain Mama""  ""Bumping Porcelain"""
He was James Harden wym
What happened to James Harden in game 6 of 2017 against Spurs?
I always chuckle at Boy Band James Harden for Luka
"Tmac demanded a trade there, Dwight signed there before James Harden was a superstar, OKC had to trade Harden because they knew he'd go to Houston anyway and they just took a pretty damn good player from Detroit just this last offseason"
"See, to me endurance, durability and toughness are markers for a champion too.   We also can’t dismiss roster builds for depth, it’s the anti putting your eggs in one basket with a couple stars.  It’s next man up, and also allows you to load manage throughout the season   We are quick to make a big deal about this but KD coming off an Achilles tear didn’t Have another major injury despite his workload. The heat managed to avoid major injuries.   Sometimes things are just unlucky or built up. Kawhi has degenerative knees. Embiid has pre existing problems. Lebron has a massive load and is getting older. James Harden came to work out of shape. Chris Paul is old. Davis is injury prone. Spida has a big workload but ankle injuries in ball are common. Trae was a freak acccident with a red but also common.  Are we saying the clippers beating the jazz is unspectacular because Donovan’s foot when kawhi also was out?   The fascination with stars is interesting but insulting to the other players. The booker playing through a smashed nose etc"
"When questioned on the system, he got annoyed and said something along the lines of ""the Rockets do it every game and no one complains.""  1) A ton of people complained about the Rockets's offense, including the Rockets.  2) The Rockets had James Harden and CP3/Westbrook running the show while the Knicks had Randle and Elfrid Payton."
"There's a VERY thin line that Harden crosses, which is why fans don't like him. He hunts fouls looking for fouls.      What you're talking about is being aggressive, knowing the defender can't foul or risk fouling. Harden hunts fouls for the foul alone. Scoring off that foul is secondary to him.      There is a difference, even if that difference isn't reflected in the rules. LeBron James charging the paint knowing his defender and the help defender are high on fouls is not the same thing as jumping into a defender behind the 3 point arc. It is not the same as hooking your defender to try and sell a foul.      Stop trying to equate them because they are equal in the eyes of the law. A man stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family is not the same as a man stealing a loaf of bread because he does not want to pay.      They are not equal, Harden does not do what plays have done forever. His lens of attack is entirely different from other players that charge the defense.      What he does comes across as cheese. When players charge the defense, daring them to foul, it comes across as dominant."
James Harden
"Not an all time great but Jimbo Slice for James Harden is pretty quality, especially now that he’s accumulated more mass."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
James Harden said he wanted to be a Rocket for life four years ago.
Bro that was not just fans lol. The team themselves were telling Ben to expect the trade:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/76ers-were-so-sure-of-james-harden-deal-that-ben-simmons-was-told-to-expect-a-trade-per-report/amp/
"Bro James Harden isn't even a top 5 scorer yet you casually say he's on KD's level?  Yes, that's how it works.  They literally are within 3 PPG of each other and we haven't included KD's twilight years yet.  Not to mention Bird played less minutes later in his career because of his back.  Also 3 point shooting is much more prevalent today and they shot about the same percentage from 3.  If Larry shot 3 more 3's a game like he probably would today he would make up for the 3 point difference off of that alone."
"What are you smoking? “Got his stars to buy in and play well” because they wouldn’t tryna win if it weren’t for him? LMAO. They are superstars who want to win. They’re not lazy bums. KD and Kyrie are killers and James is tryna win his first ever title. All the vets are looking for their first rings. Nash doesn’t need to do anything to motivate them. He needed to be a coach and run offense, make rotations and call TOs when needed like in g7. He didn’t do any of those. It’s not the result but how they arrived at the result. Had he done his job and not just winged it all season long by abusing Harden causing him to overstrain his hamstrings, abused KD in all playoffs and led to that awful shot, the Nets could’ve done BETTER."
Comparing Paul George and James Harden to rapists and child abusers. How's summer vacation from high school going?
"I don't think Doc's going to be fired because the 76ers already have their scapegoat in Ben Simmons. I also don't think Doc Rivers is all that great of a coach but I guess he doesn't actively blow up a team so there's that at least.  With Coach Bud, I think he almost got canned last year so the clock is clearly ticking, and I think that if Giannis has to miss the rest of the playoffs or looks like James Harden then he's  done. If the Bucks make it past the Hawks and then beat the (probably) Suns in the Finals, I don't think they're going to fire him. I also don't think they're going to fire him if the NBA Finals are a close series that Milwaukee winds up losing. I'm not super high on him as a coach but I guess he did finally move away from the ""I'm only playing Giannis 34 minutes a night even in the playoffs"" thing so there's that at least.  I feel like another thing to take into account with Coach Bud is that, as bad as some of his in-game personnel decisions seem sometimes, before he took over the Bucks, they had Giannis and Middleton and they were a .500 team. Sure, Giannis has matured but it goes to show that they could get a lot, lot worse, and I mean his predecessor - Jason Kidd - is not considered so horrible that he hasn't been able to find work himself. There's a real risk if you dump Budenholzer that you'll replace him with someone who's a lot worse."
Yes James Harden isn’t strong at all Lolol. So many tough guys on r/nba
Can’t wait to say that about James Harden
Marvin Bagley finds his niche as a role player on a good team.  Jalen Suggs makes an all-star team.  Kenny Smith takes a GM job and fails at it.  Knicks make the Eastern Conference finals  OKC doesn’t get much out of their picks.  A major PED scandal in another sport occurs and some NBA stars are implicated.  Chris Paul retires and becomes the lead analyst on ESPN.  The debate is still occurring on who will be the next LeBron.  Nuggets win a championship  A superstar not named Kawhi or Kylie retires before the age of 32.  Kings still haven’t made the playoffs  Orlando rebuilds into a solid team.  Draymond and Kerr both retire at the same time and join the TNT studio show.  Cam Payne makes the finals again on a different team.  Luka hasn’t made the finals  Heat don’t get past the 2nd round  James Harden starts having AD like continuous nagging injuries.  Grizzlies make a playoff run.  Two teams tie for the 10 seed and the clearly better team loses out on the tiebreaker.  LeBron embraces the gray beard.  A streaker runs onto the court in next years NBA finals and KD body slams him injuring him. ESPN debates whether KD was too violent.  Jason Kidd fails as Mavs coach and the Mavs then hire Bill Self and make him the highest paid coach.  Cavs trade the wrong half of Sexland who takes a leap on his new team.  Spurs are mired in mediocrity.  76ers trade Simmons and win a championship
"His team also loses games for that reason. Brooklyn was not as iso heavy during the year, and harden was probably the best for winning we’ve ever seen him.   In Houston, he had cp3. Don’t act like James has no power or say in the system. The way he played is how he wanted to."
You ain’t getting anything better for dame lol. Look at what the rockets just did. 3 FRP and kelly olynik for James fucking harden
"Isn’t a super team 3+ star players? Like the Nets, or when KD was on the Warriors.  Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden  Stephen Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant.  I’m not referring to the Clippers here, but some 2 star player teams do give the definition a run for its money though."
"""equally great scorers in their respective leagues""  I get your point but objective skill matters, not just relative skill.   James Harden Iso is the most efficient play in basketball. That's based on statistics against better players than Europe.  He would wreck Euro league even more. The reason they don't have anyone that plays like James Harden is because no one in Europe is as good as James Harden"
"This is a take from someone who clearly never watched a second of European basketball. Every league has their Harden. When your average player is Trevor Ariza, then James Harden has to be James Harden. When your average player is Landry Nnoko, then your James Harden can be Nando de Colo, if that makes sense. The difference is, de Colo has to defer to the team, and the team has to defer to Harden. Even though they are equally great scorers in their respective leagues. The only player in Europe atm, that can be considered extremely high usg% iso-star, is Shved."
"Let’s be real. The contract is with the NBA, not an individual team. The various franchises can ship contracts around to other franchises at will. When you sign a deal, you have a guaranteed contract with the league, not with a team.   See: Griffin, Blake; Harden, James; Westbrook, Russell; etc etc etc."
"This argument is so tried and unprovable. James Harden hit that fuck you three over a warriors double team back in 2018. He doesn’t get bailed out, he abuses the rules, just like Trae and Luka. It’s so silly to suggest that refs somehow give steph a hard time compared to other guards."
To be fair if kd is the one screening for harden James is not getting trapped as consistently as when it’s Wiggins or dray screening for Steph.  Kd is kind of wrong here.
That’s in part because they don’t have hero iso superstars like the NBA does. If you put James Harden in the euroleague he’s not going to be made to buy into a system and reduce his role.
why are you trying to make it seem like this dude pulled a James Harden and not show up play or whatever. Him giving a list to Denver management gave them more leverage in negotiations with teams as that gave them more confidence they aren't just getting a 1 year rental.
"Am I comparing the loss of defensive impact from starting Andre Iguodala to starting Kevon Looney to on the other side the Rockets going from Chris Paul at point guard to James Harden at point guard? Yeah, I think that's in the ballpark of fair.  The Rockets were -63 in that series. This idea that the Rockets ""solved"" the Warriors needs to die. They eeked out a couple of close wins after Iguodala went down because there was someone on the floor the Rockets could abuse hard enough on offense. It's really hard for bigs to be relevant for the right reasons facing a perimeter centric offense. Just ask Rudy Gobert.  The harsh truth of that series was it was the absolute closest that those Rockets could have played that Warriors team. You can simulate that series game 1 to game 7 20 times and the Rockets maybe win 1"
"He's probably the best playmaking SG after James Harden, playing next to CP3 will naturally deflate your numbers on that end. Mitchell does literally nothing better than Booker on a basketball court besides 3pt shooting, and he's still less efficient than Devin."
"I’m not saying I believe Dame will be a laker, I think out of all possibilities him being a Laker is by far the least possible  It’s up to Portland really but if Dame told the front office. I want to go home, and play for my hometown team and compete.  You have a guy who gave you loyalty his whole career and is asking at the age of 31 for a chance to compete on the team he grew up cheering for. I’d think there’s that possibility that Portland agrees out of respect for Dame, I’m not saying it’s likely. I don’t think it is, I think it’s highly unlikely I’m just saying it’s possible  Realistically I think there would be a conversation and coming to a mutual agreement on getting the best possible package for him, while allowing dame to go somewhere and compete for a championship. It’s why I think Philly is the place he gets traded to if he is traded  I like to look back at previous trades teams made, personally I don’t value draft picks all that high because i think there is a high chance that none of those players become franchise stars, compared to players in the league now that showed promise.  Houston took the risk on james harden who did show star potential but he became like a legit super star, you have guys like Oladipo, Sabonis, Middleton, SGA, Lowry, Randle, just to quickly name some players who became stars after the teams that drafted them traded them or they left in FA  How often do you get a Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic, or Butler. Guys not really picked all that high but become super stars? Most of the time not even high draft picks become stars."
"""Box and one - toronto vs the warriors thats all i gotta say"". lol they box-and-one'd James Harden the following season and he cooked us."
"I have never seen anyone guarded like James Harden was guarded last year. Coaches voted Harden as the most difficult to gameplan around. I think that speaks for itself. Once again, Steph stans proving to be some of the worst fans in the league."
"They are playing out their contracts. So did James Harden, Anthony Davis, and Kwahi Leonard. These guys are showing up for work. They’re just not playing through small injuries anymore and they’re making a scene off the court. But it’s not like they’re just walking off the job."
James Harden formally declared a trade. It’s different.
It’s not the point. He’s still James harden. He had two years on his deal. This was not a Anthony Davis situation where he used his leverage to force a trade with only one team. People on here just have zero clue how valued first rounders and pick swaps are because they are completely short sighted. Houston took bkn’s deal cause ben Simmons is overrated as fuck and seven years of another franchises firsts and right to swap firsts is very valuable. And that was when houston knew bkn would have kd harden and kyrie for the foreseeable future. Portland only will have dame plus whoever they can get and cj.
James Harden named Brooklyn. There is no super star announcing that they wanna go to Portland?
Yes that’s why the nets didn’t end up with James harden   Oh wait…
"I’m not siding with the owners here, and at the end of the day who cares since it’s not my money, but don’t you think there’s a moral grey area when a guy signs a long term deal and then demands a trade?  You’re essentially tricking a team, coach, and fan base so you can secure the bag. Then, rather than honor something you agreed to, you want to go to your desired destination without any repercussion. Even James harden still had a year left on a team that let him do whatever he wanted and got rid of Chris Paul for him while also mortgaging the future. Doesn’t he at least owe it to that franchise to play out the contract he agreed to.  I know teams are just as shrewd with this stuff. But let’s not act like players are doing this because the owners are evil. Players want to play for LA, NY, etc but can’t always sign there in free agency or won’t make the same amount of money right away. So they do this shit to have their cake and eat it too."
"70% James Harden? Why are you lying, Harden was nowhere near 70% lol, Joe Harris was literally terrible in the playoffs and had a 46TS% vs the Bucks, shooting 34% from three. Blake was good but still Giannis had Khris Middleton and All NBA defender Jrue Holiday, it was nowhere near 'just Giannis'"
"The one difference is James Harden doesn't make much of an effort to get open without the ball, so he's a at least not fighting through that type of d"
"KD had the NBA 3P% leader, a resurgent Blake Griffin and a 70% James Harden in the games that Kyrie missed.  Giannis had DiVincenzo out as well"
&gt;no other reliable scorer on the team  James Harden: First time?
"Yeah my gripe with this is that he didn't necessarily call out James Harden lol  I think there's more to be stated of Lillard, CJ, Steph, Trae, Luka, Booker, Jokic, Kemba (before the last knee injury and surgery etc), Lavine, Vucevic, Sabonis, Beal, Russell when he was with the Nets, Curry... I mean the list goes on, I'm sure.  Now, the real question is, how many of these players actually have the capability, stamina, and athleticism to put up 25 a game while playing elite defense? The numbers drops significantly.   It's not like Steph doesn't try to defend, or Kemba, some of these guys are genuinely just not strong enough or have the defensive awareness (intangibles come to mind) to keep up with some of these guys on defense. Whereas guys like Lavine? Vucevic? Booker?   These guys got no excuse. They have the athleticism (or the height; see Brook Lopez and how he went from a sub-par defender to one of the best rim protectors in the league)"
"&gt; sign 1+1 deals  You mean like LeBron James did when he went back to the Cavs?   They can also turn down the 5 year rookie extension if they don't want to be stuck with the franchise that drafted them for that long. Just like LeBron only took a 3 year rookie extension.   All these people scream ""player empowerment"" and honestly LeBron is a good example in a lot of ways. Except he never pulled this ""sign a max then beg for trade"" garbage like AD, PG13, Harden and now maybe Dame. When LeBron wants flexibility, he gets it up front and in writing."
Houston’s James Harden 23 seconds of dribbling and then decides to pass the ball!
This was exactly Harden in 2019 with all the injuries. Dude got doubled before crossing half court and carried Faried and James mf Ennis to the 4th seed
"Exactly, I wouldn't call elite offense players who are bad at defense endless like James Harden when he tries is actually a good defender he just had a huge offensive load. Back in the day KD would've been a nightmare on defense as he is today. But luckily players back in the day didn't have to deal with a player who can drop 50/40/90 while having the athleticism and handles of a 6'6 player"
Would players like James harden get a bonus if their team is sold mid contract to a cheap new owner who stops investing in winning?
LMAOOO PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE JAMES HARDEN HAS THE SAME OFF BALL MOVEMENT AND IS GETTING GRABBED PUSHED AND DOUBLED WITHOUT THE BALLL
James Harden averaged 25-5-10 on career average shooting splits while on Houston this season. That's easy All-star and borderline All-NBA if not All-NBA numbers. Houston's other max contract player certainly wasn't playing any better.
"Hindsight is always 20/20. Vert would also probably miss even more time down the road because they most likely find the cancerous thing even later. We got James Harden for non superstars, you cant act like that was a bad decision."
"what is more interesting is how much hate James Harden got when he ask for transfer with 1.5 years of contract left.  while dame, constant champion of live and die with one team, thinking the same with 2 years"
"Every great shooter has gravity and gets doubled, that's the point. James Harden while healthy was getting doubled at half court by teams when he played alongside guys like Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, yet Steph stans in this sub wants to act like that only happens with Steph.  There's also a reason why you blitz Steph and not KD, KD is 7 ft tall, he can get into positions where doubling him is either impossible OR he can just pass over the double team, it has nothing to do with their shooting abilities or their skills as players, it's just easier to blitz Steph because he is smaller.  Curry's gravity exists and he gets doubled, but so does Harden, Dame, KD and Embiid. Acting like Steph gets doubled more or that his gravity is somehow bigger than any of these guys is just dumb."
Was James Harden performing at an All-NBA level for Houston this year?
"At this point you're just embarrassing yourself.    &gt;Bro you being a weirdo, rather it’s the second or first scheduled game.   Don't hide behind some weak 'who cares', because you clearly cared enough to go and find a link to make a point about him playing in the first game.

Is James Harden not fulfilling his contract in Brooklyn?
I like James Harden and I'm upset he's on the Nets for the same reason as KD on the Nets - these superstars (top 10 players) are absolutey on another level compared to the rest of the league and it's SO FUN as a fan watching them ball out. When they team up we just don't get to see those performances.
"We couldn't have signed anyone else. Your whole point ignores the context surrounding his contract. We're in Milwaukee which means no one's coming to us. He's Giannis' guy. We don't really have cap flexibility even with him at 5 mil less. He's signed more recently than some great players who will absolutely make more than him. The max contract and salary cap sets an arbitrary limit on how much players make, so guys like LeBron will always be severely underpaid in comparison to their output and it'll make it seem as though they're valued the same as lower tier guys.   James harden is making $7mil more so I don't see why he's relevant to the conversation, were also never fucking getting him to stay here.  Klay is only making 2.5mil more but he hasn't played since 2019, so I'd absolutely prefer Middleton.   It's not about him doing great for himself, it's about him completely living up to his contract and this subreddit being clueless when it comes to evaluating player value.   Also saying him being cheaper would be better is ridiculous, you can say that about every player in the NBA."
"regardless of the validity of anyone's assumptions about KD's feelings or how successfully the Nets lineup worked together, i find this article very amusing: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/14/22231805/kevin-durant-karmic-wheel-nets-warriors-james-harden"
The jazz tried it for a whole series. Literally for a whole **playoff series** James harden was defended from his ass
"Gravity is the catch word, some folks on this sub swear that every shot a teammate of Steph hits, it's because of Steph's ""gravity"". They casually forget that Steph also plays with a guy that is at worst a Top 5 shooter ever and that his former teammate in Kevin Durant was also a 40% 3-PT shooter.  None of that was based in any evidence aswell, as Steph got more wide open shots in the regular season and playoffs than KD did during their run.  Steph is the greatest shooter ever, but people act like the difference between him and Klay Thompson is some gigantic shit, Klay legit beat Steph in a 3-PT contest before AND shoots almost the same percentage. Anyone that thinks that James Harden and Dame haven't been defended the same way Steph gets defended, is clueless."
"I would want out if I were him, but on the other hand, I probably wouldn't have been out here with all of this loyalty talk if I was gonna request a trade a year after signing a designated player extension that only begins in the coming season.   For all of Lillard's loyalty talk, it won't actually amount to more years with his initial team than the dudes who leave right after their RFA contract. If he is traded this offseason, he will have spent fewer seasons with the Blazers than KD with the Sonics/Thunder, or James Harden with the Rockets.   It is absolutely fair to clown on his previous loyalty talk."
"&gt; I thought i heard dumb stuff but ""Damian Lillard and James Harden don't get trapped on PnR's"" is the dumbest i've heard hands down  It's hilarious because D'Antoni literally said the reason they stopped bringing Clint up for PnR's so often before he got traded is because it was basically just bringing up the second guy and allowing them to trap James with that guy."
Well yeah... but hes calling olshey out because his teammates around him arent good enough. Its a lot like the james harden quote that wveryobe got pissed at just worded way nicer
James Harden states that he would’ve gladly scraped the existing contract and become a free agent when he was trying to break free from Tillman. It was the owner who didn’t want to tear up the deal. He wanted to force Harden to play for Houston while cutting other salaries because it would’ve helped Tillman balance his books.  Players have the right to work where they want. They have the ethical right to use the legal tools at their disposal to force a team to let them go where they want to work. That’s what’s happening here.
Yes exactly so clearly the warriors without Steph we’re not some 8 seed caliber team when they dominated the 8 seed that year who happened to have James harden as their best player. Any 8 seed with harden as your best player is a legit 8 seed. So I disagree completely with your point that the 2016 warriors without Steph were an 8 seed.
People are more ignorant about James Harden than any other NBA player.
[Which is why players shouldn't be making GM choices](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2922694-report-james-harden-threatened-trade-if-rockets-didnt-land-russell-westbrook)
There’s a reason he shot 76% TS in his first playoff series when teams finally couldn’t gear entire defenses to stop him  James Harden’s Houston playoff stats are identical to Kevin Durant in OKC. If Harden was the one to team up on a superteam in 2017 and won a couple rings then we would remember him a lot differently...
Wait is this a serious question? You don’t get why I say James harden vs the 73-9 warriors instead of Steph? Because houston had a trash supporting cast for harden while the warriors were in the midst of blowing up as one of the strongest dynasties we’ve seen recently. Lol dude Trevor ariza? You want me to mention Trevor ariza? At least make it bum ass Dwight Howard. He at least was a big name back then despite being washed and a dinosaur in the league.  You’re just looking for reasons to whine and act like I’m being unreasonable your points are so dumb. I’m not a Steph hater stop crying.
"lmao it was funny af seeing those randoms try and discredit how defenses play other players. I thought i heard dumb stuff but ""Damian Lillard and James Harden don't get trapped on PnR's"" is the dumbest i've heard hands down"
&gt; The warriors took out James harden in the first round in 2016 without Steph lmao.  Notice how you refer to the Rockets as James Harden and refer to the Warriors as the 73-9 team. It's the same formula every time with the Steph haters. Why not refer to the Rockets as the 41-41 Rockets who had Trevor Ariza as their second leading scorer?
"The Steph Curry - James Harden conversation absolutely PALES in comparison to that dude saying that no one ""hard-traps"" Damian Lillard. Like bruh tf? Man gets trapped on every PnR, sometimes at half-court lmfao."
Collin Sexton averages 0.1 less points than James Harden 😳
Fax AD nice but Ben had him as the 2nd best player in 2020 😭    Idc that his criteria are “help me win a championship” I’m still taking James Harden Giannis and Kawhi over him
It wasn’t just Steph. The warriors weren’t 73-9 just cause of Steph. The warriors took out James harden in the first round in 2016 without Steph lmao. Regardless of how bad klay is shooting no one is ever gonna be like yeah let’s just let klay shoot wide open 3s. Klay helped kd out a ton.
I will never forget Ben Taylor rating James Harden as the 7th best player in the league after the conclusion of the 18-19 season… after he averaged 36/7/8 in the regular season and 35/7/6 against the Warriors in the playoffs.
"It is a thing but every star has gravity, but Curry fanboys started using it and swearing by it  You think James Harden doesn't have gravity? KD? LeBron? They all do, some in different ways than others just because Curry moves off ball doesn't mean he is the only one with gravity"
Lmaoo he’s saying very similar things James Harden did before he got traded to the Nets.
"That’s photoshopped   https://beardlong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/James-Harden-Without-Beard-goatee-1-1.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:338x449/rscb11/ng:webp/ngcb11  Here’s a real one. Beard definitely helps, but it helps most men"
"All these players who force trades honor their contracts. None have been accused of being in breach of their deals. Even Kwahi who literally sat out years claiming to be injured as the Spurs docs said he was healthy. The Spurs never went to arbitration over breach.  James Harden fulfilled the obligations of his contract to the Rockets even as he was a COVID-laden Vegas strip clubs forcing a trade against the will of the owner. If any owner would be willing to go after his player for breach of contract, it would’ve been Tillman. But yet, Tillman never did because Harden played when healthy.  Players have an ethical and contractural right to be unhappy and attempt to force a trade by making a scene. Owners eventually realize that just because the cat was content to be put on a leash at first doesn’t mean it wants to be on a leash now and it certainly doesn’t mean the cat wants to go for a walk. You can try to take the cat for a walk, insisting that it remain on it’s leash, [but it doesn’t have to cooperate.](https://youtu.be/9C1leq--_wM)"
Chris Paul or James Harden probably.
"Replace ""Adolf Hitler"" with ""James Harden"" and people would be singing the same tune."
"After Olympics practice, KD pulled up his notes app with the bullet points from when he he shared them with James harden"
"James Harden had a Championship level team a lot of times, Damian has never."
"On a scale of 2020 James Harden to 2019 Kawhi Leonard, how gone is this mf?"
[lmaoo](https://beardstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/james-harden-no-beard-photos.jpg) i've never seen pictures of harden without the beard
"I hate our owner. I don’t know why you would get the indication that I don’t. To be honest I still like James Harden, because of the way Tillman ended things.  That doesn’t make it untrue that Kevin Durant was able to make millions just by taking meetings with silicon valley executives. The boardroom is all about that. There’s a reason why tickets to see the Warriors are still some of the most expensive even with Kay injured."
"&gt;Killed us in 2015 with Jason Terry guarding him.  Dismisses that he owns your team and quickly brushes past it while completely pushing the blame onto Jason Terry  &gt;2016 he didn’t even need to play we were the 8th seed they still beat us.  Ok sorry he got injured lol? They won the 2 games that he did play by nearly 30 points each. And Klay outplayed James Frauden this series btw 😹  &gt;2018 they got bailed out by CP3s injury, we were going to win other wise.  Biggest cope of them all. Wouldn't have been an issue if Harden didn't blow double digit leads in both games 6 and 7. And more importantly there is no way to definitively say the rockets would have won with a healthy CP3.  &gt;Steph was garbage in 2019 outside of one half of game 6.  Not accurate whatsoever."
This sounds a lot like James Harden but the big difference is Houston brought in multiple different super stars for Harden. Harden pushed them all away and caused the roster to be as bad as it was. Portland just hasn’t given Dame enough help.
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
"I love Steph, but why are these people literally arguing with Kevin motherfucking Durant about who gets double teamed more, James Harden or Steph? Insane shit."
Traded for James harden
"That is exactly the problem with Luka, the offense runs too much through him and he is not effective without the ball.  Similar to James Harden problems in Houston. You want your teammates to help but you are always keeping them out of rhythm."
"The story that I think best sums up who James Harden is: We're at the entrance of a strip club in Houston, about to go in and his teammates are worried about the media. Russell Westbrook asks what he'll do if the Houston media sees this and demands that he be traded. ""I'll demand a trade first"". Then he goes in the strip club."
"He's going FULL James Harden.  There is a hint of Kobe in this too though, he demanded a trade unless big changes were made and management wised up."
Got them both... and TRADED them both LOL. (All per James Harden)
"We thought that during the Harden trade rumors too but they were unwilling to deal a package of Simmons, Thybulle, and Maxey for James Fucking Harden lmfao  I don't buy the ""Tillman wouldn't trade with Morey"" rumor. We didn't trade Harden there because they didn't offer a suitable package. End of story."
&gt;“Why would James harden leave when recruited boogie and wall to Houston after playing pick ups in Miami”
You guys probably would be a game or two away from a ring right now if you had the same mentality about James Harden last season lol
James Harden said this about Houston.  #HeGone!
This is like the James harden quote all over again
sounds a lot like james harden lmao
Man James harden basically said “I need out” on his last interview in Houston lmao dame would be fine
“BKN has no assets there’s no way James harden gets traded to BKN”-99% of this sub for weeks before James harden gets traded to the nets  Reminiscent of when a player has a player option of like 30-40 mil and everyone here says they will obviously pick it up cause no one  will pay them that. You guys don’t ever learn.
"I’m sure there are, but what are those teams doing then? Yes, plenty lot of teams can beat a Simmons for dame swap, but those teams that can beat it will just end up like Portland since they don’t have the star power outside of dame to do well, or they end up like Houston after they traded James harden. But I’m pretty Houston would take Simmons over what they got from the nets for harden right now.   Dame  is 31 , if you trade for him , you’re in win now mode. And there are few  teams that have 30 million in contract players to to match  the caliber of Simmons, and  even less of those teams have picks to go back.  And the teams that have dead salary aren’t good enough to compete once they do get dame since their team right now doesn’t have players like CJ and Nurkic. The warriors have Wiggins, and picks the hawks have a sign and trade of John Collins, and picks and that’s pretty much it in terms of teams in win now mode that dame will push over the top, maybe the Pelicans if they want to move off Ingram. But teams like the magic, pistons, pacers, kings, twolves. You have to give up so much just to get him and they are so far away from the top that it doesn’t make sense. You’ll be trading to go from 10th to 5th or 6th."
"Injuries and the fact that their roster is going to be severely limited to MLE type guys with those three oft-injured stars taking up so much salary. When one of them goes down and you have to rely on guys like Mike James and Joe Harris to step up, you're playing with fire.  I would honestly be surprised if Brooklyn is ever able to win a championship with this team. They are a team of shot-makers, sure, and if they are all healthy and on fire, then they can scorch anyone. But there's only one ball, and the rest of the roster isn't stacked with guys who are willing to get the dirty work done.  Hot take: If they actually see significant time together, one of Kyrie/Harden will feel marginalized, and one of them will not be on the team after next season."
Dame just signed a contract extension. He needs to start pulling some James Harden type shit because the dude doesn't have much leverage.
It’s not nothing how do people keep saying this after seeing the clippers and nets supposedly have no assets and then end up with James harden and Paul George lol  Every team has the option to go all in for one year it’s just whether they choose to or not
"&gt; It's a worse version of the injured nets and there's no guarantee we'd get the same ring chasing depth.  Exactly the point I'm making. Dame+Tatum is Kyrie+KD lite. Dame is better than Kyrie, but not as much as KD is better than Tatum. And then instead of Rob Williams or whoever as your 3rd best player they've got fucking James Harden."
"Reminds me of another player, who’s playing third fiddle to Kevin Durant and James Harden"
james harden is signed for 2 more years with a player option. the rockets literally do not have to do anything t
People all except insane haul when the James harden trade was literally this season. Sure they gonna get more than the rockets but people should stop pretending like star trades we’re super good for the losing star franchises in the last years of the star really wanted out
"Do you want the Warriors to just coast off of the dynasty from a few years back? Curry, Klay, and Dray are all older. Klay hasn’t played in 2 years. Dray is washed offensively. None have played without KD as a trio since 2016. The west is stronger than a choke artist James Harden Rockets.   Curry can still go, it would be a waste of his talent to not compete. Warriors became a mainstream team after decades of mediocrity. Don’t rest on your laurels. Wiggins and Kelly Oubre aren’t gonna help anyone win a ring."
Kyrie Irving is playing shooting guard in Brooklyn. James Harden plays the point. Only Steph is in Harden’s league.
James Harden with Amare and Matrix w ok uld be better than Steve Nash
How can their offense be GOATed if James Harden hasn’t even read a single feminist text?
"&gt;Chris Paul is a pass first point guard, i dont understand your comparison  His success with Harden doesn't compare for you because CP3 passes, so I give you Kyrie and you say  &gt;Kyrie is more of shooting guard first and foremost. James Harden has shown us his facilitating ability.  Lmaoooo"
"Kyrie is more of shooting guard first and foremost. James Harden has shown us his facilitating ability.  As far as the warriors with KD goes, KD is an exemplary player whose game doesnt rely with the ball in hand. KD is also a 7 foot monster that can guard shooting guard,Small forward or power forward.   It’s hard to compare KD and Damian, because they both bring something different to the table. Is it possible? sure anything is possible. On paper it doesnt really make sense to me. I dont have a crystal ball so i cant exactly tell you the future"
Chris broussard Needs to stop the Steve nash slender first steve nash didn't play with Kevin Durant and james harden in there prime he never played with the talent that russ has amare is not Kevin Durant and shawn marion is not james harden. Second steve nash get criticism all the time about he should not have won the mvps he won! i like russ but without Durant or harden he has been getting bounce in the first round every year. nash one year without amare made it to the western conference finals i am not saying steve nash is better than russ because i think Russell Westbrook is better. But i am saying if he had Kevin Durant and james harden he would have a championship or two and at worse he would have made a couple of nba finals.
*James Harden has entered the chat*
"&gt; Prime James Harden and Westbrook playing together on the Rockets must have been a figment of my imagination  I specifically said that James Harden was a bench player when he played with Russ AND KD, but that might've been a figment of my imagination.  He only ever played with ONE of them in their primes over his career, never with both. The SSOL Suns were stacked rosters, but you are looking at one player as if he is what defines what a great roster is, the 2005 Suns as a TEAM were comparable to the best team Russ ever played with (2016 Thunder)."
Prime James Harden and Westbrook playing together on the Rockets must have been a figment of my imagination
They're signing dbook giannis luka kd james harden my sources tell me
"I love James Harden, going back to his Arizona State days, but mj legalization and it’s acceptance in the NBA was definitely a negative for him"
James harden with an almost 22 point triple double is a net negative? Harden had like 7 free throws in the first quarter. Dude was drawing fouls and getting assist. He wasn’t himself obviously but it’s not like he was out there like a total bum
"James Harden was a bench player when he played with Russ and KD, stop being disingenuous. Harden started a grand total of 7 games in his three years in OKC and while he did win sixth man of the year, he also averaged 12 ppg on 37/31/79 splits in that Finals against the Heat, he wasn't 10% of the James Harden we know now.  Amar'e Stoudemire also didn't make five All-NBA teams in seven years by accident, he was putting up 25 and 9 on 56% FG with ease. Stoudemire, Marion and Joe Johnson aren't Kevin Durant, but they offered Nash alot of help."
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
James Harden got traded to The Mets
"I really do not understand this new narrative about Booker manipulating refs to get calls. The dude shot 5.9 free throws per game last season, not even top 20 in the league. And despite being 8th in the league in usage, he was only 17th in fouls drawn per game, at 5.2. It's not like he's James Harden 2.0 out here living at the free throw line."
"Nash did have great teams, but what a weird comparison. Russ has played with KD (arguably the best player in the NBA) and one of the greatest ever. James Harden, a top scorer of all time, and only this past year he played with an all star in Bradley Beal and did a good job. Westbrook is a Hall of Famer and I appreciated the effort he made here in DC. Hats off to him, but Nash played with who? Stoudemire? Bell? In his prime? When he was with Dirk they played well and brought the Mavs out the cellar. I agree with the premise but not the comparison. Nash with Kobe in Phoenix would have been the equivalent of Westbrook and KD, and he never had that."
"Still, winning one and going to the last second of overtime in game 7 with injured James Harden being a net negative is insanely impressive"
"Some guys here said Melo had no place in the NBA no more  2019 people say LeBron was a liability in defense. Last year before the injury he was one of the best defenders in the league  Dwight Howard is a locker room cancer  KD is coming back at 60% of himself. May be 80% if he's extremely happy  James Harden is the worst superstar defender because he doesn't care (advanced stats shows he's a very good defender, even at the post)  Giannis can't win a ring because he's a liability in the playoffs against the walls because he can't shoot  Jaylen Brown doesn't deserve that contract.  Trae Young can't succeed yet in playoffs  Chris Paul's contract is a liability for an injury prone old, undersized player"
"I mean, Russ has played with some pretty unbelievable teammates, I could easily argue it is those teammates that helped drive winning/advancing over Russ. The one year he didn't the Thunder got trounced in the first round of the playoffs.  Every other year of his career he has had at least one of Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Paul George. This year with Beal, who you could argue is a tier below those guys, the Wiz also got thrashed."
"But now you're wasting LeBron James! Asking a guy who's still a top 5 player to play off ball (where he's at his least valuable on the floor these days) is like the Russ situation I laid out *but worse*.   LeBron is one of the few players who's better than Russ as a primary creator, and the best offensive efficiency for the team as a whole always will happen on plays where he's the primary ball handler, just like in Miami with Wade, just like in Cleveland with Kyrie.   Russ can be a primary ball handler/secondary scorer next to many superstars, but in order for that to work he has to be a better shot distributor than the other guy. He was a better distributor than KD, Beal, PG, and about even with Harden, but LeBron is a more skilled passer than he is, and a more threatening scorer off the bounce himself because of his ability to hit tough shots. Any possession Russ primarily dictates will feel like a win for the opposing defense when it means marginalizing LeBron."
"I dont think thats the notion that he cant win.     The notion is he cant win a title. Hes like Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, etc. He is one of these guys who is a great great player but he doesnt make his teammates around him better enough to help get him over the hump.    The issue with Russ more so than AI and Melo is that with Russ he will LITERALLY shoot you out of big games by taking bad shots and trying to be a 3 pt shooter. With AI and Melo it was more like these two can just score at will and they will do so but it isnt going to translate to a win.     James Harden is in the same boat as AI and Melo. Hes great. He can win you a series. But he will also shoot you completely out of games too. He could go 5-25 from three in a playoff game and you lose it cuz he plays hero ball.     Westbrook, Harden, AI, Melo, etc.     Wilt Chamberlain was kind of the same way. Great player but his best teams were when he decided he was going to be a distributor and not just score 50 points per game. All of a sudden Wilt let the NBA in assists and they were drastically better as a team overall. Which is part of what makes Bill Russell so great. He couldve done what Wilt did but he didnt because it was better for the team for him to play the way he played.     Hero ball usually doesnt end up in guys winning titles. In fact I cant think of any time in the last 30-40 years where its worked, if ever. Even the Jordan and Kobe teams all had a top tier coach with other all stars."
Yeah who needs Kevin Durant and James Harden when you have Shawn Marion and Joe Johnson
James Harden was 20-22 years old when he was on the Thunder with Russ. Comparing him to a prime Marion isn't actually horrible.   Amare was in his prime with Nash going for like 25 and 10.   I get neither of those guys stack up to KD but ppl gotta stop acting like Harden was MVP Prime Harden on the Thunder..
How is James Harden the disappointment in 2012 when he was the 6th man and only average 16ppg that season?? That’s a reach
Yeah and none of them are Kevin Durant or James harden lmao. You can’t just name good players and put them on the same level as a generational talent.
"He just named big names, James Harden at the time was a bench player and not the star he is today"
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
"James Harden has 2 rings right now if CP doesn't get injured vs Warriors and if he doesn't get injured this year.   Russ on the other hand loves to play hero ball at the end of games because it is always about him, he cares about stats more than winning.  How many times did he chuck up insanely stupid shots late game when he had the best scorer in the league on his team?"
"\&gt; he very clearly declined  On paper, he was 3rd in PER, the same spot he was in the previous year.   Using the eyetest, he perfectly transitioned to a more off-ball position (as well as a non-shooter could) and would still cook mofos off the dribble whenever LeBron went off the court.  \&gt;He was no the same player physically, he didn't move as fast.  A lot less chances to show off your speed off the dribble when your playing as an offball slasher and have LeBron as an outlet pass on fastbreaks. If there was a decline it was minimal because he was still lethal at the rim and on fast breaks.  \&gt;He could shut down anyone before  Key individuals he guarded for a significant portion of games in 2012 Playoffs:   J.R. Smith who shot 12ppg on 31%.  Paul George (before he was a star) who shot 10ppg on 37%.    Danny Granger (secondary defender on him) who shot 13ppg on 38%.  Ray Allen who shot 12ppg on 38%   James Harden 13ppg on 38%  Russel Westbrook (secondary defender) 27ppg on 43%   Outside of Westbrook who he wasn't even a primary defender on, the others all shot significantly worse from their regular season standard.  \&gt; he used to get a ton of blocks for a guard.  He tied his career high in blocks per game in less minutes per game."
"Nash has never had teammates as good as Russ’s. Russel Westbrook has Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Paul George. I love Amare but Prime Nash never had anywhere near those level of teammates. Put Kevin Durant on those sun teams and remove Amare they win a minimum of one championship if not more."
"He’s not a “loser” because obviously he’s fucking not one, but “hey he won one finals game with Kevin Durant and James Harden (not to mention a  prime Serge Ibaka) on his team” is not a winning argument in this debate. He’s played with larger list of near-prime superstars than just about anybody else in league history."
"Hard disagree, I present to you the player that will never win, James Harden. What makes James Harden a non-winning player? A play style that looks for fouls in big moments instead of taking the best shot possible. In the regular season his hunting for fouls is rewarded by going to the line and softening defense against him, but when the post season starts and refs allow harder play he doesn’t get the call and gives awful looking heaves. After not getting the call he gets frustrated and becomes whiny, plays down because he is upset, then looks for more fouls. People who have play styles that are reliant on drawing fouls are gonna have a rough season this year."
"&gt; I would rather have Thad straight up...  You're behind by about 2-3 years.  &gt;  LaVine became an efficient 27 point-per-game scorer last season on a game fueled by explosive at-rim baskets and deep 3s, yet he will now share a backcourt with DeRozan, whose midrange style is a relic of a bygone era of basketball. But DeRozan’s shot selection and playmaking also quietly evolved in his three seasons with the Spurs. Since 2018-19, DeRozan ranks third in isolation scoring efficiency among all 104 players to log at least 200 chances, according to Second Spectrum. Only Steph Curry and James Harden rank ahead of him. Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson are right behind him.  &gt; This statistic may come as a surprise, considering DeRozan’s reputation as an inefficient player. But even on the Spurs, a team without a lot of knockdown 3-point shooting on the roster, DeRozan was able to feast, getting to the basket or pulling up from midrange.  &gt; That uptick in scoring efficiency is a by-product of DeRozan’s playmaking development. He takes better shots and looks to pass far more frequently. He weaponizes the threat of his midrange jumper, snaking his way into the paint and using jabs or pump fakes to draw defenders out of position and open passing windows. He plays with a seasoning that he lacked earlier in his career, when he was making All-Star teams."
"I mean Giannis was the guy who couldn't score on a one legged James Harden 1 on 1 in the post and was down 1-2 before Kyrie went down. After that he faced significantly weak opposition then on. The suns were a team to beat them but i felt they underperformed with CP3 not showing up.   It's not like Giannis played any different to what he played before or showed something new. If KD's feet was half an inch behind, he'd still be the playoff choker who can't make free throws. Now he's apparently the best player in the NBA and the 3rd best PF of all time.   I like Giannis and his hustle and energy but he's not better than Bron, Steph, KD, Kawhi or even Harden and probably won't take a team without an elite guard to a championship in a relatively ""normal"" season."
"&gt; He's been to the NBA Finals,  With James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Prime Ibaka."
Westbrook has flaws but at least he isn’t a quitter like James harden
"Mills is much better than Mike James, Chris Chiozza, and TLC (their backup guards from this past season). His acquisition will allow Harden and Kyrie to rest a bit more. They do need to acquire a center though. DJ isn’t going to cut it, and Claxton isn’t ready to start yet."
And who almost ruin his career? James Harden.
Russell Westbrook deserving the 2017 MVP over James Harden.
"James Harden. Great talent who then pulls these bs moves like hooking under the defender's arm, jumping into people, flopping, etc."
"48 year old James Harden: 5/25 from the field, 30/30 FT"

"The following 3 to round out the top 5:  3. Kobe Bryant, 2005-06   4. James Harden, 2018-19   5. Michael Jordan, 1987-88"
This 2017 article refers to a newly-implemented [“Harden Rule”](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-the-nbas-newly-imposed-harden-rule-will-impact-james-harden-this-season/)
"Luka's playoffs were as impressive as any of those guys you just listed. And our rankings for right now don't care what you've accomplished in your career, but rather how good you are today.  Also, this isn't a slight on anyone in that top tier; they're all great. I just think Luka's top three. I'm not dead set on it; I could be convinced that he's actually below Steph, Lebron, and Jokic right now. I wouldn't put him below Harden, give that we last saw James as more out of shape and (more than) slightly injured."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."
"&gt; They could happily prove their point with videos like I've done but they haven't so  [Lebron James is Underrated as a Defender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYedgu-va3)  [How Great Was LeBron James on Defense?

But that's a bad way of supporting an argument since you can just as easily find a ""LeBron No Defense compilation"" just as easily.  Both of them are cherry picked, although the Thinking Basketball video actually has defensive stats to support his argument, so that would be the best example, if you really feel the need to use videos.  If you can find a video from the last 2 years of LeBron being a bad defender with stats to support it I'd love to watch it."
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"I'm the biggest die hard westbrook fan you will find.   No. He's a ball watcher. He's a relatively good onball defender when he wants to be, a la James Harden, but he is just about the worst off ball defender you can be. He's a ball watcher."
"They would have won a ring. James Harden, to me, has always been a better player than Westbrook and definitely has higher basketball IQ. It doesn’t get much worse than your point guard being a questionable decision maker. That supposed his number one job"

Daryl “James Harden Very Good” Morey is a fraud.
Advanced stats are far more useful to evaluate players tho  Few years ago people were still calling James Harden inefficient due to his FG% lmao
"if James Harden goes to Utah, the strippers are setting up base in Salt Lake city. location is no impediment"
"If he had to carry more of the offense he would probably have a few more all star selections and more than 2x 3rd team all nba. Manu was legit, great scorer and passer. If you want to make a comparison he's more a poor man's James Harden."
U got it all wrong. Heat culture is valuing true guys that embody the Miami cloth like Herro instead of getting chumps like James Harden
"lol don't get so amped up. I've never heard of any guy named Nunn or Melon thats for sure. And I doubt any of those aforementioned guys will be surefire pieces to LeBrons Avengers team, he will want to add a couple more shooters since he AD, and Westbrook are moreso midrange guys who can hit occasional 3s.    The Nets were up 2-0 on the Bucks without James Harden, before losing Kyrie Irving. And we all know it was an exciting 7 game series that came down to an inch, as in if KDs shoe would have been a fraction of an inch off the 3pt line the Bucks aren't champions.   Kyrie, Harden, KD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Westbrook, Bron, AD."
Raps stans think Siakam should get a James Harden haul lol
"**Nets:** Harden, Irving, Harris, Durant, Claxton with a bench of James/Carter, Mills/Thomas, Brown/Johnson, Griffin/Johnson, Jordan/Sharpe.  **Bucks:** Holiday, DiVincenzo, Middleton, Giannis, Lopez with a bench of Connaughton, Hood/Nwora, Ojeleye/Thanasis, Portis/Diakite.  **Sixers (likely to change):** Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Harris, Embiid with a bench of Milton, Maxey/Springer, Korkmaz, Reed/Scott, Drummond.  **Hawks:** Trae, Bogdan, Hunter, Collins, Capela with a bench of Wright/Cooper, Huerter, Reddish/Hill, Gallinari/Johnson, Okongwu/Dieng.  **Heat:** Lowry, Robinson, Butler, Tucker, Adebayo with a bench of Vincent, Herro, Strus/Okpala, Markieff, Dedmon. (need Oladipo back for some depth)  **Celtics:** Smart, Richardson, Brown, Tatum, Horford with a bench of Pritchard/Dunn, Langford, Nesmith, Williams, Williams.  **Knicks:** Rose, Fournier, Barrett, Randle, Robinson with a bench of Quickley, Grimes, Burks, Toppin, Noel.  **Hornets:** LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, Plumlee with a bench of Smith, Bouknight, McDaniels, Washington, Jones.  **Pacers:** Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis, Turner with a bench of McConnell/Sumner, Lamb/Duarte, Holiday, Craig/Brissett, Bitaadze/Jackson.  &amp;#x200B;  That's 9 other fairly competitive teams out East so top 5, while achievable, could be fairly tough given Chicago's real lack of depth outside of the guard spots if they get many injuries/Covid absences."
"That James harden trade kind of makes it seem like you can get anyone if you just trade every draft pick your franchise will ever own for the guy lol  If someone wanted to play with lillard all they would need to do is probably sign with the thunder or someone with 7 moveable 1sts and a few good rookie deal players.   The nba seems like it completely changes every offseason, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he finds a way onto a contender somehow, even tho it looks basically impossible rn"
2016-17 MVP Voting 1. Russell Westbrook 2. James Harden 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lebron James 5. Isaiah Thomas   Tied at 9th - Anthony Davis  2017-18 MVP Voting 1. James Harden 2. Lebron James 3. Anthony Davis 4. Damian Lillard 5. Russell Westbrook  So 3-4 years ago all were in top 5. MVP Russ year did not have AD in top 5 though.
"We were up in the third quarter of that game, but people conveniently leave that out.  The nets might have won, but that shit wasn’t a certainty.  Harden has been undoubtedly inconsistent his entire playoff career, but he would have been lebron James this season if he was healthy because??? Durant doesn’t score nearly as much if those other two are around and they do not play the same defense, which is the reason it went 7, if Kyrie and harden are on the court.  Also, remember Jeff green going 7 for 8 from 3 and scoring 28 points in game 5.  You aren’t getting they same performance from him if those two are playing.  No question one of them may approximate what he did, but the man was over 80% true shooting that game.  They don’t get that, they lose in 6!"
&gt;James Harden doesn’t even care about basketball  It kills me so much when an absolute nobody thinks they know a player.
"Kyrie always gets injured when playoffs start, James Harden doesn’t even seem to care about basketball. Dude looked over weight for the Nets"
Evwry big game against Golden state or the LATGEST CLOSEOUT GAME IF HIS LIFE james harden has underperformed. Find me some links disputing any of these claims.
I'm not disputing that at all obviously the greatest offensive weapon ever paired with a superstar top 15 offensive player ever in james harden and a star in kyrie would kill anyone even these badly constructed lakers but past experiences have taught us they all 3 probably won't be healthy.
"You litterally have a player in kyrie 8rving who has missed more good playoff series then he has been in, James harden who is a perennial underperformed in big games in the playoffs and you were surprised by the outcome kyrie was AGAIN hurt which killed your chances? Cmon man everyone saw it coming."
Can WOKE kyrie Irving stay healthy or Santa clause james harden? Probably not so this point sounds pretty dumb.
"I can't deny that they're favourites but when they got Harden this season a lot of people (including me) thought that shit was a wrap. But injuries, fatigue and any other unforeseen circumstances can come out of nowhere! I won't lie tho, Harden and KD being injured again seems unlikely and bringing Patty on instead of Mike James is an obvious upgrade."
"LA Lakers now have THREE superstar players (LeBron, AD, Russ). Over half the league doesn't even have 1 superstar player on their respective rosters!  &amp;#x200B;  Then let's look at Brooklyn. Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving. Another team with three friggin superstar players."
"Do you enjoy watching all the NBA superstars play together on a handful of desirable NBA markets? LeBron, AD &amp; Westbrook...superstar players...all on the same team...Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving...superstar players...all on the same team. You have well over half the league without even one superstar player on their roster! xD"
"If the Lakers win a ring it absolutely counts.  Let's look at reality: They've added a bunch of misfits who either haven't done much, flamed out elsewhere, or are nearing the end of their career. That's a far cry from being gifted James Harden because Mr. Shut up and Listen hates Daryl Morey."
"That's fine, Nets stagger Harden and Kyries minutes anyways.  Most of the ball movement happens with Harden and the 2nd unit.  Meanwhile assists rack up with the starters because Ky, KD, and regular season Joe are least are so efficient.  Patty can also handle the ball and has valuable big game experience.  Chiozza and TJ aren't playing in the playoffs, and Mike James was just throwing up wild shit going yolo after coming in from Russia."
James Harden slacking
Series averages:  Kevin Durant: 30/6/3 on 46/40/89 shooting(60% TS)  Stephen Curry: 25/7/6 on 47/36/86 shooting(58% TS)  James Harden: 29/6/6 on 42/24/89 shooting(54% TS)  Chris Paul: 20/7/4 on 41/37/75 shooting(52% TS)
Super team that needed 7 games to best stage fright James Harden and old man CP3. Absolutely amazing. Was this the year Draymond called KD a “B***h”?
"I don't necessarily disagree with it. He had a bad playoffs, it happens. I think recency bias has too much influence with the public perception. I don't necessarily think he's James Harden trade worthy, but i do think he's worth allstar level."
Idk how people can get mad at him it's not like he's laying down on top of people like James Harden or punching people in the nuts like Chris Paul  Also those passes man my god
"He also looked way worse on defense vs the Nets compared to the Bucks and Raptors. He didn't suddenly become worse as the stats imply, guarding Kyle Lowry or Brogdon/George Hill is different from guarding James Harden and Kevin Durant. Bobby Portis didn't suddenly become a better defender vs Atlanta and Phoenix, the matchup changed. Stats without context don't tell the whole story, the eye test without context doesn't tell the whole story either."
Same dude that signed Drummond thinks Ben Simmons is worth more than James Harden  Morey’s losing his marbles
Nets aren’t really old af.  James Harden: 31 - was an mvp candidate when healthy  Kevin Durant 32 - arguably best player in the league Kyrie - 29  All are 32 or younger and aren’t coming off a season where you question if they’re past their prime.  Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are the only 2 who really fit that bill and Jordan doesn’t play.
"With Kyrie, KD, and Harden on the floor defenses are gonna cheat off James Johnson 100% of the time, and he’ll still brick open 3s like he did for us in Dallas"
"Yeah, I agree. I dont blame GMs for being cheap. It's ownership.   The worst example I can think of was OKC trading away James Harden over a few million"
Funny how everybody mentiones how bad joe harris was but forget to mention james harden was shooting even worse in that series
No one who’s actually watched James Harden play thinks he should play off ball. It’s why Kyrie went to SG.   And Lebron isn’t as young as he was back then. His ball handling is what’s kept his game elite as he’s aged.
"I find it funny how LeBron playing off ball is a waste of his ball handling talent, but James Harden, who was probably the best handler for the last 5 or so years, should play more off ball. And you can't really claim ""oh, well there's an in between...."" because no one was asking LeBron to play like Klay Thompson in the first place."
"If the USA had LeBron, Anthony Davis, Steph Curry and James Harden then USA would win easily"
"James Harden having 2018 flashbacks right now, just made the bouncer turn the channel and bought another lap dance"
rockets has been asking him yearly until they got james harden?
"I feel like this actually demonstrates the point I was trying to make. He's leading the league in assists at 11.7 a game, a full assist over the next best ""passer"" in the NBA in James Harden. Yet, he's only 11th in Secondary Assists.  Now look at the number of passes, Westbrook is passing the ball 65 times a game. That's 15 more passes a game than Curry, Lillard, Morrant, and Jamal Murray. The ball is in his hands a lot, which explains his assist numbers. Why are his Secondary Assist numbers lower than those other point guards? If he's such a great facilitator, and he averages 20% more assists than other point guards, has the ball 20% more than anyone else, shouldn't his secondary assist numbers be at least on par with other point guards?  In summary, league ranking doesn't mean shit."
The anti James Harden
Klemen ''James Harden'' Prepelič
"He was in a fuck from the end of the Clippers series through the first half of that Rockets series, literally the worst stretch I've ever seen from him in the playoffs, but he righted the ship and got it done when it counted.   It's hilarious to call KD ""the reason they won"" when the Rockets couldn't close not just one but **two** games when KD wasn't playing. Rockets held a lead early in the 3rd when KD tore his calf. Curry went off, took the lead and Harden and CP3 couldn't get it done.   So much for ""if we only had Chris Paul.""   Curry put that shit *and* the James Harden era in Houston to bed."
"Yes, James Harden half assing it is still really good at basketball"
"&gt; Three of those 33 players -- James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook -- will likely never see free agency. Harden and Irving are on track to sign long-term contract extensions before the season starts."
James Harden a bum
"Let's compare another great passer from the same era as jokic so that we can maintain c.e to a better degree than a cross era comparison. Hell lets do it with apg considering you love the stat so much (I don't think it defines whose the better passer but lets use it as a heuristic for now to simplify the conversation).   James Harden has a 30.4% career usage rate, with a 6.5 apg. His MVP year he had a 35.9% usage rate while having 8.8 apg.  Jokic has a 25.5% career usage rate with a 6.0 apg.  This year he had a 29.5% usage rate while having 8.3 apg.  Lebron has a 31.5% career usage rate with a 7.4 apg.  His last mvp year he had a 30.1 usage on 7.3 apg.   Russell Westbrook has a 32.5% usage rate with a 8.5 apg.  His MVP season he had a 41.5% usage rate with 10.4 apg.   I'll never understand people who have a superiority complex and just assume others ignore data all because said person might not put weight on the same data points as they do."
"James Harden, last year…?"
"&gt; a bit of a shaky start in Philly, after also refusing to include Tyrese Maxey in James Harden trade discussions  Morey could've included Embiid himself , we would've still never traded with him because Fertitta is petty"
"Other than get gifted a James Harden Trade, what moves has Daryl Morey done that would place him as a top GM?  I personally think he is a bit over rated"
Kawhi and Butler def. Butler loves giving tough love. Bradley Beal?   James Harden can get away with stuff similar to MJ. Only thing is MJ didn't really bait fouls. Both of them are good at bumping defenders to create space and get calls.
You need not bring up James Harden teammates to discredit his playoff resume
James Harden accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago
"they call luka a larry bird type partly bc they're both classy (slight /s), but more importantly people who like luka don't wanna make the more accurate comparison to james harden because they don't like harden"
"&gt;The Sixers, league sources say, are trying to muster other assets (such as draft compensation) to offer Houston to keep Tyrese Maxey out of a potential James Harden trade, league sources say  [\- Marc Stein](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349453856569253889)  &gt;Tyrese Maxey, declared off limits by the Sixers in James Harden trade talks in January, is now getting crunch-time run in Game 6 in Atlanta as Philadelphia tries to save its season  [\- Marc Stein](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1406067378253828099)  &gt;the Sixers' final offer was ""Simmons, Thybulle, and draft picks.""  [\- Shams](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1349519348747145222)"
"yeah those 13 mpg from Maxey were just invaluable anyways, like what can James Harden even do?? be one of the greatest offensive players of all time?? Be the Player that most likely takes Philly to that next level and reach the Finals? Nah who needs that when you can get another playoff let down from Philly"
"&gt; after also refusing to include Tyrese Maxey in James Harden trade discussions  Wasn't that bullshit? The sad part is that even if it wasn't, a lot of Sixers fans didn't wanna trade Simmons and Maxey for Harden because ""defence"" and ""chemistry"" LOOL."
The Kawhi and James Harden trades were ridiculous scams
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
"According to a thread earlier today he isn’t even better than James Harden. I think he is the second best shooting guard of all time no debate. I personally have him at #2 after Jordan and I would draft him over Lebron so I know I have a heavy bias. He was my favorite player and was the player after Jordan and before Lebron. I’d also draft Curry over Lebron though, so my opinion is shit lol"
"&gt;Yeah, they collapsed, but they didn’t started camped way off their man. Defenses react differently to a kick out to Middleton or Holiday than one-legged James Harden and ancient Blake Griffin.  I... I tried reading this but man, I have no clue what you're saying."
I can’t believe KD went straight from Steph Klay Dray to Kyrie AND James fuckin Harden on his team
"Yeah, they collapsed, but they didn’t started camped way off their man. Defenses react differently to a kick out to Middleton or Holiday than one-legged James Harden and ancient Blake Griffin."
What a letdown. Now I’m really disappointed with James Harden.
"Yes, most players are very good at one (or more) things and try to do that (or those) thing(s) more often. Sometimes it’s a joy to watch - Steph Curry moving around without the ball, for example. Other times it’s incredibly painful, like James Harden making non-basketball moves to draw fouls."
James harden strippers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭🤣🤣 comedy gold
"This is the last time Jm saying this. Fucking a Christ. KD couldn’t shoot layups and dunks because the rest of his team were a bunch minimum, kind of okay Blake Griffin, and James Harden with one leg. Just take the fucking L.   Let’s say 2 Kevin Durants drop basically the same numbers, but one plays on that injury plagued Nets team and the other plays on the ‘17 Warriors. What performance is more impressive?"
"James Harden, Nikola Jokic, and a bunch of randos from r/nba to fill out the starting lineup and bench. Once per season they both would get so crazy hot at the same time they would overcome essentially playing 2 on 5."
"From the list, #9 and #10 in order:  &gt;James Harden - 63.51%   &gt;Chris Paul - 62.59%  Just crazy neither one of them has won a chip, even crazier after seeing this stat."
Booker is a better scorer than James Harden
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
"any HOF where someone like James Harden doesn't get in is way too exclusive. He's easily one of the 30-40 best players ever, with a definite case to go higher with longevity and a ring or two in BRK.  One stat in particular that jumps out, is that James Harden apparently has scored more points than any other player in the entire 2010s decade... despite spending the first 3 years of the decade coming off the bench for OKC, averaging 9 points and 12 points in his first two years."
Simmons is probably going to pull the James Harden option and force his way out. If Portland waits too long they're going to be fucked. The longer they wait the less they get back for Dame.
"I mean, I agree that the basketball hall of fame should be much more exclusive, but if James Harden can’t get in than there must be a problem lmao. Do you think Nash should be a hall of famer?"
Scottie pippen and James harden for starters
"Was the first image to pop up for ""James Harden fat,"" from [this article](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/james-harden-fat-picture-nba)"
It was stephs team and he wasn’t getting credit for superteam rings so he wanted to try and win on an underdog team with role players like James Harden and Kyrie Irving
"[James Harden](https://www.golfdigest.com/content/dam/images/golfdigest/fullset/2020/12/201216-james-harden.png)  He is fucking huge for a shooting guard, and I feel like tv and streams don't really do that size justice. You have to see these guys in person, they are huge."

"Tonight on espn, young socialite Ben Simmons faces off against gentleman’s club enthusiast James harden"
2016 and 2017 James Harden was something to behold. Too bad 2016 James Harden coincided with cheat code Curry.
"James Harden, James Khristian Middleton, James Worthy, James Johnson, James Bill Cartwright"
Found James Harden.
"Because fouls don't get called all the time, especially when it's a superstar. Especially when it's LeBron. For the same exact way that James Harden is going to get way more foul calls than Alex Caruso, the same tends to happen on defense.     This is not a unique situation nor something that I thought would have to be explained or wouldn't be understood by anyone who has watched the NBA for even just a couple of years.      If you genuinely don't see the fouls then I'd be glad to highlight them for you, but I honestly do not believe any basketball fan could watch that and not see that unless they are blinded by the player who is involved in the play."
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"Malone, West, Baylor, KD, Big O, Moses Malone, Giannis, Nowitzki, Doc, Robinson. Are all non debatable.   The you have Barkley, Wade, James Harden group which is where I think Curry belongs."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
*JAMES HARDEN INCOMING*
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934230-the-2-month-trade-request-how-james-harden-forced-his-way-out-of-houston  Yeah I'm sure they were in constant contact with the Nets in November because they were ignoring him lol
"Donte DiVincenzo  Kyrie Irving and/or James Harden  Yeah, super important. Completely changes the situation 🙄"
"James Harden is and always will be the NBA Paper GOAT. He already  has countless MVPs, NBA finals victories and is usually the best player on the best team on the face of the planet. He just has no physical rings. He is the ""IF"" GOAT"
tbf LeBron missed almost no significant time for the first 13 plus years of his career. Now James and KD are hitting that stage of their careers. Can't really compare a mid 20s early 30s Harden to a mid-late 30s Lebron in terms of health. Pretty dishonest and misleading imo.
James Harden in NBA Championships….    0-526
Still can't believe their stupid asses let James Harden walk for a couple million extra per season. They won zero championships with the Durant/Westbrook core and deservedly so.
Harden apparently has played more games than any other all star in the past decade with I think Lebron being #2. It's like Jordan who went out gambling at 4 am a night before a game and still dropped 30-40 points. James Harden is similar in that regard.
"I definitely was wrong about the 2-4 months since it was two months but the first game Houston played in was December 26th, that's rougly a month and a half.  The talks began on November 14th ( [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934230-the-2-month-trade-request-how-james-harden-forced-his-way-out-of-houston) ).  I personally find it unrealistic that it takes a month and a half for that trade to go through, especially when the players had mostly been decided in the trade (it was everyone but Dinwiddie)."
"Wow you are a Knicks fan, you hate your own team lol.   Uh yes KD mentally checked out, Draymond was already texting him that series and KD had as much fight in Game 7 as a wet tissue bag. Oh and without Westbrook, who btw made mean faces and broke a record nobody ever thought would be unbreakable, who dragged a sorry ass OKC team to the playoffs, and was good enough that the Rockets had to pay us in picks to get him, but hey you should know all about losing basketball. Westbrook is an absolute floor raiser, something Durant never was and never will be. Hell only way KD could ever win championships is by joining ridiculously stacked teams.   Plus for a guy who's being praised as one of the most transcendental scorers of all time, who insisted on an ISO heavy offense that Presti was confident to surround him with plus defenders and a playmaker in Westbrook, he sure does bitch a lot. Hell even with the Warriors KD killed their beautiful ball movement system and replaced it with iso heavy ball the very next season. His role is to be the offense. He wanted it that way.   That's on Brooks and if there's one major flaw of Presti, he's loyal to coaches to a fault. And it's hard to find quality players outside the lottery. People clown him on the James Harden trade not realising the context, like how the players opting for a 1 time cap explosion gave the warriors space to eventually sign KD, but that the ownership was not wealthy enough to eat a luxury tax bill as a team that was just tasting consistent success. It's fine now because our ownership group is a lot richer and Bennett has put his full trust into Presti.   We could play the game of what ifs too, like what if Phil Jackson never drafted Kristaps or what if Isiah Jackson was fired much earlier. We lost because Klay and Steph stepped up when it was needed, and KD didn't, plain and simple. I'd rather have Westbrook who will fight until the very last second rather than a crybaby who's already preparing to join the Warriors."
"you can speculate just as i can, just as james harden can. none of our arguments are any more valid than the next."
Yeah you absolutely could’ve predicted cp3 would be better than Russ after2019. Most of this sub predicted that. So no I don’t agree with your statements. Chris Paul and James harden is such a good pairing they could’ve won in the bubble too. They would’ve given the lakers a serious run for their money and I say that as a lebron fan
"Everyone made mistakes. Presti, front office, KD, Russ. Presti had no sense of urgency and kept rolling the same abysmal roster every year with the same trash coaches. Iso after iso no shooters, just 2 players taking turns. They shouldn't have taken the talents they drafted for granted. Starting from having JAMES HARDEN on your team and you trade him and keep Perkins???"
James Harden left out an “if”
That kid doing what James Harden couldn't... get around Kevon Looney on the perimeter.
his hips only work against james harden
*League MVP James Harden entered the chat*
"&gt; Yup I know but a better question is if an NBA player had the moves of these streetball players, would that NBA player be able to pull them off?  There's a video of [Professor teaching James Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjeUO5leLEU) one of his moves. I don't think Harden ever tried it in a game, but there's definitely NBA players that can pull off street ball moves.   ex. [Jason Williams with the no look elbow passes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHsd2OPIADo)   Also here's a compilation of [NBA Street Ball moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UKsPwpvpLk)."
"Draymond Green throwing his current coach under the bus for no reason. Meanwhile KD continues reach new levels of immaturity and unlikability.  These guys need to be more like overweight James Harden, posing maskless at the strip club. That was a pro PR move to leverage a trade."
"at no point did the great james harden, who controlled the offense, felt it was necessary to start attacking the basket.  its similar to a former president and his plan on war. It doesn't matter what new information presents itself, we will not deviate off this path. (even if it kills you)."
"Harden is known for being strong though, he is one of the best post defenders in the league.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-james-harden-is-one-of-the-nbas-best-defenders-statistically-but-should-we-trust-the-numbers/amp/  Old article, but Hardin is still one of the best post defenders.  Kobe 100% has a better work ethic, 100% has more stamina, agility, and explosiveness, but I don't see any evidence that Kobe was stronger than Harden."
Watching James harden flail as he shoots and not getting whistles is so beautiful to watch
"I mean it’s Kobe. At the risk of sounds like Skip... Kobe has the hardware to back up the claim that ‘when it matters’ he was at his best.   Who can get buckets at a 1% more efficient rate in the 40th game of the season? That ain’t Kobe time. That’s regular season.   Space Aliens invading the planet you are down by 1, team is drawing up a final play... who do you think they go to with the fate of the Universe literally hanging in the balance?   Iguodala isn’t available, you only got Harden or Kobe... you would never give James Harden the Final shot of a game over Kobe."
"Oh no, the geniuses at /r/nba downvoted me!!!  You literally just said that James Harden is an empty stats player. You’re a moron."
&gt; James Harden    &gt; Empty stats player    Total cringe. Don’t ever talk about basketball again LOL.
"We had one shot creator on our team in James Harden. The rest of the guys are spot-up shooters with little to no shot creation ability. What exactly do you want the Rockets to do at that point? Sure, we could try and run a Trevor Ariza high PnR or go to a Clint Capela post-up, but that's obviously not going to end well. Our team was specifically built to play one way, and that was through Chris Paul/James Harden isolations that led to baskets for those two or kick-outs for open 3s. If you have an issue with the roster construction not providing room to adapt, then that's fair, but you can't make a trade for another shot creator during the middle of a game 7. We didn't have the ability to revamp our offense on the fly so sticking to our guns was the best option we had at winning that game.  We also shot 44 3s which was in-line with our season and playoff averages. It's not like we chucked up 60+ threes and completely ignored attacking the basket. We ran our normal offense and just didn't hit the 3s we took. At the end of the day, we lost by 9. If we only have a horrific percentage from 3 (4/27) instead of a completely catastrophic percentage (0/27) then we win that game."
"Nice effort in this writeup, but 2000s had an entire generation of players with offensive bags like Kyrie Irving? Even if it were accurate, is that supposed to be a good thing? There's a reason 2000s offense was [the worst of any decade in the 3pt era](https://aminoapps.com/c/nba/page/item/year-by-year-league-average-ts/wKgr_EQQspIBPl0l71boaZNMVpbqLvabKb0), and Kyrie Irving is closer to the 25th best player in the NBA than, say, the 5th.  Also, Kobe was athletic but more in a body control and fast reflexes way. He wasn't especially explosive, strong, or even that fast. In no way was he  stronger than James ""I'm a better post than perimeter defender because nobody can move my thicc ass"" Harden."
James Harden is great and all but the only time i truly enjoy watching him is when he doesn’t get calls. Such a flopper. Thanks OP
"Your arbitrary ""muh 50+ win teams"" stats is meaningless. Nobody cares that the Rockets beat the 51-31 Jazz or that the Lakers beat the 50-32 Nuggets. That's to be expected of contending teams.   &gt; He's won 3 series against 50+ win opponents, but I'm supposed to believe he's better than Kobe who's won 25 series against 50+ win opponents  No, you're supposed to look at each player's performances and determine which is better instead of comparing players in vastly different contexts with ""muh wins.""   If you gave James Harden players like Shaquille O'Neal and Pau Gasol, he'd have won a few championships too lol. You neglected to mention how many of Kobe's wins against 50+ win opponents came next to a top ten player of all time and that the only time James Harden really had a transcendent second option was one year of Chris Paul (and we all know how injuries fucked that up)."
"If you look per-100 possessions stats to account for pace, it's:  \- James Harden: 48.2 points, 10.0 assists, 44/37/88 splits  \- Kobe Bryant: 45.6 points, 5.8 assists, 45/35/85 splits  That's not even accounting for the facts that Harden took over *twice* as many threes, shot a higher percentage on them, and that the vast majority were unassisted (only 16% of his threes were assisted that year). His percentage in 2018-19 was just regular good at face value, but when you really look at what his three point attempts were and how many he took, that season was one of the greatest ever."
I don't give a shit that he beat the 50-32 Nuggets and 51-31 Jazz all the time. How many actual serious contenders did he really beat? The Western Conference when James Harden played was insanely difficult lol. He regularly faced 55+ win teams in the second round. Fucking 55 win teams were getting eliminated in the *first* round some years. What the hell are you talking about?
Definitely James Harden in the regular season.
Pretty bad when this clip shows PJ was taking the best shots out of everyone when fucking James Harden was on this team
"These weren't called because a) it's the playoffs where refs let things go more, and b) Fuck James Harden. The guy is inarguably skilled, but he's bad for basketball, exploiting the rules for personal gain to the detriment of a watchable product. A foul is not intended to be a reward for the player being fouled, it's supposed to be a punishment for the one that caused the foul. But Harden has flipped the script, shooting into players when they have their arms out, taking shots into defenders when they are in the air, etc. Players notice and when they start copying him en masse (and they will), it will be impossible to play defense because the offensive player can make any sort of ""basketball move"" into the defender's zone and get two much higher PPP FTs. Then it becomes a game of ""create contact and get to the free throw line,"" which is *boring as fuck*.  The new foul rules are better, but fuck this shit. Example: 1:51 in the clip above. Harden (and Miller) expects this to be called a foul. Why? Harden initiates the contact. Klay's arm is there, and Harden takes the shot for the explicit purpose of hitting Klay's arm and creating a foul. Doesn't that mean, though, that *Harden* is the one causing the contact? Klay isn't moving his arm, Harden is the one moving, explicitly into Klay. It's ""supposed"" to be officiated as a foul on Klay, but in a perfect world where refs could identify intent, this would be an offensive foul. Shoot around the arm, not into it. But it's really hard to officiate intent, so Harden gets away with it.  Basketball is the hardest sport to officiate with soooo many gray areas that are able to be exploited because human refs and its rules about contact are imperfect. Other players do this, but Harden is the most egregious, and it's an embarrassment to the game.  So my response to ""how did the Rockets not get these calls?"" Fuck James Harden, that's the answer. Fuck him and his shitty beard and his goddamned rules exploits. It's not typically a just world, but it was this night."
Don’t think the Spurs can trade James Harden
James Harden is impressed
"Would you have preferred Mike James out there instead of Harden? Harden’s value as a decoy is surely more than the value James brought.  As for the Celtics series, I’m not sure what series you were watching if you thought Harden wasn’t the most critical part of the team’s offense. He was lapping the field in a number of advanced statistic categories coming out of the first round. Not just his own team but the entire league.  With respect to the regular season it’s of course subjective but I don’t recall Durant being seriously discussed as an MVP candidate the way Harden was around March. If you have a link to any publication that does show that, I’d be happy to be proven wrong.  It’s all kind of a silly argument anyway considering we’re talking about probably the two most insane offensive wrecking balls in the entire league. And on the same team no less. We should just be sitting back and enjoying the show."
Literally the only reason you got James Harden. Lmfao.   And Chris Paul. And sort of Russell Westbrook too.   Also the same reason you have years of the lottery coming up too.
"I dislike how she calls players kids, and how sometimes it seems like she's a mouthpiece for obvious PR stuff.   Like she went on about how she talked to James Harden about how he forced his way out of Houston, and how he felt bad about it and was embarrassed. Like, give me a break, he doesn't care, that move worked perfectly for him, you're just repeating some line Harden's PR person is feeding you."
Sorry I must have missed the part where I mentioned Dwayne Wade and James Harden. Where did you see that?
That's absolutely insane. Russ is not on a Dwayne Wade/James Harden level
Giannis and James Harden are coming there any minute now
"He'll need to if he wants to get any run this year. With KD, Harden, and Kai he'll be getting the Nets version of scared straight the moment he decides he's the next coming of Dion Waiters.   He did show some defensive instincts that I didn't see in his college tape. So that's encouraging. Now it's time to take that work ethic his mom passed onto him and dedicate it to improving as a defender and cultivating an all-around game offensively.  He has a scorers mentality like his idols Kobe and James which is good but he'll need to open up his court vision to become a more complete player like they did to a point."

How many chips does James harden have? It’s not Russ fault James was shooting 37% people bring up dame and how he’s one of the best playoff performers yet he hasn’t won anything what has James harden averaging 30 led to?
"PG: Lou Will, SG: James Harden SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Odom, C: Rodman  6 man JR Smith"
First of all he was injured that playoffs and he was rushed back because Houston was chocking against okc and in the regular season Russ averaged 29 8 and 8 against okc while shooting 59 percent from the field and James harden averaged 28 5 and 5 while shooting 32 percent from the field and he went 1-17 from three in one of those games but that’s Westbrook’s fault right ?
James Harden always.
"I was going to say....defense is all effort, this man hustled more than James harden does all season on a single play.   He looks hungry like he's trying to earn every dime. Can't wait to see how he turns out."
"&gt; I literally didn’t even know any of that about Mitchell.  Your memory is garbage then, because he did it against your team lol.  You forgot about Murray vs Mitchell already?  Its literally been a year.  &gt;What I’m saying is why?  Because he looks like a 22 year old James Harden.  Guards are already more popular than bigs just by default, having a young guard who is already that good just gives him even more star power."
"I'd say the former because of guy like Ben Wallace, Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green who all got rings unlike guy who just care about scoring like James Harden and Carmelo Anthony."
"&gt;	his value as an elite transition player with playmaking and strong isolation defense.  His transition points obviously don’t translate in playoffs because teams limit that type of play. And his playmaking isn’t helpful when opponents sag off of him.                &gt;	He also should improve over the next 4 seasons, given a standard development curve.   Ben hasn’t really improved much outside of defense in the past 4 years. Expecting a standard development curve out of him at this point is just setting yourself up for disappointment.               &gt;	He is significantly more valuable than Jrue Holiday.  Significantly? Probably not.           &gt;	He is less of a player than James Harden, but he is much younger and locked into a contract he cannot escape from.  Alright, imma head out."
JAMES HARDEN
"At this moment, James Harden knew he was going to the nets."
James Harden 👀
James Harden is the only player in NBA history who consistently receives this kind of attention on defense.  He's best player who has ever played basketball.
i really wish i was james harden
"Russell Westbrook: Patrick Beverley 'Running Around, Doing Nothing' on Defense. ... ""Pat Bev trick y'all, man, like he playing defense,"" Westbrook said of Beverley while noting Houston's James Harden dropped 47 on the Clippers in a 102-93 victory. ""He don't guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing."""
Lol. Harden fans whining about fouls and biased refereeing? Jesus Christ that’s rich. I’ve seen that video. I assume all you guys use it to salve the wound and sleep at night. How many James Harden gets a bullshit ref call after dribbling out the clock and going left vids have you guys made from that era? It was unwatchable. And that Karma probably killed you.   Odd how the dubs never got fouled in that game.   News flash: Lots of teams over the years feel the refereeing affected them - it’s part of the sport. Ask the Blazers fans about the wcf against Shaq and Kobe. Or Sacto fans. And those refs were cheating. Yet no videos and crediting themselves with a win they didn’t get. Only Rockets fans try and validate 0-27.  Imma go over here and stare at my replica ring.
If any Rockets fan hates James Harden then they’re ungrateful assholes.
Are we still pretending that defences in the 80s-90s were “so much better” and “tougher” than defences today or are we over that shit yet? Can you imagine what James Harden or Steph Curry could do if the options were either a 1v1 iso or a hard commit to a double team and a wide open player as a result?
"&gt; Extending KD highly ups the chance Kyrie and Harden stay  Makes no sense to grade on what might happen. Why don’t we go ahead and give the Sixers an A+ since Simmons wanting out ups the chances the Sixers try to trade him for Dame? This team just does not have the additions to get the best offseason award. They only got a third of their big 3 extended chances or not and they lost Jeff Green. Even the Lakers got guys like Bazemore, Nunn and Monk to take discounts. Heck even the Warriors got two guys who had MLE offers for the minimum. Mills was getting that deal no matter where he went. Millsap was a late signing, James Johnson isn’t a huge addition, LMA shouldn’t even count as an addition imo. Did bring back Brown for cheap so that’s an extra point, but they lost Jeff Green. That’s not a top 3 offseason."
"I'd take the Nets. KD is an incredible volume scorer, but like, oh no, now your first option is James Harden. Disaster.  Net's biggest weakness is the lack of good big men, and the offensive and defensive upgrade for them would be huge - especially since just about every other contending team has a big man scorer. Meanwhile the Lakers are trading away their best defender for yet another volume scorer. Talent wins, but I'd take talent + fit over plain talent."
KD and LeBron are two of the best game 7 performers e v e r and the Nets' best player is James Harden who shoots like 41% from the field and 30% from 3 in elimination games  It's no contest imo if we're assuming LeBron is back to pre-injury form
Of course it’s unprofessional. Was James Harden professional when he left Houston? AD in New Orleans? Kawhi in San Antonio? Is being unprofessional illegal? What’s your point? He doesn’t want to be there…
"I think that Don Nelson was just REALLY high on Billy Owens and wanted a power forward (which is odd, because Owens ended up playing SF most of his career).   Owens was a solid player. No doubt.  But when you have an All-NBA calibre player, you don't dump him for the 3rd overall pick.   Can you imagine the Warriors trading Klay Thompson at the age of 25 for a Dragan Bender, Krish Dunn, Brandon Ingram, or Jaylon Brown?  It's a little different, sure, but still...   I don't think it was a cap issue.   Certainly, in 10-15 years, kids will look back on the James Harden trade and, being unaware of the cap situation, will think ""That was stupid."" A one-year rental on Kevin Martin and Steve Adams for James Harden?  And that was a BAD trade, even given that it was done for cap reasons (though Kevin Martin was expected to play better)."
Ya there’s no doubt that nobody flops and flails into people quite like James Harden. Truly a unique scorer.
"And you think shitty stats isn’t gonna affect his future signings? James Harden is a different story because 1. He gave Houston 8 years of blood, sweat, and tears. 2. Simmons wasn’t playing up to his contract when he was trying his best. They signed him based on the assumption he was gonna improve. 3. And it’s James Harden. What team isn’t gonna give him the max?"
"It's just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan. You give James Harden the ball, and before you're giving up the ball how many points do you generate, which is how you should measure offense, James Harden is by far No. 1 in NBA history."
"Maxey, Thybulle, picks and whatever they get for Simmons could land them any star ends up on the trade block. Imagine if a star like James Harden became available, 76ers would be the frontrunners for sure."
Update: James Harden is an elite scorer
"Giannis Overrated  Since one of yo giannis fanboys want to delete my post I’m gonna repost it.  Giannis has no skill whatsoever  - He can’t dribble   - He can’t Shoot  - He has no IQ (decides to take a fadeaway on JAMES HARDEN)  -Overrated defense he’s regarded as an all nba 1st team defender yet was scared to guard kd and he has no permitter defense average at best he only has decent post defense   -He’s not clutch every time the game is on the line guess who gets the ball not Giannis MIDDLETON because giannis is not to trust in the clutch  Now let me get on with this overrated ring he got.  -the whole western conference was injured they played the worst team   -would of lost to the nets   -claims he doesn’t have a super team(great team) yet bucks beat hawks without him   - kd by himself took them to 7 games   - choked last year, only reason there doing so good this year is because injuries and the addition of jrue holiday was major to there success   - jrue holiday and Middleton don’t get enough credit the media acts as if giannis carried them, if giannis is not showing up Middleton drops 30 and they jrue holiday to lock up the other team guard like he did with booker  - all the times dropped over 35 he averages 17 free throw attempts   - he was dropping big numbers on one of the worst defensive team in the suns which is why against the heat he only averaged 24 against the heat  -he averages over than half the amount of the suns highest ft player with 85 attempts   -the idea over the casuals is that the bucks team wasn’t good and Giannis carried them they have jrue holiday, Middleton, brook lopez who saved them with the block on kd, and they got Bobby portis nowhere near a bad team actually a great team  -lost 2 games to a overrated suns team   - both his mvp he got were undeserved harden should of got it then Lebron   -Giannis also averaging the most free throw attempts in a series since Dwade in the 2006 FINALS.    Stop being bias and look at the facts when you put it into context you see how unimpressive it looks."
He’s 4-5 rn bc he isn’t at his defense peak anymore 2015-17 Draymond is one of the most impactful defenders ever and if the league has shifted towards offense wouldn’t that make his defensive prowess more impressive to having guard against modern day shooters/spacing/schemes/rules with versatility that maybe only 2-3 guys ever can match. And what about interior play being de-emphasized? i could flip it and ask you how do you think Mutumbo would defend against a 5 out offense or a James Harden PnR (which Draymond practically erased)?
People who aren't fans of James harden don't understand basketball
And you guys passed on trading Bubble Boy for James Harden. That’s tough.
*james harden has entered the chat*
is durant even better than his teammate james harden?
I wasn't around to see 2009 LeBron or rookie Durant and Westbrook but this doesn't seem as insane as it sounds if you're trading for literally the best player in the league.   Of course with what we know nowadays trading KD *and* Westbrook might have been too much.   But that also means you pair LeBron with a Rookie James Harden just saying.
"They could have extended harden regardless. Okc traded him before the extension would have kicked in because they were afraid that the market for jh would have been lesser since they would have had luxury implications upon them.   Their logic was obviously flawed since they had the amnesty clause, as you stated, *and* more importantly james fucking harden on a surplus value contract.   Terrible decision making incited by 2 draft picks."
"While this take seems overly harsh, Luca is definitely overrated. He's got horrible off-ball movement and defense, he's a lot like James Harden in that respect."
"I think this one will be overrated just because of the names you can bring up that he beat..   Beats LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy in the first round   Beats Defending champions Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol in the second round   Beats Durant Westbrook and JAMES HARDEN (who wasnt really james harden yet but that will get lost in time) in the WCF   Then does step up and beats Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the finals..     Thats 8 HOF Locks and two Solid names on portland."
Win in court? This can be how the contract is designed.  Getting a super max should be a hallmark of a franchise player. Obviously player like James harden and Ben Simmons don't think they are a part of the franchise
"No.   Please don’t mistake OKC wasting 50M on Serge Ibaka’s extension instead of paying James Harden, as not the primary reason."
*James Harden has entered the room....*
2009 NBA DRAFT ORDER  Clippers. Blake Griffin. PF.  Grizzlies. Hasheem Thabeet. C.  Thunder. James Harden. SG.  Kings. Tyreke Evans. PG.  TIMBERWOLVES. Ricky Rubio. PG.  TIMBERWOLVES. Jonny Flynn. PG.  Warriors. Stephen Curry. PG.  Knicks. Jordan Hill. PF.
"MVP: James Harden, Nets will steamroll the NBA and Harden's stats will look better than KD's  DPOY: Joel Embiid, with Simmons gone and the Sixers will still have a great defense, but with one less person to split the votes  MIP: OG Anunoby, idk, i saw someone else say him and it sounded good  ROY: Cade Cunningham, i think there will be a lot of candidates, but there's like only one other offensive option on the Pistons  6MOY: Dennis Schroder, dude will be on a mission to get paid and the C's will rely on him A LOT. I think he will be incredibly productive coming off the bench with Horford in the PnR/PnP"
"I mean Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are Nets. How do you think I feel?"
"James Harden. When I first got into the NBA I was susceptible to just believing any bs I heard about players. More specifically I was shown multiple videos where he was  slacking on defense. This made me almost instantly lose my respect for him, but this was in early january 2019, where he had his historic 30-pt-games run, which I was quick to make note of.  And then the GSW v HOU match happened, I was watching it live and I got goosebumps when Harden drained the game winning shot with 1 second remaining and 2 GREAT DEFENDERS ON HIM. I was awestruck, diehard Rockets fan ever since!"
I just look forward to anyone with a shaggy thick beard being listed as the next James Harden
Ask James Harden.
James Edward Harden is good at the game of shootyhoops tho.   Benjamin is a fucking stooge.
"Does this affect your perspective on Tim Duncan’s legacy? Having a James Harden (lite?) level player and one of the GOAT coaches for the entirety of his career? I think I’m asking this of anyone who comes into this thread. Usually during Duncan discussions, having Ginobili, Parker and Pop for a stable career gets downplayed a ton. Not many players have the same stable AND great foundation for a large portion of their careers. From what I’ve read here, Duncan pretty much carried the Spurs for two decades."
&gt;elite shooting   &gt;James Harden in the playoffs  Pick one and only one
It worked last year for James Harden 🤷🏼
He would be similar to a James Harden type of player.

Literally James Harden in the 2021 playoffs lmao
James Harden
"yes james harden is definitely a bad person because of how he plays basketball, this is flawless logic"
"Rudy Gobert is a three time DPOY which puts him at the ranks of Mutombo, Wallace, and Dwight Howard.  He broke multiple records for defensive impact this season alone.  The Atlantic even mentioned he should have been the unanimous DPOY this year.  [He has the best defensive raptor and prevented the most points per 100 possessions in history](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/).  He never even got exposed by James Harden in the playoffs the Jazz's perimeter defenders forcing him to respond to James Harden's layups/tear drops.  Even then he still had the most defensive impact in that series too.  You're referring to the same issues that were exposed during the clippers game.  [This reddit thread explains it well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o3mtbo/blaming_gobert_for_not_having_the_ability_to_be/)  All the people you listed were amazing big mans however you do not need to discredit  Gobert as well.  You act like the 3/4 big men given above weren't all in defensive player of the year contention in the past 3 years."
"&gt;Do you not see the slippery slope you’re on? It’s an utterly untestable, unprovable declaration. It’s no less absurd than me saying Bill Russell would’ve developed a Steph-level 3 point shot.   This is nonsense. I'm not declaring Jordan would be the greatest 3 point shooter in the league. It's not unreasonable to think Jordan could develop a league average 3 point shot, being *great* is maybe a stretch. But we're watching James Harden basically play 80% of Jordan's game, it's not some kind of insane take that Jordan could be playing like James Harden. You're bordering on strawman here."
"Mine is James Harden. There’s two types of players I despise watching; volume shooters &amp; iso-ball players/hero-ball. So in my head he essentially epitomised this. Then I finally got round to seeing how amazing of a playmaker he is and how much his team is reliant on his talent to succeed and fell in love with his game. The greatest quality a player can have is to be an offensive threat through elite playmaking + elite shooting imo. You can singlehandedly lead the whole offence. There’s about 5/6 players in NBA who can do this (LBJ, CP3, Doncic, Jokic, Harden). Also, small side note and I know it sounds obvious now given that is his coach but just the other day I realised while watching SSOL Suns game on youtube that Harden wear 13 because of Nash and how similar they are in play style.   TL;DR: Thought Harden was a poor mans AI, turned out to be a better version of Nash."
"On any given play a player could be anyone of the three,also this pretty much only happens during half court situations,because positions definitely don’t matter during transition.  If Jokic sets up in the high post,he’s a post player at that point in time,if he gets a rebound and brings it down the court,he’s a ball handler(I’ll add that ball handler isn’t a great term,because if the reasons you pointed out,a better term would be initiator). If Jokic for some reason spots up in the corner,like if a transition opportunity breaks down and if he finds himself open in the corner,he would be a wing. Also most of the time Jokic operates in the post,whether that’s the high post or out of a screen and move set.  Other examples of players that fit into all three are KD,LeBron,Kobe,and a lot of others.  Many of the all time greats can do all of them,because that’s what makes them all time greats.  Also an easy way of finding out what they would be referred to as(like if it were to replace the 1-5 classifications) in my weird way of positions:  Point Guard:99% of the time would be a ball handler/initiator  Shooting Guard:either a ball handler or a wing. James Harden and CJ McCollum are ball handlers,Klay Thompson is a wing  Small Forward:Could feasibly be all of them,like KD and LeBron  Power forward:Wing or post,Marcus Morris is a wing,Anthony Davis is a post player  Center:99% of the time would be classified as a post player"
And people say James Harden can’t play defense
Jordan was built for the era he played in. Bird was built for the era he played in. I think it's fair to say any all-time great could have adjusted their game and been successful but I just don't buy the idea that they would be as successful or more successful playing essentially a different game altogether.   Jordan was a career 33% 3 point shooter on super low volume. In the modern game there is just no way he could receive the touches he would need to go for 40/night. Maybe on a garbage team with zero other options but on a real competitor no way.   Michael had a TS% of 56% and a PER of ~30 his 37 ppg season. James Harden had a TS% of 61% and a PER of ~30 his 36 ppg season.   I just don't see how Jordan could ever get that kind of volume and efficiency without a reliable 3 pointer.
James Harden
"This is the era of superstars playing for 3 different teams, Leonard, Durant, Harden, Westbrook and James all played for at least 3 teams, I don't think another era can compare to that"
"I'm just not gonna like.. go through the list of superstars that were out these playoffs with injury (and who was eliminated as a result of that) and then be like ""oh yeah but Donte"" after looking at Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Trae Young, etc. Just a dishonest comparison. The reason the dude says ""a starter"" instead of Donte is because everyone knows where Donte is and saying ""a starter"" sounds more important."
"James Harden, i think i just hated him a lot  in the rockets his first years but those battles against the warriors made me come around."
"First and foremost, boiling a player's entire physical profile down to height is extremely reductive. You're like the 4th person to do that in this discussion and I'm really annoyed because it's obviously wrong. Luka isn't *just* taller than most PGs, he's *way* stronger than them too, as well as generally not as quick as even an average PG. In terms of physical profile, he really doesn't fit the PG mold in any way shape or form.  As for why I think physical profile should be the most important indicator going forward, you do realize Steve Kerr was a PG 3 decades ago...right? Tony Allen and James Harden played the same position at the same time. Position has **literally never** been a reliable indicator of offensive role at any point in the NBA's history, insinuating otherwise is just wrong."
"James Harden, obviously an unpopular opinion here on ole r/nba"
"James Harden for sure. He just became underrated imo, that I couldn't hate the guy anymore. I do believe he began flopping less and playing better defense, and I just started to appreciate his game. Helps a lot that he's out of the division now. If the Nets win, I hope Harden is the one who gets FMVP."
100% James Harden. I still don’t like his reliance on fouls but my god can he direct an offense.
james harden?
"lonzo, i hated his ugly ass hair and rat face when he was on the lakers but now he doesnt have that haircut anymore so i dont hate him as much.  here are some players i currently hate:  kelly oubre  kyle kuzma  pj tucker   tyler herro  jalen green    here are some i dislike:  devin booker  anthony davis   shai although i dont want to   danny green  james harden   frank jackson   mpj  kristaps   ben simmons"
" And there is more to athleticism than jumping high. Harden for example is one of the best at deceleration.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-hardens-secret-talent-is-slowing-down-1486667420#:~:text=Harden%20has%20a%20hidden%20advantage%3A%20deceleration.%20His%20braking,stop%2C%20you%20start%20to%20understand%20his%20entire%20game."
"That's why you can't cherry pick and have to look at all match ups.  Look at another example, when both teams play the Clippers, Patrick Beverly will guard Lillard a lot of the time, but he doesn't guard Luka because Luka is clearly in a different physical category and is a much harder match up for Beverly, not because of skill set or skill level (most people would call Luka and Lillard comparable players in terms of skill set and skill level), but purely because of physical profile.  Similarly, Kawhi is much more likely to guard Luka than Lillard. Lillard's physical profile is smaller and quicker than Luka's which (post injury) can be harder for Kawhi even though he is still one of the best on ball defenders in the league.  Once you take all these individual match ups, you can use positions as a **general** description of someone's physical profile and, by extension, a general description of who they match up best defensively. You *can't* use position as a general description of offensive role, James Harden and Tony Allen played the same position, that's an extreme example but it's not a cherry pick because there's hundreds of similar examples."
"I used to hateeee James Harden, but when he dropped Wes Johnson and stared at him for like 5 seconds I immediately was like okay this mf is RAW"
"I'm not idealising, I'm generalizing. That should have been obvious when I said:  &gt;If the traditional ""PG/SG/SF/PF/C"" position model is going to be useful at all, it has to be a short hand for defensive lineups and match ups.  One thing we can all hopefully agree with is that positions are always going to be pretty fluid. Unlike other sports that have rules limiting what you can do based on listed position or starting placement, basketball has always been a game that allows any combination of 5 players, with each player having the potential to do any legal action. Therefore, *any* definition we give for a position will inevitably have exceptions as teams find a way to gain an advantage by breaking convention.  This is why I said this:  &gt;not just who you guard, but who guards you best as well  You can't look at either to determine position, you need both. Lillard isn't a forward because he lacks the size to guard forwards. Bridges has the size and speed to guard point guards, but he's defended primarily by wings. This is the *only* system that actually communicates *any* useful information by giving a general idea of which physical profile a player falls in while still mostly matching how people use the terms. I've already demonstrated how completely useless offensive roles are for determining position with the Lillard/Harden/Lebron example, your system only gets worse the more you consider other roles and positions. James Harden and Tony Allen played the same position, enough said."
"If you’re saying that James Harden took 3 less shots to score one less point, then I don’t see why Jordan wouldn’t be able to score 40 shooting more 3s.  You vastly underestimate how talented of a scorer he was (this guys is one of the best to ever do it, if not the best!) and it’s likely that he would be a better three point shooter in this era."
"James Harden. I hated him because of his foul baiting, and beef with Giannis but come on, I gotta give him the respect he deserved last season. He got 2 player of the months and was on track to compete as the season MVP. Unfortunately, injury spoiled it."
"Lol if James Harden couldn’t do it shooting like 13 threes per game and shooting 11 free throws a game in one of the most heliocentric offences we’ve ever seen, nobody could do it."
James Harden because I haven't had to watch him play in like 3 months.
"Well the difference between Harden and Jordan is that Jordan had the help necessary to not have to score that many points to win games. Our record was atrocious in 19-20 when Harden didn’t score 30+ points. When I was bringing up Harden’s ridiculous scoring average for that stretch of the season, I was doing it to show that it was possible for some players to average 40 if they tried. In the years Harden played for a team that at least made the conference finals, he averaged 12.2, 16.8, 27.4, and 30.4 points a game. When Harden has at least some talent around him, he isn’t anywhere near as aggressive as he was his last two full years with us. As you can see on the Nets, Harden literally didn’t care about scoring that much.   At the end of the day, Jordan was the same way. Scoring a boatload of points wasn’t something he liked doing unless it was necessary to win. In the modern NBA, you don’t play for a championship level team if you average 40 a game. When I said “Jordan likes winning championships” all I was saying is that Jordan wouldn’t try to average 40 because that wouldn’t give him the best chance to win a title.   I’m still not seeing where in my comment I actually said “James Harden cares more about his individual scoring than winning.” You’re grasping at air and trying to make a big deal out of nothing."
"Don’t blame the Bad Boy Pistons, blame the refs and the league. They’re the ones who decided that the NBA would be a physical game back in the 80’s and 90’s, Detroit was just trying to win.  And I’d say the same thing to people who bitch about James Harden and Trae Young constantly flopping: don’t blame them, blame the refs and the league for allowing it. Those dudes are just trying to win basketball games."
"He took by far the most shots per game in his era, it wasn’t even close. James did it shooting 25 shots a game and 13 3pt shots a game. James is a much better 3 point shooter on higher volume than Jordan. It took Jordan 28 shots for 37 whereas it took harden 25 shots for 36.   Jordan could do it if he shot 28 shots a game in this era, but he’s not going to get that many shots up in this era’s pace."
James Harden?
"We’re talking about a guy who had multiple scoring titles in the regular season and playoffs in an era where there was less threes taken and less free throws awarded.  James Harden averaged 36 ppg just a few years ago, why couldn’t Jordan do that?"
That game against the Hawks where Harden scored sixty and sat the entire fourth.   https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/rockets/2019/11/30/james-harden-60-points-three-quarters-rockets-crush-hawks/4344331002/
The anti-James Harden
You put words in my mouth. Where in my comment did I say that James Harden only cares about stats? James Harden having to score as many points as he did for us was a sign that our roster wasn’t good enough to win.
"Yeah, because all James Harden clearly cared about was his stats. That’s why he told Steph Curry he hated playing hero ball and wanted to play beautiful basketball with more ball movement, and that’s why he forced a trade from a team because he could see that he wasn’t going to be able to win there with the way the roster was being managed.  Totally makes sense."
I am James Harden yes  Cant be letting people tarnish my rep like this
2022 Finals Potentially crushes all  PG Kyrie Irving  SG James Harden  SF LeBron James  PF Kevin Durant  C Anthony Davis  SF PF can go either way
"He probably would , James harden averaged 36 one year . i dont see a reason why Jordan wouldnt be able to touch 40"

James Harden
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
"That wouldn't make sense though. Jazz would sooner put Royce O'Neal or Rudy Gay on Davis and let AD light them up for 36/10/5 than cede a huge scoring advantage to Lebron and Russ. There's very little you can do to slow down Anthony Davis and Lebron James, so you used the same strategy the Bucks used on KD this year and numerous teams used on Harden on the Rockets: make the stars work hard for their points, and focus on locking down the less reliable and more containable supporting cast."
"Iso Joe reminds me a lot of James Harden.  Not a whole lot of athleticism or speed, but the unbelievable skill to beat you with just handles."
"2013 is a good one  Tony Parker  Dwyane Wade  LeBron James  Chris Bosh  Tim Duncan   With Pop as coach and Manu, Green, Young Kawhi, Diaw, Mills, Ray Allen, and Chalmers (lol) off the bench   2012 is another fun one:  Westbrook  Wade  KD  LeBron  Bosh  Harden as 6th man"
If you could convince James Harden he was playing regular season games and not playoffs maybe.
I mean I like melo and all but do you really think james harden isnt a better scorer than melo?
How are you making an all time 6th man lineup and not using James Harden.  This team would be much better:  Manu Ginobli  James Harden  Lamar Odom  Kevin McHale  Bill Walton
The league became goofy after that year. There's no way Kyrie and James Harden should be on the same team as Kevin Durant in Brooklyn. And Westbrook on the same team as AD and Lebron...on the Lakers. They are driving away fans like me.
Dirk  He almost had a James harden like legacy of regular season dominance but not enough postseason success
2022  * PG: James Harden * SG: Kyrie Irving * SF: Lebron James * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Anthony Davis
James Harden!
"Yea, he wasn’t flashy, but he had a pretty James Harden-like career, and Harden is totally making it to the Hall too. Cracks the discussion? Dude is a lock. It’s like that guy doesn’t realize he had a fantastic career, like Ray and like KG before their big three era."
Like half of this post is actual dogshit.   Do you really believe Mike James would play better defense than Harden or Kyrie?  Also KD wasn't some efficiency god. He dropped a lot of points but his TS% was great but not incredible. It was slightly over 59%. I'm almost positive Harden was more efficient than that in last year's playoffs.  It sounds like you probably don't like both Kyrie and Harden but you shouldn't let it impact your analysis to the point where you are saying things that make zero sense.
"It meant Lebron's run with Cleveland ends and people hate Lebron. Gotta remember that Kyrie wasn't considered a big weirdo then and unlike most of the other star trade demands, Kyrie was actually not the guy who leaked that he wanted to leave. Him leaving Boston and that shit he says is what made people turn on him. Throwing Jamal Murray's ball into the stands after the game winner was in bad taste too. Boston will still be Boston but they were the anti-hero who tilted James Harden to the face of oblivion, made life difficult for Lebron and somehow managed to constantly challenge Warriors in the regular season even with the talent disparity"
"Ben simmons shouldnt be able to hold a franchise hostage. there isnt a single seaoson when ben could be considered a top ten player in the nba and has an awful playoff record. There is no way the owners dont do something about this in the next pa negociations, simmons wasnt a victim of bad mismanagement or lack of support yet he is holding the whole ass sixer franchise in a horrible situation. James harden didnt do this ,anthony davis didnt do this, melo didint do this, hell vince carter got out when he thought the team was going nowhere and it wasnt this bad. think about what an actual top ten talent could do to a small market team, i doubt zion does this but he could really do the same and the pelicans who are the smallest market in the nba would be literally fucked with nothing to do"
"Its been called a dying sport ""ratings"" down 40% since 2019. Personally I cant watch basketball anymore, too many divas, the players dress ridiculous, every call on the court, gets blown up bye the player, making stupid pathetic faces and throwing there hands in the air. Plus now guys just all jump to the same team to win, follow lebron James around crap. Back in the day, you would build teams drafting, coaching and training. Guys didn't demand trades, especially demanding a trade to only certain teams. So giving players too much power, ruined how teams are built and guys getting recruited to teams with a lebron or harden, etc."
"bro its easy to call klay the 4th best player when the other 3 were Kevin Durant and steph curry , its semi-debatable even whether or not draymond is that much better in terms of value to their offense . the title “all-time great” player doesnt take into consideration whatever player you want to compare , whether that’s kawhi or James harden , it’s a simple yes or no about the player . and the answer is yes for klay , end of story"
"Most shooting guards passing outside of James harden has always been their weaker area. I don't disagree that he is turnover prone but tatum is just less likely to pass overall, he'd rather take someone iso and take the shot(don't hate this at all). Bookers AST% even when playing next to CP3 is better than tatums best. Tatum still has a lot more time to grow tho."
Let him rot. I’m ok with that even if it means we stink next year. He isn’t James Harden you don’t get to hold teams Hostage! it’s bad for everyone especially the fans.
"Name one instance in the last 6 years where he lost to the worse team. I don't hold it against him because I hoped he'd win but expected him to lose. 2019, James Harden averaged 35/7/6 against 3 of the greatest shooters of all time and a defensive mastermind, and then ONLY had to go against 2 of the greatest shooters of all time and a defensive mastermind. 2020, his 2nd best player was playing on a busted ligament and put up numbers fitting an average roleplayer, and lost to the eventual champions. I'll concede 2014, but 2012 he was a 6th man and 2013 his seconds best player was Chandler Parsons. The teams would never be in a place to ""choke"" if Harden didn't drag them to new heights in the first place."
Fym James Harden choked against the 4 all-stars because he had a bad game 6 and 7!11!!
"Embid can't guard 1-5.  You need someone who can guard them and come off switches .  Who does embid have to guard at his position on a nightly basis in his conference. Clint capella just catches lobs, bam has no jumper, Celtics, wizards, nets no serious threat down low. Brook Lopez is outside the paint spacing for giannas.  Nerlen Noel's is a defensive player.   Verse simmons having to pick up. Trae young, westbrook, kyrie or James harden,  Jimmy butler, Tatum, . All with different skills sets ? A.d. was basically a glorified kevin love with the pelicans. Always hurt and your team can never win."
"""Oh, you don't like that James Harden is shooting 6 threes per game and taking 9 free throws? You think his 28% usage is high? I'll raise you to 13 threes, 12 free throws, and 41% usage!"""
"So 76ers will fine him, and likely request return of pay for missed obligations/play time form Ben's initial lump sum pay cheque.  They should absolutely not let a Klutch client just wall all over them and dictate terms as they see fit.  At the same time, what team is willing to take a risk trading for him now?  he could easily pull this shit with them to force his way to the Lakers or something.  James Harden and Anthony Davis wanted out to specific teams, but they didn't quit playing  before it happened.  Ben is a fucking child."
"Simmons is hurt that possibly either 1st or 2nd best scorer on the planet was available and they wanted to trade him?  I forget the NFL team but when all the rumors where Tom Brady were going around and where he would land came up he was asked about the trade and he essentially said , "" I get it he's freaking Tom Brady""  The same principle applies it's freaking James Harden a freaking walking 30 ppg 8 asst. I would understand frustration if it was for role players or someone crappy but COME ON"
Not to mention James Harden who will likely stay and age pretty well.
"How is the real answer not in any of the comments? Neither the deal nor Morey had as much effect on the trade as the fact that Harden and Durant planned for a reunion. Harden wanted to go to Brooklyn and the Rockets made it happen for him. There was a report that Harden and Durant talked about reuniting on the Nets. It had nothing to do with Morey not offering Maxey or some pettiness regarding Morey. Here's the link to the article: https://abc13.com/james-harden-to-get-traded-brooklyn-nets-houston-rockets-trade-kevin-durant-nba/8013697/  And here's the quote: ""The idea of playing together again came up during Harden and Durant's offseason workouts together in Los Angeles. Sources said the players talked openly about whether the combination could work and how a trade facilitating it could work."" Clearly the Thunder connection was there, and there didn't seem to be as much chemistry with Embiid. The Nets package was ""good enough"" compared to the sixers and they also satisfied Harden's wishes at the same time."
Fym James Harden choked against the 4 all-stars because he had a bad game 6 and 7!11!!
"Haha, whoops. Im sorry, I was the one trying to make a joke. I’m just a guy that doesn’t like James harden, and has had a lot of talks about this with the Rockets faithful. Also, not a Twitter person, so this missed me."
Rockets fan… checks out. Poor guys just can’t accept that if you live by James harden you die outside of the finals.
"Curry is the same level of player as James Harden, might actually be worse."
"I have supported Ben the whole way. I think and still think he can be one of the best players in the league. But he needs to out work into his game and make adjustments that so far he has simply not been willing to do.   After another dissapointinv early exit from the playoffs were once again a team was able to exploit the weaknesses hie game creates on offense, the organization finally had the audacity to say been has to be better for the team 5o succeed and apparently that was to much for his fragile ego.   Ben has burned alot of bridges and is making himself look like a juvenile head case for his inability to take criticism. It's no wonder the market value for him isn't very high.    The failure to is Ben has no control over where he ends up. The Sixers will keep shopping and will even find a deal they find acceptable, and if they're almost certainly will not be to the city Ben wants us to go to.   TLDR Ben Simmons thinks he's James Harden and is a clown."
"Imagine you could have had James Harden for Ben Simmons and end up with John Wall instead, scary hours."
they didn’t say no to harden. they were going to trade Ben for him and there was a deal in place but James forced his way to Brooklyn instead and Houston decided to oblige out of a courtesy.
He was “shopped” for James harden a year ago and that’s it lol
Ben Simmons is not James Harden. Come on now.
"There were Sixers fans on here last year vehemently arguing against trading Ben for James fucking Harden, and look at them now. Sheesh. What a difference a year makes."
"James Harden was toxic as hell for the Rockets before they traded him then he went to Brooklyn and now he’s a great teammate, the same would happen with Ben Simmons"
"I don't know if there is a way to ""fix"" it at all, especially if the player we are talking about is of a James Harden or Kyrie Irving stature (we all saw what happened when they wanted out). I think if anything the Schroder situation showed that only superstar-caliber players can successfully demand to leave their situation and come out better off after the fact. I'm also not so sure the NBA wants to ""fix"" these sort of situations because most of the time they are better for the league and create interesting story lines - the James Harden saga that ended with him becoming part of a super team in the Eastern Conference (something the NBA has been starving for since Lebron left Miami, especially as Golden State got so dominant and Lebron teamed up with AD in La etc.) and now Ben Simmons making headlines practically every week as that story continues to develop. A lof of fans hate the way guys are demanding to leave their situations and I understand it but like it or not, I think the NBA thoroughly enjoyed the way James Harden forced his way out and teamed up with Kyrie and KD - situations like that are very profitable and create an insane amount of buzz around their league."

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Basically its cause Mismatches Get tiring on both ends also some teams have tried smaller players for better speed more spacing Like when the rockets had PJ Tucker at Center but Bigs took easy advantage of him and since he's not a ball handler the only advantage he really had was sitting in the corner making bigs HAVE to clear from the paint this worked well anyway cause James Harden is on of the best ISO Players of all time.  Now another ex of this is that sometimes teams like to throw Tall Players at Guards due to the Tower Infront of you lost guards are forced to speed past the big into the paint even if it's a easier score depending on who you throw at them it can tire them out severely or it can be a Party of a Big with terrible Defense getting threes rained on him  Now for why teams don't go all 5 centers well cause Centers vs Guards is a mis match both ways and teams would rather have a well Balanced Lineup then risk it all
"Uh yes they were. At the beginning of the clip the color guy said ""really James Harden? Is it that big of a deal?"""
if you just want career per game averages  Magic Johnson 5.5/6.5  Michael Jordan 6.8/8.2  James Harden 7.5/8.7 (ignoring OKC years gives a career of 8.8/10.2)  And 5 year peaks just because  Magic Johnson 6.6/7.5  Michael Jordan 8.3/9.8  James Harden 9.3/10.8
Seems pretty obvious by history that James Harden and Chris Paul won’t win a championship if they’re your best player.
James Harden’s eyes have gone through enough already.  This is pretty funny though lol.  Harden always gets in the worst situations and they’re not even his fault man lmao like the Metta World Peace elbow.
"Steph Curry and James Harden both barely jump when they shoot, the benefits of jumping higher aren't usually worth it"
"plenty of role players have better stats playing with lebron, lot of guys are catch and shoot guys and lebron is one of the best at creating open shots for teammates.  Simple one is kcp had the 3 most efficient years of his career playing with lebron.  also ad had his best year ever with lebron in 2020 but let me guess that was all due to his own development and had nothing to do with lebron.  Ofc volume will go down when you play with lebron or a ball dominant star but that's expected whenever you move to any more talented team. You'll have the ball less and get less shots and play less minutes.    aaron gordon scored 15ppg in orlando, he scored 10ppg in denver and jokic is the absolute opposite of a ball dominant star.  Denver is fine with that too he was more efficient and shouldnt be scoring 15 on a great offensive team.  To use a great player as an example, james harden wont average even 30ppg in bkn most likely while he was putting up 35 in houston and KD isnt luka/lebron ball dominant either."
"Many Sixers fans said Harden was fat, playoff choker, and the defensive loss of Simmons would be greater than the playmaking/scoring gains of James fucking Harden."
"Mann straight but its easy to flash out here and there when you got Big Vets around you. But who knows, maybe he is that James Harden that been on the bench until he got his own team. 🤷🏽‍♂️ May be one of those situations"
"I call this one ""The James Harden"":  No no, there's a lot more to the game than being tall. You can't just throw the ball to the tall guy every time down."
"Nets win. They'd have the best scorer(arguably 2 best scorers), best defender and the best pick and roll threat of all time. James Harden with Capela was unstoppable, what the fuck can he do with Giannis? It just breaks my brain."
I don't think you've put enough consideration into the fact that Trae Young is closer to Luka Doncic than Doncic is to James Harden!
James Harden is at the top
"Really depends on how young we're talking but for younger kids, absolutely do not watch James Harden lol. Loved his time in Houston but his shot selection is horrid for them"
How unreasonable of them to try to trade him for James Harden and also decline to trade him for Malik Beasley. What scumbags!
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
"are you just picking players that are versatile? Jrue Holiday is the guy most guards don't like playing against.  edit: and definitely not top 5 or even top 30, but James Harden is decent on guarding bigs when there's a switch."
He was post james harden. He had bad shooting night refrees vaild him off.
Just for a fun comparison:  Magic Johnson had a career FTr of .489  Michael Jordan had a career FTr of .358  James Harden has a career FTr of .522
"I mean KD and kyrie when paired with other stars have been historically good in the playoffs. Harden has an iffy track record but he also hasn’t had this lessened burden prior to with Brooklyn. Folding under pressure shouldn’t be an issue at all, although injuries are definitely a concern. This would be assuming they’re healthy.  A 50 piece in the playoffs is out of the ordinary for any player that’s not a Michael Jordan/ Lebron James/ Kobe. Even explosive regular season players that drop 50 casually like harden or dame haven’t done it many times in the playoffs.   And idk if I trust Boston to take down the bucks. Like in terms of raw talent, Milwaukee has the edge. In terms of fit and chemistry, we know Milwaukee is seamless while Boston has a whole new supporting cast and has a lot of question marks. Idk how Boston’s gonna slow down giannis, they struggled in their last series against him. I assume smart takes on jrue and tbf he could slow him down a good bit. Middleton should get his against brown, even if it involves a lot of catch and shoots or screens. And then at the offensive end, who in Boston can be trusted that much to create besides brown and Tatum? I love Al but I think his days of having consistent playoff offence run through him are over. Schroder is the embodiment of inconsistency. It’s basically brown and Tatum who will be dealing with jrue, Middleton and Divincenzo on the perimeter, and if they get past them, giannis and brook waiting to shut down the paint"
"It somewhat reminds me of everyone shitting on the Celtics for not giving IT a big contract.    Yeah you can say it was bad from the players' perspective, but would you want your team giving him a max contract? I fucking wouldn't.    If your team had Ben Simmons and you were trying to win now, would you want your front office to try to trade him for *James Harden*? I would."
James Harden
"james harden absolutely can win as a number one. he most likely would’ve if cp3 never got hurt, and he definitely would’ve if he didn’t have to play the best team of all time during his prime title contention."
James Harden.
"Feel like Giannis should still be the man to beat for MVP this year.  Not sure there are many players out there that can compete for it.  Giannis and MAYBE LaVine are the only players I can see representing Central.  Trae, Beal and Bam for southeast.  Tatum, Embiid, MAYBE Durant and Harden for northeast.  Curry, George, MAYBE James, Davis for southwest.  Doncic, MAYBE Morant and Williamson for Midwest.  Lillard and Jokic for northwest.  Current situation favors George the most because of how well the Clippers played in playoffs without Kawhi and also because Kawhi might return mid-season at the earliest. Gives George like 40 games to prove if he might ever be an MVP candidate or not. This might be the biggest chance in his career to win it."
"Ur not getting it tho. These players didn’t just go, “ it’s Brooklyn! Why not go!” These players had motivations to go there with kyrie wanting to be home, kd wanting to play with his friend and harden wanting to win. If kyries hometown team was the pacers he would’ve went there, kd would’ve followed and James would want to go to win. Especially because Brooklyn has no history of attracting free agents it’s a stupid point ur bringing up"
"Ainge probably does an actual trade with the 6 draft picks he threw in the trash drafting a bunch of scrubs.  In all honesty, Celtics are probably closer to a title as they have a superstar with their war chest of draft capital coupled with the stars they draft from tanking for 1-2 years.  Celtics probably still end up with brown or Tatum via the draft and possibly a James harden superstar with the 6 draft picks they had to offer. They also have more cap space due to tanking as well.  Instead, Ainge drafted literally 6 benchwarmers and now the Celtics are in no man’s land. Good enough to make the second round but nowhere near a title.  Incredibly frustrating seeing Ainge be the worst gm in the league his last two years. Horrible drafting, horrible trades/lack of trades, and just general ambivalence."
"""One-legged James Harden choked vs the Bucks""  \- r/nba, probably"
so true man i’ve never heard anyone call james harden a choker
Funny to remember last year when phillies didn't want to include ben simmons in a package to get james harden...
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Giannis, Embiid"
"I can’t look anyone straight in the eye and say the Lakers can beat the Nets in a shootout.  Both of our health is suspect at this point, but if both of us meet healthy, the nets just have too much.  Kyrie is a unique player who, when the burden of carrying the offense isn’t on him, can duel a superstar first option to a draw.  KD gets 30 on anybody whenever he wants. He’a going to duel Bron to a draw.   And James Harden as their fucking playmaker/ THIRD OPTION.  This isn’t a defense league anymore, we know it’ll be a shoot out. That nets trio takes 21 3pt FGA to the tune of 40%. And they aren’t easy field goals either. They also shoot their 2pt FGA at a whopping 56%, and shoot like 18ish FTs at 88%.   I can’t say we beat that guys I’m sorry. They’re too threatening, have too much space, and have too much shot creating.  Bron, AD, and Westbrook clog the lane for eachother which will limit our offensive efficiency somewhat. The floor is absolutely wide open for the nets."
Lol the Bucks cannot beat a healthy Nets team. Don’t be delusional. The Nets looked like the better team with just Irving and Durant. It took overtime in Game 7 to beat the Nets with Durant and James Harden at 20%.
Do you not remember James Harden eating his way off the Rockets last year? How shocked should I be that someone trying to be out of shape got a soft tissue injury?
"For the Raptors, Kyle Lowry Game 6 vs the Celtics (2020) and Game 7 vs the Heat (2016), Terrence Ross 51 point game  For my favorite players: LeBron Game 6 vs the Celtics (2012), Devin Booker Game 1 vs the Lakers (2021), James Harden 60 point triple double"
"WS/48 still isn’t very helpful though. David Robinson is 2nd all-time. CP3 is 5th all-time.   I don’t think anyone has *ever* placed those players in their Top 10.  James Harden is great but he’s 8th all-time. Rudy Gobert is 10th.  Yao Ming ended with a higher WS/48 than Dr. J, Dirk, and Hakeem.  It’s just another arbitrary mash-up of box score figures which doesn’t really do anything except *try* to quantify impact on winning."
So if James Harden beat that record the year he put up the 2nd most 3s you would concede that he is the best 3pt shooter ever?  Come on.   And I'm not say fg% = best. I am saying there is no one measure to what makes a person best at something
"PG: Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum. SG: D booker (All Star), James Harden (Super Star). SF: MPJ, Chris Middleton. PF: Giannis (Super Star), Sabonis (All Star). C: Nurkic, K Love.  I guess I don’t know who I would put as the last 2 spots. I also don’t really remember who was an all star this season so I might have accidentally picked 3."
"Harden playing defense in 2016 wow  He's gotten better recently but that was the peak of the ""James Haren"" era"
"Two great things that would go terribly together. Guys who operate in the same space and/or need the opposite of what the other brings. Guys with similar personalities but different game philosophies.   Allen Iverson &amp; Patrick Ewing. Sorry OP. Cheating a bit. The greatest off the dribble PNR guy with a stationary low post operator.   Kobe Bryant &amp; Isiah Thomas. Ball dominant orchestraters who’d get into fistfights about who The Man is.   Larry Bird &amp; James Harden. A movement creator and the ball pounder. Cultural differences?   Grant Hill &amp; LeBron. Too similar, too interested in playing chess, these two complement each other too well and don’t make up for each other’s minor deficiencies. There can only be one smartest guy on the court and it’d be like having two teachers pet’s vying for valedictorian."
The Malie in the Palace isn't Artiest only incident  See James Harden.  The guy is kinda crazy.  He just wasn't constantly running his mouth and not every player is willing to confront him like they might with a Rasheed Wallace.
"I’m surprised no one has said Houston Rockets Harden and Westbrook…  At first they thought Capela can’t be playing next to Russ as the spacing is bad so they shipped his ass and got back Covington by the trade deadline  Then you continue to watch the Pocket Rockets extreme version of small ball and it’s pretty clear Harden and Westbrook don’t exactly feed off each other off ball a whole bunch rather than the occasional Harden gets hard trapped and flip off the pass to a rolling Westbrook to the paint.. idk if it had been different to have the two play off each in a more body movement offense. Both should have learn to move off ball for one another, Russ to slash, James to curl around off ball screen or something off that nature. Both could have learn to screen for one another more, something that Brooklyn doing a whole bunch for KD and Kyrie currently actually"
"Every player should grow an Afro. It would cause offensive geniuses to have to devise new formulations on the offensive end. Just imagine James Harden with an Afro closing out on a 3 pt shot. DPOY. Karl Anthony Towns with an Afro? Who needs Rudy Gobert when you have Afro KAT. Players need to take a hint at what Jarret Allen is doing. Mfer got that Fro, then the dough, now he’s coming for Mo"
**Russell Westbrook- Cam Newton:**  •	⁠Both are MVPs  •	⁠Both made one finals appearance and lost  •	⁠Both are the most athletic players ever at their position  •	⁠Both have declined heavily with age and injuries  •	⁠Both have an odd fashion sense  ————-  **Larry Bird- Patrick Mahomes:**  - Both won a ring at 24 - Both were super talented but not as hyped coming in - Both were immediately seen as top players in the league at age 23  ———-  **Shaq- Gronk:**  - Both are super talented physically  - Both are among the best ever at their position  - Both were a major star on a dynasty  - Both won a ring after on a different team  ———-  **James Harden(pre-Nets)- Drew Brees**  - Both broke out on a different team - Both put up crazy stats - Both are all time greats missing something(MVP/ring) - Both consistently fell short in the playoffs in heartbreaks
"Not quite sure what you mean by that. I mean the difference between Durant and Lebron in terms of career scoring is similar to Durant and Curry, just in different aspects.  Durant is quite clearly the best career scorer overall out of the players currently playing and James Harden might have better argument for 2nd in that aspect rather than Curry or Lebron, also maybe Giannis in future once we see how his career progresses.  Now where would anyone get idea that Curry or Lebron aren't strong scorer's is odd to me and I've never really heard any such statements."
"I think the important part of the context here is it’s not just the ages that make a super team a super team. Age, free agency vs. trades, and the level of talent are all relevant.  Even if the Nets are roughly the same age as the 2008 Celtics were when they formed, KD and Kyrie chose Brooklyn and if you look at All-NBA as a metric for the top 15 guys in the league, Harden made first team for 6 of the last 7 years and is repeatedly top 5 in MVP voting before he was traded. No one thought the Nets were a super team with just KD and Kyrie. Just a really good team. They added a top 5 guy in the league even if you want to say he’s past his prime, he’s undoubtedly top 10 right now. That’s what makes them super.  Pierce had 4 All-NBA selections. 3 times 3rd and once 2nd.  Allen had 2 All-NBA selections. Once 2nd and once 3rd.  KG was the only guy you could say was top 5.  What the Nets have here would be like if the Celtics had just KG and Pierce, and then traded for Duncan, Kobe or Nash instead of Ray Allen. It’s just not the same thing when you have James Harden and Kevin Durant on the same team imo.  Even if you want to classify them as a super team and say they started it, the 07-08 Celtics are definitely the weakest when you stack them up to the Heatles, Durant Warriors, and current Nets."
"James Harden made an almost full court shot during Game 4 against GS in 2015, didn’t count but a great shot regardless"
"If he maintains his volume and efficiency from last year, and the Bulls are a playoff team, we’ll have to start talking about LaVine in that Mitchell-Booker-Beal tier of “best SGs not named James Harden”. Hell, he might already be in that conversation, but if he keeps it up on a good team it’ll start getting interesting."
"I mean the other thing is there's many aspects of being elite athletically in the NBA. Calling someone an elite athlete makes almost no sense.  LeBron James is one of the great athletes of all time and yet he was still average in lateral movement even in his prime.   As is Giannis.   Jrue is not the fastest guy, but he is ELITE in lateral movement and again likely one of the best at lateral quickness. Who is comparable to him? Dort, smart, Robinson, guys that can get around screens.  It isn't just their lateral quickness though, it's the way they move their feet. Someone did a video on towns years ago and highlighted that his help defense was so bad because he's basically tripping over his own feet.   Luka and harden aren't thought of as elite athletes, but their strength and movement driving to the rim is elite and what makes them so special.  Wall, Westbrook, Ja...Gerald green(it sounds weird. It it's accurate) are all elite at running the court at full speed. Green lacked a lot of other skills that these others had but he was still an elite fast break player due to his sheet speed. Westbrook was so fast he honestly never learned to halt his momentum enough that he led to him shooting the ball with momentum which caused misses.  I could go on. There are many aspects that make a player elite athletically and the majority aren't amazing at all aspects. I can't really think of Jordan's athletic weakness but aside from him most do have something."
"Hello? Police? This the Greek Freak, James Harden is trying to beat me up  😨"
"Huerter in terms of his role on a championship level team. Where a superstar heliocentric ball handler like Trae Young or James Harden controls majority of your possessions with high pick and rolls and secondary guys like Huerter or Bogi creates some offense with limited usage to either allow the super star a rest or they are feeding off the super star’s usage.   It’s pretty much consensus from the people from the Stepien, DP, and Jackson Frank that only Cade and Green have that potential to be that superstar on a championship team. Suggs would likely top off as that second option."
They were an alright team at the very beginning of the year with James Harden as Harden quit on his team they got worse and worse. They got a sub par package for him and they just completely sucked. They continued this and got the 2nd pick.
Basically James Harden can be amnestied for being a literal Hitler
That article doesn't dispute anything that I said.      Harden was missing open shots and throwing up brick after brick. His on-ball defenders were Cole and Chalmers. These are facts.  I can Google articles as well:     https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1231796-james-harden-disappearing-act-costs-thunder-nba-finals     https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/02/04/former-thunder-teammate-kendrick-perkins-james-harden-partied-too-much-during-2012-nba-finals/

James Harden Is better. He’s vastly underrated.
"""2 guys who almost beat the Warriors"" You're talking about James Harden and Trevor Ariza right? Because Kawhi ended Curry's dynasty in 6 lol"
"&gt;Who’s better all time between Kawhi Leonard &amp; James Harden?   Kawhi is higher for me on the all-time rankings if that's what you're asking. Two rings vs Zero rings.  &gt; Also who do you think is the better player right now (not considering health or Kawhi’s ACL)?  If nobody was hurt, I'd take Kawhi by an inch, but realistically Harden is better since injuries happen; rather often for Kawhi.  &gt;  &gt; Who’s more underrated between the two?  Neither are what I'd call ""underrated"". Though if I had to pick, Kawhi sometimes gets underrated because of his injuries and Harden sometimes gets underrated because of his lack of accolades.  &gt;  &gt; Starting a team from scratch and your options are Kawhi or James (not considering health), who’re you going with?  Harden, if I'm just basing my team on the guy."
If it weren’t fo advanced stats mfers would still be going around calling James Harden an inefficient ball hog
"We can have an actual discussion if you want. I understand injuries happen every year. What doesn’t happen is the literal most injured playoffs in nba history. [It’s not even an exaggeration.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/basketball/nba-record-all-stars-playoffs-injuries.html). It broke the all time record for most all stars missing. Not just that, it gets even worse when you consider exactly who was missing. You have Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden all either leaving early or playing on one leg. That’s 3 of the top 5 players and another top 10 player. Then you have Kyrie, Jaylen brown, Jamal Murray. All great players that would have changed the tides of their respective series. It’s clearly not just another “an injury happened” year. It’s very rare for both the eastern and western teams to make it through because the best teams in the conference all suffered major injuries. Most years the clear cut best team in the league wins, some seasons the second best team wins because of an injury, but it’s very rare for the 4-5 best teams in the league to Duke it out because 1,2, and 3 all got hurt. That’s all I’m saying."
"&gt;Neither team has taken the easy way out the way the Warriors did.   LMFAOOOO okay. Ig signing KD, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, and trading for James Harden ain't the easy way? I hate the Lakers more than I hate the Nets, but you're out of your mind if you have a problem with the Warriors signing KD on top of their homegrown core that they built through good drafting and development, but no problem with a bunch of superstars grouping up together in Brooklyn, literally involving the same guy you had a problem with in Golden State."
"The closest would be James Harden. He has played all 82 games (10-11,15-16) twice in his career and has played in 81 games (14-15, 16,17) twice as well.  In contrast, Lebron has only one 82 Game season (17-18). Plus a 81 game season and a 80 game season."
"Started *really* watching in 2017, I live near DC so I felt obliged to root for the Wizards as frustrating as they were, and James Harden quickly became my favorite player (should've won at least one more MVP smh) so I loved the Rockets too, not to mention Chris Paul and Westbrook have been two of my favorites since before I even really watched much basketball so their stints in Houston made it natural for me to root for the Rockets too. Harden's playstyle is one of my favorite things to watch and the 0-27 game is probably the saddest I've been cuz of sports since the 2010 world cup final"
"&gt; Wtf, literally my two favorite teams  Ew, how is that possible. I hope you only became an NBA fan in the last 2 years. Because both of these teams were the antithesis of enjoyable basketball from 2015 - 2019.  Wizards for many years were bunch of goons and dirty players with an ugly offense that bragged about losing in the first round. Marcus Morris, Mike Scott, John Wall, Gortat, even old Paul Pierce. It's like the bad boys Pistons but if they lost in the first round and still talked shit.  The Houston ""literally third reich"" Rockets with Harden and CP3 and Morey were arguably worse though. Watching Harden dribble for 20 seconds and then attempt to draw a foul on a 24ft three pointer by hooking defenders arms 20 possessions a game was the worst basketball viewing experience ever. Even worse than the 00s Spurs. Basketball gods were protecting the integrity of the sport when the Rockets missed 27 threes in a row in game 7. Thank you James Naismith 🙏"
James Harden confirmed better than Magic Johnson
57/17/17 the James harden
"Peak vs. Peak, it's not close at all. Joel Embiid will never be able to switch onto James Harden/ RWB consistently, but AD has..."
"Did anyone else click on the article and watch the video of this particular voters rationale? Whilst I still cannot agree with some of the placement, she does explain that in addition to championships and individual accolades she also looks at their impact on the game today. Be at the success and growth Or the evolution of playing styles. So it gives a bit more insight into why George Mikan is so high, why Draymont who really helped Asha in the small ball era is so high. And why Steph is in the top 10. The criteria she gives however does not explain Dame Lillard being above James Harden who has had an impact on playing style and has one MVP"
"huh?  who cares if he led the league in turnovers, he led the league in assists. And he didn’t average 12, he averaged 5   look at the other guys next to him:Luka doncic, Trae young, James harden, LeBron James   7 games with 8+ turnovers yet 0 with 12. u didn’t think this one through did you 😭😭😭😭  hope this helps!"
Kyrie also got them Kevin Durant and James Harden  They could lock kyrie in a shed for the next 10 months and they’re still at MINIMUM a top 3 team
"I only started to get into the NBA say 2-3 seasons ago, when big kiwi Steven Adams was getting popular (I'm a kiwi obviously!) After about 6 months of watching the big names like james harden etc sticking their feet out on the 3 point shots to draw fouls or jumping up even when no shot is makeable but milking a foul, jumping backwards into running players (like the comments about CP3) it really put me off. As a fairly casual fan it made it very unwatchable. Being from new Zealand we are very anti to the 'Hollywood/flopping' type behavior, being from a tough rugby nation lol, hence Adams is the toughest in the NBA but plays hard and fair. I honestly hope these calls fix all the offensive players changing their lines, milking fouls etc. as defense basically seems pointless to me.  It's simple for me; whoever instigates the actual contact is at fault"
James Harden wore a fat suit to get traded to the Nets
"For Westbrook I got Fisher, James, &amp; he joined the Rockets after losing to them then the Lakers after losing to them, so there's quite a bit of players there, but I'm excluding when joining a team after losing to them. Even if we count them, there's only Harden and Eric Gordon that overlap from when he faced them to joined them. From joining the Lakers, I see about 5 players that overlap, still nothing on LBJ's 20."
"I can't stand James Harden or the way he plays, but game 7 of the 2018 WCF was rigged and you cannot convince me otherwise. He was consistently getting calls the ENTIRE game and in the 4th the refs completely swallowed their whistle in a close game because they wanted another GSW vs CAVS and KD vs LEBRON finals for ratings and earnings.  Fuck that it's not even a conspiracy it's just factual. Watch the game.  Change my mind."
James Harden burned his heat pad
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
James Harden and Avril Lavigne swapped bodies
This is so bad. Draymond green over James harden?
"James Harden had died after the okc finals, killed himself. He since have been replaced by a clone. The beard is actually a smart trick because the chin of the clone didn't look quite right. but silly me that's just a known fact."
"Screwed? The have Patty Mills there along with James Harden, KD, Griffin and LMA. They're contenders without Kyrie."
James harden went from 6th manish to top talent
Nets really worried about kyrie not being able to play when they got mfkn Kevin Durant and James Harden! If those guys cant carry you to the at least the conference finals then you got a major problem.
"Kyrie was too special to play with Lebron James, and Kyrie is too special to play with KD and Harden for a chance to make superteam history.  That's Kyries problem, he thinks he is so gd special"
"I remember making a post a few years ago when he joined the Nets and began criticizing his teammates. I said Kyrie attitude could ruin his career and make him an unlikeable player and teams and fans will probably get tired of him  At the time people disagreed with me, some people were saying he’s not a problem. It’s not good when your star player refuses to get vaccinated, especially when you’re trying to win a championship and I’d bet that KD and James Harden feel some way about Kyrie"
"They have James Harden, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Blake Griffin. Kyrie isn't going to make them lose much from ticket sales"
They still have James Harden and Kevin Durant so it definitely doesn't have much of an impact on ticket sales
"Harden is the most disrespected superstar of all time. James Harden is one of the 5 best players of this generation. I think he is also the 3rd best shooting guard of all time. This man could/should have 3 MVP's. He was also a CP3 injury from beating the ""greatest team of all time""   &amp;#x200B;  Jordan Poole making 3 or 4 all star games would be an achievement for him. Honestly, I am rooting for the guy but stop it with this nonsense"
1. Mike Conley 2. James Harden 3. Lebron 4. Marc Gasol 5. Zach Randolph
all it took for me was for james “i wish i could just run and dunk” harden to leave
"Ah yes Lillard over James Harden, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade very good"
The hilarious thing though is the Nets still have James Harden and Kevin Durant. Their season is FAR from over and can still get a top four seed with ease based off the play of those two
"This is a lie. The talk was about how great our defense looked in comparison to our regular season effort, and how terrible Bud is as a coach(Giannis minutes etc) and how terrible the bucks were playing, but this was said in the bubble as well, and the year prior when y’all allowed the raptors to steamroll you with 4 wins straight  That did not start with the Nets. Bud and the bucks playing style has been a subject of criticism so stop the cap.   And really, you didn’t prove anything that series outside of beating an injured team **just *barely*** you didn’t overcome anything. You caught a stroke of luck. I’m not knocking the bucks for it. A lot of teams gets lucky and at the end of the day, we know injuries was always a concern  But please stop acting like the Bucks overcame some major obstacle. It took Kyrie being out and Harden being out/rushing back for the Bucks to just barely squeak by in 7 games.   Nets absolutely are significantly better than the Bucks a and you’re an idiot if you disagree. The Bucks escaped that series by the skin of their behinds even with the comical injury luck Brooklyn suffered. They had 3 games of Kyrie Irving and two games of James Harden at like 25% capacity. Give me a break.  And don’t give me that “but muh injury prone players” nonsense. James Harden was an ironman until this recent hamstring and Kyrie Irving’s injury was a freak accident that could’ve happened to anybody.   If Steph Curry and Draymond Green went down in 2018 and Golden State lost to Cleveland, it would be totally reasonable to proclaim the the Warriors would/be champs if healthy . The fact that you’re too fragile to admit it because that would’ve meant another playoff disappointment for your team is irrelevant so again stop the cap and throwing around “bandwagon” I could link you to my Twitter and all my Nets gear collected over the years.   KD played 53 minutes that game 7 and harden was on a injured hamstring and y’all only won by 4 points lol."

They have kevin Durant and James harden
"Like all owners of Houston sports teams, Tilman is a 1. The only Houston owner who is good is James Harden, part owner of the Dynamo. Love you baby."
"Some times you have to let the bird leave the nest. James Harden would have never became the player he is today playing alongside Westbrook and KD. He needed his own team. Not only that but he wouldnt have gotten paid how he should have been paid with them. There is a such thing as too much talent on one team. And unfortunately, we saw the consequences of that"
"A lot more hurtful than some old band t shirts, but James Harden is one of the few guys I can 100% believe didn't realize he was making a political statement"
[reminds me of this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/17/us/james-harden-face-mask-trnd/index.html)
"I think people overestimate his age because he is probably most memorable for his extremely good defense in the 2018 WCF, particularly switching onto James Harden or Chris Paul or Eric Gordon."
"I have...  Jordan  James, Kareem  Russell, Magic, Bird  Duncan, Kobe, Dr J., Wilt, Shaq, Durant, Big O  Curry, Olajuwon, Garnett, Dirk, Malone M, Malone K, West  Pippen, Wade, Harden, Havlicek, Robinson, Giannis, Nash, Stockton etc  So KG would be top 14-20."
"Lillard has already requested a trade, he is just not acting like Ben Simmons or James Harden last year."
"Lol Miken #6  Pippen over Shaq and Kobe WTF  Westbrook (~40 spots too high) over Stockton, Wade, AI, Nash...that's gotta be the worst take  Draymond makes an appearance on a list he has no business on and overtakes Dirk, Barkley, Ben Wallace...  Lillard over James Harden?  What?  Kinda surprised Luka Doncic isn't like 36th on this list"
"James harden gotta be up there, we all know why he grew that beard out"
"James Harden is good at basketball, for one."
"Yeah I'm sure most lists are garbage.

The only thing that jumps out at me is that James Harden should be there over Ray Allen.
"Only people who watched prime Kobe will know how talented he was. He was a much better shooter than given credit for. He and Donyell Marshall both had the three point shooting record for most made threes before Curry broke it in that game against OKC in 2016! (they both hit 12 threes and the record stood for a while).   Kobe was streaky with his three-ball, but he also did not care about his percentage. He would take any and every shot no matter the angle or if three defenders were draped all over him.  No way anyone can ever convince me that James Harden was a better basketball player. You can use all the analytical data you like."
No lie I did the same against James Harden at ASU. I was not good. My team triple teamed him and he still split it and dunked on me.
"Frs they think he's in the pg, kawhii, James harden tier but he's not at that level"
"james harden is a superstar who gave everything he had to houston and was there for the vast majority of his career, and rightfully decided that he probably couldn’t win there when he clearly deserves a ring, ben is a lower level all star who clearly does not give a shit about philly and just wants to leave at age 25"
James Harden on a night KD and Irving aren't available.
"What im trying to say is muscles don't win games, skills do. James Harden is the best scorer because his passing ability, and his practice on how to use his strength. Train smarter not harder"
We should honestly just start calling James Harden a power forward if we're going to be this loose and arbitrary with positions because that's what he often guards. Just go wild with it at some point
"We'll see. Nothing has happened in all this time. But those are far come downs from when Simmons was being tossed around for James Harden.   And, as for know more than Sixers fans, that might be true. But he's only human as well. He thought George Hill was a good enough PG and how did that work out?"

"Call it whatever you want. But the Sixers are fining Simmons for NOT pulling a James Harden/Vince Carter and stinking up the locker room before getting offloaded. And he's hurting his wallet by not giving them that. The whole deal is a car crash and at least finding out how this ends will be interesting to us neutrals.  Kyrie, on the other hand, has actually selfishly backed out of too many teams to warrant this amount of attention. Dude's getting hella mileage off of that one ring."
This reminds me why I don't respect James Harden in the slightest. He's a dirty basketball player.
"1. Who wants to die today?  2. Hey-ya hey!  3. Klay Thompson scaffolding interview  4. ?  5. Game, series, Toronto has won!  6. ?  7. Drake and Draymond  8. I love it!  9.

Curry slips  20. ?  21. ?  22. He can be a freak on the court and on the sheets know what I'm say."
"No doubt it's gonna be harder without him. But Harden missed a lot of games last year as well, including in you guy's series (which I'm really happy you won btw congrats).   I'm just saying they are definitely contenders even without Kyrie. KD and James Harden on a team with a bunch of solid pieces and cheap vets is always gonna be a contender.  Personally I think they win the East if they stay healthy. It'll be interesting to see how much the stars sit. Maybe they do the Lebron and just prioritise getting to the playoffs over having a good seed."
"“Although I think an argument could be made that Westbrook only having made it to 1 finals despite playing with KD, Paul George, or James harden in like what, 8 of the last 10 seasons? kind of says a lot about his ability to be the primary ball handler on a championship team”  Is what you said first. Then you tried to move goalposts and it still didn’t make sense  Underachieving for 2 years, one of which you were hurt, out of a 14 year successful career doesn’t mean much. You just don’t like him and that’s fine, don’t try to to disguise it in nonsensical takes like this    Take the L"
Jimmy Butler &gt; James Harden
So James Harden winning the MVP from the bench this year?
"It’s a balance. If he does this, he can end up fucking hi his value overall. Ben Simmons ain’t James Harden."
"I think most basketball knowledgeable people would acknowledge what you are saying but I also think they would say that Kyrie is on the short list of people who could do it.  Especially with KD and James Harden playing alongside him. If they want to get Kyrie going, that's what will happen.   All the game planning stuff, defensive rotations, film study, all of that can happen via Zoom, so if he's committed to the team, he could really perform well.  I mean, if he stepped off the street and dropped 40 against Milwaukee on opening night, that would be very on-brand and I really don't think many people would be surprised."
I'm confused.  Is James Harden not popular?
"I have 3 comments in this thread lmao.   This. isnt. true.   He literally was forced to drift middle to anticipate the Harden doubles, which didn’t only come from his man. There were plenty of Russ Harden back door highlights as well.   No one said he was a “great” off ball player that year, the Rockets were still an isolation team because they have James Harden.   But he was completely fine"
"Begrudgingly   Buike is only in his 3rd year as a commentator, so he gets a pass but most nights he's fine. I've been on Team Get Rid Of Fitz since 2015. He was fine when we were a scrappy up and comer but winning has really made him insufferable. And he's even worse when we play James Harden, who he treats like a mortal enemy"
"Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey squashed any rumors of star guard Ben Simmons being traded for Houston's James Harden on Thursday.   ""We are not trading Ben Simmons—he is an important part of our future,"" Morey told Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium.  That quote was from December. The rumor mill was saying that the Rockets actually didn’t want to trade with the Nets because they didn’t want Kyrie Irving   Imagine having a Harden / Embiid pick and roll surrounded by all their 3 point shooters."
"To be honest, I would put Harden in the same category as D-Wade. I mean, at the end of the day, the only thing that he has that Harden doesn’t have is more wins and two championships. That’s it. As far as playing at the same level? Competing every night? Both ends? Shooting inside and outside? Fast break? Transition? James Harden have it all"
James Harden has been cultivating mass
Georgios Kalaitzakis vs James Harden  The matchup everyone has been waiting for.
Are we sure Atlanta's strip clubs are better than Houston's? Wouldn't James Harden know?
"No one is calling Davis a victim, they’re pointing out how shitty the whole thing was handled and turned into a clown show by a gm and front office.   Look at the last several stars traded and ask how many were turned into a spectacle. Paul George, harden, kyrie, Westbrook 2X’s. All of those were handled with minimum drama from front office or player even when the player was acting like a snake or throwing a fit (looking at you Paul George and James harden). If the front office handles it well they come out looking better and the players get criticism. Like with kawhi and Spurs. No one blames the Spurs for that, they all know kawhi was being a snake   On the other hand look at how incompetent or bad front offices handle trades. You have butler and the wolves being a total meltdown and media fest, you had Davis and pelicans feuding with the pelicans leaking every single thing said and trying their hardest to make Davis look like a terrible person. There’s a proper way to handle trade request even when you’re not happy with it or mad at the player. Presti is a good example. He honored the trade request and publicly denied that it was a mutual trade but that was it. He didn’t ignore George or spread rumors/leak things. He set the record straight then moved on"
James harden can shoot the ball
"I mean you say that....but do you think Harden cost himself a dime from his stunt last season?   I can get why people, especially sixers fans, would not be optimistic about him becoming the caliber of player we all agree he has the potential to be...but if he ever does reach that potential he's gonna get paid and it wont hamper his career one bit except one city that used to love him will now hate him...see Anthony Davis, James Harden etc etc.  All star 3 straight years..all NBA team 2 years ago and he's 25. There's a lot to gamble that"
"I mean anything is possible, but by a lot of accounts Mitchell likes Utah. He shows up to college games and is involved in the community.  He also has very well run organization.   If you were a player and had to chose between the big market Knicks and the Jazz, I think you would pick the Jazz.   If you start looking at the league, I do not know if big markets outside of LA are worth it.   Salt Lake has an extremely fast growing economy and is currently 30th in the nation ahead of San Antonio, Milwaukee, New Orleans, [etc.](https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/) Of the teams with bigger markets, there are only a few options.  * Toronto - Nope - If you have a residence in the states and play in Canada. Lots of taxes.   * New York - The Knicks have been one of the worst run franchises this decade. They may be turning the corner, which may be intriguing.   * Brooklyn - It is an opportunity to win a chip, however it would be a tough situation with volume shooters like Harden, Durrant, and Irving.   * Lakers - I think this would be a good fit, but you would still be third fiddle behind Lebron and Davis.   * Clippers - It is also a good fit and given that George and Kawhi can be passive this is an option. Not a great history of the clippers though. One of the historically worse ran franchises in the NBA.   * Chicago - Nope. - Since Rose, it has been a bad run franchise.   * Dallas - Decent option and Cuban would sell the farm. However, Luka would dominate the ball a majority of the time.  * Warriors - Was an even worse ran franchise in the 90's and early 00's than the clippers. It has since turned around and would be a good place to play.   * Washington DC - What was the last big time free agent the Wizards got? 36 year old Paul Pierce? It is not an attractive destination to free agents.  * Houston - Why would you go from a contender to the current state of affairs that is the Houston Rockets? (Obligatory FTR)  * Boston - Not a bad spot to go, but you have questions with the coaching and management now. Nothing to show they are a contender from their boat load of picks.  * Atlanta - Another team that was a dumpster fire in the past and is looking to turn the corner. Domestically, though Atlanta and Georgia has a ton of issues.  * Phoenix - Made a title run last year after being continuously bad throughout most of recent history.  * Detroit - Struggles to put people in the stands and the organization is dysfunctional.   Salt Lake City is a closer media market to No.3 Chicago than No.3 Chicago is to No.1 New York. Unless you are going to New York or LA, then market size doesn't mean as much as being in a better situation.   Now, as far as the free agency attraction factor. Every team struggles with that. The Knicks, Lakers, Clippers, &amp; Nets did not get Lebron when he left Cleveland the first time or left Miami or Durrant when he left okc. They went to better situations rather than markets.   Let's review the top $ FA's over the past five years, shall we.   **2021**   * Lowry (TOR - MIA) - Smaller Market  * DeRozan (SAS - CHI) - Bigger Market  * Ball (NO- CHI) - Bigger Market  * Markkanen (CHI-CLE) - Smaller Market  * Dinwiddle (BKN - WAS) - Smaller Market  **2020**  * Hayward (BOS - CHA) - Smaller Market  * Bogdanovic (SAC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Gallinari (OKC - ATL) - Bigger Market  * Wood (DET - HOU) - Bigger Market  * Crowder (MIA - PHX) - Bigger Market  **2019**  * Durrant (GSW - BKN) - Bigger Market  * Walker (CHA - BOS) - Bigger Market  * Butler (PHI - MIA) - Smaller Market  * Russell (BKN - GSW) - Smaller Market  * Horford (BOS - PHI) - Smaller Market  **2018**  * James (CLE - LAL) Bigger Market  * Anderson (SAS - MEM) Smaller Market  * Jordan (LAC - DAL) Smaller Market  * McDermott (DAL - IND) Smaller Market  * Ilyasova (PHI - MIL) Smaller Market  **2017**  * Hayward (UTA - BOS) Bigger Market  * Reddick (LAC - PHI) Smaller Market  * Milsap (ATL - DEN) Smaller Market  * Teague (IND - MIN) Bigger Market  * Hill (UTA - SAC) Bigger Market  There are a few big names in here, but most of the guys on the list were overpaid to move and didn't make the team they went too a lot better. This year remains to be seen.   The mid tier free agents or sleepers are where any team can find players. And these players will go to any team that pays them the most.   A lot of player movement is done by trades and not the result of free agency. Teams generally fight to their talent or trade them away for compensation."
Most NBA teams logos and jersey design is uninspired drivel that should've never seen the light of day.   The Nets should've never been able to trade for James Harden.
"&gt;Do you not think Westbrook has been apart of teams better than the 2021 Bucks fuzzy butt scratcher?  Yes he has. Multiple times.  And no, im not comparing competition. Although I think an argument could be made that Westbrook only having made it to 1 finals despite playing with KD, Paul George, or James harden in like what, 8 of the last 10 seasons? kind of says a lot about his ability to be the primary ball handler on a championship team."

"Someone had James Harden in the low 60s, below DAMIAN LILLARD. Some of these are offensively terrible lists."
"A better trade isn't going to pop up.  That's what you guys don't seem to be getting.  You're not going to get a James Harden-esque return for Simmons.  You're not going to get beyond a fringe all-star player.  You're not going 3 unprotected picks, you're not getting multiple pick swaps.  And there more you wait, the worse the results on the court are going to be."
"&gt;Then with the comments towards him (though very warranted) post playoffs just didn’t help.  Do you mean Doc Rivers' comments? I don't recall Morey making any negative comments about Ben. And Rivers was hired before Morey, so that's part of the situation he inherited.  &gt;after they very publicly tried trading Ben  They did? What makes it ""very public""? Last season, there was no reporting of Morey shopping Ben all around, it was just in response to an MVP being available (James Harden) and any public comment Morey made was of the [""We are not trading Ben Simmons""](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/18/philadelphia-76ers-open-trading-ben-simmons-james-harden-rockets) variety. As for shopping Ben this offseason - that came from Ben's request."
"Even if that is James harden, blazers also won’t trade that dumb ass package. Morey must be smoking some good shit"
3 first round picks and the pick swaps.   Dudes looking for a James Harden-esque return
Weird strip clubs? So that’s why James Harden mentioned that on teams he’d like to play for.
I'm gonna have to agree.   Let's take a closer look at the top 20 in tiers  AAA Giannis Durant Curry Lillard Jokic Doncic  AA Harden Kawhi Embiid James Mitchell  A Tatum George A.Davis Zion Beal Trey Jimmy Booker Westbrook
Harden’s been an MVP contender for the last million years man he’s absolutely noticeably better than Embiid. God damn he gets injured once and everyone forgets who tf James Harden is.
James Harden in the playoffs. Multiple 2/11 games while being his teams go to scorer in the most important games
"You can say that for pretty much majority the top 10 current players.   LBJ - age, load managing during games but elite when engaged  Kawhi - load managing and health. Elite when engaged.   James Harden - focuses more on offense but has been shown to be a good post defender and good at playing passing lanes.   KD - Injuries but good at help defense.   Steph - puts in effort on defense but his size and relative lack of athleticism puts him at a disadvantage on-ball. Great at playing passing lanes (lead league in SPG at one point.)  Jokic - Doesn’t have the athletic ability but is okay positionally.   Luka - Neutral defender. Focuses on offense because he is in a heliocentric offense."
"Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden. They all have shown ability to play defense but don’t sometimes because they are old and carry offensive weight."
"&gt;We were also 2-1 down and leading game 4 before Kyrie went down   Sure, in four games that James Harden hadn't played in. I'm sorry, but the only way the Bucks can prove that last year wasn't just a fluke based on getting *extremely* fortunate with injury luck to the other team is to go out and do it again. It's gonna be the same with Phoenix. If last year was for real and not just because everyone else was hurt, then replicating those results should be no problem. Until then there are going to be people who view last year's playoffs with skepticism. Sorry."
"Lmfao no, every other contender does not have two stars. Unless you're equating someone like Ben Simmons with James Harden in which case you're just being insane"
I think almost any player that you put in place for KD on the 2017 2018 2019 Warriors wins 2 rings  From Mehmet Okur to Robert Swift to James Harden
"&gt;I’m not sure how that shows Hardens off ball skills  James Harden won 6th man of the year and for 3 straight seasons played 4th quarter minutes with Westbrook and Durant, won 65 games with CP3, and played with Durant and Kyrie this year and people still don't think he can play off-ball?  And on top of that, lets pretend he can't play off ball, Curry can and is a killer doing it.   To question whether players with the skillset of Harden and Curry could play together is already absurd, but the fact that we've already seen it is even crazier.   I'd wager that Harden + Curry would be even deadlier than Curry + Durant. Harden/Curry as secondary playmaker is absolutely deadly with the Warriors firepower"
Imagine ONLY having Kevin Durant and James Harden as your best players. Maybe they can convince Sacramento to take one of them for Hield.
Wait OKC didn't trade James Harden right?
There has to be a better way to call James Harden overweight than this
"[James Harden: ""It's not disappointing at all.""](https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZch.jpg)"
He is a 7 ft James Harden at times with his shooting ability but this is clear hyperbole.
yeah god forbid JAMES HARDEN AND KEVIN DURANT don't have a third perennial allstar as a teammate poor them
"James Harden for Simmons + stuff is probably one of the bigger ""what if"" trade scenarios. Crazy to think about if that would have went through now."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
James Harden  James Worthy  James Jones  James Johnson  James Lebron
Bruh u think Lebron wouldn’t win a ring if he had Kyrie and James harden on his team lol!!
James “literally “wishes he was Terance Mann” Hitler” Harden
"Paul Pierce, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, and James Harden"
Doncic and Porzingis shooting like playoff James Harden
I will never not laugh at James Harden dancing in that white suit
Luka Doncic’s best comp is James Harden.   Big body guard. Low and long dunker. Step-back 3. Elite court vision. Above average low post defender. Below average perimeter defender. Draws lots of fouls.
"James Harden is far from being one of the ""best iso players ever"". That is disrespectful to many other guys."
Is Embiid the new James Harden or something
"Harden, James, Irving, KD (to an extent), Embiid, Simmons, Pat Bev (jokes) are all shoe ins. Who else?"
James Harden is the best scorer of all time.
"KD is a bitch, Irving is over rated. As a thunder fan we should have drafted Curry over James Harden."
James Harden should have 1 or 2 more mvps
"If Westbrook can't even win a single ring after a career of playing with James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James and Anthony Davis there is no way he escapes the failure label."

"Luka has a bad 3pt? He shot 35% last season without anyone to get him open looks. That's higher than, for example Trae Young, and only slightly worse than James Harden"
James Harden averaged 29/8/11 on 61.3% true shooting. In what world was Westbrook better
I agree with this one. It feels kind of like a Kwame Brown situation where the media is in cahoots with the league to try and stamp that out.  1. They tried to trade him first for James Harden. 2. His head coach threw him under the bus. 3. His costar threw him under the bus. That costar that everyone loves has averaged only 37 games per season (Ben has averaged 55) 4. He is super young this narrative that he sucks cant develop etc he’s only 25.  If Philly wants to rely on one of the most injured stars in a while good luck.
"There's a lot of sources explaining what adjusted plus minus (APM) and regularized adjusted plus minus (RAPM) are, but the same author of this data set I referenced, Ahmed Cheema, has a great explanation in an awesome [article](https://www.thespax.com/nba/calculating-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-for-25-years-of-nba-basketball/) he wrote.  &gt; While easy to understand, the traditional plus-minus metric is very flawed. If an inferior player’s minutes heavily aligned with Curry’s, their plus-minus would look far better than it should just because they get to play with Curry. In other words, base plus-minus does not adjust for the strength of your teammates. Furthermore, while a quick look at on-off plus-minus may let you know that a player is carrying their team, it tells you more about how strong a team’s bench is than anything else. James Harden posted an on-off plus-minus of +9.1 in 2020, which pales in comparison with his +0.2 mark in 2021 (albeit on a small sample size). Did he get that much better? Of course not – the Brooklyn Nets are just far more equipped to play at a high level without Harden on the floor than the Rockets were.  &gt; So, we need to adjust for the other players on the floor. That’s the idea of Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM) – solving the system of linear equations representing the players on a court and the associating plus-minus for their duration on the floor.  &gt; Suppose that we have a matrix called A representing the players on the floor (one column for each player, a value of 1 if they’re on the floor for that stint and a value of 0 otherwise) and a vector b representing the plus-minus per 100 possessions for each stint. We can then solve for x which is a vector of coefficients corresponding to each players representing their on-court value.  &gt; Ax = b  &gt;A^T Ax = A^T b  &gt; (A^(T) A)^-1 A^T Ax = (A^T A)^-1 A^T b  &gt; x = (A^T A)^-1 A^T b  &gt; That’s the adjusted plus-minus solution. As you might anticipate, it has its own drawbacks. Most notably a high degree of variance. This problem can be alleviated with the addition of a filtering term that essentially acts as a penalty for outliers – it converges all values towards zero.  &gt; x = (A^T A + λ*I*)^-1 A^T b  &gt; An optimal lambda value can be found which yields an approximate solution to the original Ax=b problem. This equation is the method used to calculate regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM).  &gt; Notice that at this point, the only stat that has been used is the stint plus-minus for each combination of players on the floor. No assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, etc. Or even points scored by a specific player – just the overall plus-minus in that duration of time.  &gt; Improvements upon RAPM like RPM and RAPTOR incorporate Bayesian priors with box score and tracking stats to give a better prior estimate of player value for the model. Instead of regressing to zero, you can regress to this prior value. This leaves us with two versions of RAPM: non-prior informed RAPM (NPI RAPM) which uses nothing but the lineup metrics, or prior informed RAPM (PI RAPM) which improves the accuracy of the model in small samples by incorporating box score numbers.  &gt; In most of its use cases, NPI RAPM has noticeable weaknesses. People usually want to see the numbers for a single season, which is a relatively small sample size for a regression without a suitable prior. There’s also a lot of variance in small samples because of factors like the three-point shot. A player shooting higher or lower than their average from three-point range in a small sample may have nothing to do with the lineup or the defense, but have a large impact on the result of a regression. Thus, alternatives like EPM and PIPM incorporate luck-adjustments that are make them much more adequate for smaller samples.  &gt; I also utilized a prior to improve the accuracy of the regression. I had initially planned not to do so, but it came to my attention that any long-term RAPM essentially requires some form of prior to account for player aging. Peak Shaquille O’Neal was one of the most unstoppable players in the history of the game. An old 38-year-old version of Shaq was far less of an intimidating force. Both players would be treated the same with NPI RAPM, meaning that 38-year-old Shaq’s teammates would be penalized for playing alongside him because of how great he was in the past. That doesn’t make any sense.  &gt; My initial plan was to incorporate a simple prior based on age. The problem is that all players don’t age on the same curve. Prior studies found that a Bayesian prior based on playtime &amp; team strength is more reliable than age, so I went with that approach in this project. Thus, a player’s minutes per game and a team’s net rating were the only two external statistics used in the regression.  &gt; All that was left was to find an optimal lambda value and then run the ridge regression. Additional measures could certainly be taken to improve the accuracy of the model, such as a luck-adjustment or a different way to treat “garbage time” possessions. For now, I didn’t want to interfere too much unless it was required (like the aforementioned prior).  There are then multiple ways to calculate RAPM. It isn't intended to be a ranking of players but one objective way to evaluate every player given data available on them. Particularly surface level plus minus, but if decided also the incorporation of box score stats (and valuations of those stats) in order to improve the accuracy of smaller sample sizes such as individual seasons. Additionally to account for players' performances fluctuating throughout their careers.  In pursuit of single number evaluations of players these manipulations of plus minus data are especially helpful and applicable to every player regardless of their means of impacting a game; scoring, defending, etc."
I think it’s because Russ is a “system player” and it takes him awhile to get use to the offense and players.   He thrives off plays specifically designed for him on me. Unlike a player like James Harden who could just ISO and score.
James harden is the 3rd greatest shooting guard of all time ahead of Dwyane wade.
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
The average role player in the WNBA is fucking cooking James Harden 1 v 1
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
"-The NBA contracts need to change in some way that doesn’t allow players to secure a bag and then force themselves out. James Harden or Ben Simmons wanting out is fine by me but there has to be some sort of disadvantage to leaving your team like that. It just seems too lopsided in the players favor.  -Grayson Allen to the bucks was one of the best off-season acquisitions. As a SEC basketball fan I don’t like him but damn, he can play D shoot 3s and doesn’t commit costly turnovers. I would say he might be the 3rd most important acquisition behind DeMar and Lowry.  -speaking of DeMar, no one talks about how he just got a career high in assists last season because he was in SA. He is an all star.   -Brandon Ingram and Zion don’t work well together.  -the second half Anthony Edwards rookie season showed he’s most likely all-star bound sooner rather than later  -Russ was right about P Bev. He’s just running around fooling everyone. He doesn’t really bring anything to a team.  -Dwight Howard was elite in Charlotte"
"James harden is very overrated. Like he’s an all star please don’t get me wrong in that. But r/nba is so deeply far up his ass it’s ridiculous. I think this year, after seeing how much he relied on foul baiting that will calm down slightly but still this sub would have you think he’s the best player since Jordan"
"James/Curry/Durant/Antetokounmpo/Leonard.  Lillard can still get there, but clock is ticking. Think the door has shut on Harden becoming one."
"you know, for all that the shenanigans that James Harden is known for-- flopping and foul baiting and all that-- I don't think I've ever seen him do something *dirty*"
I think Harden is best suited for a bench role at this point in his career. He can potentially show shades of the old James Harden but only in 5-6 minutes spurts. It’s unfortunate but Father Time is undefeated
Katner what toxic whyte supremcaist telling other nations what to do.  Maybe he needs to look into the human abuses in the USA first before he opens his hypocritical mouf.  CIA puppet he is.  This is why James harden didnt want to be traded to 76ers for Simmons.  He didn't want to play for that toxic GM.   He is happy with Asian owner Nets team.  coz Harden's been to China and loves China.  Unlike Kanter who's never been to China.
No. We tried to get James Harden.

"Dame doin his best ""James Harden I want to be traded"" impression."
Trying to acquire James Harden != trying to trade Simmons.
"james harden took a box of scraps to 6 games against the Spurs. im sure he could destroy the east given lebron’s teammates. In the end the only thing stopping Harden’s path was  OKC POR GSW GSW SAS GSW GSW LAL  were it not for the warriors, him and eric gordon would be the goat backcourt"
Ok? He's James harden
"Listen all I’m saying is, 4 games in, James Harden has 3 free throws a game.  He averaged 10+ ever since he was traded to Houston"
Is it time to start worrying about James Harden?
James Harden has been bad at the beginning of the season most years.   If James Harden is below a 20ppg (barring an injury soon) i will literally suck a dick.
It's time to be legitimately concerned about James Harden /s
He's asking a hypothetical question. I think it does coz the narrative shifts from James Harden is robbed to James Harden  is only an all star because he foul draws a lot.
It would be shocking if James Harden doesn't average at least 20ppg this season
James Harden is kinda mid right now
"Well sure, but he was injured in June and still came back to play. My point is that age makes it take longer to get into peak shape and game play and that peak also declines with age especially depending on how you play. James Harden being an explosive, bulky player with heavy usage may be more likely to be affected by that compared to his peers. Doesn't mean he still won't get better in the next few weeks, but he might not have had the same issues five years ago is all I'm saying."
Lol delusional. Most overrated player of all time. Better than James Harden? Absolutely ridiculous.
Is it time to be genuinely concerned about James Harden?
Not just that though. If a person in a normal career gets fired they can be replaced. You can’t teach someone to be James Harden or Ben Simmons.
Boohoo. They don't grow James Harden on trees. Yes you're at his mercy. Get over it.
James Harden didn't want to play with Chris Paul anymore.
"The only time Simmons got shopped was last season when James Harden was on the market. And besides, even if he got shopped that doesn’t justify his behaviour, he’s not the first player to ever be shopped. Guys like CJ McCollum are in the trade rumours every 2 weeks but they still act professional and show up. Ben is acting like he’s the only player to have ever been shopped by their team in history"
I don't think so. This is an easy give for the players association because it will affect so few players. The majority of players in the union are not James Harden or Ben Simmons.
My only takeaway is James Harden hates big men and thinks they all deserve the min
Draymond has missed more FTs this season than James Harden has FT attempts
"James Harden took savvy too far and bastardized the game to the point that new rules had to implemented in order to keep the game watchable and enjoyable. The NBA did the right thing by adding these rules and emphasizing them. They're also doing the right by targeting Harden. He set the example that caused many other players to follow his lead and his bullshit needs to be curbed completely.  Obviously, Steve Nash needs to stick up for his player and try to get him calls. In this situation, though, he should be ignored."
"&gt; by yanking him when he pulls stuff like this  It's James Harden, the dude who tries to yank their arm back is definitely getting a flagrant 2."
Right so no one has violated the contract. James Harden is still on the same contract. It was just traded to another team.
"Okay, fine, whatever, James Harden played just as hard until he got traded. That wasn’t the point of my comment so who cares"
&gt;I can loaf around and half-ass it in games a la James Harden  He averaged 24.8/5.1/10.4   After being traded to Brooklyn he averaged 24.6/8.5/10.9  This narrative is so fucking dumb.
"I don't think that solves the issue, because it doesn't change the underlying incentives. Imagine a rule were in place that if a player with at least 2 years left under contract demands a trade, the team is able to withhold X% of their salary (or some other punitive measure).  If I'm a player in this situation, all I have to do is everything which indicates I want a trade *except for* actually requesting a trade. As long as I know what I'm doing, and the team knows what I'm doing, I can loaf around and half-ass it in games a la James Harden and the team will be forced to trade me eventually. Or I'm suffering from *general soreness* and I have to sit 60-70% of games. But technically I never said anything about wanting a trade, so if the team withholds any salary, they've breached contract."
Every report is that Ben requested a trade not sure what you're talking about. The only thing they tried to do was trade him for James Harden (something anyone with a working brain would try to do) during the season.
"oh god forbid he got shopped for fucking JAMES HARDEN. How big does your ego have to be to be offended at the idea of being traded for a top 5 player in the league. Every single person in the world would attempt to trade Ben Simmons for James Harden and if the sixers didn't do that it would have been malpractice. Oh, and quite frankly I would rather my GM be honest with me about trade negotiations than lie to my face and tell me it's all good there's no chance that you'll be traded."
"Assuming based on your flair you’re talking about Steph. I agree that he doesn’t get the calls he used to get but come on now, you can’t expect anyone to feel bad for the Warriors or their fans. Steph isn’t exactly innocent in this situation either. I will give you that there’s plenty of other players who have dipped their toes in this pool but James Harden was the guy doing backflips off the diving board lol"
"The best part is everyone in the entire world would try to trade ben simmons for james harden. The media talks like he was shopped for scrapes last year. They were trying to trade for a top 5 player in the league, it would have been malpractice to not make that offer to houston."
"I think 5 year deals protect the team, if you’re trading for James Harden you get some additional security with the added years that he’ll remain on your team and not bolt in FA during that time.   Likewise it’s injury protection for superstar players who generally make far less than they generated for league owners/NBA during their rookie contract."
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."
"James ran Westbrook out of town, and CP3, and Dwight Howard…. This team tried 3 times to build around Harden, and typically within a year Harden would be over it and demand they start over.  He owns a lot of the blame."
"Honestly yeah, but that's not why he's struggled. He's just out of shape right now and also spent most of the off-season rehabbing. Nash said he couldn't even fully play basketball until training camp this year.  In a month or two he'll be back to being James Harden"
"Irving, James Harden, Durant, Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap, Patty Mills, Aldridge. I can’t remember anyone else :/"
"&gt; And the 6ers tried to trade Simmons  For James fucking Harden. This is a business, and trades are part of that  &gt;  This narrative is tiring. He was coddled the entire year, specifically by Doc."
Harden was with the Rockets for 8 years that's more than LeBron or KD. How long did you want James to stay in Houston? Forever? If you're gonna set a standard at least be consistent.
"&gt;“James Harden took the money and said f— you and gave Houston the middle finger,”  pretty sure it was the other way around when ferttita asked harden after years of carrying pretty decent rosters to the brink against the greatest team of all time to then carry the corpse of john wall and christian wood +a bunch of g-leaguers to the same success after firing the GM that helped enable harden to achieve that success"
"unexpected to James Harden, perhaps."
"Nobody on the planet can tell in real time whether someone has actually made contact on a James Harden 3, because he will simulate contact in 100% of instances where someone plays legitimate defense on a 3."
"Dangling him for checks notes James harden, lmao y’all narratives on this sub are hilarious I love laughing at the dumb shit y’all say"
Aww poor james harden 🥲
"Yeah poor James Harden. He only had Dwight, CP3 and Westbrook as teammates."
"Yep. Harden gave them almost a decade of elite basketball. The owner ran Morey, D'Antoni, and Westbrook out of town so James dipped also."
He doesn't think that. He is being put into that role. Luke for whatever fucking reason is having him be in that role and putting him in as a playmaker. He is trying to make Buddy into James Harden when that's not his bag.   If Kerr started having Klay be the main ball handler and playmaker it would be absolutely bonkers and everyone would think he had a stroke or something.
"I don't see how it's salty or unserious.  Why would you as a referee ever give James Harden the benefit of the doubt on a call?  If you build up a reputation as a hothead, you get techs.  If you build up a reputation as a bullshitter, then the refs will (and should) think that you're bullshitting them.  He has nobody to blame but himself, he's the only person who made his reputation that way."
"Bruh I’m not even bout to do that I’m ngl. I’m barely doing my job rn, I’m not about to do one for you lol. I don’t even know how to do time stamps. Here’s the links. You can watch it for yourself and gather your own opinion.   Here is NFH ball that shows all James Harden Possessions: https://youtu.be/59Klq23NqKU Here is Kenny for real breaking down a few of the calls Harden is asking to get: https://youtu.be/QIvHOewiDUc Nash postgame: https://youtu.be/-F_oabYXlIo"
Is it me or are the referees really weird this year not only relating to James harden like a lot of superstars are not getting 70% of those iffy calls it’s more of 50/50 now
"Direct quote? It’s on video. He could answered truthfully and said James has to adjust and just play better. He is complaining that James isn’t getting calls and says he should keep doing it bc eventually the refs are going to give it to him. Kenny for real on YT has a video and is breaking down Hardens “questionable” calls and Harden is still trying that same BS. I watched the interview, game and video breakdown before commenting. You just a fanboy commenting bc you like somebody."
"What is he gonna do? What is he gonna do that he wasn't able to do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal?   He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's gonna win games for sure but how much will it matter in the playoffs when this is the same Lakers team that sagged off of him during the Bubble Run.  The only way I see him get busy is when you make him the 6th man and he plays with Monk, Melo, Dwight and Ariza while AD and LeBron are on the bench. Even then his shooting inability is a detriment to winning basketball. Even then, I don't think that's possible coz why you paying this dude who never learns $40M as the 6th man."
My lineup of these players would be this:  PG: Ben Simmons and Steph Curry(pretty obvious)  SG: James Harden and Jrue Holiday(Again pretty obvious)  SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)   PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)  C: Jokic and Embiid(Great playmaker meh defender vs. great defender meh playmaker)
That means the rules are doing its job. Nobody is paying to see James Harden sit an the free throw line all game.
"I watched a ton of Lebron James games in 2017-2018 and the one thing that kept sticking out to me was that he was not going out of his way to make great plays. He racked up a lot of points from mid-range jump shots and that isn't really impressive.   Harden did it all - 3 point shots, dunk in your face, great passer, fast paced player, etc."
People used to call Lebron Leflop until a certain someone started having MVP caliber seasons.  Not gonna say any names *cough* James Harden.
"wholy shit, I hate James Harden :O"
Lol You can't even find james harden doing it 5 times

"Harden's step back, jump forward 3s are absolutely foul hunting and  a huge reason why he has almost 100 more 3 point fouls than any other TEAM since he entered the league.    https://netswire.usatoday.com/2021/09/01/james-harden-has-drawn-more-3-point-fouls-than-any-team-since-2009/"
It's weird that James Harden looks older than his father
"Same, I think they’re a little more tolerable post-James Harden but still hard for me to watch"
"Jesus fucking Christ, that's just an absurd statistic even for well renowned foul terrorist James Harden"
"Yeah, that's vintage James Harden"
Word. Couldn't agree more. Fuck James harden
Cade is way less of an athlete than the Penny i remember from Orlando. But a better shooter.     I would say Cade is a homeless mans Luka Donćic/ James Harden. He could get a lot closer but he looks more like them than Penny IMHO.
"Fuck James Harden, he earned this."

"2017-2018 WCF Warriors vs Rockets:   James Harden FTA: 52  Steph Curry FTA: 14  Games 5-7:   Curry FTA: 5(0 in games 6&amp;7); Harden FTA: 26  2018-2019 WCSF Warriors vs Rockets:  James Harden FTA: 61  Steph Curry FTA: 31  Damn Steph was really getting those calls over Harden huh? Obviously not all of them were flops for Harden, but his game suffers more than Steph because he relies on getting to the line. Steph flops from time to time, but Harden is the poster boy of this rule for good reason."
Gotta prove to the fans the rule change is working. Sucks for James “poster child” Harden
Maybe he is James Harden
i think you're describing James Harden
James Harden died so DeRozan can fly
James Harden is smiling from above
DeMar getting sent to the line to make up for a poor shooting night like it's 2018 and his names James Harden
"Are the only options playing KD and Harden or trotting out Carter, Harris, Bembry, Mills, and Aldridge? The Nets immediately lose the lead and the momentum every time Nash throws those 5 out there. There's not a single PG or playmaker in there and they're *awful* on D and the boards. Millsap can't get 3 minutes of run? James Johnson? Hell, Sharpe or Cam? Stagger KD and James a bit more. Once you realize how much of a disaster that lineup is, you have to at least *try* something else."
"It’s subjective. I think if you take Curry away from the warriors and KD away from the Nets, the warriors drop off more dramatically because the nets have **James Harden.**"
I take from this that James Harden made the NBA better to watch 👍🏽
James Harden is the best player on the Nets!
the guy with the better playmaking is gonna play the position that facilitates and the guy that scored better is gonna play the position meant for scoring😭 same shit w brooklyn james harden is more built for shooting guard but kyrie plays it
"james harden is officially back y’all  gg pelicans, played hard"
So what it comes down to for the Nets is this:  1) Is it a tight game in the last two minutes?  2) Does the other team have Kevin Durant or James Harden?
"Proud to have been in the “He’s James Harden, he will be fine” group"
JAMES HARDEN WITH DA DAGGER
Who the fuck let James Harden and KD be on the same team this shit isn't fair lmao
He's got James fucking Harden as his sidekick lol. That's not just a regular right hand man
"&gt;It's apples and oranges. Those Kobe teams won at a very small time. The Durant warriors would probably destroy them.   I think you're missing my point. Kobe accomplished the same amount as KD with a far less talented team.   &gt; Also you're leaving out Andre Bynum who was pretty damn good in those days.  What? Andrew Bynum was a role player on those teams and he missed the entire 2008 postseason. He was a good rim protector but he's not Draymond, Klay level good.   &gt;Durant is every bit as good as Kobe ever was. There is a lot of revisionist history about Kobe, but look at the numbers.  Kobe destroys KD in defense and it's not even close. It's much easier to score now than it was during Kobe's era. I also think Kobe's perceived 'inefficiency' is really overblown. Many people will cite 'oh Durant was a more efficient ISO scorer than Kobe ever was.' This is when you need to look at the tale of the tape as opposed to advanced metrics or statistics because they can't tell you the whole story.  All ISO efficient scorers this league have one important luxury that players back then really did not: the rate at which a big man is switched onto them.  It is very rare now for teams to run an ISO without a PNR to get a big or mismatch onto the player ISO-Scoring. How often do you see a team run a switch for Durant, Harden, Curry, or LeBron to get their primary defender off of them? Just take a look at the 2016 Game 5 or 6 highlights that LeBron had. They forced the switch repeatedly so that LeBron could ISO against a big. You could even watch James Harden's recent explosion on the Cavs where the big (Tristan Thompson) was switched onto him repeatedly.  This big vs. guard ISO wasn't as prominent back then for one simple reason: the bigs back then couldn't stretch the floor for 3 points.  When guarding against a big setting a PNR before the three point explosion, you could live with a player scoring a given 2 points if you trapped the ball-handler. Now, you can't simply because 3 points, despite just being one point greater will add up terribly in a game. Teams nowadays do not have the luxury of being able to trap the ball handler when the big setting the pick can shoot the 3 ball. Ironically, this is how Golden State went on an absolute tear last year. Everytime they had forced it out of Curry's hands in the PNR with Green, there was a three on four, which back then would have led to a 2 point score; instead they blew games open with repeated 3 point bombs.  In the previous eras, ISOs were run with the primary scorer being guarded by the primary defender, whether that be Bruce Bowen, Doug Christie, etc. So when you consider that Kobe's points were predicated on playing one on one against their best defender, as opposed to a slower big, then you hold his shooting percentages, whether advanced or just regular FG% in higher regard.   &gt;He didn't rack up multiple MVPs. He was never this dominant force that could just carry a team to greatness.  KD doesn't have multiple MVPs either. Kobe could carry a team much more than KD can. Gasol was good but he's no unanimous MVP, not to mention Klay, Draymond, and Iggy.   &gt;Kobe was never at any point the best player in the league. For three of his titles he wasnt the best player on his team.  I'd say he was the best from 2006-2010. You could argue that Kobe was just as good as Shaq in 01.   &gt; Those warriors were better with Durant than they would have been with Kobe. No question.  Nah. Fact is Durant had to join the most stacked team in NBA history to even win a ring. Kobe's 2008-2010 run is better than anything KD has done. He averaged 30/6/6 on 57% TS in the playoffs, played excellent defense, made 3 straight Finals, and won 2 FMVPs. And this includes 2010 when he was banged the hell up. KD needs to prove he can win without the most stacked team in NBA history before he passes Kobe."
"Grayson ""James Harden"" Allen"
That would be so cool. Warriors v Kevin Durant and one of their 2 biggest rivals in James Harden.
"No the problem was that there are very few teams that need or want a Lin type scorer to take 20 shots per game. The Knicks did at the time because of all the injuries (and Melo was out). Like he could def put him numbers if you just let him run the pick and roll 30 times a game like D'antoni does, but most teams don't want that.   He went to Houston afterwards and they immediately traded for James Harden, so of course you'd let James Harden ISO more vs. letting Lin run PnRs all day. Same deal when he went to Charlotte.  TL:DR - he was a good scorer when allowed to run PnRs all day, but that's not something most teams are looking for."
"I mean, James Harden and Kevin Durant have only played 22 games with one another on the Nets. There's not a whole lot of data to pull from there."
that the rockets james harden trade wasn’t bad
"Yes he uses graphs, statistics and fun videos of what ifs so you can understand how good a player is. One of his most recent interesting videos was learning how the raptors 2013 pick was supposed to be giannas,    but they traded it a long time ago and were begging for it back because only two people knew about giannas full potential   That trade the raptors did turned James harden into a Houston rockets, Giannas in Milwaukee bucks. The raptors 2019 NBA Champions lol. He really helps you understand the importance of each player past and present.  If you ever watched flight reacts, you will know about him"
Kyrie has never been better than James Harden
"BBRef is also notoriously horrible at judging defense which is a big part of his contribution  They had JAMES HARDEN as a positive defender every year of his career(he's not as bad now, but before like 2018 he was absolutely atrocious) according to BPM"
James Harden had one of the most efficient seasons ever why are you implying his wasn't? And it's a multitude of factors
"How were Russell westbrook, Derrick rose, James Harden, or Allen iverson MVPs if that were the case? What about Garnett or Kobe in 08?"
"I remember James Harden rookie year.  He did some crazy shit and showed glimpses.  I think when he won 6moy was when people knew if he had his own team, he would go off and he did."
"Curry. A lot of people will point to Harden avg more assists but Curry is so much better off the ball and way more efficient. He also has insane gravity and gets a lot of hockey assists. People score just from the attention he draws so the assists don’t always show up but his impact on an offense far exceeds Harden’s. Also, his game isn’t so dependent on free throws like James. He’s avg 18 on 40% shooting because he can’t get 10-15 fts per game while Steph is having an MVP type season so far. Steph has always been more efficient &amp; a better leader/ playoff performer. I’m taking Curry no question!"
no. there were many valid trades for him but the sixers wanted a james harden level player back. kyrie irving was the only one available

"For me it was Game 4 vs the Mavericks in 2021. The Mavs were up 81-68 going into the 4th, and then Harden looked completely unstoppable down the stretch as OKC outscored the Mavs 35-16 and came back to win 103-97.  &gt;&gt; Oklahoma City kept picking and rolling, and James Harden kept making plays.  &gt;&gt; Instead of giving in and being content going home for a Game 5, the Thunder now are waiting for their next series. Oklahoma City rallied for a 103-97 victory on Saturday night to complete a first-round series sweep of the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks.  &gt;&gt; Harden scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, including seven in a row and nine in the Thunder's 12-0 run after they trailed by 13 points with 9:44 left.  &gt;&gt; ""I got into attack mode,"" Harden said. ""I was determined to make plays.""  &gt;&gt; After the Harden-fueled surge over 3 minutes got the Thunder within a point, they finally took the lead -- and kept it -- when Russell Westbrook stole the ball from Dirk Nowitzki and passed to Serge Ibaka for a two-handed slam that made it 92-91 with 5:17 left.  &gt;&gt; ""He beat us in individual drives, beat us in pick and rolls. He got up a head of steam and was great,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said of Harden. ""We tried everything, five or six different coverages going. We needed to be better but it was more about how good he was.""  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201205050DAL.html  https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/320505006"
"Love how you are getting downvoted  This is a distraction to the team despite their record  All the players would much rather have a guy that can contribute than a constant media shit-storm  The fans will never accept Ben back and if somehow both parties agree to let the guy play the fans will crucify him  If the team decides he can just sit in street clothes it will also be a distraction bc the fans will harass him. No matter how much the players hate Simmons they arent going to sit by and listen to that shit.  There has been precedent for issues like this, Lakers paid Luol Deng 17M to sit at home instead of even showing up for practice.  Simmons already has 1/4 of his salary paid (8M) out of 33M  That's a pretty substantial loss from the pockets of the owners.  All this shit doesnt make sense - if the Celtics rumor is true, the Sixers need to trade him Jaylen Brown ASAP before it's too late.  Celtics string together a nice little win streak and Brad Stevens will never trade him.  As for all the people in this thread saying that the players will not have Simmons back during the next CBA - it's quite the opposite.  NBA teams can make promises and rescind them without any consequences.  Look at Blake Griffin, they hung a fake banner with his name on it and said he will be part of the franchise forever. They even compared him to MLK in a fucking video presentation.  Shortly after they sent him to one of the worst teams in the league in a city that is cold (and shitty when compared to living in LA).  Players took note of that. Yeh Blake got paid, but he signed his big deal with the expectation that he would stay in LA. Otherwise he would have chosen a different team that actually wanted him.  The Clippers ended up on top in that deal at the expense of Blake Griffin.  So players will think, why shouldnt we support Ben when owners can trade players for no reason - sometimes just to clear cap space.  To me, both parties look terrible in this situation, but Simmons asked to be traded 4+ months ago. In the history of the NBA when has this happened, maybe with Vince Carter or Alonzo Mourning, but i cant think of any other instance.  People's memories are short - they seem to forget how badly Kobe fucked over a small market team by forcing a trade from the Hornets to the Lakers.   Simmons is a piece of shit for not working on his game but not for requesting a trade - his coach and fellow superstar threw him under the bus and basically blamed the series loss on Simmons. And while Simmons lack of offense in the 4th destroyed the Sixers, he did play some pretty solid defense throughout the playoffs.  Morey needs to trade Ben, get some value back, and both parties need to move forward.  As for the whole mental health argument, it is valid. No one can quantify mental health, unlike Kawhi's injury where multiple doctors cleared him and he still refused to report - again people's memories are short. Kawhi was the team's only superstar at that point and he tried over and over to force a trade out of San Antonio.  Being forced to play in a city that hates your guts (and has some of the harshest fans in the league), being forced to play with teammates and a coach that blamed you for the loss in the playoffs (despite it being a team sport - as if he was the only one to blame for losing to an inferior team) - all those things can take a toll on someone and make them depressed.  Funny how everyone takes Love seriously when he says he is depressed despite being in one of the best roles in the league - multiple finals trips, a championship, while playing next to LeBron James. If Love can be depressed in that great situation, why cant Ben Simmons be depressed or mentally distraught when the whole city of Philadelphia, his coach, and his teammates hates his guts.  Im not even a Sixers fan or a Sixers hater, Pistons / Lakers fan here, but what they are putting Simmons thru is straight bullshit.  If Morey hadnt held off on trading his younger players, he could have gotten Harden for Simmons + youth/picks and with the way the playoffs went last year the Sixers most likely would have won a championship.  Doc Rivers and Embiid tanked his value instead of praising him for his positives - they easily could have said ""Everyone has a rough series, but Ben Simmons is a great talented player and he will come back stronger next season"" But they didnt and now his value is shit and that's on nobody but Morey and the Sixers coach/Embiid.  Trade the motherfucker and move forward.  People are right, the players will throw a fit in the next CBA meeting, but it will be in favor of Simmons. No one is going to throw a player under the bus for wanting to leave a bad situation.  Surprised so much hate and vitriole is being directed at Simmons when there have been 100s of players who collected checks for sitting at home and not even bother contributing.  Even if the Sixers are the #1 seed in the East going into the All-Star break it just doesnt make sense not to get some kind of value for Simmons. Whoever they get back will help reduce the minutes of their top players, thus saving them and their health for the playoffs.  Ill get downvoted but i dont give a fuck"
Why would you want them to award him MVP when there’s better candidates? What was his nearest miss….2018? When James Harden averaged 30 a game and won 66 games in the same conference as the KD Warriors…while Lebron was on a 4th seed. Harden wasn’t a better player than Lebron but Harden fit the clear historical MVP criteria to a T unlike Lebron (best stats on a top 2-3 seed with context such as superteam/injuries included)
"james harden is not a superstar   &amp;#x200B;  he is a product of an era where the nba and networks decided that stats and offense would mean more views, nobody play d and they say that that wasnt producing ratings so decided to just go all out on offense , thats how james harden average thirty points a game, by foul baiting and the refs where giving him those ft , because the nba was letting him cheat the game so the nba could get more fans in the stands, he is a good offensive player but would not survive in the 90's because he really isnt a great overall player  &amp;#x200B;  you calling him a superstar is funny because he is really not , he is just a foul baiting player that got lukcy the nba wanted to change their style of play to chucking threes , high scoring games, youtube algtrritm highlights that you see now a days,   &amp;#x200B;  he is not a special player any star player like micheal redd and kevin marting could do what he is doing if the nba allowed it"
"Besides James Harden, Simmon was never in any other trade discussions.   He was the one who requested the trade after that playoff series"
"It really hasn't been a slippery slope. Most of the issue is due to unprofessional management.   When Anthony Davis let it be known he wasn't going to re-sign in free agency and requested a trade, the Pelicans should've been grateful AD did them the kindness of letting them know with plenty of time left on his contract so they could work out a deal where both parties came out ahead. Instead Dell Demps decided to throw a tantrum and ultimately got fired because of it.   Kawhi let the spurs know and Pop threw a tantrum too. They ultimately got a couple of years of Derozan Instead of Brandon Ingram long term because of Pop's lack of professionalism.   The Rockets let James Harden's teammate walk in free agency or traded them away, they let his coach go, his GM go, and were surprised when James Harden didn't want to have a 50% usage rate as a 32 year old. You can't drain all the life out of a player and complain he's playing lifelessly.   I would argue Simmons is the only guy here that's behaving unprofessionally. Simmons isn't fully at fault here either. Why did Doc have to air our dirty laundry by saying he wasn't sure if Simmons was a championship caliber PG? You're not under oath, a-hole. Just fucking lie. ""Ben Simmons is the greatest PG to have ever walk the earth."" How hard is that? Tell him to fix face he's gotta switch positions, but don't do that shit in public. And why didn't Morey trade him? Dude's been in every possible trade rumor since Morey took over. At some point you gotta just deal the guy. This is what happens when it's both parties that behave unprofessionally. Usually, it's only the front offices, so it typically doesn't get this messy."
"""His franchise openly tried to trade him""  If being in trade talks for James Harden causes issues they should never have been a professional athlete. It's part of the job."
Your 5th point made me think of James harden in Houston
Because James Harden is playing like a fringe All-Star and not *James Harden*
"We know that based on like 6 games together? Idk man, in 2019 Russ averaged 27 7 and 7 playing with James Harden and a small ball lineup, he cut down his threes like halfway through the season and was a maniac at the rim.   Lakers have the flexibility to run that kind of lineup with lebron playing the Harden role and and AD as PJ Tucker.   The appeal of pulling that off is way better than Buddy Hield imo."
 he has trained James Harden and Joel Embiid. Ok
Jimmy out here catching strays. Are we sure OP isn't James Harden?
"That implies that he’s broken out of it when he hasn’t.   Even in these passed 5 games, his PPG has been 17, 14, 28, 13, 16. Thats not James Harden the superstar."
"&gt; James Harden has not been superstar help  Oh he'll be one give it a few games. You can't be deadass serious believing that the whole season. I know the tweet saying ""Harden will be a rule change away from being Andrew Wiggins"" is looking to come true but with his talent, there's no way that doesn't happen.   &gt; Draymond should be an all star this year  After people really believing he's a triple single scrub, now all of a sudden he's an all star? Draymond is the most schrodinger's all star ever. People just wishy washy declare scrub/all star in order to fit their narrative."
James Harden has not been superstar help. And Draymond should be an all star this year.

James harden hasnt been critical at all
yeah cause our superstar point guard kevin porter jr thinks hes james harden
Our coach thought PJ Tucker handling the ball is a good idea and James harden should move off ball so PJ can run point lmaoooooo
I mean he’s literally playing with 5 shooters on the floor at a time AND a James fucking Harden  You’re acting like he’s on the pistons lol
Why would Minnesota want pascal?  They should want assets and reduced costs.   Raptors can offer a clean slate financially and a James Harden level package of picks.
*Dwight exists*  *James Harden at the line*
"Bruh take that +29 out of here this man averaged less points than 6, yes I said 6 hawks players. Less points than Seth curry who is a journeyman player, 30% from the line and he thinks he doesn't deserve any blame. He lost that series when teams know they can win if the game is close by sending you to the line you're not a positive.   Lmfaooooo like Idk why you're dickriding Simmons so hard he's in the wrong and the fact that you keep saying the sixers thrashed him after is hilarious considering they atleast had enough loyalty to not trade him for James harden who would've improved the sixer immensely"
Heat fans rn: Tyler herro &gt;&gt; James harden
"James Harden, Trae Young, and now Damian Lillard are the most vocal critics against the new rule changes.  I for one, am shocked"
"Now I think KD could be this efficient without any talent around him, but keep in mind he's still playing with MVP James Harden who surely carries his own gravity, at least from his beard."
He’s a 19 year that has more points in a game this year than James harden has; he’s far from a laughing stock
What's weird about this guy acting like Ben Shapiro with (I'd assume) a James Harden boner? Idk it seems pretty self evidently weird  Of course there are double standards between players. People like Giannis. People don't like Harden. People complain when a bad no call happens to Giannis. People celebrate when it happens to Harden. Doesn't make this guy less weird for obsessing over it
I thought we wasn’t calling hooks this year or is that just a James harden rule?
I'm very tired of the Nets circlejerk on here. You ask anybody in real life about James Harden and they'll tell you he's a damn good player.
"Almost as guardable as James harden now. James entire arsenal is the between the legs dribble to drive or step back, and now since defense has clamped up so has James hardens chances at still being a top player"
I think the new rule changes are God's way of punishing James Harden for what he did to Houston.
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."

James Harden punching the air rn
James Harden was the best offensive player in the NBA from 2016-2020
I find videos of offensive fouls for foul baiting more entertaining than watching James Harden play the last few years. He is a truly great player and I assume he will figure it out but the officiating change has been such a good move by the NBA so far
For James fucking harden
"I get what you're saying for sure, but if Morey wants to leave Philly, all he has to do is resign and he's out. That's what he did in Houston. If Ben wants to leave Philly there's only two options; he retires, or gets traded.    Clearly he's not going to retire, so trading is the only outcome, and Morey seems to have been overplaying his hand at every stage in the process. If offers for CJ McCollum or Brogdon were actually on the table and he didn't take them, that's a mistake on his part.   Keeping your players happy is a part of the job of a GM, and if the situation gets to the point where it's this messy and public, the value is going to be low. Just because a player is an all-star doesn't mean you're going to get that level of return back, look at the return for Vince Carter or the return for James Harden.   I don't think it's reasonable to expect Ben to have returned to play this year, and while the whole injury/mental health  battles aren't ideal, it's really all just posturing and positioning for a trade.   And I think it's a little odd how people won't hesitate to say Ben is 'broken' and 'mentally weak', but the second mental health is brought into the conversation it's an 'excuse'. But that's neither here nor there...."
Lukewarm Take: Cleveland Cavaliers won the James Harden trade.
Yea its important to find middle ground. While I agree with your sentiment even as a James Harden fan the game is far more pleasing to watch officiated like this  I believe Harden and Dame's problems lie more so with injuries they sustained last year but they should focus on adapting that whining about calls
James Harden would not like you.
Shoulda taken the James harden deal. Or the warriors picks.
Love it. I’m in Brooklyn and I can see Kevin fucking Durant and James Harden still for 10 bucks. Only a little more expensive than the (very fun) Dlo years
"I'm not siding with Simmons. He should have reported to training camp and practice. Squashed his beef with Embiid and played this season. He may still insists on getting traded with the front office, but be professional and play while doing it. Take James Harden in Houston for example, he made it known that he wants to be traded, but he show up and played. So Simmons is being very unprofessional.  However, I don't like that Morey is purposely making the situation worse. Just trade the dude, take the loss, and get the drama over with. He may think it's all business and nothing personal, but the way it is seems like he is taking it personal and trying to make life hell for Simmons. Sixers still have Embiid, Harris, Curry, Green, Maxey, Thybulle, and Milton. Get picks for Simmons plus a secondary star player like McCollum, Malcom Brogdon, Wiggins, Jeremy Grant, Harrison Barnes, etc, and use that to trade for better talent when one becomes available, maybe Lillard next year when Portland gets bounced early in the Playoffs again and the Billups experience isn't living up to the promise."
"I'm talking about the PG trade from Indiana to OKC.    Kawhi, Kyrie, and AD were all available even if they had just been 1 or 2 season rentals. 1 season of Kawhi or AD is better than anything Dame has ever had.    Harden's list [included the Blazers](https://sports.yahoo.com/james-harden-latest-trade-list-013007681.html)"
"Oof, bruh, that is not how contracts work. It's a legally binding document, not just a ""piece of paper that can be broken."" And Simmons doesn't want to break his contract, cause there is zero chance any team he wants to go to would sign him on a new one anywhere near what he's already locked in at. He thinks he's fucking James Harden with all the dick swinging him and Rich Paul are doing here, but he just shit the bed in the playoffs and his attitude fucking sucks."
"So? Like he got his feelings hurt because Sixers wanted to trade him for James flippin' Harden?   Part of the business, he knew this coming into NBA."
"They're have decreased a little bit this season, look at James harden"
"The Nets. The defense is much better this season so we don’t need to score 120+ to win games. Our biggest issue right now is that James Harden isn’t playing like he usually does. When he plays more aggressively it creates better opportunities for the rest of the team.  I can’t see this Lakers team playing good defense with the guys they have. They have to rely on scoring to win games, and that’s an issue when their 2 best players are in and out of the lineups and with Russ playing the way he is."
"Lakers have structural problems.  Nets just need James Harden to stop trying to cheat, and to be one of the best scorers of the last 20 years that he is."
"As much as you hate it, I can assure you 99% of the viewers are loving how the league is doing rn  Most foul baiters are the one complaining. Everyone knew this was coming long before the season started. Steph tried to draw fouls on one of his 3 point during the preseason but there was no call. After that game, there were instances where he looked like he was about to jump into a defender but decided not too. If youre getting paid millions, youre expected to adapt.  Same goes for James Harden and his arm hooking lmao  And also, you seem the only viewer whos complaining and hating the rule change so far."
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
"Unlike virtually anyone mentioned as a replacement for Dame on the list, Dame has played on a small-market team his entire career and without any fellow stars.  Dwight has played alongside Lebron, Kobe, James Harden, Vince Carter, etc.  Kyrie's teammates and teams have a similar profile.  Paul George has played with Kawhi, Westbrook, and Dame's career stats are simply better.  Dame's best teammates ever were Lamarcus Aldridge for 3 seasons and CJ.  To do what he's been able to do in Portland without other weapons to spread the defense is absolutely insane."
"first, ""this generations _____"" as your describing seems pretty weird, generations in basketball fans come ups are somewhat small, we've had years where fans growing up adored Kobe, and then we had LeBron for years after that, Steph has been relevant the most recently  second, this generations _____ isn't determined at all by impact of a player on the league. if thats your qualification, I think it's most obviously harden the most impactful player in basketball history. he's had multiple rule changes specifically because of his dribbling moves taking advtange of the rule itself, we had mass flopping and baiting for fouls that has ran rampant for years, Steph opening night not getting that embarrassing foul bait shot, the shot and the no call is all a result of James harden.    Also, there was definitely years of players coming up and practicing their hesi pull up to be like KD, and its weird to be like yeah look at this impact on a player drafted like 2 years later in Dame"
Tyrese Maxey might as well be James Harden offensively compared to Ben

"James Harden. And I’m talking long before this year. Dud just plays ball like a crack head looking for a wet floor to slip on. Also, repeatedly hoisting a fucking step back three step back 3 is not exciting"
Well yesterday he had got called for a kicking motion on his shot. He sort of is the center version of James Harden.  A lot of dramatic motions and spastic movements on offense.   He tends to kind of barrel up to the free throw line as well which leads to some quick charges
"I don't think Luka is that exciting to watch, and for years I was told to appreciate James Harden skill but I couldn't stand watching him most of the time"
"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."

Tell me... am I wrong? Has James Harden made more free throws than field goals in his career?
It’s actually embarrassing to watch. You’re potentially top 3 player in the world right now but he plays like James harden.
"Y’all are the No. 1 seed purely on the back of beating bad teams, lmao.  Believe me. No contenders fear those pretenders without Kyrie.   But keep pretending that washed James Harden (one of the biggest chokers in NBA history), Nicolas Claxton (a G-League player) and Joe Harris will be the saviors here, lmao."
"The Nets have been trash against every single contender so far, and James Harden is one of the biggest playoff chokers in NBA history.  Stop with the “this proves how dangerous the Nets will be once they got rolling” crap. Y’all were wrong about this team without Kyrie. Get over it."
&gt; He is having a normal James Harden year so far.  casual take holy shit
He has help. He’s playing next to harden. And joe Harris (who this sub was all about last season). And patty mills. And Aldridge. And Claxton (who this sub was all about last season). And James Johnson. Obviously Kyrie is an insanely massive loss though. Tens of millions out that could be filled by others. But the harden issues are a much larger detriment
Yeah I don’t even like Harden that much and I agree with you. The man gave a decade to Houston and still seems to care for the city.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/02/21/brooklyn-nets-star-james-harden-donating-food-water-plumbing-help-to-devastated-city-of-houston/
"History will not look kindly on James Harden if he doesnt do better. Itll probably be known as the ""James Harden"" rule going forward. No matter how true it actually is."
"No, they should be worried if James Harden continues looking like he's aged five years in one offseason."
"[It's real](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/28/devin-booker-suns-scoring-future-james-harden-kyrie-irving) from the end of the 18/19 season. Dude says that Booker's future is as role player like Lou Williams. (FYI, video won't load with an ad blocker on)."
I demand to see James harden play with Russel Westbrook at this stage of their careers just so I can witness two quadruple doubles in a game.
"&gt; Do you seriously not have any self awareness?  He says, as he continues his umpteenth hours-long tantrum over James Harden not being good enough to win.  As I've said before, your tantrums are entertainment.  And I saw your current one starting in this game thread well before the game was over, get your facts straight, buddy!"
It’s James Harden so I’m gonna give it til the playoffs to actually believe this regression but it is getting scary
"Analytics BS. No way was James Harden the best ISO player in NBA history, no matter what any stat says."

Wonder if he'll sign the max with the Nets now even if he goes back to being superstar level James Harden?

"According to you, wins against teams missing multiple starters to injuries don't really count.    Sad that the GOAT James Harden can only manage a two game lead over such a crippled team.    Asterisk first seed.  Am I doing it right?

where the james harden fans at? someone told me this guy was better than Dwade
"My God, James Harden was abysmal, it’s like he can’t shoot for shit anymore"
He is having a normal James Harden year so far. His efficiency is fine. The only slight differences so far are is his PPG is a little lower. Turnovers and assists and efficiency are completely in line with how he normally does.
"James ""Russell Westbrook"" Harden"
Healthy James Harden scary hours
I watched a bit of the first half and it was a real train wreck on offence for the nets. The Mills 3 followed up by Harden and James Johnson fighting over an open rebound resulting in a TO was sad.
what’s going on for James Harden…
Suns MVP James Harden
"Bro the Nets beside maybe Brown and Bembry have no fight in them, they spend to much time complaining and half the time seem disinterested. James Harden especially has been concerning, like it’s 20 games into the season and he still hasn’t gotten his shot together. James Johnson is straight up hacking out there. Mills is good but missed some big ones down the stretch. KD needs to play like a 7 footer on the boards man, he is allergic to boxing out. Millsap shouldn’t touch the floor and neither should Carter. Nash needs to learn to run some plays to get better looks because a lot of their stats have been padded by playing bad teams, the second they play a team on their level they completely fold. They need a center bad because right now this small ball isn’t working. Also the switch everything was getting exposed, all they needed was one switch to get Aldridge onto a guard and it was all over, Nash needs to be better."
Great win by the Suns. Turnovers destroyed the Nets. Bridges is so good. Just wrecked any ball movement.   This game is closer throughout if James Harden didn’t play like late career Deron Williams. He needs to be better esp without Kyrie
James Harden with his Westbrook impression lmao
"Love Durant and what he did for the dubs, but this dude really left for Frito-Lay presents James Harden and the Ghost of Third Eye Irving. What a shame."
"james ""2011 finals game 4 bron"" harden"
James Harden got 4 pts on 1-10 shooting and 6 turnovers 🤮
Chris Paul is an asshole who makes people around him better basketball players. James Harden is an asshole who nearly ruined basketball. Easy choice.
"They aren’t going to win a title, KD should’ve stayed in golden state. His ego got the best of him and now he’s miserable in Brooklyn with James harden. They’ve changed the way they ref the game, so harden can’t get away with that bullshit he use to do anymore to draw fouls, and so that’s about 12-17pts per game gone for him. Kyrie isn’t playing anytime soon so they are done! If he was gonna get the vaccine, he would’ve gotten it by now. Idk who gonna win the tittle, but I’m putting my money on GS."
"Embiid is the James Harden if centers, you can't touch him or be tough with him"
Yeah but we had James Harden back then  I don't know what happened to him
James harden looking average this season.
James Harden is straight ass. Hope he's out of the league soon
"It is the month of November, yes. They have James Harden and KD on their team, that’s a top team regardless of what month it is."
"When you’re the first seed and have KD and James Harden, yes you’re a top team. If Kyrie comes back,  they are easily favored to win the east."
"James Harden.  I can’t stand his foul-baiting style, flopping, and slinging his head back when he wasn’t touched. Just play. You’re very talented. Just fucking play."
Lol you mean Kevin Durant with role players and borderline amputated James Harden?
"It was Harden, and thats a different kinda hate where your team basically dominates another team consistently and you STILL come away from the games feeling disgusted. That was Rockets v Warriors games with Flopping ass Harden. I mean I would DVR these games, and literally go do something else for minimum 2 hours. That was how much time you needed to comfortably skip commercials and James Harden freethrows.  Seems like the refs are slipping back into old habits, but that first month of the season was beautiful with the no calls"
James harden hottest dudes
"For some reason, as a Kings fan specifically LeBron is the least scary superstar. James Harden fucking eviscerates us every time we play him, I don't think we beat his Rockets a single time (maybe the Bjelica buzzer beater? He was on his way out by then). Steph/Klay? They fuck us UP. Durant too.   Meanwhile we seem to either beat Lebron's teams or just play really hard against them going back a long ways. I remember when we had Vince Carter, he dropped like 24 on Lebron's Heatles and we beat them in OT. We also beat them with Isaiah Thomas and Marcus Thornton going off I think."

I didn’t say they’re in the same tier. But Dame deserves better than to be made out like he’s some James Harden chucker.
"I think like 95% of that public perception of him has come from our playoff series against the Rockets lmao. To be fair Fitz HATES James Harden and can be pretty insufferable when we played them. But I agree, the hate he gets here is totally out of control and he's really a pretty good announcer for the most part."

I've heard that James Harden literally can't even dribble anymore.
"The first time I watched him , it was against the Rockets in the Bubble Playoffs. He literally put James Harden in jail. From that day , I am wondering how on earth did go undrafted ."
Bro what about Ron Artest absolutely elbowing the shit out of James Harden back in OKC.
"Harden has scored 50+ 23 times, against 15 unique teams.  [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/james-harden-50-point-games-box-score](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/james-harden-50-point-games-box-score)  Nice ""Engineer"" make up a lot of stats and figures in your totally an engineer job? Yikes."
"What? It's hyperbole, Jesus Christ, have a basketball discussion without having to invoke a fucking safe space for yourself or someone else. You know who doesn't need your defensive passive aggressive heroism? James Harden, I think absolutely fucking nothing about the person that James Harden is, idgaf about his celebrity. I don't like him as a basketball player and am discussing his basketball merits only and you're getting upset on behalf of someone...are you ok?"
"Well, you’re forgetting about 1 thing in that 12 Finals run. James Harden was the primary decision maker and was the acting PG for that team. Once you let Russell make all the decisions on the court, yea it will lead to questionable plays. Talent can only get you so far. Donovan/Brooks ran a shit offense, that’s true but having Westbrook run your point will cost you a lot of games even in his prime."
I’m an engineer and you actually write like an overemotional 14 year old. James Harden has scored over 50 points against every team in the league. When anyone on the Pistons does that feel free to reply to this comment.
"Good thing I’m not calling him soft for personal reasons then huh? Im just saying the way he plays basketball is soft. Im glad that a all-star 7 foot center was able to successfully do what a majority of 7 foot centers are able to. He can’t post up Danilo gallanari, James harden or tim hardaway jr but he can grab 6 rebounds hooray!!!!!   Also you won’t call people soft,  but will call people you don’t know who are spreading correct information dumbass? Seems a little backwards to me and a lot more cringe than calling a basketball player soft."
"Is one finals run enough to justify:   - Getting the coach (that helped you make the finals run) fired, and then demanding a trade afterwards anyway   - Essentially running yourself out of town for eight years on six teams (And that isn’t hearsay — that’s been reported and on the record)  - Failing to succeed, at the peak of your powers, with Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, and James Harden because you insist on getting more touches in the post (the worst part of your game), refuse to do things you’re amazing at like the pick and roll, and are accused of not trying/taking things seriously   And almost more importantly, doing all of this and yet somehow still seeing yourself as a complete victim.   All that said, there’s still an argument for Dwight to be on the list. But there’s plenty of arguments to be made against it, too."
James harden calling out the MSM
That was happening to the Nets last season. Nets would play down to the worst teams like the Cavs(we lost twice to them!) and then we have a game where only James Harden with no KD or Kyrie came back from a 24 point deficit and beat the Suns.
"Cuz lebrons attitude was visibly bad, James harden was frustrated but giving it his all. Jordan would never let his attitude get like that because it would cause his teammates to give up too"
"Luka is an interesting one. He is tall but athletically he doesn’t jump off the screen like a lot of players. He plays kind of slow and is the master of getting players stuck right behind his hip.   James harden is another guy who is not huge and isn’t as athletic as a lot of other players.  Obviously, these guys are super athletic compared to regular people but by nba standards they aren’t exceptionally better than average"
"I'm not really sure what kind of confirmation you're expecting here, almost all sports reporting of this type comes via unnamed sources and snippets of candid moments. If you're going to question the validity of this based on the lack of anybody going on the record and saying ""you know what, screw my career, I'll tell you what a bad teammate Dwight was"" then you might as well question about 95% of NBA news.  Much of the Dwightmare in Orlando has been well documented. Dwight complained about Van Gundy, caused problems in the media and eventually got his coach fired. He threatened to request a trade out of Orlando, then he publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise and made several efforts to re-establish himself there via community events before changing his mind yet again and forcing the trade to the Lakers.  In LA he publicly complained about needing the ball in the post to be effective, blaming his problems on his mis-use, despite playing alongside Kobe and Steve Nash, two all-time greats who thrive in the pick and roll.  In Houston, despite playing well for the majority of his tenure, his complaining about the style of play he was used in once again caused management to lose patience with him. He was playing alongside James Harden as The Beard stepped up into one of the greatest players in the league, and still Howard couldn't stop complaining about not getting to post up enough. So Houston gave up on Howard and he declined $22m to become a FA and sign with Atlanta.  Atlanta seemed to like him, but that didn't stop them trading him for peanuts less than a year later.  In Charlotte there were numerous reports that despite his solid on court performances, Howard was a distraction off the court, and a bad influence on rookie Malik Monk. So they gave up on him after just one season.  I can't make up your mind for you, but the common threads in all of those stints were 1) decent to very good on-court performance when Dwight was healthy, 2) near constant reports of discontent from within the team, 3) Dwight leaving before the end of his contract term every single time.  Obviously he wasn't the only ingredient in any of those situations, NBA basketball is a complex affair with a lot of people and overlapping contexts. But the reports of his attitude issues and causing problems have been so numerous, so detailed and so continuous for so many years that I think you have to be pretty wilfully ignoring it to believe otherwise."
"Now I know you’re not worth a serious discussion . The man just came back from an injury , probably too early . Why should he risk getting another when not fully healed and his team is shooting  sub 20% on WIDE OPEN THREES. I didn’t think James harden was phoning it in but you people complain about players playing without fully healing . This nothing that he just gives up for no reason , rather then a multitude of factors is just born out of unreasonable standards  for an aging injured player. People gave harden shit too , players better off just not playing with how people look for things to make up shit .   Lebron drove less then half his previous career low , I’m sure that means he’s in perfect health.  Have a good day"
"&gt; The 2018 Rockets are the greatest team to never win a title, I’ve gone back and watched some games from them and the Harden+CP backcourt is on the same level as Curry+Klay IMO  Hard disagree.  Prime Nash/Amare/Marion/Barbosa/Diaw/.  Throw in Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas, James Jones, Raja Bell.  Guy went to jail for fixing games against us vs the Spurs multiple times.  We were the best team in the league, everybody knew it.  Throw in Prime Barkley/KJ/Majerle/Danny Ainge losing the prime Jordan Bulls thanks to a last second three by Paxson.  Kevin Johnson probably the most under rated PG in history.  He had several 20/10 seasons.  Which at the time was unheard of.  Barkley won league MVP and the Suns had a better record than the Bulls that year."

I still don't understand why the Grizzlies took him (over James fucking Harden) despite already having Marc Gasol who had just finished his rookie season with them and was very solid
"Totals is a shit measure of longevity objectively, no matter how you define longevity, which is the ONLY ambiguous and subjective part as it encompasses years, durability, career consistency, and actual performance as a scorer scored within basketball games. And it's still shit for all of them. Context is the most important thing behind any statistic, and totals lacks any context behind those variables that underpin it, and that is the root of its problem in trying to measure anything. You have no idea where the points are coming from, how much is attributed to each variable, only that these players have accumulated these points, under vastly different circumstances, career trajectories etc.  * if you weighed injury resistance heavily as longevity you have players who struggle to stay on the court (Chris Paul no.45) outperforming players who are ironmen (John Stockton no.49).   * If you weigh years played heavily as longevity you have players (Bob Petit no.40) outperforming players who played half the years of others (Scottie Pippen no.62)  * If you weigh consistent performance over a long period of time heavily you still have no way of discerning from totals whether someone was a truly great scorer for a long time (James Harden no.32) or was simply an above-average scorer who played forever (Ray Allen no.24). Also see Kevin Durant vs almost everyone above him.  * It doesn't tell you anything about career consistency. Eg. over 80% of Wilts points were accumulated before he hit 30 (over 9 seasons), he averaged 18ppg in his remaining seasons 30 - 36. yet he's 7th in all time scoring purely because he averaged almost 40ppg over 9 seasons. Meanwhile Dirk who is right next to him maintained a consistent level of performance over a long period of time.  And the result of this shitshow is so easily demonstrated by removing player names and comparing stats, example:   * Player A - 19711 points total (no.49). Player B - 18713 points total (no.63). who's the better longevity scorer? Most people would pick A.   * I'll divulge more stats: Player A averaged between 14 - 23 points per 100 possessions over 20 seasons. Player B - averaged between 23.1 - 44 points per 100 possessions over 13 seasons. Literally zero overlap in scoring. Who's the better longevity scorer? almost everyone would change their pick to Player B now. These 2 ppl btw are John Stockton and Stephen Curry.  Moving onto Lebron, Lebron has essentially recorded more points per 100 possessions than Kareem every year, every phase of their career. Now late in his 30s, Lebron is recording a full 10 points per 100 possessions more than Kareem at the same phase of their career. Lebron is already the more accomplished longevity scorer by any objective observer. And this again goes all the way back to the problem of points total, Kareem despite scoring less in every stage of his career has more total points simply because he played more games. Has nothing to do with his prowess as a scorer, nothing to do with his ability to sustain his level better, absolutely nothing to do with performance, and given both players have played 19+ seasons, clearly nothing to do with ""longevity"", it's simply a matter of running the numbers and playing the requisite number of games.    Same thing with Jordan. The man averaged more points per 100 possession aged 38 than Kareem ever did in his career. He's scored an order of magnitude more than Kareem ever did at any stage of their careers. The man also played 15 seasons, stretching from 21-39. He's a better scorer longevity wise than Kareem. It's pretty clear the only reason he didn't pass Kareem when he retired is because he decided not to chill on the wizards for longer, or stay on after the second 3peat.   TLDR: This whole points total thing is dumb no matter what angle or definition you look at it. It's even dumber when you consider the public's fixation with it as some great measure of longevity. If you still don't get it at this point, all I can say is good luck, have a nice day, and your job that requires any critical thinking. Ciao"
It means that the thunder won the trade for James Harden 🌚
winning championship is team achievement. Rajon Rondo's career isn't better than Steve Nash or James Harden
I watched the video the NBA put out last season of all of Steph's 400+ threes and the most insane part is how tightly guarded he is on almost all of his shots. He probably has the hardest job of any shooter in the league when it comes to creating an open shot for himself. The amount of screens he has to run through and the contact he has to take just to get two inches of daylight would ruin most players. The fact that he's still shooting some of the best percentages in the league while having higher shot difficulty than anyone not named James Harden is mindblowing
"Congrats on all that really, but that was before your team got sold to a  guy who managed to in what 2 years drive off your HoF franchise cornerstone, HoF coach, and the GM that was the architect of your analytics heavy approach and all your success over the past decade.  I'm glad you can look back fondly on your history because at the moment you've got the worst coach in the league, a gm whos highlights include trading for John Wall, and getting back a pile of shit for James Harden, and the worst owner in the league.   You're rebuilding from scratch with Frittata at the helm. Unless the Zion situation blows up in New Orleans I don't think there's a franchise with a bleaker outlook."
Go watch his defense in James harden in those infamous rockets vs warriors series. I genuinely believe the warriors have one less title without him.
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
Fuck Lebron James. I can't wait until he and Harden are out of the league.
"Impact metric, on off plus minus and advanced stats are all affected by WHO YOUR TEAMMATES ARE. Steph only had one top 75 NBA player in KD. Look at how unbeatable they are when healthy. No team stands a chance.  The 73 win Warriors is one of the best team ever. You can go blowing a 3-1 lead all you can but that Warriors weren't playing at full strength. That 73 win Warriors has no other top 75 player.  Lebron wasn't even that dominant when playing with other superstars. If you give AD, Wade, or James Harden to Steph, the Warriors are likely to sweep the finals. That's how unfaur it is when other superstar plays along side of Steph. This is not a guess, or an opinion. Just look at how KD's teams perform when play with and without Steph."
&gt;James harden FT rate has gone done a little  It actually looks like it's gone up more recently.  Early in the season he couldn't get any calls but that's changed pretty much since he and Nash spoke up about it.  * Last year Harden had 16.7 FGA and 7.3 FTA  * First 5 games this season he had 15.6 FGA and 3.0 FTA  * Since then he's had 13.6 FGA and 8.4 FTA and it keeps trending up as time goes by.  He's now getting more FTs off fewer shots.  So his FTr for this season looks like it has dropped but that's really just the first few games weighing him down.   Once those early games disappear into a larger sample size I wouldn't be surprised when his FTr over takes last year's FTr.
But I heard Trae Young and James Harden are gonna get cooked by the new rules!

"I fucking love JTA, MVP of the game, winning player with off the charts motor and hustle, gave the team energy when they desperately needed it, played great D, great passing, sparked runs, made highlight plays, etc, just did everything the Warriors needed tonight  Looney owned Drummond, like completely and utterly erased him from existence  Bears repeating, but the Warriors are DEEP AF,   Props too Philly, no Embiid, no Harris, they competed hard, kept finding ways to fight back, made some tough ass shots, but ran out of juice in the 4th  Maxey's a good ass player, lightning quick with good touch, but he got the James Harden whistle tonight, excited too see him and Embiid grow together  Philly going small towards the end was dumb as hell, never go small against the Warriors, youre just activating their trap card"
Depends on James Harden. If he has an efficient playoff series lol
"Ask the referees not me, there are plenty of examples of this situation. Whether it is James Harden getting calls to go to the line, or the lack of calls LeBron gets when he drives. It all has to do with reputation, and when a referee doesn't have a clear call why wouldn't they fall back on the habits a player exhibits in game?"
Maxey with a trademark foul. Third one in this quarter. Officiating stud. The new James Harden.
"being a relatively neutral observer is fun, because goddamn james harden &amp; marcus smart are both annoying as fuck to watch"
I hope the Nets make the finals so we can see just how horribly James Harden loses it
bro what the fuck happened 2 james harden
James Harden scored more than half of his teams points in 3 of his 4 60 point games in the last 3 seasons
Tatum and Brown are way too good and way too young to trade for an almost 32 year old James harden with a history of being addicted to strip clubs and partying    Whoever thinks that’s a good trade has absolutely zero brain. Tatum and Brown are both 22 and 24 respectively and all nba caliber players with like 5 years left on their contracts each
it's funny to listen to guys like cp3 and westbrook talk about how winning is all that matters and then bitch that they don't get to take away possessions from uber-efficient james harden because apparently winning isn't all that matters.
Could be anything he could be even become the next James Harden
"The 0.44 is probably taken from True Shooting, which weights free throws at .44 as well.  &gt;**What’s with the .44?**  &gt;You want to convert free throws into a shot attempt equivalent. Since players usually take two free throws at a time, the coefficient should be around 0.50. But we have to account for and-1’s, technical free throws, flagrant foul free throws, and 3PT free throws (three in a row.) Thus, based on testing, the 0.44 coefficient is used for the NBA, and it’s surprisingly accurate.  &gt; For example, let’s look at a free throw drawing maestro, James Harden in 2015. Using data from NBAWOWY.com, he had 2217 points in the regular season with 1470 field goals and 824 free throws. Additionally, there were 52 and-1 attempts, 66 three-in-a-row free throw sets, and 38 technical/flagrant foul attempts. The traditional formula results in a TS% of 60.49% via the following: 100*2217/[2*(1470 + .44*824)]. This is very similar to the output received with the real proportions of free throws considered: 100*2217/[2*(1470 + .5*(824 – 52 – 66/3 – 38))] = 60.71%. Even with a free throw manipulator like Harden, the errors using the 0.44 estimate are usually pretty small.  &gt; In fact, using data provided by Seth Partnow, you can calculate a “real” TS% using the appropriate number of free throw possessions instead of using the 0.44 coefficient. This essentially tests the accuracy of that estimate. Looking at 2015 and players with at least 300 true-shot attempts, the correlation coefficient between the estimated TS% and the real TS% is 0.998[1. This is true whether or not you count technical foul shots. To some analysts, technical free throws do not count because they are essentially “free points” that usually aren’t created by the foul shooter and they can be replaced by whomever else is on the court. Either way, the differences are tiny and the correlation is strong.]. Only one player, Courtney Lee, had an error greater than 1% and only roughly a sixth of the 291 players in the data set had an error greater than 0.5%.  *Taken from [Nylon Calculus](https://fansided.com/2015/08/31/nylon-calculus-101-true-shooting-percentage/)*"
"Just watching how James Harden plays the game is an amazing experience. He's a highly cerebral player, who although looks slow, he is just so crafty. The ways he can find to score are just so creative, and his vision is just top notch.  It's amazing to see a 31 year old already dominating the NBA like this for multiple seasons. I just love the way James plays the game.  It's still LeBron's league right now, but the Beard will be next in line."
"8th best player in the NBA.  I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving."
Why not just say 2nd to James Harden and tell us how many James has
"What's the point of getting the player if you don't have a clear path to contention before he leaves? We're not looking for participation trophies here. It's not even about how good James Harden is, we just can't get good enough for that to possibly be worth it."
"Why should the next step be James Harden? Tatum, Harden, knee-to-knee Kemba, a some of the worst depth in the league isn't winning us anything.   The Celtics have years and years before they have to ""take the next step"", there's no reason to waste our most valuable moveable asset (Jaylen) for two ringless years of James Harden."
"Collins, reddish, snell, bogdan and two first for James harden. Who says no?"
Forget Simmons’ latest quirky dumb fan take. The actual trade doesn’t make sense bc harden will only be better than brown and Tatum for a small remaining amount of time. That might seem outlandish to some but I stand by that. You give Tatum or brown complete free reign to just do whatever they want they’d be putting up ridiculous stats too. A lot of guys would. I do not like James harden’s game and I feel he’s overrated. I’ve been saying that for years and I feel like the fact no one is trading for a supposed superstar all time great in his prime is evidence to that.   In 2 years a 33 year old harden won’t be able to create space and its gonna be ugly. Just a LITTLE less space and all those tough shots he hits now won’t fall and then what do you have
I mean it doesn’t work. See James Harden and Houston. You gotta play a style that works when has a team ever been solo carried to championships?
You're literally a James Harden trade destination right now.
"i swear.  ""people stormed the capitol and weren't punished?  man, just like james harden never gets called for anything."""
Yeah James harden averaging 35 points a game on 60% TS that series totally did not lead the team.
"When he got a second supreme ball handler and basketball savant in CP3 it then worked. And that’s JAMES HARDEN, the best or second best scorer of the generation, yet it still didn’t get him over the hump all the way. Trae is not in that stratosphere, and his game needs to change"
&gt;Trading Simmons for Harden would be the worst move this franchise has made since trading Barkley. All he needs is a jumper and he will be a top 5 player in the league - like James Harden!  -r/sixers
it's gonna have to be a tie between kevin durant and james harden
"&gt; Hawks should try and use their other playmakers to create for Trae more.   Please name the all the Hawks other playmakers capable of creating for Trae and other Hawks players.  &gt; I don’t really understand why the Hawks would get Rondo, Dunn, Bogdanovic, and other guys capable of playmaking if they were still going to have Trae play like Harden without having much defensive support.  Rondo hasn't played more than 30 minutes total. Dunn has played exactly 0 minutes.  Another person had to step in to try to explain what you're saying because it seems out of context to anything even applicable here.   &gt; I don’t really understand why the Hawks would get Rondo, Dunn, Bogdanovic, and other guys capable of playmaking if they were still going to have Trae play like Harden without having much defensive support.   Trae is not Harden, Lloyd Pierce knows that, Trae knows that. Everybody knows that Trae Young is not James Harden, and the plan is not to run an offense as such.  But RIGHT NOW. Trae is the only player not OUT that is capable of running an effective Hawks' offense. If you think there's another player that can create for himself and others on the team, please let me know who you think that player is."
"Lots of good guesses here: Covid, drugs, civil unrest, disgust in starting Allan over his boy Jordan, learning the world is flat and of course, James Harden."
It seems that Trae Young wants to play like James Harden when he should put more off ball effort like Steph Curry
Insane and heavily biased? Next thing you know you’re going to be telling me that James Edward Harden Jr is a skill-based player.
If James Harden did this he would get 2 free throws and a cookie
James Harden to Vegas confirmed
"Harden is maybe the greatest ever at putting the ball in the hoop. If we aren't mentioning him when talking about the all time greats, then what are we doing?   By the same token, I guess we should NEVER mention Barkley, Malone, Stockton, Nash, and others when we talk about all time greats. Like, really? Not everyone wins a ring - and that is okay. Not winning a ring doesn't mean that a player isn't elite. There are countless variables over the course of a decade+ that impact these outcomes - most of which are out of the players control.   You do you, but when I am talking about the best players ever, you can be damn sure I mention James Harden. And CP3 for good measure."
Lebron James Harden has joined the chat
"Yeah, they were my least favorite players aside from James Harden.  ...and guess who's trying to join the team!  I mean it would mean a lot to the Nets franchise to get that championship, and a lot for the future since that plus the location would let them keep getting top free agents. But still so awkward. I don't like dogpiling or superteams either."

Theres only heroes and James Harden
-Whatever the best James Harden is  - whatever the best ginobili is -2016 Draymond  -2019 Ibaka -Best Houston Battier  -Steven Adams -Jordan Clarkson -Kuzma (FKK)
"You’re not hearing what I’m saying.  The Rockets’ offensive system *is* James Harden, as the ‘18 Cavs offense was LeBron, the 80s Lakers were Magic, etc. When you’re a ball handler at that level when the game gets that slow, you get to making a lot more of the decisions down the stretch especially without the second ball handler in Paul. It’s neither here nor there that the 0-27 was dispersed among 5 different guys. The offense was designed and executed to generate those looks, but to get over the hump when it’s a really close series you have to have the ability to transcend the schematic design, and he didn’t. Whether he couldn’t or didn’t is a conversation to be had, but I genuinely don’t understand why that admission and that fact is so hard to get through.  Steph gets shit on for not being able to get by Kevin Love in game 7 of the ‘16 finals and for their offense not scoring a bucket the last 6 minutes of that game, it’s an identical concept."

James Harden furiously taking notes.
Brooklyn is scary af.    No reason for them to try to make a James Harden trade unless Houston will take a 10 year mortgage of draft picks like Boston did.
Then you are really goddamn stupid lebron was mentioned after his loose to the mavs curry was ridiculed for years cp3 was also ridiculed james harden is insulted every weak kobe was also called a choker after a series every single star guys called out this is not singular to paul george the difference is that pg-13 made some dumb comment that make it easier to make fun off
"Kuzma and a 2nd. Trading for anyone from a fringe rotational player to James Harden, that is our offer."
trading ben simmons and picks for james harden is the most obvious decision in the world if you have any desire to win playoff games. my only guess is philly has invested a lot of money into a ben simmons theme park and it's too late to back out now.
"James Harden is a quitter. No surprise here. He’s never been one to put himself on the line for a W. He’s made himself scoring champ off of traveling and flopping, and as an mvp contender he just started *attempting* to play defense this year... then promptly quit playing defense this year.  I can’t think of any other player that has more untapped potential than harden (maybe Bynum?) but he’s just too mentally weak to compete. It’s a tough pill to swallow but it’s the truth. I don’t want him in mke. He’s not a winner. He’s a scoring champ."
"Lebron James exists, but outside of him I agree that Harden has carried his team the hardest"
just undying loyalty support from fans.     but james harden should only worry about his own personal legacy and continue to mail it in. he’s only getting paid $44 million
"lmao why you bringing up james harden, mad that he is 10x the player jimmy ever was?"
"&gt;Granted, PG doesn't get the level of blind hatred that James Harden and Draymond Green have received in recent years  What lol. He gets way more hate, basically Warriors KD level hate."
"At a certain point in the NBA the player dictates where they go - not the team. This is when you reach a MVP-caliber level. James Harden will go where James Harden wants to go. I'm confident James Harden doesn't want to go to Indy and probably sees it as a step down, not in population/market but in stature in the East. That's why James Harden has been leaking teams where he can win a ring.   He ain't going to Indy unless it was the Indy of the 90's."
James Harden of police.
"I don't think non-Raptors fans care about Siakam as much as you think they do.  Granted, PG doesn't get the level of blind hatred that James Harden and Draymond Green have received in recent years, but he's not too far away."
James Harden should focus more on both.
"lol come on man just read the comment. I directly answered you, its just not what you want to hear..  ""The theme isn't that he's pushing them out every time, its that there is a chemistry issue every time.""    I'm saying that in that case specifically, Harden didn't push him out. However, they don't want to play together anymore. Which leads right back to my ORIGINAL POINT.. Harden asks for his childhood friend to come to Houston, and the rockets grant his request.  \-  [https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/russell-westbrook-and-james-harden-dont-want-to-play-together-rockets-in-crisis.html](https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/russell-westbrook-and-james-harden-dont-want-to-play-together-rockets-in-crisis.html)   "" he realizes that playing with them means he doesn't get the ball as much """
"Houston has all the leverage if they become desperate lol, they have James Harden"
"This is such a dumb take. Your team had the second and third best player team up just to beat Lebron James, and Harden+CP3 took them further than anyone else did. If KD didn't join the Warriors Harden would have a ring. He gets eliminated because the other teams are just way better.  Harden hasn't disappointed, he has literally lost in the playoffs to a better team every time. Nobody expected Rockets to beat Warriors or Lakers. He averaged 35 ppg against the Warriors in a seven game series."
I just read the weatbrook one because that’s what I’m talking about. That article had only one actual thing tied to westbrook and the rest was “anonymous staffers”. And that one thing was being late to film room... one time. Not much evidence there of Harden pushing westbrook out or vice versa tbh  &gt; I wonder who created that casual culture that caused Westbrook to leave.  do I get to post receipts to? because this https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30296437/sources-james-harden-russell-westbrook-concerned-direction-houston-rockets seems to tell a different story about what actually caused him to leave
The common thread is that Harden HAND PICKED THEM. and I don't think performing well in the playoffs should be a talking point when defending James Harden... But now i'm feeling petty so i'm done.

See the common theme here? There's always a lack of chemistry or disagreement. On the court or off... And Harden always gets his way.  The ""1 year"" portion was not literal.. but to make a point.  Lmk if you want more receipts"
"Wouldn't make a difference, everyone knows the Warriors have ""owned"" James Harden for 6 seasons"
James Harden in shambles
"I think it's more winning that being in a big city. I mean, look at the Thunder and Spurs stars a few years ago. Look at James Harden. If your team is winning and you're dominating then it's a big deal.  If you're the Suns or Wiz and missing the playoffs then the story seems to be less of a big deal."
There really aren’t any players in this league who can carry a teams offense the way beal does and also give consistent effort on defense. It’s why James harden is always criticized for being bad at defense when he really isn’t.
"Not really.   Giannis won DPOY and was 26th in blocks and not even in the top 50 in steals. Counting stats aren’t as valuable on defense as you think.   Off-ball disruption, forcing tough/unmakeable shots, contesting driving lanes... you can’t really *count* that stuff but Giannis was an incredibly efficient and effective defender.   James Harden is a mediocre defender and he lead the league in steals."
"Tim Duncan has one season he had 25.5 points per game so he barely doesn't qualify. Im going to give a homer answer and say Steve Nash. He was one of the best shooters ever but back then PG's were expected to rack up assists and ""combo guard"" was seen as less ideal compared to a ""true point guard."" Also he had Shawn Marion and Amare he wanted to feed. He never even scored 20 ppg but he was basically Steph Curry and James Harden before Steph Curry and James Harden. They tried to out Spurs the Spurs instead of committing more to the 7SOL and have Nash shoot about eight 3's a game instead."
"i used to work at the Yum Center and it is a gorgeous NBA-ready building but my concern with Louisville is the political climate. i heard the issue w James Harden might have had something to do w Rockets owner's support of Trump. i would say Kentucky and the NBA are trending in opposite directions idealogically. besides that, i agree, getting 2B dollars together in Louisville would be tricky and for that reason i question whether or not Louisville is a professional sports town. the Atlanta Hawks are always near the bottom of the attendance figures and i dont think its bc ppl there dont love basketball, i think its bc ppl cant afford tickets. even in 2015 when they won 60gms i think they were 14th. compare to the Pistons who have had down attendance but last time they were relevant, they lead the league. but who knows, maybe if big blue nation throws support behind a team playing in the Yum Center there might be enough season ticket holders to fill the seats. i mean Garth Brooks sold out 4 concerts in 2 days"
If the Celtics trade him for James Harden I am going to storm Ainge’s office.
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."

In passing skill yes he is. In playmaking they are  close with harden and James being better.
"This dude literally started watching last year or doesn't watch games because I don't know how you can watch what he did to Portland in the conference finals, and be an assist off averaging a triple double in the finals and call that useless.   Also the James Harden eye was in the 2019 playoffs while the LebRon eye was in 2018."
Yes where he raked James Harden across the eyes twice. Then did the same to LBJ in the finals
Almost like James Harden..........   Who had 15 tonight on 4FTA
Lol he will have a 30/10 game next week and this sub will be putting him in James Harden trade rumors
So is James Harden. Chill with the excuses
James Harden still exists so yeah.
"If three pointers won championships, James Harden would already be insanely decorated. Warriors ball wins championships. You should watch us more often!"
"[Tim MacMahon:](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1347016093894897664)  &gt;James Harden, asked for his reaction to what happened in Washington, D.C. today: “I didn’t see it.”"
"As I’ve continuously said, Bradley Beal is the most underrated player in the league by far, and the fact he wasn’t an all-star last year, is an absolute travesty. With the right team, he’s an all-nba level talent.   But I have to give this guy his true credit in being all class with his situation. Him missing the all-star game and being so disrespected, plus having these fucked up scoring nights and still losing, I don’t know how he hasn’t asked to be traded yet. It has to be driving him crazy inside. He’s the 2nd best 2 guard in the league if you count Harden as one. If not, he’s the best. Yes, #1. He’s better than Booker and Klay when healthy. His total offensive package, ability to create his own shot and work whilst being the single focal point of the offense last year is second to none in this league. On a bad nignt, he’s dropping 23.   If this guy played with LeBron James he’d be considered a top 10 player, I’m sure of it."
I think James Harden plays better defense than capitol police
Malcom Brogdon is twice as good as James Harden prove me wrong.
"Wtf is wrong with Trae? Some of those turnovers werent normal, they looked like James Harden vs Spurs game 6 turnovers where he didnt know how to use his hands."
Flopping is like 90% of his game.   Goran dragic is what people think that James harden is
"I mean, he's way better than both of them, but their most similar comp is probably James Harden.    They were both snipers who could create threes off the dribble and who got to the line with ease. Also similar defensively. I almost feel like Harden is the natural evolution of Redd in both body type and efficiency. But he's obviously a better passer than both of them were.   I'd put Redd a tier above Martin for what it's worth."
"I think the point you're missing is LeBron went to several finals with a whole cast of different players, even went there with Illgaskus and Boobie Gibson and then a decade later with Love and George Hill, meanwhile Jordan has only been there with Pippen. Lebron made it work with so many different #2s and #3s meanwhile Jordan got sent home in the first round 3 times 😳.   Lebron has gone to the finals with 5 different head coaches. FIVE. How many coaches has Jordan gone with again??  I would how Jordan's career would look like if you replaced Jackson and Pippen. Probably not very good, might be closer to James Harden than a top 2 all time player."
Daryl Morey said recently that Kevin Martin was like his proto James Harden. A guy that excelled at shooting 3s and drawing fouls.
"totally agree. I'm not sure that Doc was the right move, If daryl came first I wouldn't be surprised to see D'antoni get it and more so a speed track to get harden together too.  That said, Doc is a solid coach and more so when there are not as many innnovations as these posters think there are in games, but what he does do well is communicate and has the voice/respect/clout to possibly push harden, simmons, embiid to another level.    Love that he got more space and shooting to let the stars do their work.       Yea Elton seems smart, but I did see where jimmy said there was no structure or accountability. That is important and sad to see them swing the fences, but they recovered well.    Despite tillman, morey had 3 years left in houston at 8 million. There is less then a handful of NBA execs who would leave that guranteed.     You guys got a cap savant. When tillman had his first offseason, rockets had just come away from a game 7 without there other star and lost to warriors. They had bird rights for evry player.  They had a successful switchc heavy defense AND an associate head coach in charge o just defense.  All those guys(if you believe defense wins titles then this is why its important) left.   We had ten million plus in trade exceptions, our full Mid-Level, most of our draft picks. Basically A lot of opportunity to be creative and add talent. Instead we signed james ennis at the minimum, traded him at the deadline for 2nd.  Signed house from gleague, cut him until we could use next years midlevel so we didnt get in the tax. That was during contention and people just say a"" So WhAt He DiDn'T plaY AriZa"" Shutup and listen!  So given that your sixers seem to be doing the reverse tillman, good things can come.  Sixers are a franchise to watch"
"James Harden played the way James Harden always played with CP3 lmao, and CP3 missed 24 games that season.  We didn't do Melo wrong at all, he was just a garbage fit. He wanted the ball too much for a roleplayer on our team.  We lost Ariza because Tilman was cheap.  None of this excuses a supposed star point guard averaging 16 in the playoffs."
"It seemed to me like there was a lot of strife in the locker room. James Harden basically refused to move off ball. They did Melo wrong, who was a close friend of CP3. They lost some good role players. Seems like his struggles are a culmination of injuries and fighting with Harden."
"Are they? After people praise his offense, they usually follow it by either complaining about his defense or saying it's not as bad as it seems. Similar to James Harden"
"Players 20 years from now will be pulling up from half court the way players today pull up from 24 feet away, and some 7’2” all star of that era will pull up from the FT line on the other side of the floor the way Bron pulls up from the logo, and Reddit will ask “Is ____ better than KD was?” And folks will answer “of course, just look at the videos. KD overrated, he only shot threes after he crossed half court.”   I find it impossible to compare unicorns from different eras because they change how the game is played, and of course the person in the past always looks like some scrub compared to the player who grew up practicing all the stuff the older players never practiced. It’s like saying James Harden is definitely a better scorer than MJ ever was because he can shoot the three... as if MJ wouldn’t be a great three point shooter if he grew up in this era.  Count me in the “Magic and Larry literally saved the NBA” camp. KD would be an awesome pitcher today if it weren’t for them."

Not really. Look at someone like James Harden or Jayson Tatum. Much better off the dribble than they are at moving without the ball.
Why doesn't James harden play like this
"as far as currency for james harden goes, he is prob &gt; steven adams (and i love kiwi steve)"
"&gt; It just isn’t really Currys game  This is as much about Kerr as it is about Curry. Kerr hates isos/PnRs and one player dominating the ball. Kerr didn’t like KD isos either and those 2 reportedly didn’t get along. If Kerr was coaching James Harden, Harden’s isos would go way down or Kerr would quit or get fired."
James Harden is the greatest FT scorer
*James Harden enters the chat*
"""Thanks for the support"" - James Harden"
"In this guy's Bizzaroworld I guess so, but for anyone with any sense....no not at all.  That's like saying Chris Paul is a better offensive player than James Harden.   But you'll notice no one is crazy enough to make that argument.   People invent weird criteria to boost Joker."
James harden and Kyle Lowry are sweating somewhere
&gt; No cuz his fans insist that he can carry any team and no one else can lol  This is 100% a strawman if I've ever seen one.  I've literally never seen anyone say that James Harden is the *only* superstar capable of carrying bad teams to the playoffs.
"This includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
"This, even James ""rick ross"" harden will be enough to get to the playoffs"
"Yup, that’s exactly why James Harden has been named MVP for the last 3 years"
Man a Jarrett Allen James Harden pick and roll would have been deadly
2011 Rose isn't even close to Harden the last 5 years.  I'm sorry but the way Rose gets overrated is tiresome. I get it. He got hurt. He was  never the player James Harden is.
James Harden
&gt; James fucking Harden  Evertybody will be looking at that so harris can shoot uncontested!
This game feels like James Harden left the strip club because he finally found a family to hold him down..
Harris doesn't really need to take step back 3s with James fucking Harden and KD on the court.
"If i'm KD and James Harden, Steve Nash.. i'm feeling good right about now facing arguably the greatest team of all time in these unique circumstance type games.."
Like a thief in the night James Harden has come to steal Brooklyn from KD.
James Harden now taking midranges now that he's out of Morey prison.
James Harden
The answer to what's going to be the defense of the Nets is JAMES FUCKING HARDEN apparently.
James Harden
Really impressed by James Harden so far. he clearly looks focused and experienced
people are surprised that former (and current i believe) assist leader james harden is a willing passer?

James harden looking hella THICC
Man with all the drama around James Harden I am just happy he looks great in his Nets debut.
These mothafuckaz going to dominate watch. I just don't see a team with Harden and KD failing. Them Boyz cutthroat!  Kind of funny how LeBron 3 biggest haters ended up on the same team. They really been plotting on King James for the throne!
Your second unit begins with James Harden. What the fuck is this team.
Joe Harris&gt;James Harden  and it's not even close
I can’t believe James harden is on this team LOL
James Harden looks like a young Barry White
"I mean, he essentially compared James Harden to a vibrator."
"everyone in here saying they’re not close to a guarantee, it’s about as close to a guarantee as you can get lmao. we don’t have to “wait and see” how dominant Kevin Durant and James Harden are going to be together, barring injury they are nearly a lock. they will get by with whoever they have to throw out there at center, because they have two top 5 players and 3 top 15 players"
Neither James Harden nor Russell Westbrook has ever carried similarly bad teams. Neither has been on a team as bad as LeBron's worst Cavs teams.
"I'm enjoying Jeff, KD, and Harden. I would never get a KD jersey but Jeff and James might make it hard for me."
The only word that can be used to describe James Harden right now is tubby   He's not obese but it looks like he's been retired for five years and just didn't give a fuck
James harden saved caris leverts life what a guy
Wait so is Harden morbidly obese or not??? I was told James Harden was morbidly obese!
James Harden doing James Harden thing may have saved a mans life.
"james ""vince carter"" harden"
"It's not that you need to think he's in his prime, just thinking he won't get better than James and knowing this roster is hardcapped around Harden is all you need to know to say the Simmons deal was bad."

"*James Harden won too many games, was expelled from said school*"
"kyrie, kd, and harden aren’t players that you can just “eh, they’ll throw some guys at em”-at. they are all-nba players. three of them. on one offense. you will not be able to double-team any of them either. the nets also have incredible shooters that can space the floor and make the offense unstoppable. these three will not have their production eclipsed by one good center, or any center for that matter. these takes need to be put to rest. it does not matter if they can “match up” with giannis, bam, embiid etc. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden, on the same court, on the same team, will comfortably nullify any impact that those individual big men have on the game."
"Magic led the league in assists and was 2nd in MVP voting after winning the previous two years.  Magic was only 31 years old, younger than current James Harden."

D'Antonis system causes ball handlers assists and scoring to explode. Now James was an amazing player before him but he averaged assists the season before D'Antoni got there.  And assists don't count for much when you have the ball 90% of the time and when you pass it your teammates have to shoot. Like despite arguably being 2 of the most selfish players in league history both russ and harden have had seasons where they average 10+ assists.
"He has had a few AWFUL games, typically at really inopportune moments, which have ruined his reputation. Same thing happened to James Harden tbh. Both are great players who rely on jump shooting and sometimes just stop hitting their 3s - when that happens in an elimination game, fans never seem to forget"
"It’s Harlan, James Harzen. Metapod used Harden."
yeah our two MVP’s Gary Clark and James Ennis match up really well with Harden and Durant
Most popular place in the NBA next to the places James Harden frequented in the offseason.
"I don't see you being downvoted, and I wasn't saying you were wrong.  I'm saying that if this is all true, it's stupid that the NBA even lets this happen.  James Harden is officially considered a Brooklyn Net right now, that's what I'm saying. The NBA itself right now is saying that James Harden is officially a member of the Brooklyn Nets.   The Brooklyn Nets themselves are saying that James Harden is a Brooklyn Net. The Houston Rockets themselves are saying that James Harden is no longer a member of the Rockets.   Get what I mean? It's odd that this would all be done if there was still any minor chance of the trade being cancelled (as unlikely as that may be)."
"Dame Lillard, James Harden, Demar Derozan, Giannis, what Kobe said before blowing 3-1 lead in 2007, Rudy Gobert. And hey guess who else? Lebron in 2011 after “Not one, not two, not three.” There’s seven right there  Now tell me why it bothers you so much every little thing PG says?"
"I got dunked on for hours for saying this elsewhere, but I will never not think this.  “Such a classy organization!”, they said. But not classy enough to actually try to win with those guys before blowing it up just because Jim Harden wanted to form Voltron with his friends.  “But it’s James fucking Harden” please. He doesn’t fix *any* of their preexisting issues, and even added new ones. thanks"
What does finalized mean though?  Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen were at last night's game on the Cavaliers bench in Cavaliers warm-ups.   James Harden already had his introductory press conference and the Nets are using him in marketing material.   How would any of that be legal if the trade was not approved by the league office?
trade for James Harden
"We always give credit to lebron for elevating his teammates its time that Harden get his credit for doing the same thing against the KD-warriors.  My post isn't about who's the better individual player. Its about who gave them the most trouble. You can't deny that Harden gave them the chills of actually losing a series. Not cavs, spurs, pelicans, trailblazers.  In 2018 playoffs in which we can say the best year for the warriors (talent wise), they lost 5 games in the entire playoffs. 3 of those is from the rockets. They didn't even lose 1 game to cavs (3 games decided by double digit margin)   Sometimes people forgot James Harden is getting doubled team more than Lebron in 2018 despite Harden had a better supporting cast back then.  Imagine if he had JR smith as teammate he is getting doubled way more."
"&gt;And let's not forget, how TF are the Nets gonna stop Giannis going downhill like the Raps/Celtics can?  How tf is Giannis going to outscore Kyrie, KD and James Harden? Even if he shot 70% on 30 FGA a game, he would be scoring 20 less than the Nets current big 3s ppg. I know they haven't played together yet, but this is an offensive level that you have to ask the reverse of  How TF are the Bucks going to score more than the Nets?"
"&gt; This sub takes any chance it can get to shit on Harden and this is a prime example. James has every right to say things like that. He has led this team for two entire contract terms.  Well, if it makes you feel better, he's one of my favorite players and I 100% support his desire to push for a trade. I do think he handled it poorly, especially the aspect where he ignored that we're in a pandemic and spent time going to clubs while many of the rest of us are staying at home, not even going out to restaurants. And to do it while he was supposed to be reporting to camp? He handled it poorly.  Also, regarding ""we"", I really doubt he meant ""I don't have enough talent"" - he knows he's good enough. Cousins isn't crazy if he took that to mean the rest of the team didn't have enough talent."
He clearly uses “we’re” as in WE are. Not they. He’s really not throwing any teammates under the boss. It’s a comment on the team as a whole including him. And was he wrong? Eric Gordon clearly didn’t take it as throwing the teammates under the bus and Boogie seems to be the only one making a big deal of it publicly.  At the end of the day it really doesn’t matter. This sub takes any chance it can get to shit on Harden and this is a prime example. James has every right to say things like that. He has led this team for two entire contract terms.
"“What I mean by that is that in 2012, Durant played on a three-superstar Oklahoma City Thunder team with Russell Westbrook and James Harden. “  Lol."
"How would you interpret [this quote?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/rockets/2021/01/12/james-harden-rips-houston-rockets/6650835002/)  &gt;The former NBA MVP concluded his press conference Tuesday night following the Rockets' 117-100 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers with a searing indictment of the team.  &gt;""We're just not good enough,"" Harden said. ""Chemistry, talent-wise, just everything, and it was clear these last few games.""  He's blaming the team being bad on not having enough talent (meaning good teammates). Even if you don't take it that way, that's clearly how Boogie took it and he was offended by it on behalf of all the other players."
"To sum up:  &gt; So, OK. Walk me through this. **About 12 seconds ago, Kevin Durant left the Golden State Warriors** in a swirl of bad feelings. He did this, reportedly, **at least in part because he’d been criticized online for joining a superteam.** He wanted to prove he could win a title with a team that, unlike the Warriors, didn’t surround him with multiple superstars and another league MVP. So he left. **Now, nine games into his career as the undisputed leader of the Brooklyn Nets, his team has traded for James Harden, meaning that Durant now plays for … a superteam, alongside multiple superstars and another former league MVP.**"
"Why do people seem to think that just because you say something true doesn't mean it isn't disrespectful?  So if John Wall came out and said ""James Harden is fatter than he's ever been"", that wouldn't be taking a shot then because it's true right? Think about how stupid that logic is. I'm guessing most of the people arguing this are in their teens because I've never seen so many people baffled by the concept of simple professionalism."
&gt;dying to play with  More like the opposite in James Harden
he thinks depth/bench doesnt matter in the playoffs because the nets added james harden
"As a rookie in the playoffs he was tasked with shutting down JAMES HARDEN, AND IT WORKED. Thunder/Rockets was an amazing series last year."
"They won’t, but if they do win it’ll be their best player (by far)....James Harden. The entire offense is going to run through him."
"Lebron and AD might give them both trouble if they are teammates but certainly Lebron isn't really as big of a trouble to the KD-warriors era compare to James Harden.  I know I'm gonna get downvoted but James Harden put up the biggest fight against the KD-warriors (excluding the 2019 finals where KD only play for 1 quarter).   Harden made me think that team might actually be beatable. Lebron didn't, he won 1 game against them in the playoffs.   He played great but didn't actually gave them real ""trouble"""

I'm talking about him completely *checking out*. Not the same thing. Kobe was awful in his inefficiency but he would leave it all on the floor. He played from tip to buzzer. Harden didn't do that. You can't blame Tillman for that. We had Vince Carter, he totally checked out &amp; forced his way out of Toronto. The moment he got to the Nets, he went back to being a monster on the court. His *on-court* behaviour is why so many Raps fans are against him &amp; against the idea of him retiring a Raptor (which isn't an issue now) or him getting a statue. *Vince Carter gave up on the team* ***on the court***. That's the biggest sin. Just look all that Lebron has done &amp; you'll still hear about how he checked out in the playoffs during his last run with the Cavs before he jumped ship to Miami. That shit will stick to him forever.  If you're upset with management or ownership or whatever, fine, but you don't sabotage the team by just giving up.  &gt;""over the past five years Harden has shot less than 25 percent from the 3-point line in playoff fourth quarters and overtimes.""

Yea I can tell your just a hater James Harden isn’t HOF lol and yea they don’t have depth they literally just traded for Harden that’s obvious. I would think that it takes more than one season of being together to form a championship roster.
What you didn’t say was that Kobe said this when Capela and Chris Paul was out. His team had no chance to win unless he dropped forty. Why are you mentioning that like he’s not playing with KD and Kyrie? No matter how you slice it a James Harden lead team was the only real competition GSW faced.
Ok what player shoots a lot and puts up James Harden numbers enlighten me. Bradley Beal? 😂😂
There's no way. They said the recovery timeline for him is about the same as a regular ACL tear. Theres no way he's fully recovered and ready to go in like 5 months.   I think the reason the Nets gave up so many of their key role players is because they knew they were getting James fucking Harden
"A team is not a single player, it is the sum of a set of pieces.   Houston may have lost James Harden, but they have some very nice pieces.  Losing James Harden is also a boost to team morale. Now everyone gets to play instead of watching Harden run the “dribble, dribble, dribble” offense."
"Nah this stuff happens all the time. It’s just under a microscope now because it’s James Harden and Ben Simmons in question. Players get traded or not traded with lots of confusion, hurt feelings, etc. Players talk about trade rumors as really fucking with them, it’s just part of the business."
Do you even watch our games? As long as he doesn't suddenly forget he's not James Harden and start ball handling he doesn't stifle shit.
This sub hates the way James Harden plays but loves Luka even though they have the same game.
"This comment is so dumb, get the fuck out of here. Stop hunting for racism. Boban is a freak of nature (I mean that lovingly), was in a John Wick movie, had the Boby and Toby run, seems like a fun guy, and is just generally a meme. Jokic is relatable because he doesn't look like a guy that should be averaging a triple double in the NBA, and he says funny stuff like his cookie monster comments the other night. Pat Beverly injured a superstar in a playoff game, costing the Thunder a title, is generally annoying af, flops and whines a lot, and plays dangerous/reckless, if not dirty. James Harden is a chore to watch, flops like a fish, quit on his team, and just pouted his way off the Rockets. No one gives a fucked about the skin color of any of these guys.     Here's an example of how your logic sucks ass and you're grasping at straws: ""Yeah I'm not sure if its conscious bigotry but its not a coincidence that the everyone's favourite players are guys like Tacko and Lu Dort and guys like Zaza and Grayson Allen are treated like war criminals"""
I'd say he's a less athletic James harden/ Carmel Anthony type
"houstons entire journey to being a contender started and ended with james harden, we wouldn't even expect houston to be a playoff team if he had never been there.  but it definitely also is probably annoying to be a rank and file nba player subject to the whims of superstars"
"&gt;ESPN: James Harden ~~buys~~ gives Landry Shamet a lap dance to regain his old number  Harden’s thicc these days, so he’ll do it himself."
"Eric Gordon is totally wrong.  James Harden disrespected his teammates.  James Harden was supposed to be the leader of the Rockets. He was the one who had the keys to the franchise for 8 years. He was the one who got everything he asked for.  The current Rockets team was the team Harden wanted. The Rockets' style of play was the style Harden wanted.  He had to take all of this on as a leader. Instead, he chose to flee elsewhere.  That's not the attitude of a leader, it's the attitude of a diva."
By that logic you should pick Dort over Stephen Curry or James Harden if you care about defense and fit so much.
You also have to realize he played next to James Harden
"I understand that you gave up on learning anything after the 6th grade, maybe you can catch up by watching some youtube videos. Maybe lay off of on FreeDawkins highlights for awhile.  Also please stop sucking off James Harden, I know he features heavily when you binge watch highlights for an entire day."
"Some new owners just don’t seem to comprehend that, unlike every other business they’ve been involved in, they’re basically the least valuable part of the organization. There’s only about 10 people in the world as qualified as MDA and Morey at their jobs. You can’t just strong arm them and replace them, like you could with some random VP whose role could be filled by the two thousand other high-level executives in the industry. Even worse, there’s only maybe 5 people as good at his job as James Harden. He’s the last person you have any leverage over, especially not enough to upend the entire organization."
James harden also gives Landry shamet his starting position and his yearly pass for free McDonald meals for his old number
"We already have a version of that with worse fininishing and slightly worse passing, James Harden."

Bro he did the James Harden and purposefully tried to land on the defenders feet so it looks like a foul. I’m not saying I’m against gaming the system I’m just calling it like I see it. And Draymond really didn’t try to kick lebron in the balls in the finals but he did it to okc so the refs had two for one punishing draymond and helping the face of the league stay in the series.

"The Brooklyn Nets are not losing a seven game series against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Brooklyn Nets have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving.   Nets in 4."
"Tacko ""Steph ""Vince ""James Harden"" Carter"" Curry"" Fall  You know, for the big extra obvious gather step"
It's because people were expecting him to be like Steph Curry. We know now so far this season Trae is not great when he doesn't have the ball in his hands. He's most effective when he's mini James Harden.
What an awful potential trade. Simmons and Thybulle combined are way more valuable than a bloated James Harden. Glad this didn’t happen. Would have been a complete disaster.
Not saying Trae is a bad shooter but a high TS% doesn't necessarily mean you're shooting well from the field. You know how many times James Harden has had a 2/16 from 3 game while finishing with like a 52%TS (not terrible but not indicative of his shooting from the field) due to his free throws?
"the poor form is worse, go back to 2019. He for some reason goes and volunteers to be the press about MDA negotiation and tells them that MDA doesn't know how long he wants to coach(totally fabricated and MDA considerd invovling lawyers bc hes lowering MDA market)   And he doubled the offer which in reality was half of hwat he told the press.    This guy does it all the time. We all know Chris paul is a notoriously competitve team, then after they lost in 2019 tillman again went to th press to say rockets should've had a step on your throat killer mentality which he was the one to instill.     Let laone its a bit odd that they say harden pushd teh trad when like above, tillman went on collin cowherd bragging about he was on a yacht in europe at 2 am and his basketball ops team was weak and he said get it done.  Morey was on interview saying Harden wanted Russ, but when morey said it wasnt likely he was fine to build upon that team  Tillman also took the buffer in between harden and paul, sort of how heat pay haslem to just be the glue chemistry culture guy. That was Ariza, they both repcted him, he won rings with kobe where harden grew up. He was a perect 3/d long glue guy for them on their defensive scheme, but just like he did with MDA he chased out our Associate head coach which was the last time we had close to a top5 defense and almost went o the finals  So people know the big names they dont see the little dominos that tillman did just to water down the culture of the franchise and make james harden dream/job harder while publicly telling him to pick up his bootstraps and g et better results with a worse product in a league that has the top level tams really gooing for it.  side note, they replaced Ariza with james ennis. He was traded that  vry season while in rotation for a 2nd round swap.  Also dropped another 1st round pick again in some trade gymnsatics to get under the tax.   I suspect that was it for morey. he had built a team in 2018  that came one game from the finals, had all their players bird rights to rerun, had 10 million plus in trade exceptios, mid level, and several picks...most of those things were just ignored and morey spent the last two seasons signing minimum players and trading to get under the tax even if the player.  So harden is suppoesed to spend his last 1-3 years of the culmination of his work with a guy whho publicly lies to him, cut cost, makes his job worse, hurts the cutlure and then publicly leaks trashings of you when you sit hre and play camong the highest minutes, games, and useage in a time of load management.    You don't lead the league in assist, points and have numbers taht are rarified air EVEN for a hall of famer and do that for the marathon of a seaoson for 4-5 stragith years. Robertson from OKC made 10 million plus just being known as a harden stopper, guys come at him every night  You don't do that accidentally or if you're not committed. That takes mental resilience like crazy and he has excuses to ret and doesn't. Hes a hoop junkie, but he isnt media savvy what so ever and tillman can buy up espn  in fact go look at Windhorst rcent podcast when he critisized tillman and said he knows anytime he says something about him he gets a call.    But people will keep buying this dudes snake oil sadly"
"KD, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all on OKC"
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, James Harden"

Kyrie should clearly be the 3rd option though imo. At least he's the 3rd best player and scorer. James Harden should be able to run the first unit just fine.  Ig Kyrie might pout about it though.
James Harden
In that case: Fuck James Harden live
For James Harden lol
"It always blows my mind these conversations. You're 100% right.  Zion is 6'6 with 6'10 wingspan and crazy athleticism.  If Caruso, at 6'5 with 6'6 wingspan can defend James Harden. If Ricky Rubio at 6'3 without athleticism can defend prime Westbrook, I don't get why others (athletic as fuck blacks) can't be at least a bit better.  At the end of the day is work and will to ve better and /or giving a duck about defense.  That's why I don't like players with all the potential to be great on defense but are awful. Like Irving. Like not post defense Harden."
"I agree but at the same time harden isn’t the most efficient player. Some nights he goes 1/13 from 3 and it’s ok but kyrie’s game is more versatile that he’s literally one of the best 3 point, mid range, and close to the basket shooters in the nba. Look I know James harden is a talented scorer and even after all I said I’m not saying kyrie is a better score, I’m saying he’s a more efficient scorer so why does it matter if he takes the most shots if he’s not missing over 50% of his shots from the field."
"Tf you mean?   James Harden has been our third best player the last 3 games. He isn't shooting and is turning the ball over a ton trying weird passes. We basically messed around the first half, got like a 20 point lead, then the Heat went on a run and we closed it. I am very happy to be watching Kyrie and KD"
"i think nash has more to do with it then him. they're running plays where hes the facilitator where he brings up the ball and then passes to set up the ball movement to the open guy. but the thing is that you have fucking james harden. WHY ARE YOU USING HIM AS A PASSER. just iso and let him create himself or score, thats the reason hes worth so many picks and players."
One thing I've noticed about Steph and James Harden is both of them have been playing their style for so long it's like they almost cant even play normal anymore. Two sides of extremely different styles no longer with teams that support it.
I know off ball is probably as important to Steph as on ball but he's still not getting on the ball nearly enough. He doesn't have to be James Harden but I know at one stage Seth was getting more touches per game than Steph was. I'm not suggesting that stat is perfectly indicative but it does say a lot
To stop James Harden I had to become James Harden.
James “just not good enough” Harden
“Demarcus what are your thoughts on this comeback statement tonight?”  “Fuck James Harden- sorry what was the question”
"The op found it interesting and wanted a highlight. Who cares why they want the highlight. Also, James harden had a no look strip on derozen that was just filthy 2 seasons ago, I guess that’s not worthy of a highlight either?"
"Don’t know what you mean by unsuspecting player, these dudes are playing with some of the most dynamic playmakers in the league so they know they could be getting the ball at any time.   The Nets are being smart as to keep one of the big 3 on the floor at all times. Harden has an actual team this year so he doesn’t need to carry the scoring load as much. He’s has turnover issues but that’s coming from him playing a more traditional point rather than playing James harden: the offense."
"To be fair, James Harden has been playing with depression after finding out SexLand isn't a strip club."
Do they have James Harden? I don’t know who that imposter from the last couple of games is.
"Yeah, all the Kyrie haters say that he's a ball hog and that's why Harden isn't shooting but it's bullshit because for the 12 minutes that Kyrie is on the bench Harden is out there running the floor and just making some nice plays but also a ton of unnecessary passes when he should be looking for a shot or getting to the FT line.   Thing is though, he's James Harden so he's gonna figure out the right balance sooner or later. The problem with this team is the inability to guard any semi-competent big man let alone someone as great as Bam."
"I’m perplexed as to why james harden isn’t being james harden. He’s playing so passive, even with the second unit. Like cmon man, I’d rather see you drive to the basket than see Reggie Perry fumble another pass.  This Nets team really has to cut down on turnovers as well. This game wouldn’t have been close if they didn’t have so many boneheaded turnovers. Yes, the officiating was horrible, but still not an excuse for such sloppy play."
"James Harden is better than him, that's not an insult lol"
He’s trying to find his place in the offense. Even without Kyrie he wasn’t 2019 James Harden.
he can be useful but not james harden
&gt; 3x Scoring champ James Harden is just refusing to shoot the ball?????  This the most bizarre thing and why the r/NBA and pundit criticisms of Kyrie hogging shots didn't make sense. Harden's not even taking shots when he's leading the bench unit without Kyrie or KD and it led to an 11-0 Heat run at the start of the fourth in like 90 seconds. He has open looks and mismatch opportunities and is just not doing anything with it.
A few notes:   1. Kyrie saved the fuck out of us   2. 3x Scoring champ James Harden is just refusing to shoot the ball?????   3. Bam was hitting some wild ass shots    4. Possibly the worst officiating i’ve seen in years
This James Harden guy is so passive. He needs to draw some more fouls and get to the line more.
James Harden is playing scared just because. Wtf
"A lot of the people who criticize Kerr are Steph fans more than Warriors fans, and are upset that Kerr isn't just making Steph be James Harden so they can post a statline on /r/nba every few nights with a bunch of impressive numbers."
"Shake ""James Harden Trade Bait"" Milton on his 6moty tour rn"
"Well, it's not like James Harden isn't familiar with the situation of high usage."
Kevin Durant Or James Harden PnR
"That’s fair... I hate his game and am super biased, but completely understand what you’re saying regarding not being a talent destination. It’s that outlier that rarely gets factored in to the extent it should with all small market, non equity franchises like this one.   It’s just going to be tough to construct an ultra competitive roster with those two dudes as the 1st and 2nd best player. The team so desperately needs defense at the three other positions to make that work, but the only real defender on this team is Okogie. Towns is a really poor defensive player even if he’s made subtle improvements. To me DLO’s lack of effort or defensive iq is so abhorrent though. Dudes been in the league since 2015 and defends he’s just showing up for his first game time in time out. That hawks game and some of the possessions Trae had where he was just walking to the rim whenever Russell guarded him was painful. Dude is worse than a traffic cone. And sadly he’s just not good enough offensively to justify acting like he’s James Harden on that side of the ball. I just hate his game...   I’m sorry.. I’m insanely biased but I think he legit sucks and is a 6th man, microwave scorer pg player at best, not a 30 million a year franchise corner stone. But I guess he’s KAT’s best friend, so there ya go."
"i feel like every time one of these teams comes together, everyone does the ""don't step on anyone's toes"" routine, the team struggles, then everyone realizes they were supposed to do what they've done their whole careers.  harden not looking to score at all is just dumb.  just play like james harden."
"""Nobody is better at getting fouls in this situation than James Harden""  State of this sport"
"Yeah Giannis is the only good player on an otherwise shit team and shit franchise... can’t expect much from him to be honest. Hell.. he’s single handedly carrying his team pretty much, more than James harden Kyrie or kd can say for what they are producing right now"
"I do know there were more calls then. This era also has the ball in one players hands way more and has stricter rules to protect jumpshooters. So you have James harden who constantly has the ball and only shoots threes and drives to the rim, and he's gonna get a fuck ton of calls, same with Trae. I'm not saying they never flop or sell calls, but people act like there's a raging epidemic of fouls and it's not like the good old nba. It's always been this way high volume stars get fouled a lot."
"Because I'm saying James harden plays a style that would draw more fouls, in an era that has more shooting fouls to call and he still only averages .6 more FTA than jordan. So I'm supposed to believe Jordan got all of his 100% legit but harden just flops for all of his?"
"In my opinion, he has the potential to be in the top 5 greatest big men of all time/GOAT big man. He is very skilled and has shown an ability to play dominantly on both sides of the court and hit free throws (80% vs 50% for shaq). Being a legitimate 7 footer, ofc he can get exposed by guards on the perimeter, but i feel like he could be the Steph Curry of the post. He could have so much gravity because he can just dominate inside and demand a double team everytime, holding the defenses attention as he roams around the block, which frees up shooters to be hit by Simmons or a good iso player to 1v1 players everytime.  Basically, his ceiling is 2000 MVP Shaq + free throws and better defense. He could generate offense with his jumper, meaning he wouldn't expend all his energy in the low post. This is even more feasible now too given the lack of true big men in the league, and the trend toward small ball, which means he can be shaq-like on offense and have more energy for defense. He could get players in foul trouble, meaning teams would need bodies to try to oppose him = a liability in offense for the opposition team, less 3 point spacing as big men generally are worse at shooting or smaller defenders = bbq chicken.  This may not be effective vs better big men like Gobert, Adams, AD, Drummond, Sabonis etc. But i do think he can dominate like shaq, he has the potential too + he has other skills.  However, the guy cant stay healthy, his fragility is incompatible with this bruising. post centric playstyle and his effectiveness depends on his ability to get position on the block smartly/footwork and an offense/perimeter players or a system that can actually take advantage of embids gravity e.g. someone in the james harden mold (Harden is the best possible pairing) or any great 1v1 player and/or passer that can take advantage of double teams, Simmons could be this in future (hes only 24).  Realistically I think Embiid also needs to improve his passing out the post (although his assist numbers are similar to prime shaq, around 4 apg) . But in terms of potential, he can do everything, I dont think his footwork is as good as a Hakeem etc but it doesnt need to be. Overall, i think its tough for him to fufill his potential, he is so injury prone."
"In 19-20 season the MVP was won by Giannis, with voting points followed by Lebron James and then James Harden. In the same season, Harden won fantasy points, followed my Giannis and then Lebron.  In 18-19 season the MVP was won by Giannis, with voting points followed by Harden and then Paul George. In the same season, Harden won fantasy points, followed by Westbrook, then Giannis, then in 4th Paul George.  I could go on in the history of comparing fantasy leaders to MVP voting, but there is always a strong correlation.  As of right now Embiid isn’t even a top 10 in fantasy points, meaning he isn’t at the very top of the league in scoring, rebounding, assists, blocks, steals, etc. I don’t think he’s being looked as a top MVP candidate currently and this is part of the reason why.  Not sure why you think this is a bad take, when it actually makes a lot of sense. Fantasy points doesn’t mean you win MVP of course, but only someone who is blind or ignorant doesn’t see the correlation between fantasy points and MVP voting."
"I think Harden is trying to adjust his game to the entire team and try to get everyone involved.  I think he's being too passive, but I also think if he wasn't, nobody else would and Brooklyn *needs* guys like Harris and Green to produce, they can't rely on Kyrie, James, and KD to go off every night, because that just won't happen."
No?  It's a much better stat than raw FG% in my opinion.  I tend to think it's extremely useful but there are exceptions (like some games where James Harden has had a 50+ TS% on like 25% from the field because he shoots so many FT's).  In your case it's telling you exactly what its supposed to. Curry's made 3's on high volume are worth more than Sexton's 2's.
People would play with a lot less effort defense would be a lot more standing around. James Harden would be MVP.
"The issue with that idea is that 2 of their 3 stars are atrocious defenders and the other is only average.  No team that puts James Harden out there is going to be good defensively. It isn’t a possibility. And things will only get worse each year as they get older with no picks coming in to add young, high energy players."
"Anyone with a set of eyeballs and that are using them to watch the 2 games so far that Kyrie and James have played together, you can clearly tell Harden is being passive as fuck. Even when he's on the floor alone this past game with Kyrie on the bench, he's deferring to his teammates instead of playing how he did in Houston.  It's way too early to tell how the shot charts will look like for these 3 but I think it matters a lot less than you all think it does in the long run."
I hope James harden is guarding Duncan. Well at least score 110 then.
"Offense isn’t more important.  Players just do more individually on offense more than they do on defense.  It doesn’t matter how good say Rudy gobert is, James harden can elevate an offense more than he can elevate a defense.  However this isn’t a great argument because Giannis is very good on offense while being one of the best on defense."
He gets shit on literally for not shooting on top of that they told him he’d be traded and they wonder why he struggled. Put him on a team surrounded by shooters no drama and let him thrive. Imagine him on the warriors 1-1 trade with Wiggins the defense of that team would be phenomenal. He’ll look at kuzma and Ingram trade rumors and drama go away and they are doing well. Ben will bounce back and be great at what he does it was just James harden was in the picture and well you kinda can’t deny a 30 pt triple double you’d be foolish
"Dude, just say you dont watch the rockets and move on.   &amp;#x200B;  MDA's first year the rockets were very good, but there was no ""eventually Harden got his way"" because after finishing with the third best offense in MDA's first year, CP3 joined the Rockets the second year. That and the addition of PJ Tucker and Harden buying in on defense jumped the Rockets even higher. The third year, CP3, Eric Gordon, and Capela all missed significant time forcing Harden to go on The Ungaurdable Tour. I'm sorry you think he was better off letting Austin Rivers, Kenneth Farid, and James Ennis take those shots instead (since they started games in place of the injured starters). Finally, after CP3 was dealt for Westbrook, which was never given a chance do to a unique bubble tournament, Westbrook wasnt able to get into the flow with the Rockets. He then demands a trade because of the culture when he has no friends except for Spalding. Harden sees the Rockets have no chance at winning and demands a trade. From that point on he did act unprofessional but to act as if Harden ran this franchise into the ground, you aren't just wrong, but completely oblivious to the real world."
Look at how many shots he’s taking compared to James Harden ... that’s the statement
Ya know the more i hear about this James Harden guy the less i care for him
"I'm not saying its some brilliant scheme everybody can run. Somebody said ""in what situation is James Harden a plus defender?"" and another guy responded ""he's not"", and I disagree. I think the Rockets proved that with the right roster, he is a plus defender, and a very unique and useful one at that."
Kyrie and James Harden the past how many years is an overreaction?
"They wouldn't, at least entirely. James Harden and Kyrie have both gone through several superstar teammates to still only be unhappy. Idk why people are acting like that's going to change."
My bad didn’t see that. Honestly I feel like that is the most reasonable choices. I don’t see how rocket can be getting better pieces any time soon so I guess they just had to go for the extreme. If James and russ doesn’t work out it is incredibly to find another superstar to pair with harden so they just went all out :(
it kicked off with the introduction of small ball jump ball specialist James Harden
The James Harden/Rockets era warped the players around them to fit with Beard. Maybe Capella isn't just some good starting center but an all-star caliber player.
James Harden Finna demand a trade outta Brooklyn
Why not? I bet my life Sean Mark's is gauging the market. You dont turn down the chance to add James Harden to Kevin Durant. That doesnt mean your roster might not need to be tweaked afterwards. There are obvious weaknesses and imbalances with this trio.
James Harden + Kevin Durant
"I can’t possibly see why houston would have wanted to trade in the James Harden headache for Kyrie, I’m honestly not 100 percent sure what Kyries trade value around the league is unless he decides he wants to be traded because I think he would be such a headache nobody is giving up fair value for him."
"But I was told he was Nerlens Noel who got to catch lobs from James Harden / no better than Alex Len?  Just kidding, all my homies hate lardbiscuits"
Lol with James harden you would be finals favorites in the East

"Hmm no? Kobe did not have ego issues with Shaq , he has stated numerous times over interviews , the real problem he had was with Shaq work ethic. He even said on an interview he wish shaq worked like him because they would have 11 eleven rings..  &amp;#x200B;  KDs ego issues? Just go listen to draymond green and why KD chose to left the Warriors. Or just search KD burner accounts, 2 clear examples of ego issues.  Ok so Harden did not start to play NBA on HOU , he first decided to leave OKC and abandon a ""championship caliber team"" because he wanted to be the number 1. On HOU he has worked with CP3 , Howard , Westbrook( the ones i can remeber) and with none of them it worked , sure it is not Harden's ego fault , not even a slightest  The fact that you resumed Kyrie ego issues to that only situation is outstanding to me lol, Kyrie left cleveland even before LBJ left because he wanted to  ""play in a situation where he can be more of a focal point and that he no longer wants to play alongside LeBron James."" (this is kyrie words btw)   So yeah , no ego issues from neither of them lol"
"This isn't the final form for the Nets, as the should be a gravity well for free agents by next season.  Getting a guy as good as James Harden, who I think is the only guy to finish top 3 MVP voting the last three seasons is otherwise worth what they gave up."
"Sixers are my east coast team, great game today. I’m Aussie so I’m a big Ben Simmons fan.   But no way Ballz trades his megastar for James Harden.  Edit: Tisse is my boy. That smile. That damn smile..."
why lol? we didn’t do right by him but it’s not like a James Harden or Kawhi situation....
"I think people need to understand even if Harden tries he just can't stay in front of quick players and dies on every screen, he doesn't have the lateral quickness or defensive stance whatsoever. Need to somehow come up with enough assets to move DeAndre for a switchable defender and play without a center, it's the only scheme that James can be an average to decent defender in."
James Harden is not top 15.
Joel “James Harden” Embiid
"Did anyone else laugh as it says ""James Harden, Power Forward"""

Nets: so how bout James Harden for Jarret Allen?
It is a big deal when you have fucking James Harden and kyrie Irving lol
"It wouldn't take a kings ransom. I get that LeBron is still the best player in the league, but he's also 36, and you're still getting back Kyrie and James Harden........."
"James Harden is a man of culture, what can I say?"
I'm starting to think James Harden paired up with Kyrie isn't very effective.
James Harden held Lu Dort to 30 points in game 7.   No excuses
I feel like you guys are not watching. Kyrie ain't the problem. James Harden is in some kind of funk...
"Dude, this is fucking James Harden you're talking about.  If Harden wants to score, he. will. score.   Everyone with half a brain knew Harden would play facilitator in that big 3 lineup because he is significantly the better playmaker than KD and Kyrie.   Harden will be acting as the PG going forward so he is trying to figure it out. Instead of blaming the loss on Kyrie, how about we just shut up and give them the time they need to figure out how they'll play?   The greatest yet most ball dominant players in this generation and y'all acting like shit is supposed to click from the get go."
James Harden isn’t depth and interior presence. I’m not saying they’re doomed to be .500 at best or that they won’t be great but come on. This trade wasn’t exactly the best
"They had a great bench, and then they traded most of it for James Harden."
"And for the second game in a row, the combo of Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen substantially outscored James Harden.  Wait, Harden started at power forward what the fuck?"
“I’ve made a huge mistake.” - James “G.O.B. Bluth” Harden
James “Gestapo” Harden
Yeah but Allen had to be moved for James harden who's levels and levels above allen
"Yup apparently trading some pretty good players for a perennial mvp candidate is mind boggling to some. This sub shits on players for making comments about their own teams being good for a few games. Then flips to significantly hotter takes based on even fewer games a couple weeks later. Do I think the Nets Big 3 will win a title together? No. Am I going to definitively declare this an awful trade and act like James Harden isn’t elite? Absolutely not. Way too many people in here are nearly as bad as Skip, except they aren’t paid to have bad opinions. They just have them."
Is it really mind boggling? They got James Harden. You can think they gave up too much but it shouldn’t be too confusing why they did it.
"I was like ''it is a bit late for this topic as its been a few days'' then I realized 'Oh yea, they do play the same teams back to back' and saw the score.  Man, can you imagine THIS be the playoff matchup? And THIS be the result?   'James Harden-PF' ... Jesus Nets, why?"
Yes as opposed to /r/nba's favourite player James Harden
"It’s for James harden. The issue isn’t talent, the issue is fit."
Y'all are crazy. It's been three games... They got James Harden. Chill for one second.
imagine if they could get james harden for the low price of ben simmons (who they won't win much with) and a few ok young players+picks
76ers will be unstoppable if they can get guard like James harden
This is from today? Does he want out already ? LMFAOOOOO please argue with James harden in the locker room
You can thank James Harden
I would do it for James harden
"He just needs to take fewer and better 3s and work his way up. He takes James Harden 3s when he’s not James Harden.   Even James Harden only shoot around league average on 3s since step backs are so hard, and he’s a way better shooter than Luka.   Like every 3 doesn’t have to be a stepback. He’s big and teams are already scared or him driving so he should be able to get hesi pull-ups or idk if someone on the team can give him hand offs like steph or even with screens like Lillard does."
But...but Reddit told me that Jarrett Allen gives the Nets a better chance of winning an NBA championship than James harden does.
"I'm feeling such deja vu when everyone used to say the same thing about James Harden, who then got Chris Paul lol"
James harden is playing basketball again too. Maybe Morey/Dantoni were the problem?
"Because defense is more of a team effort than ever there are barely any defensive players that can completely increase a whole ass teams defense to an elite level, but put lebron james in any team and that offense skyrockets. Before zone defense and analitycs where stablished it was more impressive to be a defensive force because most defense was one on one but now that teams are allow to play different types of zones and switching defenses it is more about the system implemented. Curry in 2019 was defeated by a box and 1 defense not because fred van vleet is a god of defense. Harden in 2020 wasn't stopped by the lakers elite perimeter defenders he was stopped because of their doubles and fast rotation. Put Gobert on the wizards and they are still a bad defensive team put lebron james and they become an above average offensive team."
"You're wrong. Ask James Edward's on Twitter. He wanted what he got from Houston. He wanted to be paid to stay on a non contender. If he wanted to go to a contender, he wouldn't have gone to Houston because Harden already asked out by the time he signed"
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.        That's not even including other contenders like Bam, Vic, Randle, Hayward, Tobi, Brogdon and Sexton."
We are going to have to defeat James Harden and the Nets in the 2021 Finals
"bro you think  john wall   james harden (la gonna trap him at half court again)  House  PJ  Wood  Cousins  Gordon  is going to beat  LBJ, AD, Schroeder, Harrell, Gasol, Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, THT? all they gotta do is double up Harden and the team will crumble like 2019. At least in BKN they can’t defend all 3 stars"
"We got 48 points in a quarter AND JAMES HARDEN MADE 0 OF THEM!  Fuck yes, this team is fun!"
[When the Rockets have to defeat James Harden and the Brooklyn Nets in the 2021 NBA Finals](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/578/173/f57.jpg)
lmaoo y’all still mad about getting fleeced for james harden
"Also Lebron is 11th all time in 3 point attempts, so it's expected he'd fall under a similar rank in makes.  And honestly, being high on he list of 3 pointers made doesn't necessarily mean you're an amazing shooter. In fact, half the guys in the top 10 are only in the decent to good range: Jamal Crawford (34.8%), Jason Kidd (34.9%), James Harden (36.4%), Paul Pierce (36.8%) and Vince Carter (37.1%).   Again, those guys and Lebron (34.6%) are all good shooters, but nowhere near the conversation of best shooters of all time."
"It’s been working because Harden has been willing to defer so far, and when he gets sick of KD/Kyrie shooting 🧱 he can take over the game himself.  James Harden is the best player on that team."
James harden is a known party man
I remember him playing a couple of games for us during the James Harden is God season. His “sharpshooting” did not translate to the NBA.
"I kind of lost my love for Luka just cause his fans are so annoying tbh. I still like the dude but everyone is acting like hes a superstar, top7 player and better than perennial all-nba 1st team players (james harden). Also acting like trae isnt even close to lukas level. Obv im generalizing but thats my experience"
"The Nets need a center, so they would be a better team with Mo Bamba instead of James Harden"
"Yeah I actually don't think Embiid can get to that level because his career has started so slowly compared to Hakeem's and Shaq's.  Shaq was a top 5 player in the league from the day he first stepped on the court, and had a few years of being unquestionably the best basketball player in the world, by a fairly large margin too.  Hakeem is considered by most to be the best defender that ever played basketball, and even in his second season was able to lock up Kareem in a playoff series.    Like you said, there's nothing to get mad about - it's like saying can Harden be as good as Jordan imo.  No he can't.  He's still great and will go down in history as a really great player but its just not realistic to think James Harden can be considered as good as Michael Jordan."
How the fuck is it a wash lol so what we gave a couple picks for Russ we traded him for 1 back and had james fucking harden for 8 years we shitted on them
Kyrie Irving and James Harden are going to start. They are the greatest backcourt of all time.
"It is because Luka actually moves the ball much more often than Harden.           Luka and Harden might have similar attributes (which is great, James is an alltime great), but it’s not really unsurprisingly that people prefer Luka’s game more often. You rarely see Luka holding the ball for the entire possession."
"Dude, Simmons for Beal would not make the team better. Simmons is one of the best players in the league at running an offense. Granted he does it in a unique way, his shooters always have open looks. Our offense would be so stagnant with Beal and Embiid since neither are very good playmakers. Also, Beal is one of the worst defenders in the league and is actually markedly worse than Harden on that end despite what people like to say about James."
Cousins with 5 turnovers a game is crazy..... WB and James harden are PGs who both regularly average 10 assists. Boogie doesn’t bring that
"I’m just glad we didn’t trade for Simmons honestly. We would have gotten like 2 late first round picks and some young players no one here is super thrilled for.   I just am curious who’s running your offense when you trade Simmons for Beal because Harden is one of the best passers in the league along with being arguably the best scorer. You’re telling me you’d rather have Beal than James Harden throwing embiid free lobs? Harden made Capela look scary, i can’t imagine what he’d do with embiid next to him. It’s like you haven’t watched Harden play, there’s a reason he’s considered a tier above guys like Beal. There’s an aspect to Hardens game that just brings winning, people can complain say all they want about him, but he’s a top 5 shooting guard of all time. Beal doesn’t come close to Harden and you’re crazy if you can’t see just how dangerous embiid and Harden surrounded by shooters would be."

"Ah, yes, because every team in the league has James Harden and Chris Paul.  Definitely the same situation on every team, and that's why Rudy is bad."
"Embiid has similar size to shaq but that's about it. Shaq was bigger, stronger, and faster. Shaq was like 7'1 zion. Embiid is really more finese than power. Embiid to me is going to probably go down as the best bigmen ever. I think he's a cross between Hakeem, Duncan, Dirk, and to a lesser extent james harden. People don't realize yet how advanced embiids footwork is, he's got stuff in his bag nobodies seen before which is what  reminds me of harden. Embiid also steals Hardens footwork on drives and if you listen to him talk about his game, he's always saying harden is his biggest influence.   All that seems like an exaggeration but it's not. He's so special it's absurd."
JAMES FUCKING HARDEN
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"Exactly. The irony is all of these talking heads keep saying he needs to get in the post more but the more he's in the post the more he's vulnerable to: offensive fouls usually from flops, ridiculously high amount of physical play allowed, double teams that come from blind spots causing turnovers, much more difficult passes overall. He's dominant in the post and still backs down more than anyone else but he has lessened that part of his game.   When he faces up: he can see the help and his shooters, he puts the big in a defensive position he is uncomfortable in, he goes from being allowed to have so much contact and force on him to basically being treated exactly like a perimeter player, meaning hands off and keep your distance while Joel sizes up this easy mid range J, and he can use his incredible quickness to go right by his defender because he is in a triple threat position.   This is a paradigm shift for Embiid. Similar to when James Harden stopped asking for screens (which often just brought a help defender to him) and started utilizing the step back instead to get his threes off."
"Lol not a single soul in this thread questions ""power forward James Harden"""
"Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the overrated trio. I’m going to keep saying it. I don’t care if it hurts your feelings.  Giannis Antetokounmpo isn’t a top 5 player in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Anthony Davis are better.  Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn’t the 2nd best player of the 2010s. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.   Luka Dončić isn’t a top 10 player in the NBA. Luka Dončić doesn’t have GOAT potential."
"Yeah so you guys would rather play against caris levert than james harden, KD, and kyrie? The ""trash package"" that would *never* get james harden trashed ya'll, embarassing."
"1. Actually they aren’t rotating them on a substantial level,  as seen by the fact all 3 are playing a ridiculous 40+ minutes  2. Yea you kinda left out 1 little detail about Kyrie playing off ball in Cleveland: they didn’t have a kevin Durant. In your comparison,  the co on-ball presence (Lebron) is harden. So while Kyrie and Bron could just take turns scoring all game, Kyrie and harden can’t do that. Which brings it back to my point about diminishing returns...  3. As you just explained Harden is on ball. But he’s not just on ball and able to do his thing, he has to get the ball to Kyrie AND KD. So he’s more of a traditional PG. So as PG that means he’s not averaging 30, 35 like he normally does. And if he’s not averaging 30-35, well then he ain’t “James Harden”.  Perfect example is Chris Bosh and Kevin love.  Both still good players obviously, but Bosh became a percentage of what he was before (they won a title with him scoring 1 point in a clinching game), and Love at the end became a straight up role player."
"""Russell, do you think James Harden is a max player?"""
"Because they have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving."
"kyrie been playing in the clutch the past few games, and nash plays him in a 4th quarter blowout when he has james harden lol. Tom tibbadeu actin azz boutta drose kyrie"
"The warriors are an example most people remember but there’s probably a series like this every year. That said, I don’t think an example featuring a dominant 1-seed regular season team featuring James Harden and another elite guard on the team whose incredible scoring suddenly fails them at the worst possible time is the *worst* example here."
He has James Harden bro. He’s literally a one man offense and is the best iso scorer ever. He isn’t injury prone like Kyrie so kyrie should never play more minutes than Harden. Ever. kyrie gets injured every season so I really don’t get what Nash is thinking
Nash really had Kyrie play 34 mins in a blowout with more mins than James Harden. Bro kyrie shoulda sat out the 4th. Dude is fragile as glass
James Harden lite
Damn didn’t know embid gets the James harden treatment.... pretty easy to score a lot when your getting these phantom calls.
"James Harden, Trae Young, Marcus Smart  Every possession ez fts"
I can understand wishing the best for Harden.   What I don't understand is why people are making such generalizations such as all rockets fans do xxx or yyy.   I also have trouble understanding how people can still defend James Harden after the way he acted. He literally stopped giving a shit and trash-talked his teammates on the way out. The way I see it is that you are a James Harden fan more than a rockets fan.
Here's a table of the seasons I'm sampling. Let me know if you can observe any specific anomalies from it.        |Year|Player|Wins|Conference rank|League Rank| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|63|1st|1st| |2018-19|Giannis Antetokounmpo|60|1st|1st| |2017-18|James Harden|65|1st|1st| |2016-17|Russell Westbrook|47|6th|10th| |2015-16|Stephen Curry|73|1st|1st| |2014-15|Stephen Curry|67|1st|1st|
James Harden in 2018-19 easily beats Kobe’s 2005-06 season both in terms of points per-100 possessions and efficiency relative to league average.
Lol you would think r/nba users would be a little more humble after insisting for months that the Nets didn't have enough for James Harden only for them to actually have enough for James Harden.
"This:     When Curry entered the NBA in 2009, the average NBA team attempted 18 threes a game. It hovered around that mark for the first three years of Curry's career until his breakout season of 2012-13 which just so happened to coincide with the NBA itself becoming more 3-point happy. The same year that Golden State's golden child set the all-time record for made 3s (a record he would go on to break multiple times in the coming years), NBA teams for the first time averaged 20 3-point attempts per game.  As Curry's shooting continued to explode and the [Warriors](https://ca.nba.com/contestant/golden-state-warriors/news/btbrq55c3e6btsf1z2poaakb4) transformed into a juggernaut, the rest of the league ramped up its efforts to keep pace with the free-wheeling Warriors. By the 2018-19 season, the fifth straight year that Curry's Warriors reached the NBA Finals, teams were shooting over 32 of them per game.  In that 2012-13 breakout campaign, Curry hoisted 7.7 per game and was the only player in the entire league to average at least seven. Care to guess how many players topped that threshold this season?  28.  There were 28 instances of something this season alone that had only happened a grand total of 28 times in NBA history prior to Curry's arrival.  Kids all over the world have spent the better part of the last decade emulating Curry in driveways, parks and gyms, a trend helped by the fact that Curry is about as physically relatable as any superstar in the history of the game. You can't just go in the driveway and uncork drop-step dunks. Or look in the mirror and pretend to be chiseled like LeBron. Even the famous tagline 'Be Like Mike' ignores the fact that it's utterly impossible to replicate the 6'6"" Air Jordan.  But anyone can heave as many off-balance 3s as humanly possible. Look no further than the NBA itself as James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and many others have followed in Curry's footsteps and leaned into the novel concept of 3 &gt; 2.  The 3-point revolution represents the biggest on-court strategic change in the history of the sport and there's no player more single-handed responsible for it than the original Splash Brother.  ""Seldom are game-changers idle."""
"Coming from the dude who also says ""Is James Harden washed? Or can he not handle being a third option?"" Lol maybe take a a little break from posting.   It just looks like you have some rough takes.   I suggest stop trying to be a troll because you aren't good at it lol"
6-4 record when John Wall plays. James Harden was still a member of the Houston Rockets in all 4 of those losses (2 losses against the second best team in the West).
Cavs are the biggest threat to Brooklyn after James Harden trade
It was the Ringer’s favorite way to construct their headlines. “The NBA Has a James Harden Problem” or “The NBA Has a TV Ratings Problem” etc
Teams tend to get better when they add James Harden
oh big BEEF JAMES HARDEN? I don't think Embiid scored when Harden has all that BEEF
"Bucks? I’m sorry but why the bucks? Cause of Giannis? Ok how are the bucks going to guard Kyrie, James fkin Harden and Kevin fucking Durant???"
&gt;Nets Are ~~Biggest~~ *a* Threat to LA After James Harden Trade  what he really said
That's just James harden with a different name.
"I also don’t think those guys you mentioned will be included in any trade as with a player considerably better than Beal in Harden the rockets did not get a player back that is as valuable as JJJ. They got possibly 1 year of Oladipo, two players worse than any of the players Memphis will offer and a bunch of picks and swaps. I would take Memphis’ young pieces with team control for longer than Oladipo and maybe 2 less picks/swaps over the package for Harden and that’s James Harden we’re talking about not Bradley Beal.  I understand the whole ticket selling perspective, but I think in 1.5 seasons or so you can have that right back with someone like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc."
"I mean, the Nets were able to land James Harden without giving up anyone as valuable as JJJ."
"Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Brad Wanamaker, Christian Wood, James Harden"
"lol James Harden averaged 40 over 40 games, not as clear cut eh?"
"Since I followed the NBA in the 2001-02 season, none of them.  Let's take a list in order: Tim Duncan 2 straight years, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash 2 straight years, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James 2 straight years, Derrick Rose, Lebron James 2 straight years, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry 2 straight years, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokuompo 2 straight years.  Not one time did I feel anyone else should have been MVP over them."
James Ennis owes Harden for his last couple of contracts.
"&gt; yeah if you sent James Harden to 1960 he might be the goat  The issue with that is, pull and plug scenarios never work because people making such assumptions ignore the development environment.      James Harden wouldn't be the James Harden as we know right now if he were born 60 years earlier. But people just assume as if Harden gets to born in 1989, develops his game in the late '00s, but plays against the '60s competition in their imagination.      It's not James Harden BTW. It just the general assumption about the scenario."
"for sure top 50. maybe even top 40, but people don't understand it's in relation to the league they played in. yeah if you sent James Harden to 1960 he might be the goat, but he's here now, so he's not. people who think James harden is better than, like, jerry west can gtfoh imo"
james harden did this like 6 times a quarter
"Yeah see the difference is.. kyrie is back and James harden is in the East and Jaylen Brown is on another level. 3 players with great stats(Kyrie and Brwon with great efficiency) and on winning teams. If it was like this last year trae wouldn’t have been a starter.  I understand he’s averaging 35 and if he was averaging 35 and his team was 6-9 I’d be cool, his stats actually mean nothing. He has 10 straight games of 40 points and a loss. This isn’t KD or LeBron or Kobe or MJ, guys that put up historical numbers and can lead a horrible team to a playoffs,  This is a 3rd option on championship team who decided he wanted to stay a first option and get money on a losing squad and now he cries every game. They’ve been trying to trade him for YEARS bro. I definitely think he’s an all star, but a starter? Hell nah"
Doncic Curry  Leonard  James Jokic  Beal  Harden  Durant Embiid  Giannis   Based off stats I think this is probably the most chalk lineup you can go with right now
All my homies hate James Harden
James Harden Put em' in a popcorn machine
"Houston's offense without Wood seems to be ""pass the ball to everyone and hope that one of them is James Harden"". Nothing but perimeter iso"
James Harden will be the Tony Gwynn of the nba.
"Hahaha man you are a narrative driven person, supporting your teams man. I gotcha fam, you do you.  All the numbers support Harden. Not really debatable. When you add narrative and circumstance (how many HoF on that 06 team? Wade, Shaq, Zo, Riley, payton, etc.) vs what has James played with and against?  You zero in on the one thing Wade has and ignore all other context and pretend Wade is better because his team was"
James Harden
"Couldn’t be Kyrie Irving. Kyrie Irving doesn’t care about individual awards. He’s a champion and winner.   I’m so happy to have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets. They care more about their team and winning."
"I agree it isnt pretty watching Harden heroball all the time, especially when teams figure this out in the playoffs and scheme directly to counter it. But statisically you want Harden to take those shots since his TS% doesn't drop much on increased volume, that was the basis of the entire Houston system.  He's also proved he can play the pure facilitator role, putting up multiple 12+ assist games and taking far less shots on the current Nets team.  James just presents a massive problem for opposing teams to solve, he's capable of dropping 50+ point triple doubles while fouling out several defenders which is completely bullshit.  Not to mention he's a stout defender when engaged that can switch 1-3 and possibly even cover PFs in the post with his low center of gravity as a 220lb guard.  I'm a diehard Jazz fan and I hate Harden as much as the rest of the fanbase but credit is due where its due. He's an offensive savant and all time elite scorer."
harden no winner!  KING JAMES WIN 4 RINGS 4 MVP!!  RESPECT KING!!!
"This is obvious sarcasm, but to ignore that the Heat was a team that HEAVILY benefited from the bubble last year by not having to play road playoff games with rookies, it's disingenuous. Miami is more likely to miss the playoffs than to ever replicate their bubble success.  There was Heat fans in this sub saying that they shouldn't have offered Tyler Herro and a package for James Harden, which is the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen, they are trying to be the '04 Pistons, but without being the greatest defensive squad of all time."
"Do you have a link?  From what I see, the site's player projections list Harden as an ""[MVP candidate](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/james-harden/)"" and Antetokounmpo as an ""[All-Star](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/giannis-antetokounmpo/)."" If you're just trolling... you can find funnier stuff to troll about."
"And if we ignore the fact that he had Shaq that would be really important but it's not. James Harden offensively is a pretty significant improvement offensively over Kobe and his number would destroy Kobe's if he hadn't gone to school for 2 years. Even with the 2 years of college he will.  Neither player was ever the best in the game, but Hardens peak has been higher."
"&gt;by your logic James Harden should have 4 MVP’s  At least the impact Russ, Steph and Giannis made individually were comparable to Harden. Don Mitchell winning would be like if Chauncey Billups won MVP for the mid 2000s Pistons."
"by your logic James Harden should have 4 MVP’s, but the only time this wasn’t the case (best player on best team) was 2017, I don’t like the idea incentivizing numbers over wins; Beal’s team literally has the worst record in the league"
"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn’t mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"
"You brought up Trae Young and his record last year. Kemba Walker was also an Eastern Conference starter. That’s a dumb argument. Were there Eastern Conference players last year playing as well as Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown? That were winning games as well?  The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal on this sub. I’m not even going to vote and Kyrie Irving and James Harden will easily be named Eastern Conference All Star starters. They deserve it too, unlike the overrated player that wanted to be in Washington and has the worst record in the NBA."
"Steph ""James Harden"" Curry."
"The Brooklyn Nets Big 3 is the greatest trio of all time. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving is just unfair."
"When I see him as the centerpiece for trade packages for James Harden and Bradley Beal, he is overrated."
1. MJ  2. Steph Curry 3. Kobe Bryant  4. Kevin Durant  5. James Harden 6. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 7. Tracy McGrady 8. Allen Iverson 9. LeBron James  10. Wilt Chamberlain
Kevin Durant should be the favorite to win MVP. Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. James Harden will lead the Brooklyn Nets in assists after the Oklahoma City Thunder game. Only way Kevin Durant doesn’t win MVP is because the media still hates him.
1. I haven’t heard Beal say one thing on the level of what James Harden has said about the rockets  2. we all know signing a long term deal in the nba doesn’t mean anything in terms of staying with that team   3. imagine you’re busting your heart to win and no one around you can carry your jock. Meanwhile you have delusional Russell Westbrook next to you who thinks and plays like he’s a top 5 player. Is the guy not allowed to be frustrated?   4. He could have signed the max not only For the money but to actually build something in Washington. They could’ve sold him on their vision and Washington was frisky with him and John wall for a couple seasons there.
Best Offensive Player(Scoring &amp; Passing) James Harden is the best in History  Best Scorer gotta be KD or MJ
"Yeah, but did you know that Lebron also made some poorly phrased comments about the China/Hong Kong situation?   The NBA has a real problem. Employing James ""literally Hitler"" Harden and Lebron ""literally Lucifer"" James is not acceptable."
"See other comment, I remember where I was standing when Mario Ellie blew the Phoenix Suns the kiss of death.  2014: clippers series 2017: kawhi dad ducked harden 2018: team with James scores 26 points in the entire second half  in a series close out game 6, then the 27 missed threes the next game 2020: pulled a clippers Series and gave up.  Care to show me when/where James Harden ever closed out a series for us in the crunch?  I can’t seem to find that anywhere.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J-9vIaMhm90"
"That guy didn't mention their ages at all, which was my main point. Most of Harden's best seasons are done, and if you buy him now you aren't getting any of that. All you're getting is 31+ year old James Harden, who could age like LeBron or he could age like Westbrook. There's significant risk on that end of the deal as well.  You can say ""there's no guarantee Wiseman will ever be great"" and it's true, but he's what? 20 years old? If he turns out to be an All-Star, you have maybe 10-14 years of elite performance. It's probably worth more than a short-term rental of a guy approaching the backslope of his athletic prime."
"James Harden has KD (top 2 player in the nba) and Kyrie now. This isn’t something you can compare to Harden playing with CP3, or Russ, or Dwight. There’s unprecedented offensive talent on the Nets. Btw Houston would’ve beat GS if CP3 didn’t get hurt. No one else came nearly as close to taking down that team healthy."
Thats a quicker step back the James Harden!!
His style honestly reminds me of James Harden but he won’t be as good obviously. I think he could be a tier B star like victor oladipo pre injury. I’m not worried about his shooting splits. Zach LaVine for instance had god awful ones and was regarded to be one of the worst players in the nba his rookie year. Edwards has a good stroke so I’m not that concerned. His shot selection will improve. He shoots decent from the line.  Right now he gets absolutely hammered driving to the rack and is learning to just play into the contact instead of using his insane athleticism to go around it and put up a bad shot. He’s still learning what works and doesn’t in the nba as he’s been a player so athletically gifted that college scrubs couldn’t impede him. I think his big question will be can he put it all together.
"What? I don't understand, why wouldn't you trade Wiseman for James Harden?"
"I think the Rockets may have declined that one actually. No way Heat don't trade Herro, some picks, and a couple other players for James fucking Harden"
&gt;Jesus fans online are annoying nowadays. People have to stop making everything championship or bust.  Do you think having james harden. Kyrie irving. And kevin durant in one team is a factor or is it completely manufactured by annoying fans
"Lol did you watch the 2019 playoffs? Harden averaged 35 and 7 on 60% TS and the series went 6 with every game decided by 6 points or less. This is with Chris Paul playing like garbage for 5/6 games BTW. Couldn’t beat his man, couldn’t create bc of the switching, bad efficiency, couldn’t keep up as much on defense etc. put lebron fucking James in this spot and what happens? Not to mention they get lebron James, an agile 6’8 athletic freak to throw at KD and he can be even more locked in since he knows James can score at will   This team would be *way* better then any of those cavs teams. The 2018 version of the rockets when Chris Paul was a step quicker and they had a couple more 6’8 bodies they had golden state down 3-2 won 65 games and would have won until cp3 went down.   Harden&gt;&gt;kyrie, he literally was reigning MVP and deserved it again for averaging 36 and 8, love was dog shit against golden state every round, capella &gt;&gt; Thompson, tucker, EG, house, rivers, all guys who played well against the warriors scheme. Harden + bron and all of them dismantle every team in the last 20 years, elite defense that can actually switch every action and iso/spread PNR the shit outta the other team for 48 mins"
But who's guarding james harden
"&gt;And Embiid is significantly more impactful to the game right now than harden.  All your points were completely reasonable and logical up until here  There's no world in which Embiid, especially in today's NBA (where Centers have the least impact they ever had), is *significantly* more impactful than the iron man that James Harden has been, even if we talk just this year  You can argue maybe he's a bit better, maybe slightly more impactful, but no... Harden's playmaking, scoring ability, shooting, gravity and (most importantly) durability outdoes Embiid's and makes him more impactful to the game than him."
James Harden is easier to hate
"No, no, no, your bias completely disqualified your ability to consider another opinion.  Jokic is having a better statistical season &amp; arguably performance overall than someone like LeBron. Does that mean he's a better player?   I don't see any sense in changing opinion of who's a better player after some regular season games. I think the only appropriate time to revise the list is once the season is over, unless it's a complete foregone conclusion (like Player A is an MVP candidate halfway through the year while Player B tore his ACL and is washed now).  And so far, Harden is still James Harden. Harden &gt; Embiid, but it's closer than ever, I'll give you that"
"Literally mfs are so wishy washy, like this shit was to be expected. Wait for buyouts or some trade or even next offseason to get a decent fucking 5 and then judge. We still got K motherfucking D, James Harden and Kyrie under contract and Dinwiddie is injured mfs need to relax"
"For real. In a game against the sixers this season the heat started herro, ollynyk, precious, gabe Vincent, and Duncan Robinson. They all played for close to 40 minutes each. Oh, and how can I forget about six man of the year, max strus. He really carried our offense this season. Can’t imagine how hard it must be for kyrie and James harden."
"I think if I added team win percentage as a predictor jazz players would be much more likely to make it. I couldn't figure out how to do that, however, because there are edge cases in the data set in which players are traded in the middle of the season, a la James Harden, and it becomes hard to decide what to do about their team win percentage. Average across the two win percentages? I could get a snapshot of their team win percentage before the date of the game as well, but the game date has varied year by year."
&gt;Did James Harden die or something?  Kinda
STOP BLOWING THE WHISTLE LET THESE KIDS PLAY      JAMES HARDEN ISNT PLAYING
"Steph ""James Harden"" Curry"
"Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and Taurean Prince who were all contributing on Defense to various degrees along with Rodions Kurucs who was relegated to the Bench.   They received James Harden who isn’t known for his Defensive skills and only recently filled up 3 Empty Roster Spots a month after the trade.    Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between the trade and Dinwiddie’s injury. Not to mention Sean Marks shitting the bed on the Bey for Shamet trade. Of course their Defense was going to be bad.   How many great high quality Free Agents are available to sign mid season? Nets can only do so much and so far Sean Marks hasn’t proven himself to be on the level of Morey when it comes to in season roster building.   Sean Marks gets a ton of his shine from hitting on LeVert and Allen back to back in the draft along with finding Dinwiddie and Harris in the trash bin. He’s been very limited in his drafting skills since 2016-17."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
He also flops and free throw hunts almost to the extent of James Harden.
nah its fine heat fans are just mad they chose tyler herro over james harden and couldnt throw money at giannis to leave a small market team  knicks heat beef is BACK
Is that Kent Bazemore or James Harden out there? /s
Did James Harden die or something? He should have been mentioned at least.
No James Harden on 'tier 2'?
I don’t think the goal was to have all 3 of em play together almost every minute Bc that wouldn’t work. It’s knowing you can take Kyrie Irving out and still have James Harden and KD in is what benefits them
"Just like Lebron's rookie year was compared to the immediate impact of Jordan on the Bulls, Zion's rookie year was compared to Lebron's immediate impact and hype.  The fact is, as great as Lebron was from 2003-2006, it wasn't until 2007 in the playoffs against the Pistons that he had his first IM HERE BITCHES moment and thrust himself onto the spotlight  as a potential legend rather than just a great player. This is despite ridiculous averages in his second and third year.  People need to keep the following names in mind:  * Steph Curry * Giannis * Kobe Bryant * James Harden  All of these guys are all time players that didn't show what they were capable of until their 3rd-4th years and only went up from there.  People need to be more patient."
"Who knows, he's 25 games into his rookie season. I wouldn't have thought you could build a contender around James Harden 25 games into his rookie season, and I would've thought you might be able to around Tyreke Evans."
"Jokic - can easily get Pts/Ast/Rebs while also having a chance at both Blks/Steals       LaMelo - good at getting steals, puts up pts/rebs/ast pretty easy       James Harden gets the TD pretty easy so maybe with less energy spent carrying offense he can get a big steal game"
"You ain’t James Harden baby, they don’t love you like that"
Our sub was calling flynn a god before he got sent to 905. Our sub thinks Matt Thomas is the solution to our problems. Our sub thinks james harden would be a bad fucking trade. Please
Dude LEBRON JAMES and AD are way different than jokic and harden
Remember that Nuggets fan really said they’d rather have Jamal Murray over James Harden.
"&gt; who would not help bring this team closer to a chip during   Lol you think Harden wouldn't have brought the Nuggets closer to a championship than Murray? Murray is inconsistent and can play like a scrub or a star depending on the night. James Harden plays like a top 5 player in the league every single night. The Nuggets would have been way better off maximizing Jokic's prime by putting Harden next to him. Also it was 2 years left on his deal with a 3rd year player option, not 1 year."
Remember when everyone on this sub said the Nuggets shouldn't trade Jamal Murray for James Harden
Our announcer called it the James Harden disease lol
"I never said it wasn't a foul. I just watch James Harden, Kyrie Irving and a million other guards do it every night without a call."
One is James Harden and the other is on the Cleveland Cavaliers
Lmao Suns broadcast called it the James Harden disease
he's disrespecting the heat for defending James Harden?  you sensitive bunch 💀💀
i would take tyler herro for him but we saw that the heat fans wouldn’t even trade him for bradley beal because apparently tyler herro has james harden potential or some shit so i doubt we could get him
&gt;What do you guys think about James Harden Jeff Green and Joe Harris and their attitudes towards the situation  It's hard to sympathize for any of the Nets big 3 when all of them have been caught not wearing masks in public
Yes because it was Tyler Herro + FRPs for James Harden that’s exactly what the trade was.
"They're incredible. Better than Harden mixtapes (though those are crazy too). Let me rephrase.   If a buddy texts me 'Steph Curry is heating up' I will do socially unacceptable things to watch that game.   If a buddy texts me 'James Harden is heating up' I probably won't turn on the game unless I'm bored. He could be on the verge of dropping sixty but it might be with 25fta. It's not guaranteed to be exciting and, sometimes, it's boring.  Right now if a buddy texts me 'Luka is heating up' I'll jump through a lot of hoops to watch it. But after that last game I'd jump through less.   The OP wasn't saying Luka is bad at basketball or that it's dumb that Luka passes. Rather, Luka should be must watch tv if he's getting hot. He's undoubtedly a superstar but he also plays unlike any other superstar we've seen. He has the potential to be one of the most exciting players ever. The foul baiting and constant complaining takes away from that. It doesn't make him worse at basketball, it might make him better. But it drowned out his incredible play in that last game and that sucks."
Kevin Durant and James Harden to the Celtics  Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson to the Nets  And we both give a second round pick to the Wizards because we feel bad.
James harden was great in the playoffs as a 3rd option. Where’d you come up with that?   He’s the reason the made the finals. He was only bad in the finals because he couldn’t stay away from the strop clubs in Miami.
&gt; If you can’t elevate as a number 2 there’s no reason to presume you’re capable of even being a number 1.  This is such a strangely inaccurate point to make. What correlation is there between playoff success as a second option and regular season success as a first option? James Harden wasn't great in the playoffs as a third option but he's been wildly successful as a first option in the regular season.
That’s James Harden iso efficiency 👀
"I agree that because lebron has been able to adapt his game we haven't seen much of a decline offensively. However I definitely think we have seen a decline on the defensive end.  I think his IQ allows him to still be a good off ball/help defender, and he can occasionally still show signs of greatness but over 48 min I think he's an average defender.   For example, in the finals against the heat, Jimmy was going at him over and over and LeBron couldn't stop him. They had to to have AD who's a C/Pf  on him for the final games.   Again, I'm not saving lebron is a trash defender, he's no james harden, but at one point he was elite and he's not anymore."
Celtics were the only decent team the sixers beat this week.   Beating James harden and some random dudes found in Brooklyn parks and Charlotte isn’t that special
"I saw James Harden play in Vegas in a strip club and he smothered the opposing customers for 90 minutes the entire time yelling ""I'll strip you"" in their faces. It made me anxious watching the strippers and he had like ten girls giving him lap dances at once."
You never know with heat fans. These are the same bunch that didn’t want to give up Tyler Herero and first round picks for James Fucking Harden.. Lmao.
"James Harden was bad in 2017 playoffs, especially against Spurs without Kawhi."
"Kobe played a blistering pace compared to someone like James Harden, and you know it. Also, Kobe and T Mac were the exception instead of the norm. Every single NBA team in 2021 has a primary Iso player as their main scorer, exception Jokic, who is an anomaly of historic proportions.  Also, no acknowledgment of the average number of threes at 35/game? Here's another one: league average 3PA in 2004 = 14.9. Teams are shooting more than double the amount of 3's now vs. then.   Reggie Miller isn't running around out there on every squad. It's guys iso-ing into their own shots. That's the league now."
Daryl morey should have traded James harden to the sixers for scraps before he left
"James ""Luka ""James ""The ""The Beard"" Beard"" Harden"" Doncic"" Harden"
James “Luka “James “The Beard” Harden” Doncic” “The Beard” Harden
"Y’all remember that foot locker ad with James Harden going undercover by disguising himself as AD?  And Davis is like “but I’m famous, too” and Harden just goes “I would disagree”"
PG- Nikola Jokic  SG- James Harden  SF- Kawhi Leonard  PF- Giannis  C- Joel Embiid
"I can just see him now, on the court, microphone in one hand, towel in the other. Screaming at a guy trying to guard James Harden or something."
James “Luka “James Harden” Doncic” Harden
Chiefs know what it's like to face James Harden now
"If we increase to 4, only two people qualify. James Harden and Jayson Tatum."
"&gt;Clearly stars are irrelevant.  I think this is the wrong conclusion, tbh. What we should actually be drawing from this is that Victor Oladipo is as good as or better than James Harden."
"Fuck yeah give the ring to James Harden, KD, Kyrie, Nash, MDA, Joe Harris. These dudes are real real. Heart of a champion."
Wow. James Harden
JAMES HARDEN WTF
I LOVE YOU JAMES HARDEN
THIS IS WHY YOU TRADE FOR JAMES HARDEN
JAMES HARDEN COLD BLOODED 3!!!!!
JAMES HARDEN THE FLAMETHROWER!!!!!!
"Harden stepbacks lets the 3 fly, bang! thats 40 for James Harden as he cuts the Suns lead back down to 28"
"Lmao James Harden took them to 7 games and almost won. The ""King"" basically got swept twice."
I don’t think OP means he is a James Harden level shooter. I think he meant they both have lower %’s because of their team role and shot selection.   It’s not that they take bad shots. It that their team situation encourages them to take tough shots to bail out offenses.
"Trae young, Luka doncic, James harden. These are my favorite players to watch"
"Bro if you really listened to Draymond, you would understand that he's mostly talking about the reactions we have to looking at player movement. When you complain about players trying to take their own career into their hands and asking for a trade but you have zero qualms when teams use them as literal commodities, it sort of dehumanizes them. James Harden wasn't wrong to want to ask to be traded. But people got on his ass about him giving up on the team and all that. Then you have people shitting on Bradley Beal because he wants to stay in Washington to try and succeed while they come up with garbage tier trades just to put him in a Lakers jersey or whatever. And it's likely because fans identify with their teams and don't look at how players themselves feel. They think that because most are paid in 8 figures that they aren't entitled to be satisfied with their job and work environment or to be given respect as someone providing the fans with entertainment.  Criticize players that push their actions too far (Kyrie and Harden partying in covid is totally fine to criticize). But don't criticize them for voicing displeasure with their situation while giving owners a free pass."
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
James Harden Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's unfair how they're all on the same team
"No it's not...at all. When a team trades a player it's to get better that day, or to accumulate assets for down the road to get better. Most fans who aren't 12 year old NBA 2K fan boys want their team to get better. It's not often when a James Harden demands a trade does that *help* the team he's playing for.   There's a big difference. But it's so funny how much the younger fans (I presume you are based on how you talk) really look at these players and feel bad for them, like they're these poor guys who are treated so unfairly."
The assets they got back is nowhere close to 1 James Harden.
"Huh? What are you talking about? James harden demanded he get traded to the nets, and he got traded to the nets.  The league didn’t just say “oh ok, looks like James’s career is over now since he doesn’t want to play for the rocket, well just replace him with the next star”"
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
"That’s not true though, an individual fan has almost no importance.  Someone like James harden had the power and leverage to get himself traded to the team he wanted to get traded to. This is an objective fact. James harden is more powerful than the rockets ownership, because he was able to leave the team to go to a different team.  I’m not sure why this is so hard to understand.  And to your point about replaceability, all of these owners are completely replaceable too. They didn’t start the league, they can just be replaced with another rich guy if they don’t want to own a team anymore"
Idk how people don’t understand this. Comparing James Harden to Drummond is just dumb. Harden got everything he asked for in terms of changing the team and then forced his way out. Drummond isn’t earning his contract and they’re looking to move him. I understand what Draymond is trying to elude to but this ain’t it lol
It’s quite odd his argument bc he technically glorified James Harden dogging it.  I mean in all honesty I think you play to win games not politic for a better team.
James Harden was contractually obligated to play
"Bro, are we really about to pretend that NBA players and normal employees are anything the same?  Take James Harden, I can’t just tell my job I want a new one and then fuck around until I get a new job.  NBA players are mad entitled and they don’t represent you and me...."
"These comments are sad and show a lack of understanding for the business-side of the game. Teams cannot be fined or punished for coming to an agreement with a player to sit them because they are in trade talks, and it is in the CBA that players have certain obligations that we have seen violated in the James Harden and Anthony Davis asking-for-a-trade-publicly sagas. I honestly can’t see what Draymond doesn’t understand here."
"The comments Draymond is making dont support the overarching “point”. His rant can basically be boiled down to: it’s not fair that the Cavs get viewed as reasonable while players who sit out (James Harden) get viewed as a villain. The reason is simple: because the Cavs and Andre mutually agreed to hold him out.   There is a “point” that teams and players are not always treated with equal fairness in the media, but this rant does not actually address that issue. That’s why it’s nonsense."
"Idk man. Yes I agree that players deserve respect &amp; dignity. They deserve the freedom to speak their minds as well without constantly being fined. BUT......I think the players have gotten out of control. The league needs to step in &amp; do something about the rampant disregard players now have for their commitments to teams &amp; their contracts. It’s a contract. It says you will get paid X million to play X years for X team. You can’t just decide your team sucks &amp; you want out whenever you want to. Players cant be demanding trades left &amp; right in order to go join up with their buddies. That’s just not how the game is meant to work.   And if the situation was reversed, guys like Draymond would be HEATED &amp; demand something be done. For example, if the situation with Harden was reversed &amp; Houston just said “You know, we just dont think this is working out James. We are gonna not pay you the rest of your money” what would we all say? We would say thats BS &amp; they signed a contract &amp; agreed to pay him. It would go to court &amp; easily be dealt with in James favor. When you sign a contract, you are making a legal commitment to each other. These latest examples of AD &amp; Harden reneging &amp; demanding trades with time left on their contract should concern the NBA &amp; the teams. If the younger guys like Luka, Trae, Tatum, Zion, etc see these older guys backing out of contracts &amp; basically getting their way in the end, they will follow suit &amp; contracts will mean nothing anymore. All the great players will just team up with their friends &amp; get rings that mean nothing. The league needs to stop this before it gets out of hand."
"I wasn’t angry about James Harden demanding a trade out of Houston, or not being respectful of his team.  I was angry at James Harden for flouting health and safety rules during a deadly pandemic to go to huge strip club parties where no one is wearing a mask, because he doesn’t think the rules apply to him.   KAT’s next family reunion is going to be at a cemetery, and James Harden is acting like one of those grocery store Karens. Fuck that guy."
"anytime a basketball player speaks more than two sentences this sub goes crazy calling them ""articulate"" lmao. ""james harden got castrated""???"
Scrolling through the comments looking for someone to say this. Thank you. No one clowned James Harden for wanting a trade. He acted completely unprofessional and irresponsible during a pandemic. Not to mention he’s had several guys traded away over the years for players he wanted...only then to complain about not being surrounded with the talent he needs to win this last year. The rockets spent years giving him different elite players to work with. They had good runs but unfortunately it didn’t pan out. He also had a lot of agency there? They tried a lot of stuff to keep him happy. I understand the owner is shit but that does not take away from the particular wha he forced his way out. It’s not like they didn’t make the effort for him though. He didn’t even give this year a shot and they picked up both Wall and Wood. Not at all the same situation as Drummond. No idea why this is getting so much praise like it’s some super enlightened take.
"True, and it's how corporate masters keep workers in a subservient mentality. Some journalists and other people will do their dirty work by calling Draymond, Andre Drummond, James Harden, Kyrie ""entitled"" or mock them for taking a child's game seriously. For example, Stephen A. Smith a few weeks ago ranted that Kyrie should retire if he doesn't want to play (do what the corporation demands) every night. But this happens to highly skilled, gifted workers like them or regular, average, mediocre (but still nice people) like us. Like, how dare you not do what the corporation demands! It's how they keep power and they will send the Stephen A's of the world out there to make fans angry and direct their rage at the players not the failing yet financially thriving organizations."
"I agree with you — Draymond acts like the NBA is a charity. The team pays Andre Drummond millions of dollars; if his value comes from being traded, then there is nothing wrong with holding Andre back from playing while still paying him millions of dollars.  If James Harden were paying the Rockets millions if dollars to play for them, I’d agree with Draymond’s point."

"1. Players get labeled as cancers if want a change in situations meanwhile teams are openly trading players and expecting players to stay in shape and remain professional as they bench and trade them.  2. Organizations don’t get held to the same standards as players. Kyrie took time off for mental health during stress times and the media went crazy, Stephen A Smith called for him to retire. Sacramento  literally traded DeMarcus Cousins after the all star game and he found out during an interview.   3. Players get ridiculously fined for tampering when it’s a player driven league.  I mean he’s right, player like jimmy butler, James Harden, and Kevin Durant get labeled as cancers for wanting out when a lot of the blame has to go towards organizations."
"Straight up. [This article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30528130/inside-james-harden-houston-rockets-breaking-point) is pretty much a hit piece that convinced people Harden was all sorts of bad teammate while also being the GM. Meanwhile they “couldn’t find the right package” for him for 2 months, then the season starts and we begin hearing how they want to keep him. It’s not until he outright says “this team’s no good” and looks like an asshole that a 4 team trade happens immediately to ship him out.  That’s the way more interesting point that people seem to be missing: teams play games like this to protect/benefit themselves all the time. It is different from Drummond’s situation but Draymond was pissed and ranting."
"There's posts in this thread talking about how the ""middle class"" (lmfao) of players don't have enough power. Like wtf? You guys want someone like Marcus Morris having leverage over an organization like he's James Harden? And people don't think that would be bad for the NBA? Give me a break..."
"Because a team sitting out a player doesn't violate its obligations to him, as long as they keep paying him.  But when Harden refuses to report to the team in order to force a trade (which is the crux of the issue here), he is violating his obligations to that team.  &gt;when guys like James Harden and Anthony Davis give 60% effort  Perfectly legal. As long as you don't behave unprofessionally (and that includes leaking trade demands to the media), you're free to half-ass games to your heart's content and I wouldn't say a thing.   But that's not what Dray is saying here. He's directly speaking about players sitting out, publicly demanding trades and generally being douchebags while violating the terms of their contracts."
"If you wouldn't say that James Harden is much better than Ben Simmons, then I'm sorry but you don't understand basketball."
He could be 18 and you still trade him for Harden 10/10 times. I dont know how this is even a conversation.  Tyler Herro is a good player. James Harden is an all-time player.
"I disagree. It's not a double standard or treatment of the players. In fact, players get away with a lot of shit, The Anthony Davis saga or the James Harden saga shoudn't have happen.  A player shoudn't be able to say ""I wanna leave, oh you won't let me go then I'm gonna show up out of shape, tank my value, boicot the team, play like shit, complain to the press, complain to my teammates, etc"". Yet, they do, and the only punishment they get is people talking shit about them.  Team pay a ton to have those players, and they have the disadvantage that if said players doesn't want to play anymore he can sit and the team is unable to fire him because they lose big time if they do something like that. Teams should be able to say ""we're moving from you, we'll find a deal that works for us"" and that's the end of the story, because they're the ones putting a lot of money into you to be a professional. That being said there are things that should change, like players shoudn't learn about them being traded during a game, or a random interview, or on Twitter, but they SHOULD be criticized and heavily punished for doing stuff like the Harden or AD things, yet they don't."
"Okay but neither of those things have anything to do with basketball. I personally think curry is the better all around basketball player and has a better leader mentality. In no way do I think James harden is bad. He’s one of the most offensively gifted players in the league. Curry is on a different level when it comes to 3 point shooting. I also believe curry is a better team player, not saying harden isn’t. They’re both amazing top tier talented players, and honestly arguing who is the better player is stupid. Steph curry had the blessing of playing all those seasons with one of the best 3 point shooters ever in klay Thompson, James harden never had a player by his side like that. Add on draymond green, and a handful of consistent role players who fit the system well, and you have one of the best teams in the league. Arguing Huston and Golden State were equal is going to come with bias, because it’s simply not true, the warriors were always the better team."
"Definitely not, the dude had like 35pts in game 7 and had a very solid series and averaged like 30 on good efficiency with solid assists and rebounds, you can’t expect James harden and role players to beat fuckin steph/klay/kd/dray. The no title is definitely Mainly on the cp3 injury. The rockets got absolutely fucked by the refs in game 7 as well in one of the worst reffed games ever. I seriously don’t know now anyone could blame James harden for losing when cp3 is the one who got hurtt. Cp3 got hurt multiple times on the rockets and harden had to carry the shit out of them and at the end of the day cp3 got hurt at the absolute worst time ever likely costing them a title. 2nd yr on the rockets harden balled out against the warriors and cp3 looked like shit most the series and capela was embarrassingly bad, if cp3 played like he has last 2 yrs or his first year as a rocket they’ve got a pretty good shot, so again definitely not Harden’s fault. So ya If the new diet is the main thing that’s been keeping him healthy then if he changes his diet 2 yrs earlier and it keeps him healthy for the rockets they prob have a title.regardless the no title thing is on cp3s body not harden and The next year it was on cp3 lookin like a shell of himself the majority of the series, couldn’t even shake dude like looney isoing 1on1. Love cp3 hes a legend but he’s a lot more of the reason rockets didn’t get past those warriors and win a ring than harden is"
"In 2015 they were equally talented 4-1 Warriors  2019 no KD, still choked seems like it's not a talent thing it's a James harden doesn't show up thing to me"
"i mean in general. before the trade the consensus here was ""fuck james harden"""
He’s saying look at the reaction to what those players did vs the reaction when did teams do things like wheel and deal. Hence him mentioning that James Harden got crushed for dogging it. Teams don’t get the same level of criticism for how they treat the players.
"Wait, you're the guy who unironically thinks James harden is better than Steph aren't you"
"I don’t understand why there’s so much media emphasis on Harden “changing” his game. Any Rockets/Harden fan can tell you that he’s the same player. The dude was the assist leader in 16’-17’ when he played PG. This isn’t new. Being part of the 50-40-90 club is dope though. If I recall correctly he said that was one of his goals back in 15’-16’ season I believe.   [Yep, found it.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/james-harden-looks-to-go-off-ball-to-join-exclusive-50-40-90-club/amp/)"
we didn't bend over backwards for him more than any other team caters to its star/stars (as we saw with the kawhi/pg13 articles this offseason and as i'm sure cleveland/LAL have done for lebron).  i don't know why people think trading for good players is catering to james harden.
Says the guy whos posts are 99% about James Harden...
Meh he had got a lead on the goat warriors before his injury. No title is on james harden choke jobs imo.
Kyrie Irving is a better pure scorer than James Harden
"I would have too, James harden is a bitch and a quitter"
"Except there was no facts spitting here.  James Harden is a bitch. My petty ass would have sat James Harden all 3 of his remaining seasons under the Houston contract. Enjoy your money, punk ass bitch."
"It's called signing a contract, Draymond.  I don't understand what the issue is. Teams have the leverage when the player is under contract. The player literally belongs to the franchise for as long as the player is under contract. Houston didn't have to trade James Harden at all. Houston was under no obligation to trade James Harden. James Harden signed a 4-year deal after the 2019 season for $171,131,520 with all of the money GUARANTEED.   And then James Harden pouted and wanted to play with his ""friends"".  Yeah.. Fuck James Harden for that move."
"James Harden was out partying w/o a mask during training camp, showed up late to camp w/ no explanation, and then publicly criticized his team. Kyrie went AWOL on his team, without even telling his coach what was going on.   That is unprofessional, and the team had nothing to do with creating those situations."
"I 80% agree with Draymond.  James Harden totally deserved the flak his was getting, he showed up late and out of shape to practices and was pouty and bitter to all of his teammates till he got out. Over the years the Rockets had given him basically everything he wanted (Dwight, CP3, Russ, an offense constructed entirely around him, and hundreds of millions of dollars) yet he still couldn't get it done for them. Nothing wrong with wanting to be traded but he handled his exit in such a bratty, snobbish way IMO."
Seems like Kyrie had a mental health crisis and James and Harden acted respectfully until their team didn't listen. You're kinda proving his point not being understanding and just choosing to see the athletes as unprofessional instead of the media (and fans) lashing out on players for being fucking human and ignoring the team's part in creating the situation (for Harden and AD).
“Castigated” not “castrated.”   Great post game commentary regardless but I don’t think he meant that James Harden had his nuts chopped off. Kind of works that way too though...
"Neither would Jimmy Butler. And James Harden wouldn’t put up very spectacular numbers. It’s a good way to play the game, you can’t hold that against Trae"
"I love Draymond, and I get what he’s saying about pulling Drummond from games, Barnes being told he’s been traded mid-game, etc. Fully agree that players should not have to deal with that bullshit. The Drummond news is especially strange, Idk if I’ve seen that before.  But as for the comparisons to people criticizing James Harden, Kyrie, and Anthony Davis, I don’t see it. Those guys weren’t criticized for requesting trades or because their mental health was off. They were criticized because they didn’t handle their situations professionally, straight up. I don’t think you can pull those stunts and be free of punishment/criticism.   Player empowerment is awesome, but those guys handled their situations poorly."
I just heard James Harden is castrated. Missed everything else.
Yes but it’s not like Simmons is James Harden and operating around the 3 point line getting ready for step backs which are gonna have Gobert lost.   You know he’s gonna try and slash to the rim which Gobert specializes in. Rudy was a good matchup on him. Still funny though.
"That's my only issue. Fans exacerbate this issue by trashing guys on social media. Like, what's the issue with wanting a trade? Or wanting to trade someone? Typically players don't walk out the door for free. It's better than holding onto someone that clearly wants to move on as we just witnessed peak toxic James Harden lol"
Therein lies the problem that Dray is attempting to expose. Why is it acceptable for teams to do this for the reason that you stated but when guys like James Harden and Anthony Davis give 60% effort for teams they’re not committed to anymore it’s the end of the world?
There's more threads about Draymond Green's statlines than there are James Harden
james harden hearing he got castrated like 😅
"James Harden is a better passer than Jason Kidd. There, I said it"
James Harden going to be adding to his triple double count this season hard
Imagine not trading for James Harden
"if you think scoring 42 once is a big deal, wait til you hear about how james harden averaged 42 over 3 months."
It is well documented that Dwight Howard refused to run the pick and roll as much with James Harden and wanted to prove a point that he had more to his game and decided to post up more (this was at the peak of Shaq bullying him)
"James harden had scott brooks too, and then Kevin fucking mchale lol. Durant had brooks too. At some point you have to admit it’s the player"
JAMES MFN HARDEN
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
"&gt; i think so, but i think the same for all top-10 level guys.  I remember Joakim Noah was top 5 in mvp voting one year. A lot of it is based on narrative. I have little doubt that Luka will win MVP one day because of how much volume stats he puts up and how great of coaching his team has.   &gt;a range or level you think luka actually is vs. what people think he is?  Last year Luka started with like 60% TS and the Mavs were like a middle of the road playoff seed team at the very start of the year. His reputation immadetly went to a top 5 MVP player and he carried a lot of that reputation for most of the year despite his efficiency cooling down and his team going down the rankings. His stock is lower than this point of the season last year. The Idea that Trae may be a comparable player wasn't even entertained but this year at least it is discussed. However, the Mavs got on a slight tear where Luka did amazing recently. I think prior to this year people thought he was a top 5 player but he is like a top 12ish player. I think he is considerably worse than those players who can play both sides of the ball like Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis, and Embiid, and he is also worse than those players that can both play make and shoot well like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard. I think he is closer to Kyrie Irving than he is to James Harden in terms of how good he is."
"I actually agree with you here. Harden can straight up carry a team. He's a one-man wrecking crew. Curry has never had to carry a load like that until this year. We'll see how this year goes, but I'm not expecting them to be a top4 seed like the Rockets were.   I was just saying that the best possible version of a Steph Curry team is better than the best version of a James Harden team"
James Harden believes Scott Foster doesn't like him so good luck to the Nets when Foster is officiating.
"Jordan, KD, Kobe, Steph, Harden. HMs: LeBron James, Karl Malone. Jordan was exquisite. If you watched him in his prime, you remember. He was the MVP every year. KD is unreal. With MJ/Kobe effort from the beginning of his career (more assertive, killer instinct), he could have made a case for best ever. Probably won’t by this point. Kobe was exquisite. His prime was filthy, and it lasted for years. Steph. During GS’s insane run, Steph (and Klay) sat the fourth quarter for weeks at a time. When you’re up 30-35 points going into the fourth every night, it demonstrates just how potent Steph and that team was. Imagine if they played him 6-8 minutes more per night during that run. We’d be having “Harden” discussions about Steph. Harden. When he’s not drawing contact, manipulating the rules, making the rule “work for him”, when he’s just straight balling, he’s amazing. But I can’t get behind his style. And I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks this way. It’s not hate, I promise. I recall him playing well into games where he had no business being in. The coaching staff would put him back in up 18-20 points to “get to 30”. That’s whack. Style matters. Presence matters. Hopefully his Nets run is more like he’s been recently. I’ve enjoyed watching him of late.  LeBron’s offense the last several years, on top of  his assist/rebound dominance, is really beginning to shift my opinion of best ever. I think he’s going to have to retire for me to take an objective look. He’s adding to his case every night. Karl Malone from 88 to 98 was a monster. 51% career FG%. Career 25/10. Played for 60 years...fuhgetuhboutit."
"And now I just hear “James Harden, definitely had a pre-game meal” every time I see them"
"Wow, can't believe you would openly support a dude who wears Blue Lives Matter paraphernalia. You're part of the problem. James Harden has knowingly spread covid. James Harden is a killer"
"&gt;But Steph is an S-tier character while he has the ball and is also S-tier without it  What? S-Tier typically means the best you can possibly be, and he isn't on that Lebron or Harden level of offensive talent on ball. His passing, while good, is nowhere near theirs. Nor is his ability to break down opposing defenses on ball. He can't be rated S-tier at something he both does not do very often (hence the surge after Draymond returned) nor does at the level of the actual S-Tier players.  &amp;#x200B;  And right now, Harden is playing with Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's still better for him to be on ball than anyone else on the team. He's averaging the most assists in the NBA by a lot while putting up a very efficient scoring season. You can't hold what he does off ball against him when the only person in the NBA that might be better than him on ball is Lebron James. It's just not an indictment on him that he's so good at running an offense.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Harden himself awknowleged you can't really win playing that kind of hero-ball  This is a mischaracterization of the point. He had to play that kind of basketball to win *when his teammates were that injured.* He is clearly very capable of not playing hero ball. But when you don't have the supporting cast to make it worthwhile, you do have to if you want to win. Look at how Harden's old teammates are doing without him running the show for them"
"Every time I try to make this argument people s*** on me and say that shot selection is an important part of being a good shooter, which it is, but it's important to know that what James Harden and Luka are doing isn't actually trying to take shots.   I also kind of view it as the concept of the free play that you sometimes hear talked about in the NFL where the quarterback recognizes too many men on the field and throws it down field because if he scores it counts if something bad happens they get to redo.   Luka tries to bait foul calls because if a shot goes in that counts and he shoots for bonus points and if it doesn't then he get to shoot free throws and the shot didn't really count.  Also when your favorite shot is a step back that's going to make your percentage look worse than you are as a shooter because that's just a really hard shot that you take more often than you should because you like it"
"There’s quite a few ways actually just like all the reply’s say  The biggest one is he just takes difficult shots. His 3s are often contested and off the dribble.  He was also a better 3 point shooter in the past  Do u think Arron Gordon and cam Johnson are better 3 point shooters than James harden, cuz they shoot a higher %."
James Harden
"Ever since I saw James Harden score all over an intense Kobe in the drew league, we been known he’s a real one. Just needs a ring to be cemented into history forever. Might even get finals MVP on this Nets team."
"It isn't dumb in any facet if your goal is to win a Championship. 2 years for a bonafide superstar who elevates everyone around him instead of a lower tier allstar who won't ever be as good as James Harden. This is a no brainer if you wanna win; I'm tired of homers insulting Harden with thinking Brown (or even worse, Heat fans with Herro) are worth more than Harden  Only someone as stupid as a Celtics fan would covet all his worthless assets in the hope they'll all develop into major Championship contributors on your team instead of taking the necessary risks to win a Championship. You're all over doing damage control for Ainge because you're coping with the fact your philosophy has majorly failed. **Most of these assets in the past 5 years haven't panned out to be Championship core pieces or have left and done even better after leaving Boston, like guys like Terry Rozier.**   Dumping Kemba, and a couple of picks along with Brown as the centerpiece would be more than enough for Harden and Tucker, but you guys scoffed at the idea because why would you trade your 'young core' for a bonafide Top 5 player over the past 6 years? What a stupid idea. You guys are so insistent on fleecing teams and hoarding picks you won't even make basic, common sense moves like a S&amp;T with a player who's gonna leave anyway for a Center who's a perfect fit your team because you held out to try to get even more than what you were offered.  The only contenders are the ones who took real risks to win a Championship. The Lakers did with AD, the Clips did with PG to assure Kawhi's signing and the Nets did with James Harden... and it's going to work out for any one of those teams this year, and it already has for one of them last year.  Remember this, because this is the last time I'm gonna talk about the Celtics situation; Jaylen Brown (along with Tatum) is the one who'll be gone in a few years anyway (through a trade or FA) when he realizes he isn't winning shit with your obsession with hoarding warchests of assets instead of taking the right risks. **The Thunder thought they would had Russ, Harden, KD and Ibaka for longer**, who are muuuuch better than what you have now, and they left before they ever won a Championship. What makes you think it won't happen to you?"
Metta World Peace elbowing James Harden
lol if they think James Harden is going to Atlanta and not going to a strip club
"Because he doesn't really shoot them. There was a play this year where someone got him a wide open corner 3 (everyone's favorite shot) and Doncic went ""oh I have the ball again time to do my thing"". He's my favorite player so no hate but I don't think he's exactly an off ball menace/shooter. He's good at what he does and that's James HArden ball but with better vision and a better perimeter defender (but worse post defender)."
"This is a terrible take. Maybe if your the Lakers you can do this because your team always gets the big free agents based off of location alone but it’s mind numbingly stupid to give up Jaylen Brown, a 24 year old player on contract for the next 43 years for James Harden, a 31 year old who probably wouldn’t stay with the team."
"Definitely. James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kywie Irwing are all top 15 players. no other team in the league has three top 30 players."
Chris Paul  James Harden  Carmelo Anthony  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Patrick Ewing
"Steve Nash, James Harden, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing"
"Disagree. Joe Harris is not essential offensively on a team that has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Kevin Durant. Your offence will be elite with or without Harris. Meanwhile you defence is turnstile regardless of who’s on the floor."
"Well. LeBron did that in 2011. Kobe did in 04. Magic Johnson did, Larry Bird did. Kevin Durant has, and James Harden has. Dame has had some awful playoff performances. It happens to all superstars, even the clutch ones. Kyrie hit the greatest or second greatest NBA shot of all time while averaging 27 PPG in finals series though."
Defenders should be able to hold their ground. There space. That includes vertical space.   If I’m backpedaling and keeping pace while you drive at basket and shoulder dive into my chest knocking me to to the floor to “create space” for an easy layup... that an offensive fucking foul.   All the greats find ways to find the loopholes to the rules. Kobe mastered ripping through your hands for a jumper.   Lebron does the shoulder thing. He also had a nasty and I mean NASTY forearm that’s an offensive fucking foul every time but he’s just “mastered the paint”.   James Harden mastered the flop for a few years but created the step-step back. Every league I ever grew up playing on that’s a travel.   Equally tough defense and offense is what makes basketball great.   Jordan pushing past the Pistons wouldn’t have been nearly as great back in the 80’s/90’s because they kicked the shit out of him defensively. And he took it to them offensively. When he finally overcame it was AMAZING.
dame isn't exactly known for his playoff runs  &amp;#x200B;  you know how easy it is to force a switch to get him off you if you're a james harden?
"OK, let's use your example then. Assuming that Kyrie is injured in the playoffs, who are you trusting among your PG to run the offense? The lineup would be Brown/Shamet, Jrue, KD, Green, Allen. Do you trust Brown or Shamet enough?   Then say if KD is injured. How far do you think a team of Kyrie, Jrue, Harris, Green, Allen would go in the playoffs? Even ignoring the fact that KD and Kyrie have significant injuries in the past couple of years, this team wasn't going anywhere if either player misses significant time.   Having Harden is a luxury, sure. And they probably need an interior presence soon but there is no way that getting role players, even very good ones like Jrue or PJ Tucker is better than getting James Harden"
If you are or anyone else is interested you might be thinking of josh hart guarding james harden with his hands behind his back
Wait what? Harden as in James Harden?
Drummond attempting to play basketball with Kyrie and James Harden would be a beautiful mess to watch.

I wish I lived in the alternate timeline where Houston was so petty they refused to trade Harden and I got to see a 360lb James Harden waddle to the free throw line
"Somewhere, James Harden just looked to the sky, as if he was given a sign. A nearby ref, seeing the patented head snap, awarded him two free throws."
"Nope, Luka went from overhyped MVP bookie preseason to the most underrated top 5/10 player in the league.  ---  BPM  1. Jokic 11.1 2. Embiid 8.7 3. Luka 7.6 4. Giannis 7.5 5. Curry 7.4 6.

"I'm telling y'all, no one watches the Rockets except Rockets fans. It's the only explanation for all these people having sudden realisations that James Harden can pass or that he makes his team better when he joined the Nets."
this is because hes played the most games out of the high usage stars. James harden is leading the league in mins right now around 38. Lebron is tied with gordon hayward for 17th in mpg. Part of this is the lakers scheduling and a lot of guys have had covid etc. Hes still among the top but i dont think is quite as accurate description of how much hes played relative to the league. Other guys are also playing a bunch
"Kevin Durant would have been my pick until they added James Harden, had Kevin played more consistently of course"
Devin Booker over Paul George  Trae Young over James Harden
I agreed with the zion booker takes until I saw [this](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-all-star-game-2021-damian-lillard-james-harden-among-reserves-selected-by-leagues-coaches/)
According to [cbs sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-all-star-game-2021-damian-lillard-james-harden-among-reserves-selected-by-leagues-coaches/)  The wildcards are PG and mitchell.
Didnt James Harden have a bouncer and others beat up Moses Malone Jr. at a strip club bc of a facebook post?

"I'd say they are even rn, harden deserves the most credit for their recent run but the narrative will always be on durants side coming off the tear. If kd plays a similar amount of games to harden for the rest of the year I think kd would be above james in the race."
James Harden is good. He does magic with whatever cast you give him
"What makes it even more ridiculous (especially with the media) is that apparently Bradley Beal, playing for the 11-17 Wizards, deserves to start ahead of Zach LaVine (who's also setting milestones for Chicago that were unheard of since Jordan last played for them in 1998; Chicago is also 8th right now and not 13th) and James Harden (whereas having been traded during the season somehow ""lessens"" his viability as an All-Star starter)."
Nah Steph is both better and greater than James harden.
Good. Fucking hate watching Trae Young play. Baby James harden the way he works the referees. Fuckin terrible watching that prick flop about on a nightly basis.
Only reason it's not the rim is bc of the 1/1000000 chance of the james harden situation happening again
"that's former 6th man of the year James Harden to you, pal"
and some really good role players like James Harden and Kyrie Irving to compliment those stars
Kevin Durant is robin to bruce brown . James harden is Alfred and kyrie is a custodian
Blessed to have 2 MVP caliber players: James Harden and Bruce Brown
James Harden throwing lobs to Bruce Brown is not what I expected in 2021

Lol James Harden is a reserve tho....
Are you president of the james harden fan club
James Harden drives slowly to the hoop..... [Refs](https://image1.masterfile.com/getImage/NjQwLTAyNzcxMTYxZW4uMDAwMDAwMDA=AIy5xc/640-02771161en_Masterfile.jpg)
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
"I'm making a point about efficiency and your response is ""who cares who shoots the ball better"" lol.  James Harden had games where he shot 10/35 last year and still had a higher TS% than some players on the court because he got to the line 15 times. Is that really ""better"" for the team? Debatable."
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"I think to be an all time great he has to either develop elite defense like Lebron, Kobe, and Michael Jordan all have or he has to get elite efficiency like Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, or James Harden have who averaged &gt;61% TS for their career. To me averaging more rebounding then them doesn't really help his case too much as it isn't too important for frontcourt players."
james harden has entered the chat
I was a rockets (James Harden) fan during the warriors massacre man. I feel your pain.
Losing side from the Rookies game has to pole dance and Governor James Harden gets to judge.
might be on a Harden-esque trajectory (not saying he's going to be James Harden but could have a similar career path where he starts as a role player off the bench and slowly gets more minutes proving to be good until he either becomes a centerpiece or winds up in a better situation)
"Don't say there's so many things wrong and then spew idiotic shit like that.  &gt; Harden could stay if you actually make it enticing enough for him to stay, like winning a Championship. Even if you win one ring the trade is an automatic W  Just like Kawhi?  &gt; Jaylen Brown is not, in anyway, a 'superstar', nor will likely ever be one as nearly as good as James Harden.  Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year. It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks. So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away. Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  &gt; If you continue to stagnate and/or regress as you you build nothing around the Jays, they'll leave or force a trade while in their prime anyway.  Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24."
"Glad you took the time to clarify, because you are definitely not understanding correctly. Westbrook taking significantly fewer shots at the rim this year than the rest of his 13-year career has nothing to do with James Harden. Hopefully that clears it up for you."
"So just to understand you correctly, you’re claiming that Westbrook’s shot selection was not at all influenced by playing with James Harden?"
"speaking for myself only: i don't want James Harden to win.  I hated the way Houston played, I don't like the way he hunts for fouls, etc.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, etc., but I'm just not a fan."
Because Kyrie and KD have both done and said ALOT of stuff that rubbed people the wrong way. And now they’ve added James Harden after he basically forced his way there to become a super team.  So yeah fuck Brooklyn
I don’t care James Harden should and will be a all star
Mans does not have James Harden
"So many things wrong with that sentence  1. Harden could stay if you actually make it enticing enough for him to stay, like winning a Championship. Even if you win one ring the trade is an automatic W 2. Jaylen Brown is not, in anyway, a 'superstar', nor will likely ever be one as nearly as good as James Harden. I don't think you understand how good James Harden is, especially in comparison to a 1 time All Star in Brown. He's on another level when it comes to finishing, playmaking, shot creating and scoring in general; it's absolutely worth trading for 3. If you continue to stagnate and/or regress as you you build nothing around the Jays, they'll leave or force a trade while in their prime anyway. In today's NBA, 'under contract' for stars doesn't mean shit"
James Harden. If only he didn’t have those “personality issues” that made Ainge so hesitant...
Within the season - The selfish James Harden narrative  From before this season - Knicks having a defensive identity/Julius Randle
James Harden wishes he could have played with ANY role player of Joe Harris’ caliber in Houston. For all the threes they chucked they didn’t have anyone that reliable. Harden would get them the best looks imaginable and they’d still hit it like 30%.
"Yeah he should try to take teams to the promised land in the NBA finals.  I know that the roster is not complete for a finals contending team, still need a solid rim protector, a bench unit, and a playmaker.  But even so, guys like Jason Kidd, and Lebron James or even Jimmy Butler has done more with much less or a bit less.     Not saying that Tatum is like those three, but sometimes the best way to bring players into the team is by elevating your game, that's why Brooklyn had attracted the attention of Kyrie, KD and Harden"
James Harden
"OKC traded away James Harden for nothing, ruining a potential dynasty. Their front office is trash."
"""while i agree it was reckless as hell"". I didnt say what he did wasnt incredibly stupid, im saying the way you phrased it made it seem like he was out a  public club partying. In reality he had a birthday party and rented a private club  Now if you want to see someone doing what i initially described look no further than james harden lol"
James Harden
"They didn't trade a player LIKE James Harden, they traded James Harden. What's with sports talk using the phrase ""a player like"", when they actually are talking about a specific player. Stop it."
"This is gonna get long but the deal would have been perfect if Oladipo was playing like his pre-injury self.  But the problem is that he isn’t.  So the Simmons deal was higher floor/ lower ceiling, while the Brooklyn deal was higher ceiling/ lower floor.  There are a few ways (most of which involve the Nets becoming bad) that the Brooklyn deal pays off:  1. The Brooklyn Nets’ big three breakup and join new teams which can happen at the end of next season.  2.  Harden, KD, and Kyrie age horribly and cap out the Nets down the road  3. Brooklyn’s roster bottoms out due to injury   4. Some combination of all the above  5.  Houston uses those picks in future trades for star level players.  If any of those things happen this trade is a success, and whether or not it’s better than Simmons boils down to how high or low you are on him and who they eventually get in return alternatively.  Now it’s hard to speculate on these things.  The prevailing attitude seems to be that Harden, KD, and Kyrie will all age like fine wine, get along well and retire together in Brooklyn leaving all those picks to be in the 20s.  However even successful super teams can be short lived, and injuries can tank even the best of franchises-case in point Miami Heat with LeBron and the KD era Warriors.    But even if they get along well and even retire together, they will get older in years 2026 and 2027, Kyrie will be 34-35, Harden will be 36-37, and KD will be 37-38.  It’s difficult to say how good these players will be at those ages.  Just for perspective Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony are both 36 years old right now, while Dwight Howard and CP3 are both 35 years old.  DWade also retired at age 37 not too long ago.  So it’s very possible that by then Kyrie and Harden could be both be on bloated contracts and KD could be retired and still have no depth making for a very decent chance at at least two lottery selections there, although it’s tough to say how much carrying those guys will be capable of at that age.  So the best realistic case scenario for Houston is probably a combination of #2 and #5 where they trade most of those picks (excluding years 2026-2027) for young star caliber players (ie MPJ and or John Collins) while hitting big on their own picks and while still having 2 very valuable lottery selections in years 2026-2027  TLDR: We don’t know yet, it really depends on what happens with those picks/what Houston does with them. So time will tell"
Do we know how many months above 32 ppg James Harden have had ?
&gt; didn’t the trade not happen because they didn’t wanna give up Maxey?  Which is fucking insane.   You are going to hold onto Maxey when you can get fucking James Harden?!
"The truth is that only time will tell. Probably not cause James Harden is a generational talent IMHO, so, by definition, it's highly unlikely that one of those picks they got will turn into a player of that caliber  With that being said I'd like to be a contrarian here, and I'm gonna say they accepted the best deal they got offered for no other reason than me just not being big on Simmons. Expecially not if he has to play in the West  (not to mention he's pretty much the last player Houston would want to build around given their recent basketball philosophy, but that could have changed with another mad scientist at the helm of the franchise)"
I don’t think you can ever get enough for a player like James Harden.
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
You think Simmons initiates the offence 90% of the time? That’s higher than James Harden Rockets numbers.   He brings the ball up the court then becomes a screen setter in the half court waiting for a defensive lapse or a quick person to shoot a pass off to.   If you think he is a point guard than so is Draymond Green.
"But I think the argument is that, yes it was a legit process, but when the opportunity became available, Nets were able to QUICKLY go from DLo + Dinwiddie to KD + Kyrie + DJ...then they added James Harden.  Thanks to that process. The Celtics on the other hand are basically hoarding everything from talent to picks and whiffed on getting any type of new talent.   I mean it's not like the Cs aren't developing talent over there. They're just not letting go of it to get better talent. That's the issue people are having,"
Chris Paul/ James Harden/ TMac/ Hakeem/ Yao  Or if you want my 2k all time lineup  Harden/ Moses/ Hakeem/ Sampson/ Yao  I call this MEGA ball
Chris Paul  James Harden  TMac  Moses Malone  Hakeem Olajuwonn
How big of a factor do you think James Harden relationship with him during the end of his Rockets days is for him to come to the nets?
"Well if we assume Embiid is currently the front runner for mvp, I don’t think he’d win this award. The past two years I think we’d see James Harden and possibly Luka take this over Giannis as well. I don’t really hear seeding arguments come up for DPOY, so it would be interesting if it matters for this."
"The James Harden award essentially, he’d win it this year too"
Yeah Kyle Lowry will be way better for both the team chemistry and the teams ultimate championship odds over they scrub James harden. Good thing philly let him go somewhere else. Probably won’t have to think about it for  a while
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
We James Harden now.
The james harden step back move
"I will semi joking with that post. Personally I would go with the Rockets.  Hakeem with James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and TMac if we are going with primes"
"Oladipo was literally just traded as compensation for James harden. So yes, the sun's could absolutely have gotten at least one measley second."
James Harden
&gt; **Pregame thots**   *\* James Harden has entered the chat\**
"The nets beat a healthy suns with just James Harden, they beat a healthy clippers with KD out, they beat a healthy bucks without Kyrie. We can go on for days but I already know the outcome."
Yeah that’s part of it. Plus mike conleys 10+ years of playoff experience and making it to WCS multiple times and the WCF. Plus Jordan clarkson experience with the lakers and cavs. Also haven’t had bogdonavic in the playoffs yet either — he carried the pacers against lebron.  Also James harden knew he’d lose in 4 to the jazz this year that’s why he went east.
James Harden is most deserving of MVP. I will die on this hill.
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"WTF? Who said Bosh was a better player than LeBron James? I'm just saying the best player of a stacked team can still win an MVP while you said Harden can't win because his team is too stacked offensively.   If Harden doesn't clearly show he's the best of the Nets trio obviously he's not gonna get MVP consideration. But if he emerges as the alpha dog (remains yet to be seen if he will but his last week or so has hinted that it could be the case), the fact that he has a top 5 player teammate (KD/Wade) and a top 10-20 player teammate (Kyrie/Bosh) won't necessarily eliminate him from MVP consideration just like it didn't for LeBron in Miami. I'm not convinced Harden is a better player than Durant but that's not the argument you were making originally. If you said, ""you can't win an MVP when you're not even the best player on your own team,"" sure, I'd wholeheartedly agree."
"according to unpopular belief, Capela didn't outplay Gobert, Harden **AND** Capela outplayed Gobert. Really hard to guard 2 people let alone 1 of those players being James fucking Harden. But go on nephew, keep shooting your shot &lt;3"
And James Harden  also LeBron only on the Cavs
"&gt;LeBron won two MVPs with Wade and Bosh  Ah yes, arguing that Chris Bosh was a better player than Lebron James when he nearly one a unanimous MVP, or his other MVP. Truly an r/nba moment. Harden doesn't have a chance at MVP because he has no narrative and he isn't the MVP of his team. Arguing that Lebron winning 2 MVPs with Bosh and Wade so Harden can win one over Durant despite Durant being the better player is the equivalent of arguing Bosh &gt; Lebron when he won his MVPs."
Well yeah not for a James Harden. For Kyle Lowry absolutely.
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
Durant in OKC in the playoffs averaged 28 points on 58 TS which is similar to James Harden in Houston who is regarded as a playoff choker. LeBron averages 29 on 58 TS and he's spent half his career on some dogshit Cavs teams.
He learned that one from James Harden
You really think Daryl Morey of all people would have passed on James Harden? It seems far more likely that Tilman didn’t want to deal with him
"&gt; harden who is a flopper and is unentertaining  CP3 is notoriously known for it &amp; Wade started it. Kobe in 2017 said if he can build a team he'd start with James Harden, but you think your opinion valid? LMAO. Go to sleep."
"dude stop bringing up that series i fucking get it, btw everyone knows being a knicks fan is superior to riding james fucking harden who is a flopper and is unentertaining"
"to tell you the truth, i see nothing wrong with what adams did in this instance and i saw nothing wrong with what bev did to jeff green. but this league has forced people into being soft. unfortunately there are players like james harden who feed off of it. shit sucks."
Unguardable Tour James Harden
"Most GMs and owners can’t point to picks 5-7 years later and use that as a constant measure of their value. Don’t talk about whether GM “X” makes it 8 years, it’s not that relevant here, tell me about GM “just traded for a ton of picks and pick swaps”.    The Rockets are banking on those later picks, but it also seems like they value being an okay team for a while. They’re effectively playing both sides of this especially considering they won’t keep their pick this year anyway.   It’s obvious the Nets offered the best draft package. They could’ve gone with Simmons and less draft stuff, but they probably didn’t think Simmons was that good or that valuable. Keeping James Harden would’ve been the worst move. Your star doesn’t want to be there, it’s ripping up your locker room, you can get ton of assets for him and you’re not winning jack with him anyway. This is also that had a fair run of success. So it’s not like they’ve never been anywhere and just needed to hold on to get a playoff series. They took the best offer they were ever going to get."
"No mentions of James Harden? The guy is basically LeBron with Curry's shooting. No player in the history of the NBA is as good as Harden is on offense, not even Michael Jordan. Think about that for a moment, the guy scores more and assists more than LeBron James, who can claim that?  When Harden wins a ring this season, he should be crowned GOAT."
Charles Barkley  Shaq  KD  Wilt  James Harden
"Yeah JAmes harden was the problem, that’s why the rockets are a amazing 11-17 without him"
"James Harden is better than LeBron and MJ, nevermind Kawhi."
James Harden is so good at basketball man.
Wait til they sell the James Harden bobbleheads. They're gonna be leftover Ish Smith bobbleheads with felt taped to the face.
Man if only Steph Curry retired for two years maybe we'd feel different about James Harden.
James Harden has like 3 inches and 45 pounds on the average height and weight of point guards in the 80s/90s. He would be better back then than he is now.
"In the 1980s and 1990s, James Harden would be a poor man’s Mark Aguirre. He wouldn’t be able to draw fouls like he does in today’s game. Plus, with hand checking, he wouldn’t be driving to the hole as often. He’d surely be a starter and average like 18 a game. With this said, I think his role as a facilitator would improve vastly."
It’s going to be kinda hard especially since perimeter players had mad ball handling restriction and James harden moves even today standards are questionable
"Probably not, but it’s hard to say for sure. This results based analysis of individual players’ games is idiotic. Hakeem Olajuwon was not better than James Harden is *because* he won two championships.   The guy is acting like someone said Danny Green is better than Hakeem Olajuwon."
Imagine trading James Harden and not getting at least Ben Simmons back. Then imagine trading James Harden and not getting Jarrett Allen either. That trade still confuses tf out of me
"Nah bruh I know you’re a Nets fan so you’re gonna be biased towards your own team, but he has James Harden and Kyrie and went 10-4. The Knicks lost their starting center and have a significantly less talented roster than the Nets(w/o Durant) and went 9-5"
"Agreed, Nash has it tough... man... he only had a fat James Harden out in the court and coocoo Kyrie too"
Is Ayton really better than Booker? Beacuse James Harden is the best guard (PG or SG) in the league.
"Oh I love Harden, I almost forgot how much I did during the Rockets era at times. But now that Trae Young exists the foil baiting doesn’t bother me as much from James lo  He’s a WORLD CLASS playmaker, passer, hell even point guard as a label. The dude is amazing. He just isn’t as efficient in his assisting when weighted vs turnovers as the all time greats in that regard.  See Prime CP3 or apparently Prime Jokic lol"
"I just go by best player on the best team or second best team. I think thinking about what the MVP award *should* be is an endless debate that ultimately doesn't matter much. We know what the typical standard for MVP is.  Stats aren't weighted as significantly as people think. In 2019, James Harden led the league in BPM, VORP, Win Shares, and RAPTOR WAR. He also led the league in scoring. Yet Giannis pretty easily won MVP."
"\- Dallas was straight up better than Portland.   \- Teams are rarely the same after three consecutive Finals appearances. The Pistons got crushed by the Bulls in 1991, the Lakers lost to the Spurs in 2003, the Heat got killed by San Antonio in 2014, and the Lakers got demolished by the Mavericks in 2011.   \- OKC was a young and inexperienced team. They were also just not as good as the Mavericks. Neither of Durant or Westbrook were in their primes and James Harden was a role player that year.   \- Miami had zero depth. Like none. That team was good because of its Big 3 and with LeBron choking as hard as he did, victory was not some insane feat for Dallas."
"Atlanta chose Dollar Store Steph Curry over a younger, Slovenianer version of James Harden and they blame their coach."
idk something seems off with “Luka’s the baddest white dude since James Harden “
Never would have thought people would think Jokic is better than James freaking Harden or Kawhi Leonard...yet here we are....
"Are you dense?  Arenas was efficient in his era (funny enough due to him taking more 3's than he is peers), he will be efficient in today's game. He just isn't James fucking Harden efficient. There is no era where he is close to James Harden. I even gave a great example how KD who is naturally efficient isn't as efficient in today game relative to era as he was early 2010's (even though he has  a high TS% now)."
&gt;	Crazy that Harden could realistically have been a 2-4 time MVP if it wasn't for narratives consistently changing against his case lol  Say that to lebron james or stephen Curry as well
James harden has hit 37.5% 36.8% twice and 36.7% while in houston. 3 season reallyyyyy close to 37% and a season above 37%.
"Comparing 3 percentage with a dude who’s played like 10 seasons versus a guy who’s played not even 3 is difficult anyway, but I’m saying Luka is not far behind James because he takes a similar amount of 3’s and his percentage is climbing, and he’s 22. When all is said and done I think it’s pretty reasonable to say Luka and harden aren’t going to be that different of shooters, because as I said harden has never hit 40%, let alone 37% in houston. He’s hitting at 40 right now cuz he plays with fucking Kevin durant and kyrie"
Remember when Heat fans and Riley didn't want to trade the Hardy Boys for James Harden?
"If you just watch these 4 different players you'd know the difference.  Trae at a point was doing this flopping shit on every jump shot, every drive. There's multiple points where he's lost games due to looking for calls instead of just looking to make a shot.  There's also shit like [this](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/02/10/0022000384/631/9f95c252-04e0-21df-f8a8-bb427672d715_1280x720.mp4). This is not the type of shit you should pull at clutch time. Due to him doing this the Mavs got a fast break and his team had to foul.  Lloyd Pierce is also not the coach of Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and James Harden."
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
james harden is shooting 40% on 8 3s a game. Just with the nets he’s shooting 42%. He is definitely miles better
"Signing an aging Chris Paul who you traded after 2 seasons is a bit different than Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving teaming up."
I think you guys may have forgotten who James harden is then
James Harden :(
"Harden being the true PG with Kyrie playing SG makes an incredible fit. Harden can still guard bigger guys on D and you don't have James next to a non-shooting PG like Wall or Westbrook so he's not forced to play sometimes like a spot-up shooter, what is one of the worst ways to use Harden while attacking."
James Harden
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
James Harden will age well then.

Lebron James Harden
LeBron James Harden wins easily
I like how they start the article by saying MVP is a two man race between Joel Embiid and James Harden.   And then a couple paragraphs down they call Durant the Nets best player.
I just realized that Kyle Lowry has been a Raptor longer than James harden has been a rocket
"Remember when he picked Kemba Walker over James Harden because he wanted “someone that would pass the ball”, as if Harden isn’t a better passer than Kemba with his eyes closed? Giannis was horrible at drafting last year."
I think my meaning is pretty clear. You’d probably get a better sense of how good James Harden was on a bad team than Klay Thompson.
"Just because a respected coach gasses you up to be something you’ve clearly not been, it does not mean he is right, but you know what, you guys believe it! You’ve always been elite, even when getting toasted by James Harden pretty handily for 2 years straight.  If Michael Jordan came out tomorrow and said the Celtics should be the favourites for the 2021 title, I’d call blasphemous."
"Kobe was much better than Wade come on. Even Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, James Harden"
"I’m super in favor of player empowerment, trade demands, etc. I don’t really give a shit about some dumbass owner and it seems like player empowerment is bringing hope to more hopeless fanbases (Warriors, Nets, Clippers) than the old way did. Players hopping from team to team is exciting and having guys like James Harden able to punish shitty owners is fine by me."
"Unless Harden picked up some eating tips from Big Daddy Vladdy over the offseason, I think LeBron is still the Heaviest James."
Show them James Harden.
"I’ve been watching the Nuggets for about 20 years. With the James Harden trade, you’re asking: do you blow up this roster that’s been under construction for 6ish years for a shot at a championship right now. We finally made it back to the playoffs two years ago. Made it to round 2, which is we’d only done once with Melo. Next year, same roster, despite criticism of lack of action, the team goes further than I’ve ever seen them go.  So when asked, trade MPJ plus tons of assets for Harden? (A true championship or bust proposition). And James Hardens teammates don’t even want him in Houston? Where he’s proven he can lose in the postseason? I say no thanks. I say let the team that has routinely defied expectations stay together and grow. Nets have shown they can win in the regular season. If they win the championship, I would probably feel some regret. I do not envy their current regular season success 🤷‍♂️"
Nobody said that. The season is over because the Brooklyn Nets were able to trade for James Harden while having Kyrie and KD. THATs why it’s over....
"Tyrese Haliburton talks about the difficulty in guarding Kelvin Benjamin, and how during a trip to Golden Corral as Kelvin stepped back into a 3-point stance and swallowed three handfuls of breaded shrimp, James Harden yelled ""Can I have this ranch dressing, Kelvin!"" It was nothing but diarrhea."
"&gt;	Zion has the ability to be the most unstoppable offensive force in decades. He is already averaging 25.6 ppg on 62% shooting, and now he is starting to become a playmaker, and he has only scratched the surface. &gt; &gt;	Luka is great, but he is a poor man’s (or maybe a middle class man’s) James Harden.  Lmaoo this is hilarious if you think Zion is anywhere near as good as Luka.   Man must be trolling"
"&gt;Luka is great, but he is a poor man's (or maybe a middle class man's) James Harden.  You do realize he's 21 right? We are nowhere near peak Luka"
"Zion has the ability to be the most unstoppable offensive force in decades.  He is already averaging 25.6 ppg on 62% shooting, and now he is starting to become a playmaker, and he has only scratched the surface.   Luka is great, but he is a poor man's (or maybe a middle class man's) James Harden.      Other than shoot 3's and free throw, Tatum does nothing as well as Giannis, not even close.   He doesn't score, rebound, pass, or defend anywhere near as well as Giannis and he doesn't get to the line much.     Two years ago, in the 2nd round, Giannis and Tatum went head to head and Giannis won and Giannis won in 5.    Giannis 28.4, 11.0, 5.2, 52.3% FG, 41.7% 3pt, 56.4% EFG 62.0% TS  Tatum 12..0, 7.6, 2.2, 36.4%, 12.5%, 38.2%, 46.4%"
"Tyrese Haliburton talks about the difficulty in guarding Kyrie, and how during an iso as Kyrie stepped back into a 3-point shot and let it go, James Harden yelled ""Can I have this dance, Kyrie!"" It was nothing but net."
True. I was making a point about the value of combining very different players.   Could Manute Ginóbili be better than LeBron James Harden?
"I don't blame Trae at all, coaches need to learn that until there's a rule change foul baiting will become the new normal. Young guys growing up and seeing guys like James Harden and Giannis dominate  in part by getting foul calls."
"Yes, my name is James Harden"
"Ok well that makes more sense if he’s basically playing like James harden on the rockets, still think the assist numbers should be higher if his playmaking is that good or else I better see his teammates shooting like 30% on the season"
If you have roster spots you should at least get someone. Luckily y’all have post defensive god James Harden lol  Y’all will probably be able to outscore everyone if y’all are healthy anyways so who knows.
"I’m not saying that Lebron NEEDS to come out and stand behind J-Lin, it would be nice but Lebron is not the reason why there is the increase in hate crimes. However the issue (and the reason people are calling on him specifically) is that Lebron has positioned himself as an advocate for all people publicly, yet he is relatively selective about when he put actually puts his voice on stuff and advocate behind.  &gt; &gt; “When I first came into the league, it was all about ball. It took me a while to realize the responsibility, the opportunity I was given. You know, ****I speak up for those without a voice, those who grew up like me, poor without hope. Those people, those kids exist all over the globe, and they deserve a chance. No one person is capable of turning the tide, but each of us have an obligation, because somewhere along the way, someone picked us up. And that’s why we pay it forward.” -Lebron James, 2019  &gt; “I hope we made [Kaepernick] proud,” James said, according to a video from The Washington Post’s Ben Golliver. “I hope we continue to make Kaep proud every single day. I hope I make him proud on how I live my life, not only out on the basketball floor but off the floor. I’ve been one to always speak out about things that I feel like are unjust. If I’m educated on things, I always go about it that way.”- Lebron James 2020   [Lebron at the Bloomberg Leadership Summit in 2017](https://youtu.be/BFxMzDW5k3I)  The production of that clip (not say Lebron has any actual involvement in the production that reel) highlighting democratic protest around the world and specifically Venezuela. Speaking the way he did to a room full of world leaders (both in the political and financial sense) really shows how impactful of a person Lebron is and how much his voice (or lack of) actually matters. Nobody cares or expects what KD or Harden feel about an issue like this.  I think many people here would think that his response to the Morey tweet (an issue that uniquely affect Asians and Asian-Americans) is something that was very un-leader like and does not fit well into his own characterization of how he sees himself."
Love me some t-Mac but the answer is James harden

It’s weird how they say prime T-Mac is one of the best offensive players of all time like James Harden isn’t also lol
still better than James Harden
You can make a deep playoff run with James Harden as your guy. You couldn't with TMac.
I loved T Mac but the playmaking is such a big difference. James Harden is a top tier point guard in a league with historically great point guard play.
He wasn't  an average defender he was a really good defender. I'd  take T-Mac over every version of James Harden.
James harden kevin durant kyrie irving say less sir we'll see when the time comes
"Lol, Beal is not even in James Harden's World when it comes to a player, Harden's an MVP and has been in EVERY in MVP conversation since 2015, 3x Scoring Champ and about to be a 2x Assist leader, he's also played with G-leaguers and guess what? Those teams where Playoff bound no matter what, I'm Sorry Wizards fans but it is WORLD's apart like every one makes it out to be, A ring will put Harden in the Top 25-30 players of All time so please don't be comparing Beal to him, Harden's a Top 5 player in the league, Beal is barely Top 15."
James Harden is the best player in the league and should have won 3 MVPs.
&gt;And you’re acting like it’s fun to watch Trae young or James harden flail around the court.  I don't think anyone is acting like that
"I'm presenting an extreme to prove a point.  James Harden is both quick enough and strong enough to guard 1 through 3 (and maybe 4). He's still no better than an average defender at any of those defensive positions.  If a team with bad defense, like the Nets, needs to shift a defender around, they can do so with Harden without getting substantially worse on defense... but not substantially worse is still having bad D for them.  Same concept applies on the other side of the ball. Beal has the capabilities to play any position 1 through 3. But he's always going to be most effective at SG. By far."
You can thank James Harden for that.
"1. i really enjoy watching james harden  2. as a whole, the nba is kinda boring right now  3. i can't stand steph curry's shimmy  4. what JR smith did in the finals wasn't even that bad, by getting the offensive rebound he prevented any chance of the warriors winning before overtime, the real screw up was when the refs switch the block to the charge on Lebron  5. the spurs would have beat the warriors if Zaza didn't injure Kawhi"
They should get James harden back
James harden said it best when talking about this mans “skill”
I think people know James Harden is going to be an all star. Beal was sort of snubbed last year so I think everyone was happy to see him make it and they know what caliber of player Harden is so being a starter or reserve doesn’t matter at the end of the day.
Refs were bad but Bama shot 30 threes   And you’re acting like it’s fun to watch Trae young or James harden flail around the court.
Ok? And James Harden is leading the league in assists. Are you really going to make the argument that Bradley Beal has been playing better this season than James Harden?
Even Bradley Beal says James Harden is better. He says this in every interview about Harden.
"They just went through a toxic locker room a few years ago. I’m sure that’s what they were “advised” about. Harden seems to fit with the Nets because he, Kyrie, andre, &amp; Durant are all really similar, but James would’ve definitely pissed off the young Celtics core &amp; Kemba."
"Meanwhile, in Houston, Turdman Fritatta actually had his GM send out a first and second round pick to sneak under the tax line in 2019, the year after his team took the KD Warriors to 7 games in the WCF. This was accomplished by sending the Rockets into the playoffs with only 1 playable Center and Forward.  Please remember this the next time you hear folks say management gave James Harden everything he wanted. He was fully justified in being fed up with the situation he was in. Especially since the contract he had signed was with the prior owner (who had paid tax the season following the Rockets 2015 WCF run in an attempt to improve the team)."
Ben Simmons is literally behind fat James Harden at the ability to guard 1-5.   https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1364040806726660104?s=19
Nah dude. James Harden is James Harden. But Jaylen Brown could be anyone...he could even be James Harden!
"I consider a superstar to be someone who is a household name outside of basketball fans. Now a lot of people retort that it shouldn’t matter whether non basketball fans know who they are but that’s what makes their stardom super in my opinion.   Your average person who doesn’t follow the NBA knows Lebron James, Steph Curry, KD.   Even some of the best players in the league like Harden and Kawhi aren’t that well know outside of sports fans and their city.  So to answer your question no I don’t consider Zion anywhere near a superstar."
What do you mean not ready now? You went to the ECF last year with kemba playing like shit.  Put James Harden on your team and you're 100% better right now and a higher chance to go to the finals.
"Also James Harden showing up ""fat"" only to drop 44-17 straight from the strip club. Sure, it might help a bit with quickness and endurance, but all these players know how to leverage their size and it's an important part of their games"
TBF if the Nets had Deandre Jordan or James Harden on their O-line they probably would’ve won
"You don't know anything dude, you really think PJ Tucker, Capella, Ryan Anderson, House, MCW etc should be having the ball over James Harden? Cringe take dude.   ""He should have just let people who dribble like Stanley from the office take the ball up! He wasn't forced to!""- your dumbass rn"

How the fuck u gonna look like a grandma and arguably be a top 3 player in the league atm James Harden what the fuck?
"Just in terms of how good these two players are, I’d say Charles is similar to James harden. All time greats who will be chastised for not winning a ring(could change for harden) while putting up amazing stats and being mvp candidates multiple times in their careers."
James Harden is the man
"James Harden this season will win it, god willing."
James Harden rn no bias
Everyone knows that the NBA all star voting isn't a popularity contest and that clearly Kyrie Irving is a better player than James Harden
The beauty of James Harden is completely shitting the bed in the closing game of a playoff series?
"And he still had 22 points because that's the beauty of James Harden. Even if the shots aren't falling, he still finds ways to score. Not to mention his 10 assists."
UO;: James harden is the best PG and will win MVP
Here’s a spicy one:  James Harden is easily top 20 all time
James harden will be appreciated more when it’s all said and done... that’s for sure
By who? James Harden? Brooklyn? Philly?
"James Harden on the Nets has a higher TS%, eFG%, 3pt percentage, FG percentage, 2 point percentage than Steph Curry this year."
they couldn't create a championship team paying $35M to james harden but they're going to create a championship team paying $35M to ben simmons?
"Because the Nets have James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving"
PG needs to study james harden tape to figure out how to get to the line
james harden with attitude
They can be your villain but I personally don’t think they’re villains. They’re just great. And how is James Harden an outlaw? Going to strip clubs and being late for video sessions doesn’t make him an outlaw.
Fuck James harden
"Jayson Tatum looks to his friend Kyrie. He has James Harden, one of the greatest players in NBA history.  Jayson Tatum looks back. Jaylen Brown. 5/23, 4 turnovers.  Get Tatum more help!"
I absolutely hate that call.  But James Fucking Harden having the audacity to complain about that call should be a double tech and ejection.
Can someone post that Marcus smart foul on James Harden and explain how was that a foul?
"Ok, so what about Rockets Harden and OKC Harden made then different players? Could it have been his role in the offense behind Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Similar to how Wade was playing behind LeBron James, therefore putting up less volume stats?"
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
"James Harden, Anthony Davis. The list will keep going on and on."
"No need for the name calling. You got exposed as a bandwagon fan, and resulted to throwing insults. I’m sure you’ll become a Nets fan in a few years. Also, let me know when you wiki that 2006-07 Warriors roster and figure out who the center was. It was Biedriņš. It’s pretty bad when I have to inform you on your team’s history. I take your gatekeeper comment as a compliment. I keep young heads honest when they claim things like “Curry is the greatest PG ever”  and ”James Harden is the greatest scorer ever.”"
"Were those before-and-after pictures of James Harden real? The ones that surfaced when Harden transferred to the Nets at the beginning of this year, where he seemed to have dramatically lost a lot of weight right after the transfer."
"I mean reputation always plays a part but free throw drawing is a skill that is hard to master, hence why a lot of non stars knew how to do it despite not having ""superstar reputation""  Like you think the refs are going ""hey guys this James Harden 19 year old kid in OKC averaging 9 points per game we are giving him calls today because he has a reputation"" well know he just knew how to draw contact"
"James Harden needs the ball nearly constantly. Klay Thompson is a far better complementary player.   Thus, Klay Thompson &gt; James Harden."
"Yeah no way former MVPs Kevin Durant and James Harden, and all NBA player Kyrie Irving can do it without washed DeAndre Jordan."
"Julius randle was booed by the fans too. Did he request a trade? No he worked his ass off in the off season to make sure he wasn’t booed again. Also it’s not like he was a superstar that has given his all for this franchise. If he was James harden wanting out of Houston that’s different. He didn’t even give us a chance really to build a great team around him. Every time we tried and looked like we might be decent and make the playoffs, he would get injured and we’d end up with a mid lottery pick."
Starters:   Irving     Harden   James   Durant    AD
"PG: lillard, Curry, Irving    SG: Booker, harden, Beal     SF: James, Durant, Leonard     Bigs: Adebayo, Davis, Zion  I wanted CP3 and butler though"
"A lot of people said that about Steph Curry before Steve Kerr coached him.  And a lot of people still say that about Harden.  Heck, people said that about Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and LeBron James at one time.  I'm not saying it will happen, it just seems like the closest situation to the Warriors the year before Steve Kerr took over."
Eric Gordon’s and James Harden also combined for 90 btw.
"If James Harden is having one those nights where he's in his bag, but is able to keep Kyrie in rhythm I can this happening."
Forgive me but curry ain't a better scorer then James fucken harden
Uhh let's see. James Harden or Tony Allen
Yeah because people randomly hate Utah for no reason and people love James Harden
"Didn’t a [report](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/01/15/report-76ers-thought-they-had-a-deal-with-rockets-for-james-harden/amp/) come out that the 76ers never got a chance to give a counter offer?? I don’t think Fertitta wanted to “reward” Morey for leaving. That’s not on the 6ers, that’s on the Rockets"
"Jokic has a lower usage percentage than trae. Does that mean that you think Trey is better than Jokic?  As does LeBron, Kyrie, Paul George, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Zion Williamson."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"&gt; Elite Big men still have value as much as an elite playmaker  Do they though?   If building a team from scratch, wouldn't everybody rather have James Harden than Anthony Davis?"
I guess the Nets since I want to cheer for Harden but KPJ is obviously the next James Harden so idk
What I remember is he was the reason james harden was traded. How many people can say that? Two? Him and ferttita.
"Jokic and Embiid are competing for MVP, Jerami Grant is averaging like 24 somehow, the jazz has the best record in the league because of incredible defense and three point shooting, curry is trying to carry the warriors to a playoff spot, James harden was traded to the nets and is averaging a near triple double, and uh somehow the knicks might make the playoffs with one the worst offenses in the league"
Love the similarities to James Harden here. Have seen him do this exact sequence many times. Go Luka!
"I wasn’t calling him a clown for thinking the kid would be good, he’s allowed to have that opinion. I’m calling KOC a clown because of the way he went about it and now it’s biting him in the ass. He literally called hayes James Harden during pre-draft , he was a contrarian against LaMelo, Wiseman and Edwards the entire time just to be one, and to bolster his opinion he LITERALLY made up fake stories about LaMelo and his stock dropping to the point that guys like Givony, Schmitz and Lowe had to call him out on it.   Another reaction the dude could of had is actually asking why I have the opinion i do/why I said what I said instead of getting over protective and accusing me of calling the kid a bust, insinuating that, and “unfairly criticizing him”."
"That’s fair, I looked at the wrong stats. At the end of the day, efficiency isn’t the end all beat all for defining who’s better when there’s more factors involved. If it were, chris Paul, James Harden, Bob Pettit, David Robinson and Anthony Davis would all be widely considered too 10 players of all time."
"They have meaning for Harden as a player. But in comparing two players from two different time periods, they dont mean as much.    Wade dealt with injuries throughout the regular season of his prime which hurt his all-nba counts. He broke out in 2006, was injured in 2007 and 2008, then made it in 2009 and 2010, then was playing behind James for the rest of his prime.    Its hard to compare regular season accolades between two players that followed such opposite career trajectories, with Wade playing his best in the beginning of his career, missing out on accolades to more respected players like Nash and Kobe, then later in his career taking a backseat to James, compared to Harden who was able to gain some rep in the beginning of his career as the sixth man in OKC, before breaking out a bit later in his career in Houston. Regular season accolades are just as much about reputation and the narrative as they are about actual performance. Im not saying their meaningless, but they should be take precedence over actual statistics."
James Harden is Better Than Allen Iverson
"""Hey Sixers fans, one of the best and most beloved players in the history of the franchise that I'm running didn't have shit on the best player on the previous team I ran!""  Allen Iverson did absolutely nothing better than James Harden currently does. He probably wasn't even better than prime Russell Westbrook."
Absolutely not. James Harden is a giant diaper baby and Kawhi was the best player in the league in 2019.
"Let’s see James harden has played with Dwight howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. All future hall of famers and dude has had mind blowing terrible performances in the playoffs."
Yea but 2018 Rockets were no slouch. The 2020 Rockets the Lakers beat were a joke compared to 2018 Rockets. They had Capela patroling the paint. Then we all know CP3 is much better than an out of prime Westbrook. Harden ofc would eat as always. Gordon was much younger back then and was a great 6th man. But the key is Rockets had Tucker and Ariza who would hound Lebron James. I got Rockets in 7.
"He is the white Harden and the media wants  to portrait him as the next Larry Bird or Lebron James.. I can see the similarities with Lebron, but the most accurate comparision is Harden."
"Wade had a more impressive career than Harden before James even joined Miami. An MVP is as much a team award as anything else in the NBA, you win MVP by having a being the best regular season player on a top 2 seed. Wade was playing with a G-league supporting cast, so he was not able to have a record that good. All those players you listed are miles, MILES better than anyone on the Heat roster between 2007 and 2010.    Harden could've beat one of the greatest dynasties ever had he not choked in game 7. Harden consistently plays worse in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Thats not a top 20 player all time, which is what he'd need to be to be better than Wade."
"Sure but it shouldn’t move someone in or out of a “greatness” tier. Like Scottie Pippen doesn’t get to be put into the same tier as James Harden just because he won 6 titles. At least IMO  I think it’s silly to say that Harden isn’t as great as KD/Steph for that reason. Anyone who watches them and looks at their statistics can see that they are similar caliber players.  Use it as a tiebreaker, sure. But titles shouldn’t move the needle that much"
"How many MVPs has Wade won? How many 1st team all NBAs does Wade have? Scoring titles? Harden has been top 2 in MVP 4 times, Wade has made 2 1st teams.   Harden has 3 scoring titles, Wade has 1.   Like, maybe let’s say the MVP versus the finals MVP is a wash. Harden has still had the longer and better peak.  Also, harden has never played with prime Lebron James. He’s played with a past his prime Dwight Howard, a past his prime Chris Paul, and past his prime Westbrook, and for a lot of that time he was going up against one of the greatest dynasties ever."
"Giannis was on the best regular season team and was a dominant force on offense and defense, the hell you mean Embiid is more deserving? Embiid and Jokic have the best cases this season. James Harden third, Lillard fourth and Lebron will be 5th."
"Championship rings push you over the top rather than being the main component of who is considered the best of all time.  Karl Malone is arguably top 2 PF of all time behind Duncan with zero rings, Barkley is definitely top 10 if not 5.  Ewing is top 10 Center easy with zero rings, David Robinson’s rings were more as a secondary piece to Duncan but he’s top 10 as well.  Stockton is top 10 PG with zero rings, arguably higher. Payton and Kidd’s championships were in their ring chasing years. Nash has zero as well. Those 4 would definitely be top 10, add CP3 in who is unlikely to get one as well.  While I won’t be against ranking Wade over Harden, I don’t think it’s as clear cut as you say it is. Only one of his three rings were won as him being the main guy.  While James Harden carried the Rockets to 8 straight playoff appearances, where let’s face it, his team always lost against better calibre opponents anyways."
"Do we have any evidence that he's drinking heavily while he's there either? Dude gets the rich man strip club experience, he could just be enjoying the hoes. I feel like the James Harden parties all the time idea is extrapolated from very little evidence."
"my trae young conley and aldridge for james harden trade continues to look better, for anyone curious conley and aldridge were FAs in my league"
"Fair list, this is my top player rankings that's divided into tiers a bit more.

James Harden point guard pupil
"James Harden doesnt get credit for anything until he wins a championship. The narrarive around James Harden is correct. Hes is an unbelievably talented player, just like Melo was. If he wins a ring, the narrative changes. Its not rocket science dude"
"Ur fucking stupid if u think James Harden is even comparable to Carmelo Anthony lmao. Also I see u are still pedaling the braindead ""Harden is a selfish ball hog"" narrative so I can only assume ur a casual that only watches Harden highlights but still completely ignore the fact that he played like that because he had to. Look at what he's doing in Brooklyn"
I do not understand lists that have Chris Paul above James Harden.  Harden shouldn't be in the top 25 but he's a lot closer to Barkley than CP3 is.
current favorite is james harden and the fandom started after Hardens first game as a Rocket vs Detriot and put up 37/6/12
"Steph is referencing [this](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30897633/kyrie-irving-tells-james-harden-point-guard-going-play-shooting-guard-brooklyn-nets-settle-roles) &gt;Kyrie Irving tells James Harden, 'You're the point guard, and I'm going to play shooting guard' as Brooklyn Nets settle on roles"
"“They didn’t trade for James Harden”  More like Rockets didn’t like Miami’s package so the trade didn’t happen  It’s not like it was up to the Heat...but yes let’s compare trading for a top 5 player to an old expiring player, the assets are totally comparable   Do you just believe all the bullshit you say and then pat yourself in the back thinking you’re so clever and smart? 😂"
Everything I said was factual.   They didn’t trade for James Harden but are thinking of going to trade for a player who at best is a bench player now that will take assets.   They declined a oppurtunity to group Harden/Bam/Butler.
The irony of this with a Rockets flair is laughable. You better have that same energy for James Harden.
What has James Harden ever fucking won?
"&gt;	Nah, come back to me when you actually understand basketball. James Harden couldnt even sniff KDs jock.  That’s why harden joined Curry after he continually kicked his ass for 5 years right? Oh wait. That was kevin Durant"
Didn’t trade for James Harden but want LMA.
"Nah, come back to me when you actually understand basketball. James Harden couldnt even sniff KDs jock."
Would have been so much more perfect if she'd asked that about James Harden or Marcus Smart.
"damn that's crazy  let's not be rude /u/dietcokewLime, James Harden hasn't put on THAT much weight, c'mon"

"The warriors rings are completely meaningless to the vast majority of fans who watched basketball before Durant joined the warriors and not impressive whatsoever because he joined an already established juggernaut that won a title, made 2 finals, set a million different records and it’s a team that had the best offense and defense in the league before Durant even joined. Of course adding Durant would be free rings.   Durant is the 2nd/3rd best player in the league and got guarded like a role player in the finals multiple times  It was a joke. The team won a ring and was 5 points away from going back to back with Harrison Barnes yet I’m supposed to be impressed when KD wins it there? Nah    that was literally a free ring, the warriors would have been one of the top 1-2 contenders to win without Durant    I truly don’t see how people are impressed with those rings. I honestly think less of you’re basketball knowledge if you think KD went through any adversity or struggled for those rings   If anything it’s embarrassing he was about to lose to a james harden team before CP3 went down. Dude joined an all time great team he couldn’t beat and still almost lost"
"Why was an article about the upcoming trade deadline written where the Celtics potential pursuit of Harrison Barnes using the Hayward TPE was discussed, probably because the trade deadline is happening soon.  Who Amick’s sources are and what they suggested Ainge did differently than Ainge publicly suggested he did in pursuit of James Harden, I don’t know because Amick didn’t say.   The article links to an NBC Sports Boston article/video of a radio interview Ainge gave. In the interview Ainge said they had conversations with the Rockets but not recently as they were not coming down on the price they were asking for and the Celtics didn’t want to pay that. Given how trades work and assuming the Rockets didn’t want Kemba, Jaylen Brown would have needed to have been traded for the Celtics to get Harden. I don’t really see how if the Celtics actually offered Brown why the Rockets wouldn’t have gone for that instead of what they did get. And if the sources are saying, “Ainge said he didn’t have talks recently before the trade had happened, but actually the Celtics did have a recent phone call before the trade,” then I certainly get why they left that tid bit ambiguous."
"You might want to look up what seed James  Harden was when he won lol. Going back 38 years, Westbrook was the first to win it outside top 3 seed. And Michael Jordan in '88 was the only person to win it from 3rd seed in that period. Every other year (36/38 years) was a top 2 seed.   You didn't say ""ridiculous to have him in contention"". He's definitely in contention. You said ""I don't think it's ridiculous to have him as your mvp""."
These are the same “fans” who think James Harden is an all-time great because he scores a ton of points and little else. The dude plays a bastardized brand of basketball who goes for the foul before the shot.  That’s my get off my lawn rant.
"I was looking for LeBron’s name for a sec. I don’t know if it’s from reading the LEBRON over and over or if it’s because of the “Harden, James” on the first team"
"Truely Only nephew's on r/nba could say a player currently putting up 33 points a game would not be better on a contender. You've never seen beal surrounded by a good team so how could you even assume he wouldn't be good on a contender.  Harden has never won a chip and has been criticized for not playing ""winning basketball"". Who would you rather have, klay or James harden?"
"I'm about time.  Some of the trades being proposed for Harden was straight up disrespectful.  To top if off, you have Heat and Sixers fans debating whether it was worth throwing in Herro/Maxey for Harden. This shit was legitimately upvoted.  I thought I was taking fucking crazy pills.  James fucking Harden, who is always in the running for MVP, is up for trade in HIS PRIME.  And you really are going to hesitate on giving up a player like Herro/Maxey.  Imagine Harden on the Heat right now with Butler and Bam or Harden running a two man game with Embiid.  Instead, we have Harden with Irving and Durant which means they essentially have 3 of the worlds best isolation scorers on the same team.  (This alone should have been an incentive for Heat or Sixers to acquire Harden)."
"James Harden is good at basketball, more shocking revelations at 5"
Or just not the 15 best regardless. James Harden 29/7/6 comes to mind
"Danny “almost traded for prime Westbrook, prime Blake, PG-13, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden” Ainge"
"**TEAM DRJISFTW**  Fans are excited when the Dr. Jisftw used his vast medical fortune to buy an expansion team. Moreover, Damian Lillard fans are excited that the roster appears well-suited to his particular game, particularly in regards to 3+D wings in Royce O'Neal and Mikal Bridges. Due to the owner's flair, the team is slated to join the Eastern Conference.  Armed with Ben Simmons (well known defender) and those two (underrated defenders), the lineup immediately clicks together and becomes a top 10 defensive unit. Lillard thrives as a result, averaging 25-8 and emerging as a potential MVP candidate due to the stats and the team record, as the group vaults up to the # 4 seed in their first year of existence.  That said, the Eastern Conference is no joke this year, leading to a very difficult matchup with # 1 seeded Brooklyn in round two. As expected, Damian Lillard is a monster in the series, averaging 33 points per game. The team trades punches and trades wins with Brooklyn all series long, going down to the wire tied 3-3 headed into Game 7.  Unfortunately, the game is marred by some shaky officiating, as the refs call quite a few fouls on Dr. J's wings for their physical defense. James Harden ends the game going 12-14 from the FT line, which may be the difference in their 109-105 win. The team goes home salty and disappointed, but confident that they can contend with the best of the best down the road."
Id had even harden over james now.
"What’s your source on lebron being the most dedicated? What’s your measurement of dedication? Do you think jimmy butler doesn’t train hard or eat well? Do you think Paul George breaking his leg was an example of poor diet? What about Gordon Hayward? Kevin love was famous for his diet and training and he’s been barely able to play for years. James Harden has a shit diet and partied late and is a god damn iron man. Is Kevin love just didn’t training or eating well? A huge part of genes is determining if your body reacts well to training, too. Not everyone can handle the work load, some people develop over working conditions like tendinitis or lose their cartilage. Plus there’s shit like lebron’s teammates mocking his diet.   Yes, lebron maximizes his potential. But his potential is defined by hitting the absolute gene lottery. If you ever played sports you would see first hand how working hard is not the greatest determination of success, health, potential, etc. Some guys are born jacked, put on muscle easily, and just don’t get fat. It’s ridiculous how much advantage some have. Some guys are just always injured. It’s just the way life is."
"*2016 Steph Curry,  2018 James Harden, 2014 Kevin Durant have entered the chat*"
"Lot of LA county guys to choose from, but the guy who grew up closest to my city would be james harden"
Lonzo has been this good since he was a Pelican but has had no momentum due to injuries. Shit he was putting up good numbers on LA the last LeBron year when Bron was out then he got injured in a Rockets game he was shutting James Harden down in. The guys a really really good winning player but he needs to stay healthy to get in rhythm
He called James Harden and compared their Kardashian notes.
Except to James harden lol
"Why is it offensive though? Sure they might be shit jokes but I don't see how it's necessarily offensive? People make bad puns/jokes all the time (e.g. LeBum, James drills a 3 giving me a Harden, etc)."
"I get what you're saying, I really do. We're numb now. It's normalized, as far as Harden's piece of it goes. In the seemingly can't-wait-it-out age of LeBron's tyranny, here's an MVP guy, hard working every year, no ring, wants a ring. He can say it or the world will say it on his behalf: save him.  Better question is: how did KD avoid a second round of flak for joining this team which would eventually include James Harden? Harden was the final piece of the trio so he's the most visible. But KD left a superteam to join a superteam. Redemption arc denied. (If you're into that kind of drama. Disclaimer: it's fine to care about absolutely none of this.)"
Because james harden gave it all for so many years and roster looked bad.
James Harden thinks Syria is a stripper
Not sure they can even trade him before off season. He has the right to veto any trades and because of his season ending injury the heat got a DPE.   Now in the off-season assuming there is some team willing to take a look on a guy who is paid 10m to average 6pts a game I assume it’s for a relatively toxic contract... unless there is a player that pulls a James Harden.
So James harden minus assists and rebounds
Ask James harden
"I mean, Dame has done it tho, along with Klay Thomson, Dirk, Kemba, Brad Beal, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, etc.  Not quite the same as the dunk contest.  And a lot of times the best 3 point shooters are more role type players anyway.  I'd say vet players just tend to avoid entering, but I do agree Steph is build differently and would probably compete in it when he's 40."
"""The Nets made a wagon and I jumped on....also James Harden."""
"One team also has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Joe  Harris, the rockets Have Christian Wood."
"If James Harden played in the Pierce/Walker era Eastern Conference, he would be in the finals every year and have at least one ring.  This dude played the Warriors 4 times in the playoffs and the Lebron/AD Lakers before he could even sniff making the Finals"
"not make off-court activity, rings, or choking in the playoffs, like james harden, important factors  focus on skill, impact, popularity, success, stats, dedication"
"It’s suuuuuch a dumb narrative that all started because James fucking Harden was able to ISO and score on him in the playoffs. Like no shit lol, he can do that to any player in the league. Gobert’s still a ridiculous defender.  I do think his value decreases in the playoffs with greater emphasis on targeting matchups, exploiting weaknesses, etc, but that’s okay, that’s just along the general rule that versatility is key in the playoffs. If anything, a bigger complaint I’d have of Gobert is he isn’t better at defending elite bigs 1 on 1, he should be more of a matchup problem for guys like AD and Jokic, and that kind of hurts the Jazz in the playoffs in my view."
A bummy Melo? Danuel house?James Ennis? This was when CP was injured and Harden basically dropped 40 a game to bring the Rockets from the 14th seed to 3rd.
"Lol one year without his all NBA buddies and Curry is a 9th seed team, if that. What happened to his gravity making his teammates better? James Harden hasn't missed the playoffs his entire career. After Giannis became the man his team is constantly one of the top 3 teams in the league. Kawhi won a FMVP by himself. Curry is overrated lol."
"I think many people still assume that the path towards becoming an NBA ref is similar to that of the players. I always figured there was some sort of system to recruit great high school refs to college, then the best there get to the NBA eventually. Or something along those lines. Made a lot of sense to me but never something I thought to look into.  Then like a month ago I see those Mark Cuban quotes and realized how naive I was being. It was really easy for me to excuse incompetent NBA officiating by thinking “these guys are the best at what they do, it’s just a really difficult job” but turns out, these guys aren’t the best at what they do, or even that close to it.  Like if James Harden is talented enough at drawing fouls to convince the best refs in the world he was slapped, I guess I can tell myself that’s an elite skill he developed, even if I don’t enjoy that aspect of the game. But when he’s tricking someone who only has that job because their uncle was once an NBA ref or whatever, idk that just feels very different to me.  The NBA is amazing because it’s the best basketball players in the world competing in one league. It’s really unfortunate that for whatever combination of reasons, the officiating is not held to an equivalent standard.  It’s comical how resigned to poor officiating the entire league has been. Scal was on the Celtics broadcast tonight complaining about how Jaylen Brown didn’t get some call over an absolute nobody. He wasn’t complaining about the call itself really, just whining that “all star” Jaylen Brown didn’t get the call. Why have we all accepted that star players get different whistles? It’s definitely a thing in other sports (protect the QB, can’t rough Conor McDavid, etc) but I really think the NBA has gone way way too far with it."
"Lebron's ""Lefuck you"" threes only average like right around 30%.  He misses a lot of them but nobody really remembers those misses because usually he shoots them while the team is on a 10-0 run situation.  James Harden 100% though"
That was be a weak ass James Harden move. Fuck that.
James Harden IMFO.
1. Goran Dragic (All Star (sub-in) like 2 seasons ago) 2. James Harden (MVP and multiple NBA scoring leader) 3. Jimmy Butler (Averaged 26.2pts in his only Finals appearance to date) 4. Kelly Olynyk ( 3&amp;D player (needs work on both tho) ) 5. Bam Adebayo (last year All-Star whose young with a very high ceiling IMO)     Pretty decent starting squad but they definitely lose their depth in the process. Not so sure it would've been worth it.
"Current superstars would have hard time in 90s.   Dude, can you imagine how what havoc would James Harden and Kevin Durant wreck if they’re never double-teamed thanks to illegal defense rule."
"Such a good comp. Some players seem to have certain things that despite conventional wisdom making success seem unlikely, just channels them into focus that leads to obscene success rates.  One example I can think of is James Harden. He has this rock you to sleep dribble he uses to get open on threes, where he often seems to dribble too much to the point where he allows the defender to recover, but I swear when he does that move he drills it like 80% of the time.  Another one is LeBron's ""LeFuck you"" threes. He doesn't quite have the fluidity of say Steph or Dame when he takes those long ones, but he has this weird nonchalance where he'll get the ball in a deep spot and just fucking hoist it. Swear to god he's better at those than a lot of what would be referred to as ""easier"" 3 point shots, corners, catch and shoot 3s off the wing etc."

Harden gets inefficient at times but simmons literally turns the game 4 on 5, he had 0 in a playoff game"
Well you guys have an easier schedule coming up and your second best player is James Harden so I think you're in a good position lol.
That’s exaggerating. Putting him on Kawhi changed that raptors series he was not a non factor at all.  And best player on the floor against two average teams in the playoffs his first two years is fucking impressive what are you talking about? James Harden wasn’t the best player on the floor in any series til like 5 years into his career
"James Harden, I saw him play live in college and was like dang I love this guy and he’s been my favorite player since."
"Did you see kyrie against the bucks in 2019? Or that just didn’t happen ?  Chris Paul got fucking injured after we went up 3-2, Wby are you intentionally leaving things out to prop up your stupid argument? Harden went against 4 allstars with 1 and still put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on half his threes in game 7, and we only lost by 9. The same team that 4-1d kyrie while he had lebron fucking James on his team lol. Hardens next best teammate was eric gordon  &gt; kyrie has never had the opportunity harden has had to have a team constructed around him  Yeah, because he’s not that good. Like there’s no way you are this sense.  Kyrie is a champion because he played with lebron. That does not make him better then harden in the slightest, harden would have beat the tougher warriors team had his teammate been healthy.  Kyrie isn’t a superstar, and has never been considered for MVP. You’re talking out of your ass"
You think black people are taking the vaccine because James Harden took it? You think we give a fuck?  We can think for ourselves. Dont infantilize us
James Harden at C would be nice
"Idk, but not as important clearly.  I’d rather have someone like James Harden giving my 10 assist a night even if it’s on 2 point shots, then someone like Jim Harden giving my less assist on more 3s."
The dude was essentially a Center version of James Harden on offense when healthy.  I've never seen a big man so comfortable with a step back three.
"It's completely irresponsible and egotistical that Jaylen Brown chose to attend the All-Star game instead of resting his knee. It's clear the guy cares more about his image than actually winning. Mike Gorman was completely right about Brown playing for himself.  Jaylen Brown since February: 21/6/4.5, shooting 43/31/78 from the field, with 3.3 turnovers a game.  What happens when you combine an overrated player with a bum knee worse than Kemba's? You get the worst starter in the NBA.  Danny Ainge will regret not trading Brown for James Harden. The biggest mistake of his career. Green teamers will scream ""the future is bright"" until they are red in the face while we watch Kyrie lift another trophy before we do."
James Harden exists.
Avery Bradley can’t guard James Harden tho. I think Davis might have been the best defender against him considering his ability to defend 1-5
"Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?  Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.  Luka is the 8th seed.  Steph isn't even in the playoffs right now.  The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.  James Harden has his Houston mess which will turn off voters in addition to being apart of a superteam roster with 34 combined allstar appearances.  So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes? Poised to keep winning games without Anthony Davis for another 3 weeks.   Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   How do you *not* make the case LeBron is the favorite and in the lead right now?"
James Harden
Kevin Durant and James harden have played a total of **5** games together
Curry should take some notes from the way James Harden played last night on how to control an offense
"Such snowflakes they are. What kind of weird human are you that you need only LeBron James to tell you to get a vaccine. Not Kevin Durant, not James harden, not Steph Curry. But only lebron? Weird motherfuckers."
"The bucks also have probably the best defenders to match against the nets, along with the best defensive strategy against james harden. We can put Giannis on KD and Jrue on Harden"
‘I play the game the right way’  -James Harden
"I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t help but be irritated that Harden is even in the conversation. Statistically he absolutely deserves to be in consideration, but the way he left Houston was was petulant, stupid, and pathetic to a degree that he shouldn’t be rewarded with jack shit.  He’s the the best player for the 4th best record in the league, but he also broke Covid rules while holding out for a trade mid-season. Fuck James Harden.  *disclaimer: I don’t think LeBron should be the obvious front-runner either. Giannis and Jokic are a small step ahead of him imo*"
I wouldnt say its dumb necessarily .  Let's say you dont have barely any assets but want to trade for say James Harden.  This helps you pump up the value of your pick(s)
"&gt;  I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Fair enough.  It seemed like you were making that implication, but if you're not I appreciate the clarification.  &gt;  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics. It's true I didn't watch him on the Bucks, but on the Celtics, he wasn't being double teamed regularly.  None of his years with the Celtics were close.  His years with the Sonics were much, much better, although the end of his Bucks tenure was solid (minus when he basically got replaced by Michael Redd).  &gt;  Also wtf, you claim Lillard has McCollum to prevent him from being double teamed? I think you are the one who does watch Lillard enough. Even with a healthy McCollum Lillard still gets double teamed on most plays. Go watch any series against where the Warriors beat the Blazers.  I can flat out promise you I've watched more Lillard than you have.  I was a few years above him on the same AAU squad, I watched him dominate from very young all the way through Alameda and have been a huge fan of his for his entire career.  The Warriors almost never double teamed Lillard.  Zone trap is not the same as double team, and Lillard purposefully drove into extra defenders so he could move the ball and work the 4v3.  Lillard purposefully driving into an occupied area of a zone to force more defenders on him and make a teammate open is not the same as shooting against a double team.  Lillard is almost always guarded by Klay 1v1 when they play the Warriors.  &gt;  Also I am a Blazers fan and a big fan of Dame, but this has nothing to do with that. Here is a list of players I also think are better shooters than Allen. Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, obviously Steph.  Dude....this is just bad.  Really bad.  Trae Young isn't even a top 10 shooter in the NBA right now.  Just because he has highlights hitting 35 footers doesn't mean he didn't miss 10 before he made that.  His shot selection is piss poor and his percentages are worse.  Not that that's the end all, and he is a talented player, but he's just not a very good shooter.  Damn the disrespect to an all time great here is savage.  Not one of those people besides Steph is a better shooter than Ray.  &gt;  I simply value the ability to create your own shot more than I value the ability to catch and shoot.  Then it might interest you to learn that Ray shot a better percentage on 3's he created than any of the people you listed in the last paragraph and Dame.  The fact that Ray Allen was shooting 40% regularly in an NBA that didn't value the 3 and would bench you for shooting off the dribble is insane.  Devaluing his accomplishments just because we're not qualifying them with context is a huge mistake."
"I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics.

"It’s not Gobert’s fault that he has a great supporting cast but it puts a dent in the idea that he’s “carried” the team. Kobe carried the mid-2000s Lakers. Lebron carried the mid-2000s Cavs. Gobert has never carried anything.  &gt; KAT has never accomplished anything  You realize he plays for the TWolves, right? And what has Rudy “James Harden” Gobert done in the playoffs besides get exposed on switches? You act like the Jazz have done shit in the playoffs lmao"
Put Gelo on the Nets and Put James Harden on the Los Angeles Ballers and we'll see what happen.
He won't have a James Harden type career.
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"The gap has closed a bit this season but yeah Trae is better. Sga is dealing with the worst spacing in the league, taking unassisted shots at a James harden mvp level rate and being an elite playmaker with terrible team mates and still having godly efficiency. Plus his size/length gives him infinitely more  defensive potential, even though it’s not close to realized yet. Trae passing/pull up 3s rate and volume gives him the edge but you’re understimating shai"

"kyrie has never been in the MVP convo because he played with lebron and the two seasons in boston, he wasn't playing like himself. Situation matters a lot. James harden was never considered MVP until he became the leader of the rockets. Westbrook didn't become MVP until he was the main star of a team. If kyrie was the main star of a team that was built around him he would have the potential. He's literally one of the most skilled players in NBA history, if not the most skilled."
"What does shooting have to do with dribbling up the court?  Joe Harris and Klay Thompson don't get doubled dribbling up the court either. James Harden does though, and more often than Dame does. Does that mean Harden is a better shooter than everyone else?"
"You said Harden has better assist numbers and shooting because he's playing with kyrie and KD.   But he's had better assists and shooting numbers playing with Rivers, House, PJ tucker and James Ennis as his starting lineup.  Maybe he's just better at assisting and shooting and has better numbers regardless?"
If you watched james harden on the rockets you know hes not selfish. The reality is he was the best option on the offense in most scenarios.
"idk about that. When Giannis and James Harden were neck and neck for MVP, Giannis had the big defensive advantage. I don't believe any fan has forgotten that silly saltfest after the MVP was awarded to Giannis."
James “$5 Lawn Chair” Harden. It has a nice and appropriate ring.
James Harden isn’t playing better than LeBron.. AD had played 23 games.. KD had played 19. It’s not like there’s a big difference in games missed between the two... Are we ignoring the fact that James Harden’s second best player is Kyrie Irving? Or did he die when KD got hurt lol. You’re the one who sounds like a “casual” bud
James Harden is what you get when you fuse LeBron and Curry together. He's the best basketball player to ever play.
So basically Serge Ibaka = James Harden??
"If Tyler Herro becomes James Harden, I will tattoo Ty-Ty on my butt."
"Based on this he might actually become the next James Harden hahaha, Harden's only Finals was rough"
if he’s comparing james harden to best 3 point shooter in history seth curry then it’s curry
James Harden passed Larry Bird on the all-time scoring list tonight with his last 2 free throws to ice the game
James Harden passed Larry Bird for 34th on the all time scoring list tonight with his last 2 free throws
DR JAMES EDWARD HARDEN
James Harden coaching up Deandre as we speak.
That's why James Harden is the mvp! If it were Leflop he would shoot 4 bricks in an L and call it a night!
James Harden is the man
James Harden
No one has seen more double teams or whatever defense than James Harden.
How anyone can legitimately think James Harden isn't clutch is beyond me
"Like in the Heat sub, they’re complaining anout the nets when Pat Riley didn’t want to give up Nunn,Duncan,Herro,Achiuwa and picks for James freaking Harden"
If James Harden is nothing I don’t wanna know what something is
"Yes, it was 1000% worth it to get James Harden."
"The league is getting so small that a rebounding guard doesn't have the same value as they once did.  Whether or not a guard gets rebounds depends on whether or not his coach sends him to the basket on shots when playing defense.  It's really more of a coaching strategy of getting the ball to the PG the fastest and heading the other way down the floor.  There are the Russell Westbrook and James Harden types of the NBA world that can certainly influence a coach's decision in whether to employ this strategy. But minus a few exceptions - great overall players - it's comes down to whether or not the coach thinks this is good strategy (which considers the talent of the other players on the team as well).  If a player is pretty average at everything but a really good rebounder, I don't think it would help his chances all that much of making an NBA roster unless the coach used that strategy.  About the only exception to this is when a team doesn't hardly have any good rebounders and the guard is actually one of the best, if not the best, rebounder on the team.  Then, out of necessity being a good rebounding guard would certainly be a benefit.     90% of the players that get a rebound in the NBA think they're a guard anyway."
"why moving the goalpost?  You asked where was James Harden and I gave you the answer.  I don't need to see that ridiculous game 7, I know pretty well how many times Harden underperformed in crucial playoffs games.  But this is a whole different topic."
"From what I can tell, James Harden seems to be the real deal. The dude can shoot the 3 and score inside, if you name it he can do it. What I’ve heard from my private sources is that he spends some time at the strip clubs in his local area. I think this is why he has some games where he is on fire and some games where he is only so-so because it is like a strip club. No good on a Tuesday but come back during the weekend"
"And then there was the additional effect that it had on a certain player on the team.  After having seen his best friend, James Harden, shipped out a few years prior, Kevin Durant now watched another good friend and valuable player getting let go a year before his next big payday.  It prompted him to believe that the remaining cats were incapable of winning a Championship and ushered him out the door in FA to create a superteam in the Bay that destroyed parity in the NBA for several seasons to come."
"Where is James Harden? Oh that’s right, he folds like a $5 lawn chair in the playoffs."
That was james harden
Remember in 2018 when 40 year Manu Ginobili cucked James Harden so hard he literally gave up and fouled himself out of the game. I know who I'd rather have on my team
"&gt;etc   James harden, Reggie Jackson"
This doesn’t make sense. The top 20 individual regular season ppg only features one guy from this era in the form of James Harden.
This hypothetical is basically pointless in an era of zone and PNR switching. You can go from guarding DeAndre Jordan to James Harden in the span of 5 seconds and vice versa
I get what you are saying. But they won’t grow the same way if they stay there together. Just how James Harden wouldn’t be as dominant if he stayed under KD and Russ.
"So if we ignore his passing, vision, spacing, handles, then ignore his three shooting, driving, and finishing, all he can do is wcore by getting to the line.  This is on the same level of that r/nfl post saying if you regress Mahomes's stats to the league average, then he's an average qb.  James Harden does draw fouls, but no one in their right mind would call him one dimensional. Similar to that, Trae can get to the line and also isn't one-dimensional.  Your level of analysis and widely inaccurate insults makes me believe I'm talking to Skip Bayless's burner account."
"He literally makes more free throws than field goals, he averages prime James Harden numbers from the line. His game is unquestionably focused around foul baiting, that's supported both empirically and with the eye test.   Now, saying his game is focused around free throws doesn't mean he literally can't do anything else, but it doesn't change the fact that he looks to get whistles more often than not."
He’s been the next James Harden in our sub for months so why don’t y’all wet blankets let us get hyped about one young fucking player.
"First of all, the OP completely butchers shit - the article is paywalled, so most people won't notice, but he actually selectively quotes and moves stuff around. The other thing is that what's lost in the quoting is that Lowe is talking about the ""discourse"" of the MVP race and not talking about his personal justification. Here's the full quotes and I'll bold the stuff the OP quoted.  &gt;The discourse surrounding last year's top two finishers -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James -- was primed to get messy and interesting and maybe a little edgy in the media even before Harden and two behemoth centers crashed the MVP race. Antetokounmpo has won the past two MVPs, outpointing James easily last season.  &gt;Antetokounmpo's statistical case was almost unassailable -- at least according to almost every publicly available statistic. He also won Defensive Player of the Year. The Bucks finished with the best record in the NBA.  &gt;And then the world went haywire, and for whatever reason -- including the Miami Heat exposing the remaining holes in Antetokounmpo's game -- **the Bucks flamed out in the postseason. James and the Lakers rose up. It was a reaffirmation: Duh, LeBron is still the best player when it matters.** In celebrating the title, James, stone-faced, demanded his ""damn respect.""  &gt;As our Brian Windhorst noted last month, James has not won MVP since 2013. You can explain away each individual season. I've had an official ballot in every season starting in 2013-14, and have not voted James as MVP in any of them. At the time, each vote felt fine -- close in some seasons, but fine. I don't regret any of them now. In totality, **it still seems undeniably stupid that that guy we all recognize as the best player alive has not won MVP in eight years.** It just does.  Then you skip a couple of paragraphs talking about why voters might be reluctant to award Giannis his 3rd straight MVP (it would put him in an exclusive club) he talks about how James is probably behind Jokic, Embiid, and Giannis statistically.  The rest of the article is about the more fringe MVP candidates (Dame, Luka, Curry, Kawhi) and how Harden will impact it."
"But it's not an argument. This is not an argument for LeBron being MVP last season, this season, or any season. Lowe says that he doesn't regret not voting for LeBron in any of the last 8 seasons. This article isn't even about LeBron. It's about James Harden"
"LeBron shouldn’t even be in the race. It’s Jokic, Embiid, Giannis and then daylight.   I’d honestly even put James Harden above LeBron this season"
No he reminds me of James Harden 😎

A guy called James Harden?
"That’s fine and well, but if you can exaggerate things like that, like calling the Nets a lock is probably just as much of an innocent exaggeration. I don’t think the Nets are a lock by any means, and I’m a massive Harden stan.   Honestly I think the thing I just didn’t like was that if “The Nets are a lock” is like some ridiculous exaggeration, why circlejerk the other way so hard that we just act like KD, Kyrie, and James Harden are not just some absolutely fucking bonkers trio. Like as nuts as the 03-04 Lakers are, the offensive potential this Nets team has is historic. Can they flame out and lose? Absolutely, but I feel like giving credit where credit is due, and this team at the least has earned the right to be considered a favorite.   Anyway, it’s not that deep, hope Embiid is at least health come the MRI results."
Really was looking like James Harden Jr out there
"In recent years the following players were available via trade: Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Paul George, James Harden and Jimmy Butler. Ainge was generally thought of to have the most trade assets/best trade package possible and got none of them. That's pretty telling. That's what the guy you responded to meant."
"I mean it’s alright to be a realist and say they haven’t won a championship yet, but if that’s your description of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden immediately after, thats pretty disingenuous.   Good thing Embiid doesn’t have any injury or weight problems! Knockdown shooter in Ben, too."
"Don't listen to them, dude has played two games and he's the next James Harden in here."
"36 is my stereotype of when a player should retire.  I get that all these are no ordinary players.  KD wants to retire with James Harden is my guess.  I think they are going to quit once they earn the championship trophy.  I give them 2 years of playing finishing on the Nets.  Kawhi I think he'll retire at 44, because he sells tickets that well.   I think he'll retire on the Pelicans.  Lebron, he'll retire at 40 on the Blazers.  Curry will retire at 38 on a team close to Austin Rivers, his brother-in-law."
Ok but just because he's younger?? Would you rather have James Harden or KPJ?  Or are you saying that the skill gap between WB and KPJ isn't that big in the first place
"As we all thought,Sam presti has given Houston another James Harden. This time for free!"
KPJ had more points tonight (27) than James Harden ever had in his age 20 season (26). Just sayin
James Harden with defense
James Harden gave the Rockets his energy tonight. He wants the Rockets to win.
They already tryna push James harden for mvp
This kid is James Harden 2.0 ive seen it all
"Durant was an obvious pick, the rest was good talent assessment, but that doesn’t mean much when you squander it all with poor personnel management.   No one made him trade for or extend Perkins, the latter, before he’d ever played with the team. As far as I know, no one forced to deal James Harden with a year left on his rookie deal, retain Scott Brooks far past his usefulness, or fail to find the team shooters. Nope, that’s all on him."
"Morey definitely put the future on the line several times to keep the team contending, but he left them with James harden lol. They could’ve had Ben Simmons thybulle and picks at least. Then you build around Simmons. They fucked that trade up and it seems like that’s fertittas fault. If that was stones outright decision he should be fired. I think the Brooklyn picks will be decent in the long run but that’s hard to sell a fan base that’s accustomed to a constantly competitive team."
aight so it's not even true now let's pretend like it never happened james harden never had a bad game in his life
No one forced OKC to give James Harden away to Houston with year left on his rookie deal.
It’s crazy that he was able to dunk a completely open lob from James harden?
"&gt;""It's just kind of crazy how it all comes together,"" Griffin said. ""In the beginning of the season, if you'd said that James and LaMarcus and I would end up with the Nets -- everybody's betting against that.""   Uh.... no they wouldn't.  The biggest reason the Nets were doubted after that trade was just the lack of size and depth they had after the Harden trade.   If you told people they'd pickup Blake Griffin and LMA on vet mins to pad out the roster then those people would say ""well shit that fixes the one clear problem they have""."
Jimmy Butler made it to the finals as the best player for the Heat.  James Harden has never made the finals as the best player for the Rockets.  Harden is a much better player than Jimmy.   There was also no Dynasty Squad in the 2020 Eastern Conference. Context matters. A lot of dudes potentially could reach the finals with a solid enough team backing them and some luck involved
"that's not quite the point I was trying to make, but yes I would agree. And that includes the Melo signing.  My point was in response to this:   &gt;not sure why the corpses of Blake and LMA are causing people to lose their shit about the Nets when everybody seemed to just shrug off the trade for James Harden.  The trade for Harden should be viewed in a very different light because the team had to give up several valuable assets and players - that's why it's a *trade*, because you have to give something up.   It's a much more legitimate transaction than the buyouts - in the case of Griffin and Aldridge, the Nets had to do absolutely nothing except just exist. They were able to get them for free just by virtue of them already being a good team in a big market. Textbook example of the rich getting richer, which is why people (including myself) have a bigger problem with it than the Harden trade."
Buy out James Harden you coward
"&gt; KD is the better player,  Probably unpopular take, but a healthy James Harden is currently a better player than healthy Kevin Durant.  The last time they met head to head in the playoffs, Harden was just as good as KD was while being surrounded by a lot less talent and in turn, easier to gameplan for."
"100%  I wonder if part of it is the historic relative disrespect for Harden's skillset (due to his playstyle), and people being dubious of ""fit"" because of the endlessly discussed chemistry issues (esp. around Kyrie).  Harden hopping teams and the showing that he continues to be James Fucking Carryjob Harden (now with new improved all-stars!) is the real story. League fucked.  (unless it turns out defense still matters during the playoffs, I guess we'll see)"
"Well, there are [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934230-the-2-month-trade-request-how-james-harden-forced-his-way-out-of-houston) of [KD recruiting Harden](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30324693/sources-brooklyn-nets-top-james-harden-list-trade-destinations) and encouraging him to force his way out of Houston.  Obviously the player doesn't always get to decide where he lands after a force out scenario (Like Kawhi) but considering how GMs will facilitate stars' wishes (for better relationships or agent clientele) I'd say there's an argument to be made that he forced his way to BK."
"If you're these players, are you picking those teams over A) defending champions with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, or B) team in the East with 2-time Finals MVP + 1-time reg season MVP + Kyrie?    Assuming all healthy of course.  I'd personally join those top 2 teams as well and let LeBron/AD or KD/Harden carry me to at least the conference finals."
James James  Harden Harden  Curry Curry  Doncic Doncic
"Here is my list. I'm sure some of the selections are flawed and I think I have a slight modern bias but I tend to think modern players are just better in general and shooting has become more and more important every year.  Steph, MJ, LeBron, Bird, KG is probably the best in terms of fit. 3 elite off ball scorers (plus MJ who was amazing at it as well). KG is arguably the most versatile and dominant defender of all time. KG, Steph and Bird pretty much solve the spacing issues of LeBron and MJ being on the same team. And all 5 are elite passers with KG being a top 5 big passer all time. Bird being probably the Goat Off ball and touch passer and curry being brilliant at it as well.  PG: Then for the reserve 5 Stockton, Chris Paul or James Harden. Shooting plus playmaking volume for all of them is all time great. I'll take Chris Paul because I think he is the best defender and a better scorer than Stockton and has the off ball skills to boot.  SG: Got to be Kobe.  SF: KD (arguably the best off ball scorer of all time key in any all time lineups)  PF: Giannis (He's here to counter both Big and small lineups he is a walking mismatch and one of the most switchable defenders of all time along with KD, LeBron and KG)   C: David Robinson (the best vertical spacer of all time, one of the greatest rim protectors and one of the few Big Men who didn't have to be ball dominant in the post to rack up the points - Hakeem. Or shaq are better but the Admiral is a better fit).  Then for the lineups you can have one of the 3 greatest offensive centre pieces in the court at all times and aside from LeBron all of the players I picked have tonnes of off-ball value that just make them superior choices to overall better players like shaq"
Because James Harden is literally stratospheres better than Jimmy Butler.  ‘Comparable regular season stats/accolades’  Harden’s had two more All-NBA seasons than Butler’s had All-Star
Like I don’t think James Harden is worse than say Jimmy Butler even though Butler generally plays well in the playoffs and Harden doesn’t always
"Seriously to think LA and BG can’t fucking dominate other benches on sub 20 Minutes a game is ludicrous. They’re going to be the best they’ve been if used correctly because they don’t have be managing their stamina against fucking 20 year olds for an entire game. They get to come in after kd, Kyrie and fucking James Harden just got done giving them the business."
"It is certainly studied. Competitive balance is one of the most important factors for owners, league officials, television stations, etc. Anyone who makes a portion of the collective revenue of the league cares quite a bit about competitive balance. Lebron James going to the Lakers and having to compete with the Warriors(minus KD), the Rockets(with Harden), the Clippers, and all of the other up and coming teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Sixers, Bucks, Raptors, Celtics, and so on greatly benefits the league. But when one or two teams dominate so much that fans stop questioning ""who will win this year"" the league definitely suffers.     Issues like what we're seeing right now actually have a fairly big impact on the future of the league considering the upcoming television contract. Fans who closely follow the sport see things like buyouts hurting competitive balance while casual fans who only watch the playoffs see a team like the Nets running through the conference with no competition whatsoever and it has an impact on how these broadcasting companies view potential revenue in their tv rights negotiations, which trickles down on the entire league."
An NBA guard can't throw a lob??? Only james harden can???
Ok I guess James Ennis can be had for Harden
He's a combo pg/sg like James Harden is. But he's still above James Harden
People thought Blake not being able to dunk in the Pistons as the 1st option meant he couldn't catch a completely open lob thrown by James Harden lol.
"Difference is, James Harden."
"Lol that won't prove anything. Did you actually watch any Pistons games this year or are you just assuming that not dunking = not trying?   BG played 25 games over that 1.5 year stretch of not dunking, between those games were multiple surgeries and rehabs and he was literally never healthy. It also includes 5 games in 2020 when he could barely move and was sidelined the rest of the season after.  He barely dunked in the 2019 season which is arguably his best year as a pro.  He's going to be playing an entirely different role on reduced minutes where he quite literally has no expectations and is playing with multiple superstars to maximize spacing. Do you think Bruce Brown was ""sandbagging"" on the Pistons because his efficiency is up 100 points and he's getting easy dunks/layups after leaving Detroit or do you think playing with someone like James Harden and being a 4th option gives someone easier opportunities to score compared to playing on a team with no other stars and being schemed out every night."
Why play off of one MVP shot creator when you can move teams and recruit James Harden.  Snake lookin ass
"Apparently it’s hard for Blake to understand lol  That said, not sure why the corpses of Blake and LMA are causing people to lose their shit about the Nets when everybody seemed to just shrug off the trade for *James Harden.* Straw that broke the camel’s back I guess."
"Harden does not have him beat in defense. James is a worse defender by nearly all measures and it goes without saying that the Nets defense with Harden on the court is way worse than the Nuggets defense with Jokic on the court. Jokic also has a better assist/to ratio this season, the playmaking gap is narrower than the scoring, efficiency, rebounding, and defense gaps. 7% more points per 100 possessions at 4% higher TS is a big gap, that’s the difference between Harden and players who aren’t even all stars."
"I think it's mostly a result of having a better team around him, which gets him better looks.  Teams planning for Jeremi Grant and Blake Griffin is a lot different than teams planning for James Harden, KD, Kyrie, and then Blake Griffin as a role player.  Blake is just getting better/easier scenarios to produce in.  He's really not that different even if he was mailing it in a bit."

"None of those teams have a seemly fully recovered Kevin Durant, James Harden and still crazy Kyrie, proven winners and all are near or at the top of there position. It's ring chasing."
"I’m kinda confused by the nets gm getting so much praise. KD and Kyrie were added last year not this year. And yes James harden is a huge add, but a lot of gms could have made that happen if harden forced a trade and wanted to go there anyways. Not knocking the nets for their success, but how much credit does the gm get for basically helping the players get what they already wanted."
"There's no situation where trading for James Harden is a bad move. If you say otherwise, you must have some sort of developmental disability."
OKC traded James Harden because they didn't want to pay the luxury tax to keep their super team together. How is that the fault of big markets?
"I agree with Suns over Nets.  Being located in New York and not being the Knicks helped big time in landing KD and Kyrie. Unloading all the picks you're allowed to unload to land James Harden isn't being a great GM lol, that's some shit I do on 2k when I have no intention of playing the following seasons.  Not even talking shit about the trade, but it's not like their GM is some type of wizard for pulling it off"
"I think under your plan what we are going to see are small markets signing these huge contracts for fringe players, and then players demanding trades/buyouts in year 2 and sitting out until their demands are met. If the team starts fining them, they will come back and just not give any effort just to secure their checks until their demands are met (a la James Harden). I think the rules of the buyout need to be stricter, as in they can't play in the playoffs or the salary cap hit gets split between the two teams (basically the minimum the buyout team can sign the player for is 50% of the original contract)"
"Ok, lets not go too ""lone hero"" here, much like how Kerr got 5 all stars to play flawless basketball on both ends, Harden was supported by a D'Antoni system that pushed the offensive envelope, and created a system all around his own strengths and weaknesses, with other fantastic shooters, Gordon and Ariza, talented bigs in Tucker and Capela, and a great floor general in Paul. We need to stop going ""James Harden almost beat Golden State"", Houston almost beat them. And they both ultimately failed in their losses for the same reasons: missed 3's, defensive limitations, and so forth. When they ultimately fell short in 2018, it was the team as a whole, as well as Harden."
"Imagine Russell Westbrook with less rebounds and assists, more points, and James Harden levels of free throws"
That’s a bit of revisionist history. Some of the top comments from the James Harden trade thread:  - “ Kyrie Harden Durant. Elite team Elite mental problems.”  - “ My goodness they really sold the whole future”.... “it’s ok they’ll play a 3 man rotation.”  - “Losing Allen is terrible for the Nets”  - “4 firsts AND 4 more swaps?  Celtics deal was only 3 picks and one swap.  That's twice as much and the Celtics deal set the Nets back half a decade. This is literally title run or complete franchise bust for the next decade.”   reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kwq2ik/charania_the_nets_are_trading_for_allnba_star/
"Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton are some of our best talent and they are homegrown/Marks picked them up years ago cause he's a good GM  we traded for Bruce Brown because Marks is good at finding talent. We have had other players like TLC and Chiozza for years.   Our other homegrown talent we traded for James Harden because well, no shit. Marks deserves credit, calling this team artificial isn't accurate when the GM is just really good"
"we traded our homegrown assets for James Harden. We still have Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton as some of our best players, we forgetting how good Sean Marks is to get these talented players who have either been drafted or on the team for years?  We traded for Bruce Brown. Again Sean Marks being a genius. We made good signings to build roster and have other players like TLC, Chiozza, etc left over from previous years.   Blake and LMA are literally playing like 15 minutes a game max lol"
"lmfao you guys are acting like he got up out of his wheelchair and is jumping over Kia's again on the Nets. He still looks old and washed, just has a significantly smaller role and he's playing with James fucking Harden. No shit he's playing better  lol having a lot of good players devalues a ring, cool story bro. Go ahead and devalue like every ring in history. I'm sure the players will be heartbroken by you being unimpressed"
Because he didn’t play with James harden setting him up? Also Detroit’s spacing sucked. His dunk this year Joe Harris and shamet spaced the floor for him and we were 5 out
Yeah “risky” trade? Levert and Allen is all they lost this season. For James Harden lol. There was nothing risky about it.
"&gt;An incredibly risky trade most people shrugged off and laughed at the Nets for doing.  Surely this isn't talking about the James Harden trade, right? Anyone that mocked the Nets for making that trade is a fucking moron."
He’s an scoring combo guard who plays at his own pace. I see a lot of okc James Harden in his game but instead of using his strength to finish he relies more on finesse. They both play almost off tempo.
"I hate to say it, especially with James Harden, the true success of it will be judged by the playoffs, not the regular season"
"When the James harden trade was made, everyone was complaining how the trade wouldn't work since ""theres only one ball"" and ""their egos will get in the way"". No one knew this was gonna happen, I don't think even nets fan expected this. But now we signed 2 aging players in Blake and LMA, And KD still coming off an Achilles injury. Would the league and r/nba still have the same reaction if Kawhi DID join the Lakers when he was being recruited by the LBJ and the Lakers? I think the addition of Blake and LMA doesn't  very minimal to the nets offensive needle, they were already good enough to make to the finals. Blake and LMA add some depth, maybe 8 pts and 5 rebounds. The Lakers adding Drummond is a bigger issue imo"
"This isn't fair to the Nets tbh cause this is like the first time that they are serious championship contenders in a while other than the 70 year old Paul Pierce and KG they brought it.  Blake and LMA are just big names. They weren't the ones that made the Nets amazing, that was James Harden. An incredibly risky trade most people shrugged off and laughed at the Nets for doing. It paid off and now people are mad that they took the risk while their team was being stupid and rejected Harden for culture reasons lmao"
"This is your opinion. Crazy how you think it’s a 35 year old LMA and a Blake Griffin who has to ice after 15 minutes of game time and can’t play back to backs is the issue. Not James Harden who was an MVP runner 2 seasons ago and an MVP before that. Use your brain, look past the names and you’ll see that it’s nothing special apart from extra depth."
James Harden.
"I don't understand how someone can be talking about Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and end their argument with ""When is he going to get the respect he deserves as an all time great?""  Disconnected from reality."
"Absolutely.   LeBron and Vogel are amazing at team defense that doesn’t rely on a dpoy performance from a superstar like Kawhi. If they can make Kyrie/Durant/Harden/Harris take hard, contested shots, AD can just feast on DJ on offense. Assuming both James and Davis can come back close to 100%."
If you don't think James Harden is a better player you're an idiot. You new nba fans don't watch basketball and it shows.
Shot longer than a James Harden euro step
Look at all these kids in here making 6'5 James Harden a 7 footer and leaving Muggsys ass at 5'3
I’ve adopted the nets so to me this is great. But trading for James harden is what made the nets scary. I was so mad when the warriors signed demarcus cousins but buyout guys rarely ever make a huge difference in the playoffs.
"LMAOOOOO that’s like trading james harden for kelly olynyk and some pick swaps :,)))))"
"Bitch, you gotta be the most consistent hater ever. I've seen you on threads hating on Curry and others. Gotta give it to you atleast you're more consistent than James Harden in playoffs who you advocate. Fucking piece of trash"
He’s delusional enough to be point Drummond. He’s a fucking manic he has a higher turnover rate than James Harden. He’s gonna throw a few passes in the stands every game.
Drummonds a fucking manic. He somehow has a higher turnover rate than LeBron and James Harden.
"Man Kyrie should keep on playing. This NETS team is slowly turning into full-time James Harden team and James was already proclaiming that he was the league MVP, that means he is the boss man of the NETS right now.   We know Kyrie hates being a third banana but if he keeps missing games, that's exactly what he's going to turn into because the team will slowly configure itself to the skill set of Harden."
AD best scoring season: 28ppg on 61% TS  Zion right now: 26ppg on 67% TS   Just a massive gap efficiency wise. That 6% TS gap is like the gap between James Harden and Jayson Tatum.
"Easily. Although my flair is of former Celtic great, Von Wafer, I wouldn't consider myself a Celtic fan.  What I've seen is they've made the conference finals in 3 out of 4 years but that's the indicator on what's to come indefinitely according to most die hards.  What I see is this, they've lost all those series and the entire league doesn't just stay the same as they get better. I think they really missed the boat on possibly keeping Hayward (don't know if that was entirely possible), getting Myles Turner, and making a run at James Harden in favor of building around the core of players WHO ARE GOOD, but not nearly as indispensable as fans make them out to be."
"James Harden this season, James Harden in 2016, and Russell Westbrook this season"
Bruh it's Andre Drummond they signed not James Harden.
He's just more rested and has James Harden playmaking for him. His best couple games of the season were with us still.
because he's playing less minutes and getting easy set ups from James? the detroit team was ass and he was asked to do too much when it's clear he can't. on the nets Harden is just finding him easy passes. and let's not act like that dunk was a real dunk. if you saw Blake in his prime you'd know this was barely a dunk he just guided it in.
Exactly. I mean the fact it ended with Olynyk and shitty picks for James Harden is comically bad. And I hate to say that since I really genuinely respect Rockets fans.
Lou Williams and James Harden come screeching in.
"You're exactly right and anyone who's not an idiot foresaw that the Nets are going to be fucking insanely nice. I cannot believe people thought James Harden KD and Kyrie Irving would just crumble becuase people thought they would have to have less touches lmao. It's honestly the disrespect to Harden since people legit don't watch him play (but are actually are watching him this year) and so they didn't realize that a player who has been a top 5 player for the past 5 years is actually good at basketball lol. People realize now that he's one of the best playmakers in the league and so he can elevate everyone around him, including KD and Kyrie. It's also the disrespect to Kyrie since he's a little bit nuts, but people forget he's a certified bucket in the playoffs. KD's game speaks for itself tho, people doubted he would come back this nice but he's looking just about as good as ever. I mean even if the three have to split touches, any one of Kyrie, Harden, or KD being relegated to catch and shoot for a possession or two is gonna result in a bucket lmao. We're talking about star players here they're gonna get buckets regardless lol"
"“I’ll have you know James Harden didn’t quit on his team, and go to parties violating COVID protocol. He just tactically ascertained that his team wouldn’t be good and desired the opportunity earn a ring in a better environment”"
"Because when superstars go public with their demands for a trade, the team makes it happen   See Kyrie Irving 2017, Anthony Davis 2019, Paul George 2019, Russell Westbrook 2019/2020, James Harden 2020..."
Wait kyrie irving who outplayed Steph curry in the finals and went toe to toe with him the next year? The guy who has one of the biggest shots in the history of basketball? Or James harden who dropped 35/7/5 on 62 TS% vs the kd warriors in the playoffs? Or James harden who dropped 30 on 60 TS% vs the lakers last year who had the best defense in the league?
You think the Nets wouldn’t get James Harden if AD didn’t force his way to LA?

"Those early Heat teams were every bit as stacked as this Nets team. Come on now. Bosh was every bit as good as Kyrie, and Wade was every bit as good as James Harden."
"The Warriors only beat Cleveland with Kyrie and Love injured. The year after, when both were healthy, they defeated the Warriors. The Warriors then went &amp; recruited KD, who they felt they needed to combat LBJ in the finals.      KD was right to leave OKC &amp; join GS, giving us some of the best basketball of all time. It was well deserved after OKC's management ruined his chances at a dynasty by giving away James Harden to Houston."
"Ahhh yes an NBA credentialed reporter for Sports Illustrated, and ESPN is not a reliable source because you haven't heard of him and don't like what he said, good take 👍.

The man couldn’t even get the Thunder out of the first round after KD left. Had to link up with James Harden to see what the semis felt like again
"James Harden has never won a chip, Kyrie won a chip with LeBron (One of the bests to play in the NBA and has made it to the finals 10 times), a washed up Blake Griffin who has never even been to the conference finals, and an old Lamarcus Aldridge.   They can't win alone so guess what they decided to do? Create a friggin Avenger team."
James Harden: “Damn he just like me”
"See heres the name value thing. Dieng has shot over 40% from 3 (small sample size but you can't leave him open from there), can protect the rim, and is quick enough   to not be a liability outside of the paint defensively  LMA on contrast is shooting just 36% from 3 and looks like he can barely move on defense. Just like Blake he will be better on the Nets but don't expect it to move the needle much. The Nets are insane because of the incredibly risky James Harden trade, not the buyouts"
"I stopped caring at this point but I hope KD understand where people are coming from where he leaves GS to presumably want to compete for Championships without needing a superteam and prove himself and then probably has a hand in getting James Harden on the roster to form another Superteam that's undoubtedly the favorites right now.   The Blake and Aldridge signings don't change much, but the big name signings just amplify the outrage."
"&gt; First of all there’s no comparison between Lebron’s and Durant’s superteams   Wade had won the championship as the best player four years before, and averaged basically the same stat line as Lebron James on the same efficiency their first year in Miami. He made first team-all nba in  the two preceding seasons before Lebron joined Miami. He was a top 2 guard in the NBA, and one of the 5-7 best players. Chris Bosh was a 5 time all star at 26.       &gt; Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie   Kevin Love was 26 and 13 guy the year before he joined Cleveland. He was basically asked to play out of position for his entire run with them. Of course he isn't as good as Harden, but he was a top 15 player.   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt; Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt;  Durant wasn’t even the leader of the team during his championships.   After Durant joined he was the only player on Golden State to win FMVP. If you don't think he was the best player and the leader than you are blind."
"PPG is far from the only thing that defines a player. Lmao.  &gt; These guys aren’t the guys that made the Nets a super team lol we became a superteam when we gave away Levert, Jared Allen, and Prince for James Harden   So, do you understand everyone's qualms? The Nets became a super team with the addition of James Harden, then they got Blake Griffin and LMA for free."
"First of all there’s no comparison between Lebron’s and Durant’s superteams  Old Wade and Bosh is nothing compared to Steph,Klay,Dray and Iggy  Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie  Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve. Durant has never played without a multiple time all star by his side and generally had competent teams. Lebron gets more respect because we know he can do a lot with less help, Durant wasn’t even the leader of the team during his championships."
"If you want to criticize Durants move to Golden State, sure. Was a FA and stacked the deck. He didn't make this team though, he came to Brooklyn when it was him and Kyrie.   You cannot fault someone for recruiting James Harden. Bron and AD BOTH were recruiting Kawhi before he came to Clips, and that was fine. Kudos to Kawhi for not making that team sheeeesh."
"Lmao dude Kevin Durant is not the GM of the Nets, he didn't make these moves.   If ANYONE had the chance to make this Brooklyn team they would. So, for example, if James Harden had wanted to go to LA, Bron woulda recruited hard. But that's okay right? Because it's Bron and the narrative is Durant is a snake bitch?   Fucking so childish on this sub I swear"
I don’t hate him or anything he is like James Harden for me where 9/10  even if I have no real interest in the outcome of a game I am rooting for his opponent.
"Lmao Nets fans being ""excited"" about a team of guys who showed up anywhere from this week to (at most) a year ago and won't be around in five years and are gonna forget what team they even won a ring on someday. Legit no player is signing with the Nets because of ""The Brooklyn Nets"", it has nothing to do with ""Sean Marks brilliant moves as a GM"" it has nothing to do with ""Steve Nash"" it has nothing to do with ""being in a major market"" when casual sports viewers who only catch some of the playoffs and the finals still think the ""Nets"" are a team in New Jersey, it's ""KD and Kyrie signed there and got James Harden to force his way there so now everyone else wants to be there too"". This team is legit a meaningless blank canvas that's had little to no identity for 40 years in the league to the point where some guys could just show up and be the entire identity of the team, wear their generic black and white uniforms emblazoned with the most nondescript object in the game of basketball, pick up a ring, and feel no emotional attachment to that franchise. Being a Nets fan in 2021 and being excited about this is the definition of rooting for laundry."
KPJ Sophomore season: 16/5/3 on 54% TS as one of the teams top options  Harden Sophomore season: 12/3/2 on 59% TS as a bench player   Not saying KPJ will be James Harden but let’s not act like Harden was an all nba guy overnight. Believe it or not most greats struggle in their early seasons the league is a tough learning curve
"I wouldn’t say the nets have it easy. Just a different path to get where they needed.  They were fleeced for years with their trade to the Celtics, had very little draft capital and still was able to get enough value for James harden. And it is really hard to make a super team, if it was easy all the star players would just team up. Contracts still have to be paid and when the superstar is in their prime they aren’t taking discounts.  Compare that to the warriors who had Curry Thompson and draymond all being underpaid then out of nowhere due to a cap influx warriors lose nothing to gain KD for a max deal."
"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving &amp; Lebron James was a super team in 2015.  The reason the Warriors got to the Finals that year was because the talent level was low in the league. Like I said, transitional period, the old guard in Duncan, Kobe etc were moving on and the young guys weren’t established in the league yet.  Besides Warriors and Cavs. You had Lob City Clips, Al Horford Hawks, Lowry Derozan Raptors, Harden Dwight Rockets, Dame LMA Blazers, KD &amp; Russ who were hurt a lot.  That’s how bad the talent was. Most teams had 1-2 All Stars at most. Lebron-Kyrie-Love is 100% a super team in comparison to the rest"
"Kyrie is the emotional leader, James Harden generally directs offense but trades possession with Kyrie.  The way the minutes are staggered they both have a good 5-6 minutes stretch of running the offense. In the clutch Kyrie is going to get the ball a bit more than he should cause Hardens unselfish. They essentially are conjoined top dawgs."
Yes you’re changing the goal post. I said that most players averaging 35 mpg this year were all stars this year or the year before. I thought using a 2 year sample size would be better than using one year where the season has been pretty whacky.   Holy fucking shit why don’t you just answer the question. Who were LeBron’s 2 beat teammates in those respective years you mentioned?   But to answer your question LeBron has been averaging better overall numbers now than he was in his first stint with Cleveland. His percentages are all up along with his assist and rebounds. I don’t know why you’re comparing him now to his first Cavs stint when it’s clear he’s the better player now. Even the box score support it.   You said Kobe would average worse stats and you haven’t giving a clear cut answer except for he would average less minutes. I disproved that by showing you he averaged his career numbers when he was already old and he was playing less than 35 mpg that season.   I’ve been saying his prime this whole time. You’ve been saying his prime this whole time. We never talked about his peak offensive season. See how you don’t even know what you’re taking about?   Did I not tell you per 100 stats are not meant to be used as the sole dictator in a discussion? It’s a damn mathematical equation used to try to balance out the numbers for every generation. But guess what? No one fucking averages per 100 numbers in a season for a reason. You really think if you give someone 100 possessions every game they would average those numbers for a season? Get the fuck out of here.   Less minutes does not equal less touches. Holy shit you’re dense.   James harden in his peak offensive season was averaging 24 shots a game and 11 FTA a game. That’s almost 30 shots a game if you count the shots he needed to take to get those free throws. He did that in 36.8 mpg. Kobe on the other hand 27.2 shots and and 6.5 3’s a game along with 13.2 3’s a game along with song with 10.2 FTA. That’s about 32 shots a game. You really think Kobe wouldn’t be shooting more 3’s in this era? Kobe would constantly take 3’s with his toe on or foot past the line because the 3 wasn’t as important when he played.   You’re crazy if you think Kobe would play exactly the same in this era where he would have the offensive freedom to do whatever he wanted.
"Yes, of course. Let’s blame Durant for everything when the 76ers could’ve got James Harden themselves"
I'll just answer 2005.   Kevin Durant comp Tracy McGrady  Kyrie Irving comp Allen Iverson  James Harden comp Dwayne Wade
I'll just answer 2005.   Kevin Durant comp Tracy McGrady  Kyrie Irving comp Allen Iverson  James Harden comp Dwayne Wade
Kyrie is no James Harden.
"It's beal's first year leading the league in scoring  James Harden for example didn't do that until 28, Beal is only 27"
"Damn the disrespect to James Harden and Steph Curry, they ain't Lebron or MJ, but they belong in the same class as everyone else"
"&gt; Something people ITT are conveniently ignoring.  No, I'm not ignoring it. I'm talking about who is better *right now.*  How relevant are KD and Harden's first ~8 years or whatever number you want to use when evaluating a player *right now?*   &gt; Replace KD with Harden on those GSW teams and I guarantee he would still average his usual chokes in the playoffs.  Statements like this are among the dumbest on this subreddit.  Why are you using a situation you cannot prove either way to make a point?  There's literally nothing that supports what you're saying.  The last time we saw both Kevin Durant and James Harden in the playoffs, Harden was the better player overall."
"He's not ""clearly"" better than James Harden lol. That's ridiculous."
"I'm sure no names like Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are beside themselves that all eyes are on Reggie fucking Bullock and Julius Randle."
"James Harden really is the MVP at this point, night and day difference when he's out"
Kyrie in 3 seasons without James Harden (or anyone better than him) on his team  25 ppg on 49/40/89 splits
Kyrie is no James Harden
KD and Harden already have chemistry for playing together for years during their OKC days. They even went to a finals together  KD and Kyrie have been on the Nets for two years now and played tons of games together at the beginning of the season.   And Kyrie and James have played together tons this season
"So three picks and Bled/Hill would’ve been good enough for James fucking Harden? Would you take that if you were the Rockets GM? Even if you add Donte, the difference is that all the Nets stars are 31+ and those later picks from BKN could actually be valuable. Meanwhile a pick in that year from the Bucks still has Giannis in his prime. Which is better?"
"Idk, i usually judge a players defense by their ability to guard James Harden  Therefore the best defenders in the league are Lu Dort and Josh Okogie"
James Edward Harden II
1st Team-  PG: Damian Lillard  SG: James Harden  SF: Giannis Antetokounmpo   PF: Zion Williamson  C: Nikola Jokic  ---------------------  2nd Team-  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal  SF: Zach LaVine  PF: Julius Randle  C: Nikola Vucevic
Individual awards &gt; team awards when measuring individual greatness. We all would agree James Harden is better than Channing Frye
"I know a bunch of r/nba casuals like to mock screen assists, but Gobeet currently has the highest OTRG in NBA history. Not saying he's James Harden or anything out there, but what he does do contributes to his team's offense immensely and is overlooked by the casual fan who only looks at box scores."
"Ahh yes, the 7 foot James Harden  And that's a 7 foot ""one of the best offensive players ever seen"", not 7 foot ""strip club connoisseur"""
"Not sure if you’re trolling or not. KD honestly might’ve went back to end it but the fans handled it so poorly it probably soured that idea for him. I understand losing a superstar sucks, but the dude still balled the fuck out for your team for 9 seasons and made OKC relevant. And if you want to be mad at anyone for him leaving, don’t forget that the front office traded JAMES FUCKING HARDEN for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and two picks."
"I love how actually NBA players have called him the most skilled player of all time or think he’s up there with the likes of Kobe but you guys, who don’t like Kyrie think you know more than him and think he’s not more skilled than the guys on his team. He’s a better shooter and finisher than James harden, and a better shooter, finisher and passer than KD. At 6’2 he’s been really efficient throughout his entire career, and is super efficient this season. The only reason he isn’t averaging 30+ every season is that he gets no calls. But he’s even a better free throw shooter than harden and KD and we know he’s a better ball handler than both so why tf is everyone saying he’s not the most skilled on his team? Tf is wrong with y’all hating on this man so much"
That's a James Harden Monday night.
Steph Curry and James Harden are not top 5 players then.
trueeeeee  unrelated but what is your opinion on James Edward Harden?
Embiid gets more calls than anyone I’ve ever seen outside of James Harden.
7 ft James Harden basically
"Durant didn't win his 2 fvmps with harden though, and harden decided at 31 to join KD off a season long injury. Wade at 29 joined a 25 year old lebron james, see the difference?    Wade literally got outplayed by lebron the entire time they played together at miami"
Why stop there let's give them James Harden too.
'Dwight literally made an all star game' Lebron james was literally the best player in the world. He literally won 2 MVPs and 2 FMVPs in Miami. 'outplayed harden in a couple playoff series' Yea and lebron outplayed wade in Miami
Paul Pierce's last tweet before this called James Harden the MVP.
"Sorry, I can't hear you from the bottom of the standings. All I managed to hear was ""We didn't win anything with James Harden because we were only a regular season team"""
"Horrible take, harden played with russ and KD... Til he was 23, then it was 8 years with the rockets with cp3 as his best teammate in that time. D wade played with shaq and a fucking prime lebron james."
"That says more about plus minus as a stat than it does about Harden, unless you seriously believe Ben McLemore outplayed James Harden lol"
"That’s all highlights, I could show you the James harden stare down, Ibaka fight, dame lilard wave and say *tHe LeaGuE hAs gONe SoFT*. I’ve watched games over quarantine, it’s all revisionist history"
Don't forget all the weak James Harden-esque moves to built theses superteams. Which essentially makes the championship irrelevant for the NBA outside of the team that wins it.
I mean James Harden has more seasons/years being viewed as a top 5 player than Wade.
James Harden is a better scorer. Wade is a better player.
"Friendly reminder that of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry.  And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall."
Why so many James harden posts
James Harden?
Paul Pierce walked so James Harden could run
They could legit win this with just James harden of the big 3.
James Harden was available earlier this season's for a pretty low asking price. They should've jumped on that. Even this year's atrocious supporting cast couldn't drag down two guys who are basically an offense unto themselves.
James Harden calls this a Tuesday morning.
"This sub jokes about James harden at the strip clubs all the time, but then says that Paul pierce is slipping for the same shit lol. Have these people not been to a strip club? What do they think people go there for? Chicken wings?"
James harden
James Harden would never do something so low budget
"Kyrie thinks the Earth is flat, Lebron thinks vaccines are fake, Lou Will went to a strip club during the bubble and took pictures, James Harden went to a strip club during quarantine and took videos lol  NBA players are god-tier 1% athletes that barely graduated high school, you're asking for way way too much expecting them to be intelligent."
James Harden
Another career that James Harden revitalized
"I mean it comes down to the players. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Lamarcus Aldridge is a stronger lineup than any 5 the Lakers can put out there."
&gt; averaged 35 for a season  In a time when scoring &amp; 3 point shooting was much lower too. It's not the same as James Harden averaging 35.
James Harden calls this a Tuesday.
"Top 10 in order. By the way, I don’t overreact to 30 regular season games like some do. A 3 month stretch isn’t going to undermine years of someone else’s work.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Stephen Curry   4. Kawhi Leonard   5. James Harden   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Damian Lillard   10. Anthony Davis"
"That last sentence... You're short (relative to a tall person, so like 6'2 or below), are you?  Kyrie's skill (aka his dribbling, because let's be real that's what we're all talking about) doesn't scale in effectiveness linearly with height. There's more distance for the ball to travel.   It's also easier (in theory of course) to read the movements of a 6'8 player, making it more efficient for them to blow by you with the first step than to break you down off the dribble.  Besides, as mentioned in this thread a couple times... Kyrie isn't even the most skilled player on his team. That's James Harden.   There's an understandable bias towards ""underdog""-type players. Two biggest traits being short or white... And lawwwwd god forbid they're both (formerly TJ now Facu) but this ain't it."
"Both guys had their superstar teammates miss a ton of time in 2015.  Harden proved himself an alpha dog through and through even though Dwight missed half the season. Getting the second seed caught everyone off-guard.  Russ couldn't carry as hard as James with KD out. He arguably had slightly better counting stats, but was far behind in advanced stats and that came through in the team records."
Why TF would we care how James Harden looks now? Lol
"**2017**  James Harden averaged 29.1/8.1/11.2 on better shooting   He led his team to 55 wins despite not having a co-star. Westbrook led the Thunder to a 47 win 6th seed  Sadly, Harden’s stats weren’t “round” like a triple-double so he didn’t win MVP   After 2017, it hasn’t been debatable"
"They have that many players averaging double digits because none of them could stay on the court lmao what, we had a bunch of different guys give us minutes. The warriors have Andrew Wiggins who is a great defender and averaging 18 PPG on 40% three point shooting. Harden would have loved to have that. Or Draymond who would have been by far our best defender and would have relieved some playmaking off James"
"Rockets fans are a different breed man, all that james harden pollutin' yer minds"
"Doesn’t matter about the total number. It’s more about who was standing in their way. James Harden and the Rockets lost 4 times to the Warriors - who knows what happens if they’re able to reach the finals and play LeBron’s team . LeBron denied the Melo knicks team, PG Indiana teams, &amp; the Toronto teams because he stood in their way."
"They want you to believe this Warriors team ""isn't that bad"" for two reasons: to make Steph look bad and make James Harden look good. Inferiority complex on full display."
"Nah, maybe it’s just me but I wouldn’t give up Wiseman and the Minny pick for Brogdon and Myles Turner. We’re getting a stretch 5 who if his shots don’t fall he is an offensive liability and a guard who looks like a Walmart version of Manu.   You have to understand that the Warriors could’ve offered a trade package better than any team that big for James Harden, Wiggins+Wiseman+Wolves Pick+3 1st Rounders beats any team in the league in terms of package. So ideally what the Warriors need to get is at the very minimum a multiple-time All-Star that can shoot if they want to give up on Wiseman and are willing to add in more."
Houston found their next James Harden
"I understand not wanting to give the nets undue credit, but it does count for something to have the pieces in place to make the kind of moves they did.  For what it's worth, I don't think it's enough to beat the Lakers, nor would I give them credit for the James Harden trade. They got lucky Tillman has a grudge against Morey."
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."
WHY DOES WISEMAN THINK HES JAMES HARDEN? WTF
"If Kerr had James Harden and he didn't let him run the offense, he would be fired."
The same James Harden that averages less points on a lower efficiency than Steph while playing on a super team.
steve kerr is far more expendable than a James Harden or Damian Lillard.
Pretty sure James “Jeffrey”  Harden could win the finals with these guys. Cmon bro gtfo lmao
"I’m not sure what the criteria would be but James Harden, Russ, and Melo come to mind"
"Yeah, look no further than James Harden. He's a superior offensive player than KD due to"
James harden?
Yeah but they'd also be starting James Harden  I'm sure they would find a way to address the C position.
"rudy gobert, chris paul, james harden."
"I can see Dirk as Sagat, but KD, with his limbs, is Dhalsim for sure. Lol Steph Curry is Ryu while James Harden is Ken."
"That line of thinking, that players can't be considered truly great unless they win a championship is ridiculous.   The players have taken it upon themselves to erase that and now people are mad about them making their own superteams.   That's what happens when you tell all time greats like Ewing, Barkley, Iverson, Stockton,  Malone, etc , that they are lesser because they never won a title.  The generations following them who become all stars and want to cement their legacy have taken it into their own hands and I don't blame them one bit.   It sucks from a competition standpoint,  but from the player's side I agree.    Chris Paul, James Harden, Dame Lillard and others shouldn't have their legacies suffer because their owners never surrounded them with better talent &amp; coaching."
FT attempts is not a good example. James Harden at his absolute peak was taking 11.8 FTs a game. That's 6 calls. How many of those do you think were bad calls? 1? 2? That's not a lot for how much people think he gets  There's much more than fouls than FTA
"Man all SAS was saying is that Russ needs to get to the next level ...it’s the same with Dame or Last year James Harden !!!!!!! Killing , giving crazy numbers ...."
"“Few pieces away”... if by a few pieces you mean KD, Kyrie, James Harden, Blake Griffin and now Aldridge...  Yeah.. not exactly a few pieces there buddy... the Knicks this year are well ahead of where they were projected to be.. at the very least the Knicks didn’t have to buy their championship.  If the nets win this year 1 no one will give a shit and 2 it will have an asterisk on it forever... that’s what this season has shown..  In fact, the sheer amount of movement from guys who want rings to the nets has only served to spark conversation about change in the way buyouts, trades etc. should be handled to stop it from happening again."
My starting point guard is Elfrid Payton so I'll take 1 James Harden please

"Kevin Durant has played one season of his NBA career without a future, present, or past MVP next to him. That was his rookie season. Since then he's either had Westbrook, Curry, or Harden on his team. When Westbrook was injured in 2013, the KD-led Thunder were up 2-0 on the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and closed it out 4-2 before losing 1-4 to the Grizzlies the next round.  Title success in the NBA this past decade has been either you have LeBron James, ~~Klay Thompson~~ Steph Curry, or put Kawhi Leonard on a team that could make the conference finals without him."
"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.  The most-recently-drafted Top 10 pick to play in the Finals with his draft team was Harrison Barnes -- #7 overall by the Warriors in 2012.  Of the past 100 top 10 picks -- 2009 through 2019 -- only Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry have even played in the Finals with their draft team.  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that a team just needs a first-round pick to win is not well supported."
"I got downvoted to hell for suggesting to deal Jamal Murray post haste, and had to hear why even Michael Porter Jr. wasn’t worth trading for James Harden since he’s so young and it would disrupt team chemistry. James Harden!"
"I mean in that Rockets game ya’ll definitely started out slow but you won by 12 and out scored them by 25 in the second half. And even in that game you guys still had Aldridge and KEVIN DURANT inactive. KD averages 29 ppg on 65% TS this season and you just saw the value Aldridge gives. It’s fun to act like there’s still a question about who’s gonna win it all this year but be real, when everyone is healthy this team is literally unstoppable. Just having 1 of James Harden or Kevin Durant makes a team an automatic contender most years, and you guys have both of them plus Kyrie and a stacked team around them."
"LeBron James: Reg. Season 27; Playoffs 28.8  Durant: 27.1 - 29  Kawhi (since 2016): 24.8 - 28.1  Curry: (since 2015): 27.5 - 27.2  Harden is a top 3 player in the regular season and doesn't live up to that in the playoffs. Its not even just about stats, the eye test hasnt been great for him."
It's not that far fetched to see him at James Harden levels of stats.
Would you rather have Damian Lillard or James Harden?

Hum  James Harden went from literally hitler toplaying beautiful basketball in 1 week and a plane flight
"Jesus like people really need to watch games  Drawing fouls is a skill, there is a reason that a rookie James Harden drew fouls at an elite rate as a 8th man on the team averaging 9ppg   It's not about refs not calling shit, you need to know how to draw contact and sell it   Jokic faces up, Embiid posts up and takes way more shots from the post (5.5 FGA from the post, 3.8 for Jokic) and Jokic takes a lot more from that outside the paint area   Also Embiid is just great at drawing contact, it's talent, does he get shitty calls? Sure"
"Hmmm no actually doing it when Lebron was a viable candidate was the best time to do it. Hurting Jokic to prop up who? James Harden? Dame Lillard? Maybe, MAYBE you guys are just wrong and refs stink?"
"Bernard King got 11 first place votes out of 71 with a 47-35 record, against Larry Bird of all people.  Harden didnt finish 2nd because people looked at his advanced stats and were wowed. He finished 2nd because voters dont give a shit about advanced metrics. It’s all about narrative and record.  Seriously, any person not named James Harden wins that award. And if it was true that voters look at advanced metrics more and more, Harden should have 3-4 MVPs by now.  But he doesnt. He lost most of them purely because of record. And when I say purely I mean purely. Curry in 2015, Giannis in 2019 had no argument outside of record really. Harden was better.  This is my main point. If Harden loses the MVP because voters decided to switch up the criteria (again), that would be the 3rd time he’s been screwed by voters suddenly changing what ‘matters’ to win.  If voters keep the consistency they’ve always voted with, it doesnt matter how much better Jokic’s stats are, Harden should win because muh seeding (which is ridiculous)"
Still not a good comparison. Jokic is better than Harden in everything this year. Giannis was way closer to James in the areas Harden led than Harden is to Jokic in any advanced stat. Harden isn’t even top 5 in a number of them.
"The team fans on here talking about how their 4th best player wasn’t worth trading for James Harden was truly the dumbest recurring argument I saw on here in a long time. There are like, 8 players max you maybe hesitate to trade for Harden."
"""somehow the 6MOTY is being awarded to James Harden"""
"Pretty solid list. To add to it, looking at half decades:   PG:   * 80-85: Magic Johnson * 85-90: Magic Johnson * 90-95: John Stockton * 95-00: Gary Payton * 00-05: Jason Kidd * 05-10: Steve Nash * 10-15: Chris Paul * 15-20: Steph Curry  SG:   * 80-85: George Gervin * 85-90: Michael Jordan * 90-95: Michael Jordan * 95-00: Michael Jordan * 00-05: Tracy McGrady * 05-10: Kobe Bryant * 10-15: Kobe Bryant * 15-20: James Harden  SF:   * 80-85: Larry Bird * 85-90: Larry Bird * 90-95: Scottie Pippen * 95-00: Grant Hill * 00-05: Paul Pierce * 05-10: LeBron James * 10-15: LeBron James * 15-20: LeBron James  PF:   * 80-85: honestly real hard, all the great players were either a SF or C. I guess Kevin McHale * 85-90: Charles Barkley * 90-95: Karl Malone * 95-00: Karl Malone * 00-05: Tim Duncan * 05-10: Dirk Nowitzki * 10-15: Blake Griffin * 15-20: Anthony Davis  C:   * 80-85: Moses Malone * 85-90: Hakeem Olajuwon * 90-95: Hakeem Olajuwon * 95-00: Shaq * 00-05: Shaq * 05-10: Tim Duncan (at this point he had moved to center almost exclusively) * 10-15: Dwight Howard * 15-20: Nikola Jokic  In total, players with 3+: MJ and LeBron, players with 2: Duncan, Hakeem, Shaq, Bird, Kobe, Magic."
"&gt; Because James Harden is better than him.   there is room between ""Worse than Harden"" and ""low end top 10 player"". nobody is taking Anthony Davis over KD"
"Because James Harden is better than him. There are only two players that you can make a convincing  argument for being better than Harden in this league, Curry and Lebron, that's it."
It is when we’re talking about James fucking Harden
"Herro is never gonna be even as good as Jimmy Butler, never mind James Harden. If he really was the roadblock that prevented a James Harden trade, Miami’s entire front office needs to retire in shame."
James Harden is overrated
"Embiid, Jokic... you're not trading them. And James harden only got traded cuz he forced it"
Lebron James Harden
Still think Zion could be traded for a James Harden type deal. People act like ye is going to play like this for 15 years.
"Dear diary,  Steph Curry has a trash ass team and is carrying them to the playoffs, barely. So he shouldn’t be MVP.   James Harden had a trash ass team and bounced so he could join KD and Kyrie. He should be MVP."
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
James Harden and it just ended on the last day of last month at 654 games. When he played on April 5 he failed to score a point before coming out with that injury.
"James Harden =/= ""great"" defender"
But Tyler Herro could be anything! He could even turn into prime James Harden!
"Fucking idiots, who cares what Tyler Herro could turn into you get prime JAMES HARDEN right now"
"&gt; if they can't handle the reality of possibly being traded then they probably aren't strong enough mentally to be in the league.  This is the reality. If Wiseman is going to make it in the league, and I hope he does because he seems like a great person and hard worker, he's got to be focusing on himself right now despite the injury. Every successful player is playing to be the best they can and give as much as they can to win and avoid being tradeable, but, when push comes to shove, there's very few players who are untradeable when it comes to getting players like Harden or AD.  &gt;People are so worried about James Wiseman psyche. This is the life he chose, the fans shouldn't be asking him to be pampered like a child. He may be young but he is no child  He's definitely not a child. Above all his struggles and adaptation to the NBA, he's been incredibly mature about everything. Some people point out clips of Dray being a bit harsh on him as reasons why he won't grow but every indication from him says that he's working hard to become better, adapt his play to the NBA and absorb as much as he can. As much as I've hoped he would grow to become a huge contributor for this iteration of the Warriors it would be fairly dumb to pass up a reasonable trade for him in hopes of him recovering fast and contributing immediately. He'll make it in the league, whether it be with the Warriors or someone else, he just needs to continue working hard."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/heatnation.com/rumors/heres-the-ridiculous-package-the-rockets-wanted-from-the-heat-for-james-harden/amp/  It was a simple google search away dude
Uh....James Harden being traded for essentially no players but a lot of picks is kinda a big reason why.
"Tyler herro just has a ton of people that hate him for whatever reason lol. Guaruntee that OP knew this shit was misleading but just felt like getting some herro hate going. I mean, he's played decently since the ASB overall (at least that's what I thought), so I guess this type of thread was overdue.   Btw, did you know that the heat wouldn't trade Tyler herro for James Harden straight up???^not ^true ^but ^who ^cares ^lol"
I couldn't possibly think of a less important comparison. Herro takes the second most shots on the Heat during the age of 3pt proliferation and Harden was a fourth option (by a sizeable margin).      Here's some other comparisons though. Tyreke Evans averaged 20-5-5 in his rookie season and won ROTY over James Harden and had better looking stats for their first three seasons. Brandon Jennings also had better looking stats than Harden for their first three seasons.
not a chance. Harden alone is a better passer and a better scorer. LeBron James is... LeBron.  so nope
He really reminds me of James Harden in a lot of things
"Not now, but he’s going to be in the conversation when he retires unless things go really bad in the next couple years. Since #3 is basically in the bag, he’s probably about 50/50 to break the record for most DPOYs with 5+. He’s only 28 and should have another 5-6 years of competing for the award. Winning twice won’t be hard, and rim protectors tend to age well. He’s also going to tie Ben Wallace for most consecutive 1st team all defense selections for a center, and has a good shot of getting the most total. That’s particularly impressive because most of the best defensive players are centers and there’s only 1 center spot compared to 2 guard and forward spots.   Rudy’s also going to benefit from coming into the league just as tracking data became a thing. In addition to on/off data we now have shots contested, shot location on/offs, etc that give us a better picture than just blocks, steals, rebounds and team Drating. By most of the stats that use these (DRPM, DRAPTOR, DLEBRON), Rudy’s been miles ahead of everybody else in the league over the last 5 years or so. Other defensive greats don’t have that data to back them up, just the eye test and subjective accolades.   People are always reticent to put up current players against all timers with complete careers. If you say James Harden is the best offensive player ever people will look at you weird, but there’s a lot of data to back that argument up and IMO in 10 years Harden will be a consensus top 3 offensive player of all time, once people have a little perspective. A similar thing will probably happen with Rudy, who’ll probably match or surpass Wallace/Mutumbo in accolades and have a more robust statistical case backing it up. And you can easily argue one of those two are the defensive GOAT even if personally I’d say Duncan of Russel."
"Well hey, at least you still got Oladipo. But maaaan do I feel bad for Rocket fans. They not only gave up their pick for this horrible year to OKC for Westbrook, a guy who they gave up on after one season basically making their suffering so far for nothing, but they also gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks plus a pick swap in 2025. Those would have hurt a lot later if they didn't trade James freaking Harden for a bunch of late first round picks, Caris LaVert and Jared Allen, who are actually a pretty good gets to build around. Not an amazing deal but they played the hand they were dealt well enough. Only for the front office to trade their center for the future for another late pick and bags of chips. Than, just to really show how incompetent they are without Morrey, they trade LeVert for Victor who they flip for a 29 and 30 year old bench players plus pick swap in 2022. So they basically got a bunch of late first round picks for James Harden. Just typing this all out makes me cringe lol."
To be honest man I don’t follow the NBA to closely so don’t take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he’s my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that’s why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
But think of his potential; Tyler Herro could be *anything!*  Even James Harden!
Yeah dude just like all the players they got from Brooklyn. Houston essentially traded James fucking harden for 4 first round draft picks. You're telling me heat couldn't beat that???
"Still crazy to me that he was a focal point in stopping a trade for Harden. Not to shit on Herro, he looks like he can have a solid career, but this is James fucking Harden, and in the NBA you have these opportunities come so infrequently"
"Lowry is a FA, 36 year old PG thats making $30m, Heat would have given up Herro + two of Dragic, Iggy, KO. That was never going to happen.  CP3  Westbrook was coming off injury, making $38m at the time and it steadily progresses to $47m. We would have to trade Herro + salary which would have been 4 other players. That shit was never going to happen.  CP3, same as Westbrook at that time.  Jrue was traded for PICKs, which the Heat didnt have.  Its not as fucking black and white as you nephews are trying to make it. If it was as simple as Hero for James fucking Harden, it would have been done in a blink of an eye."
"Lol reason we suck is because we lost James Harden and we lost Harden because he wanted to play on a superteam with KD and Kyrie.  Anything other than that is mental gymnastics.  Only thing that would’ve made him stay in Houston was a championship.  We were always gonna to rebuild, it was just a matter of when"

yes but hes better than james harden tho
"To be clear, going into last season (the 2019-2020 season) Bontemps had LeBron outside of the 5 best players in the league. He was not giving his rankings for how everyone had played the previous season, it was his prediction for last season. [The reason he gave was LeBron's lack of defense,](https://youtu.be/c6sIz31oGW4?t=164) yet he had James Harden and Steph Curry ranked ahead of him."
Both of them piss James Harden off too.
"The celtics only won 1 ring and made the finals twice in their 5 years. While good, that's not the level of dominance I would associate with the term ""superteam"". By the time Lebron formed his own big 3, the celtics big 3 were already old and past their primes. Paul, Allen, and Garnett were 34,36, and 37 years old respectively in 2011. Ray Allen also pulled a KD and joined that same Miami heat team that won the championship that year.  ""KD joined a 73-9 team"". I heard that old line thousands of times already. That 2015-2016 warriors team was a ""lightning in a bottle"" situation. The factors that allowed that team to exist probably won't ever happen again with the salary cap increasing and a Max player being paid peanuts.   If KD doesn't join the warriors in 2017, the warriors definitely get a lot worse as a team in 2017. The warriors had the best bench in the league in 2016, but a mere 3 years later, they had the worse bench in the league. In 2017, role players on the warriors like Harrison Barnes were demanding Max-level money and if KD doesn't sign, GS probably resigns Barnes. GS was forced to let a lot of their depth walk in free agency. Steph was being horribly underpaid at the time and was eyeing the supermax. Without KD taking paycuts, Iguodala probably also leaves in free agency in 2018. At best, the warriors win 1 more ring in 2017 (I doubt that), the cavs were unstoppable going 12-1 against the east in the playoffs, no way in hell they beat the rockets in 2018, and we already know what happens in 2019.  What tools did KD have to win a championship in OKC? OKC as organization favored Westbrook over KD and allowed him to run rampant as the primary decision maker on that team. Westbrook is a great player, but his high usage rate + inefficiency doesn't lead to playoff success. OKC also made really dumb decisions like signing a person who has never coached in the NBA as their head coach, using big chunks of their salary cap to sign big men that were damn near unplayable in the small ball era, and TRADING JAMES HARDEN for scraps because they didn't want to pay the luxury tax. That last reason alone should be enough."
"I got 09-11 Carmelo, 05-06 grant hill, 06-07 Kobe, and 19-20 James harden.   I’ve gotten comps to harden and Melo before so I’d say it’s accurate"
"Warriors strategy is notoriously centered around Steph but it isn't centered around him taking a billion shots. If anything, it drives me insane how Kerr uses the best shooter of all time to get G-Leaguers open for midrange J's. His stubborn refusal to run P&amp;R is even more baffling to me. They had Steph and KD in their primes for 3 years and they ran P&amp;R with those two guys maybe a handful of times each game. Why? Because of Kerr's stupid insistence on his offensive philosophy. Even in 2019 when it was clear that KD was going to leave, they didn't use it. It doesn't end there, Kerr tried to turn James Wiseman into Andrew Bogut ffs. It's just awful, he's completely stuck in 2015 when they had a bunch of unselfish, high-IQ guys and is just so inflexible it makes my brain hurt. I think you are really overrating Kerr's system. Curry is the system. They look worse when Steph's off the court because he's, statistically, far and away the best at raising his teammates' level of play since they started tracking that stuff, even better than LeBron. I mean the Warriors barely broke .500 when they didn't have Steph in the past; they went 1-8 this year. That's crazy. Yet when they don't have other stars, Steph is still amazing. So all the evidence points to Steph being the cause and not the beneficiary.  &gt; just saying those on/offs just aren't really fair to use because those other guys wouldn't see the same dropoff since the scheme would be going from Curry to Harden, who is arguably better at creating for others.  You could argue he's better at creating for others but all advanced stats show that not only is Steph better at Harden at creating for others, but he's arguably the best ever. When Harden doesn't have the ball, he can't create. When Steph doesn't have the ball, he gets double teamed anyways. If you mean pure creation in terms of having the ball in your hands, then maybe, but the off-ball stuff is just a world of difference."
"Honestly, no. I WAS at Oracle when he dropped that halfcourt game winner though, that was fucking crazy. I have nothing but respect for Harden's scoring ability, but IMHO he had a better coach and GM who actually looked for players to compliment him instead of sticking him in a motion offense next to Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, and James Wiseman.  Harden is a fucking killer tho, people love to hate because of the ft's but they forget that's how Kobe and MJ and all ISO scorers since the dawn of basketball have feasted. I also fucking love Harden's shot profile, too. The fact that we got to see arguably the two best scoring backcourt players since MJ go head to head year after year is truly a blessing."
Well this entire subreddit can’t see the future can it? Obviously Kelly Olynyk isn’t good enough for fucking James Harden. Just disingenuous to argue that their current unknown return is garbage just because it’s not in front of you. That’s a child’s argument.
Assuming everyone is healthy  1. Lebron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. James Harden  4. Anthony Davis  5. luka doncic
You think one top 4 pick is worth james harden?
More realistically: D. Fox JJ Redick James Harden KD Andre Drummond
I love this lineup I had a similar thought and obviously James harden is perfect for this system. How important do you think is it to have multiple playmakers in this system? This would be my only concern
"I’d just do what he did in Houston but scale it up a bit. Everyone should be thicc, switchable, able to hit 3s, and good rebounders.  PG: James Harden  SG: Josh Hart  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Anthony Davis"
"Apperantly I am a cross between Westbrook, Lebron and T-Mac.  Personally I always saw myself as James Harden trapped in Delly's body but with the vertical of Z-bo."
"&gt; James Harden would have stayed with the Thunder if the team would have paid him what he was worth. Small market teams struggle to win consistently because they are often run poorly and cheaply, not just because large market teams steal their players (after at least 7 years of team control).  Yes thank you. Someone gets it."
"James Harden would have stayed with the Thunder if the team would have paid him what he was worth. Small market teams struggle to win consistently because they are often run poorly and cheaply, not just because large market teams steal their players (after at least 7 years of team control)."
James Harden would be on the first plane West
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."
Oklahoma City has no one to blame but themselves for being cheap fucks. Winning zero fucking championships with all the talent they drafted is unfathomable. All it would’ve taken to almost guarantee a championship was shelling out a few extra million for James Harden.
"I think whichever team loses the ECF, it will take a 6 or 7 game series to do so Mr “Nets fan since the James Harden Trade”."
The defense and passing of Ben Simmons with the offensive ruthlessness of James Harden.
"Joel Embiid and James Harden  Size and skill of Embiid, durability, shooting, and beard of James. This is the GOAT player easily"
"James Jones, Morey and the Nets GM are top 3 imo. I think Jones should win considering how deep our roster is. Trading for CP3 was also a big time move.   That being said, I think the Nets GM will win because while he did have it easy since 2 superstars wanted to team up in a big market, he still traded for Harden and brought it other players."
When you're simping for James Harden so hard you decide his 9 turnovers in Game 6 and his 2-13 from three in a Game 7 isn't a choke.
As opposed to James Harden who has always shown clutch moments in the Playoffs and never come up short when needed.
"We have the greatest PG in the league, 2x MVP, 3 times champions and greatest shooter in the history of nba. Steph Curry. Watch more nba games little boy.  FYI nets have a great franchise player too, his name is James Harden!!"
~~Light skin Rudy Gay~~ Longboy James Harden
You? You!.   I watched my team won 3 rings loooool.  What did u watch? James harden said ur team sucks ? Ouchhhhhh
&gt;money into refs' bank accounts.  That easy. James Harden.
~~James Harden~~  Marc Gasol is old now but his BBIQ is still really high
"Did James Harden ever comment on those “before vs after [weightloss]” pictures of him, which were memed around the time of his move to The Nets? Were the pictures even real?"
He made a post in the Boston sub about not wanting to trade Jaylen Brown for James Harden that got over 1k upvotes and no one realized he was being sarcastic except me I guess. Trolled our whole sub and it was truly embarrassing.
"Yes they’re flawed, but that doesn’t make them “useless” or “clearly bad”.  And yeah I actually remember you mentioning it on that flawed James Harden strip club analysis thread lol"
"&gt; Rockets lost because they have players who are average shooters shooting 10 threes a game. That’s bad basketball  They shot 36% as a team, while taking some 500+ more attempts than 2nd most prolific 3pt-shooting team (the Nets).   Rockets had the best offense in the 17/18 regular season and the only person jacking up 10 or more 3s a game was James Harden. Of their most prolific 3pt shooters, all of them shot between 36% to 38% which is about league average to above average.  Their main problem was Harden (10 3PA, 29%) &amp; Ariza (5.4 3PA, 28%) going ice-cold in the playoffs, failing to make shots they've been making all season. Yet they still took that ridiculous Warriors team to 7-games  &gt;Emoni bates or Luka can get any coach in the nba except pop fired they are generational talents coaching does not matter in basketball Rudy tomjonavich won twice  You tell me coaching doesn't matter, then give 2 examples that directly contradict your point.   The Spurs do not win the 2014 title without Popovich, that team in any other coach's hands would have gotten ran off the court by the younger &amp; more athletic Heat Big 3  Tomjanovich was a highly-rated coach, Hakeem gets a lot of credit for the Rockets' 2 titles in 1994 &amp; 1995 but Tomjanovich helped craft an offense that allowed Hakeem to shine.   It was a very modern offense, with shooters like Smith/Maxwell/Cassell/Horry etc spacing the floor to give Hakeem more space in the post. It was somewhat similar to how the 2009 Magic flanked Dwight Howard with 3-point shooters, daring opponents to double the big-man who can then kick out to open shooters."
"No problem.   &gt; Ok so in Russ’ scoring title years, he shot league average percentage. So, isn’t this an argument for his inclusion on this list?  I'm not sure what you mean here. Let's bear in mind that this is not about whether Russ is a great scorer or not, but about whether he's on the level of Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, and Giannis, all of whom have had seasons where they were the focal point of the offense and produced a comparable volume of points on much greater efficiency.  &gt; He was likely the focal point of opposing teams’ defensive game planning for a lot of years  All of the players we're comparing to have also been in situations like that, except maybe KD who is an efficiency and scoring god regardless of who's next to him.  &gt; Such as quality of supporting cast, his own selfishness as a teammate, or unimaginative coaching?  Even accounting for these things, Russ had low efficiency. Kobe had a terrible supporting cast during the seasons I previously cited, yet scored at 4% above league average efficiency. Lebron James was the focal point of an early Cavs team with a bad supporting cast, and was still dominating in both efficiency and volume.  And player selfishness that leads them to take bad shots and miss means they are a worse scorer. Shot selection and bball IQ is part of a scorer's skillset, not separate from it.  At a certain point, it doesn't make sense to keep fishing for circumstantial excuses. It comes down to Russ and his playstyle, not any external circumstances. He was simply nowhere near as efficient as the guys we're comparing to, who have all produced a similar volume of ppg at some point. I.e. Russ needs significantly more possessions and attempts to score the same amount of points as these all-time scoring talents, thus he is not *as good* of a scorer, even if he is great."
"&gt;lebron was the best player in the league and viewed as such   Rightly or wrongly, James has not won an MVP since 2013, so that's debatable at best.  I think he's the best player in the league, but to claim that he's ""viewed as such"" does not have much support.  &gt;when he left the cavs. He just had an all time dominant playoff run.  The Cavaliers were swept in the Finals, and lost 10 playoff games in total.  While that certainly wasn't James' fault, it's impossible to call that ""all time dominant"" with a straight face.  &gt; Most people had the bucks, clippers, lakers over the nets to start the season.    That's irrelevant, because that was a completely different Brooklyn roster.  &gt;The only reason that AD is in Los Angeles is because he refused to resign anywhere else. If he was traded based on the value of the package, he would be playing in Boston right now.   This is both wrong, and irrelevant.   &gt;Davis, [speaking to reporters](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096800664951369733) as part of his All-Star media availability, confirmed the previously reported list of [Milwaukee Bucks](http://bleacherreport.com/milwaukee-bucks), [Los Angeles Lakers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers), [Los Angeles Clippers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-clippers) and [New York Knicks](http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-knicks) is ""true."" When asked specifically about the Boston Celtics, though, Davis made it clear they are a contender for his services.   &gt;   &gt;""They [are on my list](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096802063315546112)...I never said Boston wasn’t on my list,"" Davis [told reporters](https://twitter.com/VinceGoodwill/status/1096802751617646594), before repeating the latter sentence when asked for clarification.      &gt;   &gt;""All 29 other teams are on my list,"" Davis later [said](https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1096810453437538305) on NBATV. ""I don't have a preferred destination. I just want to win. Big market, small market, I don't care. I want to win.""    &gt;   &gt;[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots)  &amp;#x200B;  Davis was a Laker in 2020 because they were the only team willing to trade as much as they did for a one-year rental.  Davis is a Laker right now, because they signed him as an unrestricted free agent five months ago.  &gt; Ingram, Zo, hart is a really mediocre group of players  It's not, first of all, and that's less than half of the players involved in that trade, and again, this is utterly beyond irrelevant.  If you want to spout nonsense, do so in another conversation.  Davis was the most expensive single-season rental in NBA history, and maybe in all of sports history.  &gt;, which would make sense because they were the core of a lottery team when combined with lebron.   Your complete ignorance is tiresome.  Everyone on that team except Caldwell-Pope was injured and missed significant time.  &gt; Pelicans got robbed with that package.   Again, Davis was the most expensive rental in NBA history, and by significant margin.  Houston got far less for two years of Harden.  &gt; getting harden for 7 pick package + JA+ Levert isn’t really that much different   For two years of Harden, which is a completely different story.  And there's no All-star in that package, and no young player who was a #2 overall, and most of those ""picks"" are swap rights that are liable to be worthless.  &gt; The nets took more risk than the lakers   No, they didn't.  The Lakers traded a decade of assets for one season of one player.  The Nets did not.  And even when the Nets did make a trade, they already had two stars signed.  &gt;and ended up with a seemingly better team.   That remains to be seen.  Was not the case a couple nights ago.  &gt;This isn’t any more unfair than the lakers.   From the perspective of small market teams, signing two marquee free agents is quite demonstrably less fair than a team signing one.  All free agents have to sign somewhere -- exactly like James did -- but they do not have to team up, like Durant and Irving did."
"Zion’s would be 65.9% so a .3% increase  Giannis’ would be 63.2% so a .1% increase  They get a lot of And1’s, but they don’t get fouled shooting 3’s and they don’t take the Technical Foul Free Throws. Steph and James Harden have a good combination of everything so they’re the ones that benefit the most from this."
James harden had 40 point triple doubles with the rockets this year. AD requested a trade and wore a shirt that said “ that’s all folks”
Is Eric Gordon supposed to seem younger than James Harden? Cuz he definitely has always seemed older to me.
James Harden would be called for traveling on every possession.
James Harden
"sure, and he signed that deal when James harden was on the team, before they were the 2nd worst team in the league"
Harden couldn't close the Warriors after KD went down. 2017 I'll give u that one. But by that same token Wade would've had one in 2011 but LeBron didn't step up. Also ur complaining about officiating when ur talking about James Harden? The guy has made more free throws than field goals in his career lmao. Also defensively it's not even close between the two. Harden is an all-time offensive player and SG. But he's not better than Wade
"I know you said so far, so I'm not attacking you or anything, but we gotta stop talking about how good/bad players are who have been to the playoffs like 2-4 times. The sample size is incredibly small. People bring up Ben's playoff history all the time like he's James Harden or some shit, dude has played in four playoff series, let's chill. I've also seen some other young players described as clutch in the playoffs and it boggles my mind. I mean sure they had a good run in the bubble but they're being talked about like they're LeBron.   This is currently Embiid's fifth season, he's been to the playoffs the last three years and will obviously go again this year. Three playoff runs is not nearly enough to be a good or bad playoff performer unless you do something like win a championship."
"Literally the only thing more ""quitting"" he could have done was walk off the court in the middle of a game.  James Harden quit on the Houston Rockets and that's objective fact, sorry."
Because he had Kevin Durant and then James Harden to cover for his historically inefficient production.
"&gt;**Jokic finished with 964 points and was the only player named on all 101 ballots.** Embiid (82) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (81) were the only others named on more than 70.  &gt;Since the league shifted to its current voting format before the 2016-17 season, **no MVP winner has finished more than 224 points ahead of second** (when James Harden outpaced James in 2018). Jokic, by comparison, has a 568-point advantage over Embiid, who is now a very distant second."
"I think KD Kyrie vs AD LeBron would have been a competitive and exhilarating finals, and I would still have given the nets the edge with Jaret Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LaVert  James Harden quitting his way to Brooklyn lopsided the matchup by a mile  &amp;#x200B;  KD doesn't want to compete"
"Yea, so they bought James harden   When Thomas Jefferson bought half of the US, it was a trade"
JV for James Harden to Toronto.
"&gt;Lol, your team chose Tyler Herro over James Harden  How to expose yourself as a casual 101"
"Lol, your team chose Tyler Herro over James Harden, it’s going to be so satisfying seeing your team possibly miss the playoffs this year and go back to being shit"
James Harden and Rudy Gobert. It’s a shame that despite cycling through multiple guys at the position we haven’t found even a decent lob thrower at guard to pair with Rudy. Harden or Paul could get Rudy to 20 points per 36.
"You can take it a step further - historically if you don't finish at least 2 seed, you aren't going to be MVP. In the last twenty years only Steve Nash in 2006 won as a 3rd seed. 14/20 MVPs have been top seed, 4/20 have been second seeds (Lebron, Durant, Nash, Duncan), 1/20 has been 3rd seed (Nash), and then Westbrook won.  That said, this year's admittedly weird - Jazz, Suns, and Clippers don't REALLY have an MVP candidate. No one wants to vote for James Harden. Embiid has missed a lot of games, and no one wants to vote for Giannis again."
"that time when the rockets almost traded James ""MVP Scoring Champion Assist Leader"" Harden to the nets for a bowl of popcorn. I had a nightmare that it actually happened."
"James Harden for Simmons, Thybulle, 2 1sts and [*Maxey](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349436865548595206).  Morey [wanting to send picks instead of Maxey/haggling](https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1349453856569253889) cost the Sixers a sure trip to the Finals. Some will blame Fertitta but this was probably the same as the Lowry trade where Morey just wouldn't budge."
"I have an issue with calling Luka the future GOAT because I consider GOATs to be elite on both ends. LeBron and Jordan are both two of the best scorers in NBA history while being All-Defensive Team members. The fact that Lukas a polished player combined with the fact that I never see him becoming an elite defender make me hesitant to call him future GOAT. I still think he’s definitely going to be a Hall of Famer, but he’s going to be more comparable to Chris Paul or James Harden all-time rather than LeBron and Jordan. And that’s still great company to be in"
"It’s stupid cause when James Harden averages 40ppg he gets immediate comparisons to Jordan and Kobe as a SG  But Curry doesn’t get those comparisons to other all time PGs like Magic or Stockton, even when I’d take him over those PGs  Between him and Magic it’s debatable, but since Lebron exist I’d take him at my SF position and have Curry as my PG on a all time team"
"Dwight, Ariza, Josh Smith, Terry, Brewer, Terrence Jones etc. Wasn't a bad roster, but wasn't good either. Definitely impressive how far Harden carried them all the way to the conference finals.   But James was pretty inefficient in the playoffs. Curry is just wayyyy more efficient that Harden."

James Harden and Christian Wood 😢

"90% FT shooter on crazy low volume.   Allen has fewer FTA's in his NBA career than James Harden had in November 2019. In college, where he had a bigger sample size, he was an 83% shooter."
"James harden regular season god and trash af in playoffs. Steph isn’t point god in the playoffs, but he’s better than harden."
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
It has to be James Harden and Steph Curry.
Game 1 James Harden
"[""if you do that to James Harden it's freethrows""](https://youtu.be/glrXsfl78b8) *the Warriors commentator says unironically*"
It's not just 2016. He was bad in 2014 against the Spurs and the Grizzlies in 2014. He would have gone down 3-1 against the 2014 Grizzlies in his MVP year if Reggie Jackson didn't score 30 points in game 4. He wasn't good either in 2013. His numbers in OKC is basically the same as James Harden on the Rockets in the playoffs and yet KD is treated like he's unguardable in the playoffs and Harden is a choke artist. This idea of Kevin Durant being unguardable is completely false. Kevin Durant being able to shoot over anyone is something that people romanticize about.
Even the ironman James Harden wasn't safe
Not really lol. The man can drop 30 on 14 shots if he wanted. And not the Joel Embiid or James Harden method either.  No one can guard him
"I can’t tell if you’re serious here or if you expected more detailed reports about a trade that didn’t happen. You new to the NBA?   And its Morey and James fuckin Harden lol. You don’t know basketball at all if you think Morey only offered Ben Maxey and one pick  Philly had the best offer, it was basically a done deal til your dumbass owner stepped in and forced Houston to take a worse deal so Morey and Harden couldn’t re unite  outside Houston"
"People do say the Thunder may have won in a rematch all the time?? The Rockets and Harden never had a 3-1 lead over the Dubs idk where you got that.  The 2020 Heat are worse than that team, just by virtue of having LeBron James.  The 2018 Cavs is debateable considering the argument is just a better LeBron.   2019 Warriors is arguable, the Cavs had the way better depth. The Warriors were starting or playing guys that would be out of the league or end-of-bench players the following year in huge minutes (Livingston, Bogut, Boogie, Cook, McKinnie, etc.). They also were missing Klay for 1.25 games."
I agree on everything but the Klay part. I wouldn't change Klay for any guard not named James Harden for the warriors. He's perfect.
Lakers are defending champions! (no one can stay healthy for a stretch)  KDs back for the Nets! (off and on)  The Nets got James Harden! (we've seen those three together in how many games?)  Warriors aren't going to be that good with Klay out for another year. (Steph does the most Steph thing and forces his way into the MVP conversation)

"Fucking thank you!!  The man is tiresome, not in the same way as Kyrie, but almost as bad.  Who knew James Harden would be by far the easiest player to like on the Nets? Lol"
"Wel, James Harden *is* a great regular season performer."
"Nash, KG, Reggie Miller, Robinson  Imagine Nash with the spacing of what james harden has had in Houston over the last 3-4 years."
Where is this energy with James Harden against the Warriors lmao
JAMES HARDEN WENT TO THE METS
"Tbh I’m not sure if they know what’s going on or not.  Talking about how players are feeling and talking about the game at a simple level is what most fans want.  The extent to which my family analyzes the game is “the refs are really screwing us!!”  The extent to which I analyze it is “man we gotta stop this guy” or “man we gotta take better shots.”  I doubt very many people are watching going “oh even though they’ve got James Harden double teamed, they’re not allowing Joe Harris to hit his spots so Kyrie has to play a lot of iso ball” or some shit"
James Harden and Kyrie Irving
"I agree James Edward Harden Jr. is quite proficient at the team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players  each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the  primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop  while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop, also known as basketball"
"I agree, and there are several other types of play that I consider unnatural to the flow of a basketball game that I would like to see addressed.  One example: on shot clock violations where the offense airballs a shot at the end of the shot clock and the ball ends up with the defense but they whistle the play dead just to give possession to the team that had already gained possession of the ball. This rewards the team that just committed the shot clock violation by letting them set their defense (and not allowing a fast break), when I think they should be penalized for both committing a shot clock violation and shooting an airball.   However, my general response to any proposed rule change is to remind everyone that players and coaches will always find a way to stretch a rule to the extreme, or get as close as possible to breaking the rule without actually breaking it, no matter what the rule is. Baseball pitchers don't try to throw the entire ball over the plate, they try to ""paint the black"" so that it *barely* counts as a strike, but still counts as a strike. Much of James Harden play style is done in an effort to deceive a referee rather than to make an honest attempt at a basketball play.  Should they change or crack down on the rule you mentioned? Absolutely. Will players still find loopholes just like this? Also yes. It's like whack-a-mole - by fixing one problem you are creating another."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845241-report-james-harden-was-behind-rockets-trading-chris-paul-to-thunder  Harden also famously said he knows 'exactly' what the franchise needs to do after their loss in 2019.  Moreover, Westbrook's contract is actually a year longer than Paul's. So if Houston didn't want Paul's contract why did they trade for Westbrook's?"
Houston is also 2-6 when James harden is active.
"Jokic has been the MVP for weeks now. After Embiid and James got hurt, there is not a single argument for anyone else. You could have *maybe* made one for Harden, but then he got hurt. It's his by default, has been for weeks and no one can catch him. We've known this for weeks not sure why we keep being told the same thing around here.   He's had a great season and deserves it, but there's no race and this no need to campaign."
I got a funky joke about this xD so listen up. Kyrie walks in the room and goes wow I’m the best of us three Kd and Harden swag 😎 take off their hipster glasses pardon me buddy Kyrie wtf James harden looks at KD whattt is a snake KD man ur messed up Harden be like it’s time to go to the strip club hahahahah
James Harden is a winning player wow that’s surprising never woulda thought
"I'm super high rn so imma just make my own pitch and hope the NBA adds me to their writing team:   A little kid keeps manipulating their parents with the best fake crying anyone has ever seen, but the crying is tiring out the parents just too much. One day the kid falls in the street and the parents are too tired to hear the kid crying this time. A bus is about to hit the kid when they're saved by a passing Nikola Jokic. The reigning MVP just came off not getting a single free throw in a 7 game 2021 WCF loss to the Lakers, and was out doing some long distance running to clear his head. After this meeting they bond and the kid goes on to show Jokic how to emotionally manipulate the refs and get free throws. Jokic then averages 20 FTs and 50pts a game through the 2022 regular season but right before the playoffs the kid gets suspended from school for cheating on a test and both Jokic and the kid have a shared growth experience learning some life lesson about honesty. Jokic goes on to try to win the playoffs without manipulating the refs for foul calls and has a miraculous journey through the WCF where he narrowly loses to James Harden and the Nets. Existentially content despite losing, Jokic then retires early to start a summer camp for kids where they teach honesty, basketball, and horse back riding. The end."
"I think: 1st- curry,harden,leonard,giannis,jokic  2nd-lillard,doncic,george,james,embiid  3rd-irving,mitchell,tatum,randle,gobert"
"It ignores the other factors in play. CP3 and James Harden were a combined 1 for 41 against Iguodala this series. So if we’re talking what ifs, we might as well get Iguodala a fresh knee.  Also, they beat Houston G1 and blew them out by forty-gotdamn-one points in G3 with CP3 on the floor. Prior to any injury."
James harden   Not even close
JAMES HARDEN WAS RIGHT!!
James Harden for his time on the Rockets
James Harden for 2 packs of fritos and a diet coke is a big one
James Harden is the only true Answer.
"Harden didn't ""want CP3 gone"". He just wanted to play with Russ *more*.  Morey and MDA had already smoothed things over between Chris and James and were ready to go into the next year with the same core.  But then Presti blew it up and Harden decided Russ gave him a better chance."
"James Harden first 3 games: 37 PPG, the normal Harden you'd see from the past 2 years went 1-2 where they could've won against Portland.  James Harden last 5 games on the Rockets: 17.4 PPG, something went fishy against the Mavs (Jan. 5) he started to average 15-20 PPG from that game until his last game against the Rockets and they were 1-4 in the 5 game stint"
"Well for one how bout the fact he's played 22 games in a 72 game season. There was a lot of talk about Davis carrying the Lakers to allow Lebron to rest and it turned out the exact opposite.  He came into the year with him and Vogel saying he was going to bring his 3pt attempts up to around 6, he's at 2.5 per game at a pretty much career low .293 excluding years he really didn't shoot any. By all metrics he's had a pretty shitty year with numerous games where he's been outplayed by mid level guys even in wins. If he hadn't won a chip and his name was Paul George or James Harden he'd be getting absolutely killed in the media.  He's just ruined my fantasy team and made me further consider why I even play it every year."
"If I need to make James Harden leave the rockets, I can do that."
"Luka ""James 'Hitler"" Harden"" Doncic"
"I can only make it down to 10.  Who's tradeable among:  Curry  Lebron  Anthony Davis  Giannis  Lillard  Jokic  Durant  Doncic  Embiid  Kevin ""James Harden"" Porter Jr."
"You forgot to finish your sentence, “for James Harden”"
my takeaway from this is james harden is good
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
Yep. The Brooklyn Nets may have a loophole due to acquiring James Harden midseason though.
Is James harden dead?
"damn the harden mvp races, they ruined james harden"
No James harden? Lol
"It could be done, you would just see pretty lack luster defense, and quite a few possessions on offense of them sitting in the corner and ball watching. I think the closest we’ve seen to something like that happening in recent memory was James Harden with CP3 as his teammate. Someone who is known to not be the most active defender, not move off ball, had a ball dominant teammate, and a true Ironman athlete. I really think he could have done it if CP3 played all 82 and he wanted to"
I believe James harden doesn’t  browse the web like that lol man showed up in a blue lives matter snood pre-game lol
AD is tradeable though  James Harden literally just got traded lol (I know he requested it I'm just jokin)
As a Lebron Sexual I always have to remember 2 things. 1.) Jordan Fans 2.) Him daddy dicking the East and sending everyone packing from the west lmfao. LeThanos is real! When Harden high tailed it out and sloppily forced his way out to Brooklyn... I became fully aware of how terrified dudes are of him. It has to be emasculating. I have no doubt Way Off P is kinda glad he wasn’t beat by Lebron again. If Lebron wins 2 more... the pure undiluted hate that will spew out of people’s mouths constantly is going to be hilarious. 7 chips.... boy. They might let him into the hall of fame early lmfao. We will have a new black Jesus. Then if his kids are even half the player their daddy is... you will never stop hearing the name James as long as you live basketball lmfao.
i remember westbrook was the lovable underdog who was carrying a bum team to a 6th seed and this was peak james harden hate so that didn’t help either
Not to mention the laziness of a James Harden comp. 2 black left handed players must mean they’re the same or even similar right ?!  Fucking idiots don’t watch the games
James Harden didn’t win MVP because his playstyle was unwatchable and it’s decided by a media vote. Idk how nobody has ever told you this
It's a conspiracy.     Don't let them do to you what they did to James Harden.
"It was last year! Heat fans wouldn't shut up about it, just paying back the favor  Also, any Heat fans reading this thread: You could've had James Harden"
"26 points to 30 points is not miniscule. That's four more points. Which is a hell of a lot at that level. Bradley Beal leads the NBA at 31 ppg, if Joel scored four more ppg he'd average 34 ppg and would which is James Harden MVP territory.   You can say Jokic is more valuable on offense due to his role as primary facilitator in the Nuggets offense. But there's no need to act like Jokic scores at the same rate as Embiid, either throughout their careers or this season.   Also as I'm going to start doing whenever replying to a Nuggets fan about Jokic, this is a friendly reminder that Jokic will win the MVP and there's nothing anyone else can do about it. Congratulations."
That's not how it works lmfao. The gap in their scoring is miniscule. Jokic has a better ts% despite getting much lesser fts which shows how efficient he is on the floor. Jokic like you said is a much better passer. Then Zion is better offensively than James Harden.
"👋 Hey gregjsmith2021, here you go! Happy listening: 🎧 https://liso.ai/play/Brooklyn-Nets'-James-Harden-neck-'not-a-guarantee'-for-Friday-vs.-Pistons"
"James Harden touched Wilt records, in fact averaging more points per possession."
"Too bad basketball isn’t played on an excel spreadsheet.  Riddle me this: if say, next year, Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Jokic, Embiid, and James Harden decide to team up and play on the same team (obviously I know it’s impossible but humor the hypothetical), and James Harden puts up great stats and leads the league in PER and in WS/48, in your eyes does he deserve the MVP?    Even if his co stars are all MVP type players in their own capacity?  It’s clear what the answer is."
"oh i agree. one plays with guys like lebron james, kevin durant, james harden, etc. the other.. doesnt.  trapping kyrie in those cases just doesnt make sense."

All you have done since Lebron left is go to 1 finals where every one knows you would not go there without the bubble and injuries to Gordon Hayward
"James, AD, Harden Durant, Curry, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kawhi, Embiid, Giannis are set.   I suppose KAT is the next tier with Beal, Westbrook, Kyrie, Paul, Booker, Butler, Tatum, Zion, Mitchell, and Gobert."
"Cause yall said he was the next Devin Booker and your fans on your subreddit were saying ""I would rather develop the kids then trade for James Harden"" for Lowry I would still do it but I understand but your fans were reluctant to deal him for JAMES MOTHERFUCKING HARDEN"
"Yeah, James averaged 11 FTAs, and Embiid averaged 10 FTAs that season.  Westbrook averaged 10.4 the season before. DeMarcus Cousins averaged 10.2 the season before that. Kobe Bryant averaged about 10 FTAs three times in his career. Michael Jordan averaged 11.9 FTAs in his 37ppg season, more than Harden ever has. Embiid is averaging 11.8 FTAs this season, more than Harden ever has.   Also, if you don't like free throws, Harden also scored the most field goals and 3-pointers that season too. He also has lead the league twice in assists per game."
This game really made me think how ridiculous James Harden is. Steph went 11 games with 30+ and averaging 40 and he started getting injured and now has human games like this. Harden went thirty fucking two straight games scoring 30+ and averaged 43 for a whole month with like 8 assists to go with it. Nobody is taken for granted like that man..
James Edward Harden would never

Of course. When James harden averaged 36 ppg on 24.5 shot attemps per game I said that if steph curry had that many shot attempts he'd be able to average that as well.  I got downvoted all to hell when I said that. Now steph is just proving it again but on even better %. Just like I said would happen 🤣🤣.  If steph was shooting 25 shots a game he'd be averaging 35pts easy   Edit: had to edit to add that steph is averaging a career high in 6.1 FT attempts a game. Harden was averaging 10-12 free throw attempts per game while averaging above 30ppg.  Wow.
"They said “they don’t love you like that?! Who you think you is, James Harden?!”"
"No, this is just my opinion in connection with the deleted tweet incident and other times he’s talked about the Rockets. I apologize for not flagging the above as an opinion explicitly. https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/02/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-deleted-tweet-houston-rockets-officiating-james-harden"
"&gt;LeBron James has 35,283 regular season points which is more than Jordan's 32,292  Lolololol karl malone is a better scorer than Jordan or James. Or KD. Or harden. Or wilt."
Just checked another mock draft for 2022. Projected No. 3? A 6’5” SG named Jaden Hardy. The comparison? James Harden. LOL
"&gt;When Thompson played earlier this year, Embiid put up 42 and 38.   And both games were still within 3 points in the final 5 minutes despite Boston not having Tatum for either.  ""Who will guard Embiid?"" has always been the Philly question. Boston is 8-1 in the playoffs without ever providing an answer.   Embiid will do Embiid's thing. We have no one who can stop him, he's incredible.   Our approach has never been about stopping Embiid it's about playing well against a team that really has no one else besides Embiid. Ben and Tobias can be slowed in the playoffs. Danny and Seth are mostly C&amp;S guys scoring single digits atm.   A big step in that direction is being able to play certified NBA talent like Thompson over guys like:  * Kornet - An okay 3rd stringer * Wagner - We just waived him  * Tacko - A G-League player who's legitimately had 1 good game in 2 seasons    Does playing Danny Green over Dakota Mathias mean you can suddenly lock down James Harden?   No, but having a capable player on the floor who understands his role does help your team play a lot better overall. Which is why the earlier games with Thompson were closer even though we were missing Tatum.     &gt;And sure Fournier is a good bench scorer but do you really think adding him would have made much of a difference  Minus the rebounds, he's pretty much averaging Tobias Harris' numbers for the season on a similar efficiency.  Yeah, I think once he's brought into the roster properly (which should be soon) he'll be a pretty big addition."
Embiid gets to the free throw line more (per 100 possessions) than any modern player.  |Rk|Player|FTA| |-:|:-|-:| |1|Joel Embiid|14.2| |2|Shaquille ONeal|13.9| |3|Karl Malone|12.7| |4|James Harden|12.5| |5|Dwight Howard|12.4| |6|Corey Maggette|12.4| |7|David Robinson|12.3| |8|Alonzo Mourning|11.9| |9|Leon Powe|11.7| |10|DeMarcus Cousins|11.4| |11|Allen Iverson|11.3| |12|Dwyane Wade|10.9| |13|Charles Barkley|10.8| |14|Kobe Bryant|10.7| |15|LeBron James|10.7|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 4/21/2021.
...You think 6'9 230lbs is guarding pfs in the modern era? You think he has a chance against players like zbo/david west? I dont think you are comprehending the weight difference. James harden weighs more than Larry bird did.
Isn’t it KD who ran to another MVP(steph) who had already won and then got another MVP James harden 😹😹
Answer my question is Clint capella better than James Harden
Ok but how many times did a front office refuse to trade Huerter for James Harden?   Herro: 1  Huerter: 0
So is James Harden
"James Harden is 6’5 220.  This man is 7’2 and outweighs him by 12 lbs, and you’re saying he’s not a beanpole?  He is.  He’s extremely skinny.  He should be 30-40 lbs heavier at that height."
Lmao. KD just saying that to discredit Bron.   I guess James Harden and STEPH CURRY aren't cheat codes. I guess Klay isn't a cheat code
if you're James Harden and you walk into the strip club those girls are going to do WAAAAY more than just dance for you
"But that doesn’t account for any kind of difficulty or defensive attention. You can’t just ignore that stuff, otherwise you get wacky conclusions like James Harden is an average shooter and Steve Kerr is the GOAT of shooting. Especially with Steph that context is important when it comes to appreciating why he’s by far the greatest shooter ever."
Imagine a team where James Harden ist the sane and wise one in the team lol
"Harden before LeBron—James used to participate in load management before it became unpopular. Harden, at that same time, scoffed at the idea of missing games."
"to me durant is nothing without good teammates. im not saying he is bad but he is not a key player. he never will be someone like harden, curry, james etc. and why tf you tweeted everyone to check your pinned tweet mate? you need a like from someone famous to be important person? you did even screen record smh 🤦‍♂️"
you’re james harden vs steph curry
"Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Chris Paul. It seems like great players are always coming and going."
"How the fuck is James Harden, the guy who lives in a strip club, the sane one"
"Really? Cause Steph beat James Harden, swept Lillard, and possibly could have won the title when KD went down in 2019 if Klay didn't get hurt. And that's not counting the title in 2015 and most wins ever in 2016, where he beat Durant in the playoffs lol  Steph is currently averaging 41 per game while shooting 57% from the field and 51% from three on 15 threes a game. Durant is not better than that version of Steph."
CJ is a good iso scorer but Stotts gotta tell him he’s not James Harden
"Not when there is a guy like James Harden doing what he’s doing literally on the same team lol.  Tbh, all I’m seeing is people trying to move the bar for their own player, not us.  Also how tf are they on pace to win that many games lmao. That’s an 83% win %."
"Thats stupid because it’s Lebron fucking James we’re talking about.  Did we forget how he’s still the best player in basketball? Did we forget that he has AD by his side? He has an ever better supporting cast than last year and we’re also forgetting that Nash is a rookie head coach while Vogel is a proven one with a chip under his belt now.     If KD, Harden, and Kyrie all come back for the playoffs do people just expect them to magically clique on all cylinders? Yeah the Lakers have been dealing with injuries too but at least the bulk of that squad went through a championship run together.  I’m just saying there are wayyy more question marks for the Nets than there are for the Lakers and it seems kinda BS that people are just overlooking all of that and crowning them as clear favorites. I just don’t get it."
Kyrie had James Harden for how many of those wins? Enough to disqualify him even if people saw him as an MVP level players which he isn t
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
james harden &gt; ai and john stockton
"I'm with you, but only James Harden is the guy that seems to be immune from injuries and he got injured. We all thought KD Warriors would 3peat too but injuries got them so IDK about 3 championships."
"Nobody is else could do this or we would have seen it. Not to say that they don’t have the physical talent, but Russ gets these numbers because he plays the way he does and there has never been a point guard this athletic. The Big O was doing this in a much weaker league. Granted, the assists were harder back then, there were fewer elite level athletes on rosters. Now everyone in the NBA is an elite level athlete. And Russ is still the most athletic dude on the court most of the time. The only other players who combine this level of vision with his level of aggressiveness and willingness to attack the board on every single possession would be someone like LeBron, but LeBron only really goes all out like that in the playoffs. Maybe MJ and Kobe had all the check boxes filled too, but both of them played on teams where their roles were to be scorers. In order to do this, you have to be a super aggressive point guard with a a pretty much equal desire to score and pass while also having the aggression to one to be THE MAN on the court. He only turns 33 this year and if he’s healthy next season, Russ will probably average another triple double.   That one year he played in Houston, he averaged 27/8/7 which is pretty much what Luka averaged when people were saying he was Goated. The difference is, Luka got to play with the ball every possession. Russ was playing with James Harden who is also a point guard and also a dude who gets triple doubles. It’s easy to downplay Russ because with the eye test, we can tell that he isn’t the greatest player of all time. Even if he had a jump shot, we can tell that his ability is actually just below the conversation of greatest of all Time point guards. It’s his effort level and tenacity that contributes to his production and I don’t think we’ve ever seen anyone play that hard in the regular season while also being that good."
"Lowry no, Harden absolutely. It's James Harden."
which confirms that James Harden is cursed after all the flopping
James Harden?
"He was 5th when he retired in 2011 but then Kobe passed him the next year after that, and Dirk passed him in 2015-16 season, followed by Lebron in 2016-17. No one else is even close to catching these guys right now. James Harden and KD could be up there in 5 years though."
"okay if we go by that, then LeBron James, Michael Jordan, James Harden, Dwayne Wade, and Tracy McGrady are all point guards too  and i am not 83 years old, so yes, i have not watched “much” oscar lol"
2015 Warriors: beat a James Harden led Rockets team who's second best player was a declining Dwight Howard   2021 Sixers: need to beat a team that has 3 superstars and might be the greatest offensive team of all time.   Also the sixers don't have the depht that the Warriors had. Horrible comparison
"Let me tell you something, Shannon... James. Edward. Harden. would have took it right to Gobert's chest, got the layup to go in, get an and one despite very little contact, and get a tech on Gobert all at once."
1) Magic  2) Curry   3) CP3  4) Oscar   5) Nash  6) Stockton  7) Kidd  8) Isiah   9) Cousy   10) Payton    Do Jerry West and James Harden count as PGs? Because if so put them top 5 and move WB even further down.   Don't see who WB goes over.
"Lebron James made 3rd team playing 55/82 games and Lakers missing playoffs, James Harden has played 42/72 games avg 25/8/11 on 37 mpg on the current 2 seed which he is most important for them having when kyrie was sitting and KD was injured. Don’t come at me with that double standard bs. Never said Harden was a lock, said it’d be Book first"
The wizards might legit beat the Nets if they can get to them in a playoff series before James Harden comes back.
"Rather have jimmy but he’s not better, luka is worse James harden which still puts him far above jimmy"
James harden was really impressive these last 13 games huh? Google before embarrassing yourself next time.
"If ur talking about the guy that ranked strip clubs and found out Harden performed better as the strip clubs we’re ranked higher , that’s the story I’m telling my children. They will bow down to the real King James"
"So, Jeff Green is more valuable than James Harden with his ''decent D''. They dont have to run a same lineup every game dummy they can go big with benching Joe and starting Kyrie-Harden-Kd-Green-Jordan. And Its fucking James Harden he won and an mvp just with his offence you think he gonna give more points to Bucks than his own points. What a casual"

I'm still pissed Portland didn't offer CJ McCollum for Harden. Houston made an offer but Portland refused it. Imagine Damian Lillard and James Harden on the Blazers.
&gt; Dwight / James harden rockets  For some reason I always completely forget that this existed.
The Dwight / James harden rockets. Big disconnect between those 2 and the rest of the players
You have KD &amp; James Harden as 1 &amp; 2 and you talking about injuries lmao the agenda with some of these mfs
He never was a top 5 player. Top 5 guys right now are  1. Kevin Durant  2. James Harden  3. Steph Curry  4. Giannis  5. Jokic
Put Gelo on the Nets and put James Harden on the Los Angeles Ballers and we'll see what happen
Maybe not the top tier but we got a pretty nice starting 5  PG: James Harden  SG: Clyde Drexler  SF: Tracy McGrady  PF: Moses Malone  C: Hakeem Olajuwon
"Hell, even KD's legacy improved significantly after his 2 rings.   In OKC, KD got same criticism as James Harden as a underperformer in playoffs."
You are severely underrating James Harden Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the same fucking team surrounded by pretty underrated depth
"Yea, for his 'old' players. He would classically list Duncan as DNP--Old. James started doing it it with Cleveland, which was like the Thundercat Emblem being plastered across the sky for every other star player. Sans a few holdouts. Kobe was against it, Harden, and so forth and so on."

James Harden is good at basketball.
only way Steph does not make is if Dame wins mvp which there is a 0.00001%. Beal will def make it sense james harden has missed alot of games.
"all this without James Harden too, beautiful picture of the potential ECF matchup"
James Harden .. Meta World Peace vibes.
I hope people look back and realize he is not an all-time player. He could never scratch the playoffs alone and really spent most of his career putting up volume stats on bad pelicans teams.   Today’s NBA leads people to have quite different opinions on players than how they actually perform on a night to night basis. People just talk about averages and look at a few flashy highlights of the player and are just convinced of all time status. The same goes for negative perception. Take James harden a player who puts his team on his back every night (excluding his rockets games this season). If you just listened to the media and other talking heads about how he is boring to watch you would miss some of the greatest offensive performances in history because he is boring and a foul baiter.
"[League data shows the player injury rate this season is down about 6%, even though several marquee players — including LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, James Harden and most recently Jamal Murray — have dealt with injuries in recent weeks.](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal)"
"I will say KDs injury management is 100% justifiably over precaution.  Kyrie is fine for now but literally hungry and dehydrated until ramadan ends.  However James Harden is absolutely hurt.  This is a soft tissue injury, which outright is a huge red flag. He has had 3 seperate incidences with the same injury (textbook shutdown candidate until playoffs).  Im not worried at all about health (barring anything drastic happening to kyrie or kd as of now). Harden will be 31 days removed from his last flare-up by first round.  Ample time, to recover, or at least be ready to rock and roll mid series."
Jokic every year  I’m not even trying to be reactionary to the recent AD either. Jokic has taken his team miles further than Davis ever did prior to jumping on LeBron’s team.  Want a real hot take? Jokic is closer to James Harden than Anthony Davis.
"This continues to be a clown take. It's like you people have never seen James Harden actually play for more than ten seconds. Harden doesn't even have to score the ball himself at all to elevate the offense to ridiculous heights, and more importantly, *he doesn't give a shit about being the hero*. For some reason there's a long-running narrative that he plays hero ball out of his own ego or something and not just, you know, cause it was the only chance Houston had at those times. Having him playmake for Kyrie and KD is a terrifying prospect and there is almost no chance the 'there's only one ball' argument will have any merit."
And I've been teleported back to when James Harden was first traded. It's going to be a never ending circle of the same bullshit until the Finals.
James Harden being on this team is stupid
"Some of our fans are so out of touch. Great players miss the MVP every year. They aren't used to the idea that Steph can put up MVP-tier numbers but lose because someone was simply more impactful.  I mean, just look at James Harden. He has put up MVP numbers so often in his career, but has only one because of circumstances largely beyond his control."
"Well he's certainly going to give up some more layups for one. And I don't really see where he's getting these extra touches on the ball, it's not like they are going to give the Nets extra possessions, and it's not like the shot clock is going up to 48 seconds. I mean James Harden uses more time off the clock than virtually any player in the NBA.  He adds 25 and takes 20 from Durant via possessions, then gives up 3 extra layups and turns the ball over 4 times late in possession. Plus Gianiss and Middleton shoot 10% better from the field with an extra defender they can exploit.  Where the Bucks have 3 good defenders and two DPOY caliber defenders."
"Not exactly the answer to your question, but...  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best."
"No lol that's not what I'm saying at all. People are still deferring to the ""how they gonna stop"" take. You'd think after watching the Nets this season the answer would be blatantly obvious. What was the score friend. You don't think James fucking Harden is going to cover that difference. The best part of that loss to the Sixers was Embid scored 38 points.... and Kyrie scored 37 and there's 3 of him on this team."
"Your saying you disagree? That James Harden is a good defender? And that a backcourt of Irving, Harris and Harden are going to really lock teams down? Especially versus tough match-ups like Gianiss?"
"Harden likely isn't worse than anyone that replaces him.  He would have to be worse than both Shamet and James, which he's not."
"Tbf I don’t think the guy you replied to is saying harden doesn’t improve the team. Just that nets are good enough even without him to be a contender and possibly win it all. Which is insane since it’s James fucking Harden, but just goes to show how good these Nets are"
and then you remember they also got James Harden
"Harden has accepted the PG role.. Or more accurately Kyrie has accepted SG role which allows Harden to go full distributor. This is not a issue at all.  Also, it's easier to understand this way: Know those 3-5 minutes starting the 2nd and 4th quarter where the Nets played some dogshit 2nd units? Now replace Mike Jones with JAMES HARDEN and see the difference that makes. Too many cooks is not even an issue, it's just a pure mega upgrade."
What? The Bucks needed the game of their lives to barely beat a Nets team without James Harden and with a fasting Kyrie. I really wonder what went on in your head when you typed that nonsense.
I feel like James Harden woulda made a difference
a loss without James Harden? Yeah ...
"Well, they lost by 3 points to one of the best teams in the league without James fucking Harden. I think they’re in really good shape."
"Kyrie has Kevin Durant and James harden as teammates bro, he doesn’t even need to play to win a ring."
"The Nets badly need James Harden, even if all that does is take the ball out of Kyrie's hands."
"Pretty much. I’m proud of how we battled today, and it was great to see both Giannis and Khris show up, but damn that felt like such a Herculean effort by us, and we still went down to the wire against a team that has James Harden sitting on the bench. The Nets are unfair..."
The Nets badly need James Harden
"Amazing intense competitive game. Bucks got an incredible game by giannis, this would be a really good series and then you realize James harden didn’t even play."
This series would be so good if the Nets didn't have James Harden
What a game. Can’t believe this team is still waiting for James fucking Harden to return to the lineup.
This game is so much fun.  A series between these teams would rock. Too bad James Harden ruins it.
I'm gonna need James Harden to be locked in a strip club until the end of the playoffs
Crazy how the Nets have James Harden sitting on the sidelines
Imagine how fun this series would be if the Nets didn't have James fucking Harden in their backpocket.
"Harden gets the switch on Bobby, Bobby just stands stiff mean mugging him and Harden defers to Mike James"
reminder as you watch this game that Brooklyn will be adding *James Harden* to this lineup lmao. Bucks have no chance.
James harden shows look therapeutic but them mfs probably like 3k lmao
"James ""Leisure Suit Larry"" Harden"
This. James Harden is far more valuable than even his scoring. Despite being one of the best stat stuffers of all time alot of his contribute goes on behind the box score. The same was true for the first 5 games in Houston and even more true in Brooklyn
Wild we are saying that about a team missing James fucking Harden
"Don't get me wrong, Harden's a great player and if he were playing 1 on 1 vs Jokic, I'd take him to win - but in a 5 on 5 game with a similar team surrounding them of replacement players, I'd bet on Jokic.  But if I were building a team as a GM, I'd probably rather take Harden on my team, because it'd be easier to build a team around conventional pieces.  If that's confusing, read on!     I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that James Harden's archetype, the ""star swingman shooting guard"" has existed in multiples in the league as far back as I can remember; like if we went into a time-machine to a random place in the leagues history and had to bring a player back to replace Harden on our team maybe we can drop in a Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Clyde Drexler, Brandon Roy, etc, etc. - our team dynamic won't change too much.  Now try the same exercise with Jokic, and you'd probably have to dial your time machine in to a very specific time and place to find a remotely similar player to plugin; maybe a Bill Walton, Arvydas Sabonis, Vlade Divac even.   Same thing would happen if you were comparing box scores anonymously from all the starting centers on a given night and trying to find Jokic, you'd probably be more able to do because of its uniqueness... you might even get more right than if you tried figuring out whose box score was whose between Harden and Bradley Beal for example.       TL;DR; Jokic is a cool, unique player, but I wouldn't want to build my team around him because he's too hard to replace if he goes down"
"Yeah, the James Harden who shot 24 % from 3 against the Warriors across 7 games with over 10 attempts a game. He also had a 1:1 assist to turnover ratio and was a net negative throughout the series. Only if the Rockets had someone like Jokic that series."
so bias. He's JAMES HARDEN
james harden would've gotten it if he didn't get hurt
"I love this comment cause it sums it up perfectly. Luka is the first guy since LeBron came in as a kid where you almost can’t even fully predict his true limits/potential cause we’ve just never seen someone quite like him before.  My friend last night was like Luka is like if you combined Magic Johnson and James Harden into one person. I was like wait what? Lol....but then we both just set there and were like damn, that take actually isn’t as insane as it sounds when you first here it maybe 😂"
Just like how James Harden won MVP and had his best seasons with his addition.
"I agree with you, even Russell Westbrook stated, James Harden got everything. Coming late always, not working hard enough, not proper time spent in the video room, it's a recipe for disaster in the end. Look at where Huston is now, totally lost. This is what happens when you put too much trust into one player rather than the whole team. I mean whatever he asked he was given better shooter, better pg in cp3 and Westbrook but still not enough."
"That's really the only thing that'll stop him.  With his play, I don't think father time will ever impact him like other young combo players.   He's basically New Jersey Nets Jason Kidd +Dwight Howard Rockets James Harden... At 22.   Look at how much better both Harden and Kidd got past 30... And the son of bitch is 22.  Just unreal.b"
The James harden iso dribble package with the Steve francis finishing package
Obviously not quite that. But didn’t James harden have like a 50-60 point triple double with like 16 and 17?
The nets are favorites now because they got james harden mid-season. Neither the cavs nor warriors added that type of talent during the season
"James Harden because his mohawk and beard was really cool  His team went toe to toe with the Warriors while everyone else bent over for them  Adidas &gt; Nike  But also Chris Paul, I've said it many times: If you don't like the point god, you don't like nba basketball.  e: and yes, the 2018 wcf was as painful as you can imagine.  oh i also have go give a mention to demar and lowry, they really love the city and i hope 7and10 are right beside each other in the Scotia rafters."
This likely wont apply if ur a fan of the other 29 teams that got torched by him in 2019 but James Harden
"he is james harden. yes, he decides lol"
It sucks because he’s gonna be a monster in a few years. Just didn’t fit the timeline for the Nets championship window and you get James Harden.
james harden had 61 against the spurs just 2 years ago [https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201903220HOU.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201903220HOU.html)
"Sean Marks took Brooklyn from the worst team in the league to title favourites in less than 5 years.  This season in particular he somehow acquired Brown and Shamet for almost nothing, traded for Harden, added Griffin and Aldridge in the buy out market, took a huge risk in Claxton, added Johnson and James as free agents who have been amazing, Assembled an insane coaching group, extended Harris, and added Green who's been solid.  Jones has done an equally amazing job, but I'd give it to Marks because our roster is ridiculous compared to Phoenix."
It doesn't really matter. Paul payed with James fucking Harden who set records for usage.
"&gt;Do you have any evidence against it?  Russell doubled Wilts votes.   The 2015 MVP race was decided on the fact that Steph had better seeding. Lets take a little look at the votes. Steph Curry had 1198 points for the MVP. James Harden had 936 votes for the MVP. That's a 262 point difference.   The 2019 MVP race was decided on the fact that Giannis had better seeding. Giannis had 941 points. Harden had 776 points. That's a 165 point difference.  The 2008 MVP race was decided on the fact that Kobe had better seeding. He had 1100 points. Chris Paul had 894 points. That's a 206 point difference.  What these stats tell us is that when it comes down to Candidate A vs Candidate B, and Candidate A has the better seeding despite B having as good or better individual points, Candidate A usually wins by a 200 point differential. The total difference in votes is around 10% of the total votes in this scenario.  Bill Russell won while having nearly double Wilts votes. According to you, Wilt was better individually. If this is true, than statistically, Wilt should have had been within 10% of the total votes distance in the race. He wasn't."
"&gt;Marks made the Harden trade, sure, but I can't imagine any GM wouldn't trade LeVert and Allen level players for a prime James Harden  were you not on this sub when Harden got put on the block?"
"He left because the franchise, tillman, since he owned it cheaped out on the margins, watered the drinks like in his eateries. We cut staff, role players, basically the culture meanwhile he'd scream to everyone that he would spend.  Think about if you're harden the year after you go one game from the finals.   You replace the your best friend on the team, Ariza, teh vet, championship presence, its hard to quantify more than his stats of what he did for the squad:  Former Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul was on the Knuckleheads podcast with Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson and explained the impact of the Rockets losing Ariza.      “People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”  So they took their glue guy, replaced him with James Ennis on A minimum contract. Come Feb, they traded him for...a top 55 protected 2nd rounder, thats right no one while he was in the rotation.    Thats not all, they cut Daniel House in Jan for 2 months bc it wasn't tax friendly yet. So your harden, in a time of load management he still played heavy games, useage,minutes, dominating individually and you come back for months to see actual depth and talent  cut from your team. Does that scream winning culture, going all in for your championship window?  further more the offseason we had over 10 million in TPE, we ignored it. MLE? We Ignored. bird rights for our players to add assets? ignored it. In fact we traded multiple picks including first to get under the tax.  Those moves don't help the gm, don't help harden, or the fans, it goes only to the owner.    Harden loved houston. He had business here, multiple homes, moved his family out here. Hell the guy just opened a rockets themed restaurant. He wasn't scheming to get out, but The GM left several million on the table to leave. THe coach Left after negotiating with tillman and tilly lied in 2019, so did the associate head coach. And now the president. All points to one guy.  Lebron came back after gilbert thrashed him, harden is like that so hopefully they can salvage it. But make no mistake, we weren't losing harden, morey, Tad brown, MDA until this idiot took over and changed the trajectory of our team."
"I don't see how anyone possibly has an argument over Jones. Marks made the Harden trade, sure, but I can't imagine any GM wouldn't trade LeVert and Allen level players for a prime James Harden, especially when you have the option to pair him with KD and Kyrie.  Jones took us from a perpetual turd in the punch bowl to the literal best record in the league. Before the season started, his moves were heavily criticized, and all we've done this season is prove everyone wrong time and again."
"They literally cut margins and costs, the non headliners moves each off season under fertitta.  They some how created a narrative that they did it all for harden. 2018 offseason, tillman's first. They came off one game and injury from the finals pushing warriors to the brink.      -Tillman drove off the associate head coach in negotiations who led our top defense.    -We had over ten million in TPE(He ignored it)    -We had MLE( IGnored)     -We had bird rights to all of our players, if not to retain them, to use them as cap assets to get players( we ignored it)      -Former Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul was on the Knuckleheads podcast with Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson and explained the impact of the Rockets losing Ariza.      “People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”    -We replaced Ariza with James Ennis. Who was in the rotation and was traded in Feb for...a top 55 protected 2nd rounder, no player.    -We also Cut Daneil house in janury for 2 months until it was cap friendly.       -We traded multiple picks, including a first rounder soley to get under the tax.   -Almost all of our moves, except westbrook. Which tillman is on record on Colin Cowherd saying that the front office went cold on the trade, but he pushed it through, were made that lowered our salary.    -Those salary cuts did not help us with future flexiblity, soley tax purposes. They don't help the team, coach, harden, or even fans.  They went to one mans pockets meanwhile he sold anyone who would listen a different narrative.    But if people say it enough, it sticks, and fertitto knows that."
"I get that man, I do but the second time we lost to the Warriors, it was close every single game. If we had gone into the tax and gotten some actual NBA wing talent on the roster, we could have beaten them. That's how close that series was. If you are not going to go into the tax with James Harden in the prime of his powers, I dont know when you are going to do so."
Playing with James Harden wrecked the reputations of two all-time great point guards. Makes you think.
"&gt;	 KD doesn't need to be a top playmaker, he actually being good even if he's not top playmaker on top of him being the best scorer and best offensive player OF ALL TIME   If that were true why couldn’t he be the playmaker without averaging a turnover per assist when trying to create without Westbrook in OKC? Why was he never trusted with the ball (according to touches, time spent with ball, dribbles per possession, pass completed) in golden state: that was left up to Curry and Draymond green. Why? Because the moment Curry (or Westbrook) left the floor Durant’s efficiency cratered and he turned the ball over at an embarrassing rate if he’s an all time great.   What other top 20 player constantly turns the ball over at a historic rate when he doesn’t have an all time great creator doing all the heavy offensive lifting?   Here’s an idea: the *idea* of Durant being the best scorer ever is nice but when it comes to him being the primary ball handler/creator and scorer, he turns the ball over and over and his efficiency plummets below league average.   The “””””haters””””” on this sub are critical of Durant because of his play within its proper context.   This isn’t even to mention that he choked massively alongside an MVP-candidate then joined a 73 win team with the reigning MVP in his prime. Now he’s with james harden and kyrie Irving lol"

The reverse James harden
"This is what happens when people think they know what ""would"" happen, but ignore what did actually happen. It happens a lot on r/nba and ""If"" is James Harden fans favorite word because they'd hate to talk about what has actually happened when these players play against each other. Harden is a great player, but Steph is an all timer, and the difference is pretty stark."
Never want a James Harden team to win because people will start consistently ranking him above Wade if he gets one.
I never said anything about Luka I think he’s just as bad I hate watching him. And Lebron doesn’t do that James harden bullshit where he runs to the free throw line and stops on a dime and the defender slightly touches him and he falls to the floor. That’s a Luka/Trae/Harden play.
"It's very easy.  Luka Doncic 8M  James Harden 40.8M  OG Anunoby 3.8M  Giannis Antetokounmpo 27.5M  Nikola Jokic 28.5M  Total 108.6M  If you mean for the whole roster, just swap out Harden with Donovan Mitchell who makes 5.2M and fill the rest in."
"james harden in 2012 august: Harden On Extension, Thunder, Kobe, LeBron, KD August 31st, 2012 at 10:42pm CST by Chuck Myron James Harden is in the midst of a remarkable few months. He reached his first NBA Finals in June, and won an Olympic gold medal a few weeks ago. Soon he'll have to decide whether to sign a long-term extension with the Thunder, but this week he's been in Spain promoting the NBA 3x Tour, a series of streetball and three-on-three events sponsored by Spanish bank and NBA partner BBVA. He spoke with Marca.com earlier about his desire to remain with the Thunder, and he reiterates those comments in a video posted on YouTube by basket4us.com (hat tip to Royce Young of DailyThunder.com). The narration is in Spanish, but all of Harden's comments are in English, and he had plenty to say about the Thunder, his game, and the preeminent stars of the league.  On whether he'll remain with the Thunder after this season:  ""It's decisions, but I love the Thunder. I'm excited to be here. I think we've definitely grown a brotherhood, so hopefully I'll definitely want to be in Oklahoma.""  On the appeal of the Thunder:  ""We're young, and we're exciting. I think that's why everybody likes us a lot, because we're exciting and we get the job done. We've got to just keep doing it and win games.""  On his continued development:  ""I've got to improve. I improve every single year. That's my mindset. You've got to be better every single year, because there's some very good, talented guys in this league. This summer was a very good summer for me, and I've got to go into training camp improved and ready to go."""

"I honestly don't know the difference between ESPN and TNT at all as far as production goes, and for commentators I don't know who works for what company. If you blocked out the logos then I'd never tell the difference.  Harlan/Breen are elite, JVG I really don't like, and everybody else in between is just background noise. I don't really think about the broadcast itself much at all: I see basketball, I watch it.   The only thing that really irks me is when they fuck with the camera angles too much. Camera angles are great for replays, but for real-time in-game action I want the standard view. And I also hate the heavy zoom that some broadcasts do -- I need to see all 10 guys at once, not a closeup of James Harden iso-ing."
James Harden averaged 10 more points a game than the other 3 (whilst getting more rebounds and assists) and yet you have him as 4th.  I really don't get that logic. How is scoring 36 points a game on average not seen as one the greatest seasons ever?
"Even with the trajectory the league is on right now, look at James Harden. He is 3rd in current player triple doubles with 58. In 2016-2017 he had 22, then with tweaks to the roster 15 the next 3 years combined.   A few tweaks to the Mavericks rosters and Lukas triple double numbers could go down, regardless if the amount of triple doubles go up or not.  I definitely think Luka would have the best chance, however I think people are assuming an All-Time record that just got broken after being around since the 70’s is a little too easy to beat."
"The Rockets because James Harden 💉🔥.   I came for James but have decided to stay for Houston after learning the history and strategy and because I like the idea of Texas (I’ve live in NY my whole life tho).  I do semi-support Brooklyn though because it’s in my state and because of Harden.  However, I’m a 💯% casual when it comes to Brooklyn and don’t really watch the games."
&gt; People just focus on the few exceptions where a guy consistently over/underperforms  I don’t think anybody argues these players never exist like I said before I think DeRozan would be one of the first ex people call a playoff underperformer. The bucks are a pretty analytically oriented franchise and clearly thought Bledsoe was too much of a playoff underperformer. It’s just the availability heuristic where these ex cause people to think it’s more common than it actually is   What we’re talking about with Jimmy Butlers playoff track record is basically the last 2 years. 33 games in a 11 year career. We can call it what it is 2 strong postseasons. I don’t 33 games to be that predictive of how he’ll play in the playoffs going forward and that’s where I probably disagree with others. That’s kind of my point with Paul George postseason 2013-17 vs 2018-20   And even with Butler it’s all relative the playoff reputation. When James harden has 12 points in an elimination game vs LA people don’t say “oh he was just too fatigued can’t blame him”. When Paul George averages 22/6/5 but goes 5/14 16 points 1 assist in an elimination game his team loses vs Toronto people will drag him not talk about how good he was.
"A simple google search of “Harden post defense” gets you good articles like [this one](https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/2/14/22283079/film-study-taking-a-look-at-james-hardens-unique-style-of-defense) that have both stats and film study that prove his post defense is actually effective and one of the best in the league.   &gt;	Last year, he had the second best points per possession numbers for any post defender who got posted up a minimum of 12 percent of the time, according to NBA Stats. That talent has continued to shine in Brooklyn.  He defends the post less often in Brooklyn because Brooklyn doesn’t switch everything on defense like the Rockets used to do. Back in Houston, Harden would guard meaningful bigs more than nearly every other guard in the league, because he would switch onto them and let guys like Tucker take the perimeter assignment. And this thread is about a theoretical Warriors team with Harden, and the same kind of switch could be done with them so Harden isn’t guarding on the perimeter."
OP with Rockets flair straight up erasing James Harden from existence lol
"I hear you. I really do. But James Harden was getting trashed for his defense a few years ago even though he was a killer on offense. Just saying. The Jokic defense problem needs to be heard just as much as the Harden defense issue was heard. Both super incredible offensive players, no doubt."
james harden would like a word
Harden is the best offensive player on the Nets and he wasn't there for two mostly competitive games and it's not like he's a downgrade defensively compared to a guy like Mike James or Shamet either.
James Harden is the man
They can keep up offensively with the nets when James harden is injured lol
John Wall (2016-17) and James Harden (2018-19) have both led the league in steals.   Russell Westbrook (2015-16) and Monta Ellis (2012-13) have both come in second.
James (Lebron/Harden/Wiseman) is arguably the goat.
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."
James Harden nods off camera
"I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do with a holistic player measurement that suggests Fred Van Vleet is more impactful to winning than James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, and Kevin Durant. If your suggestion is to ignore what doesn’t seem to make sense then it returns back to a subjective evaluation of the data and at that point the LEBRON measurement is pretty damn useless. This has been essentially my critique of all these holistic player measurements. They don’t really add anything to the NBA discussion besides confirmation bias when a player you like/dislike is rated high/low on RAPTOR, LEBRON, etc."
"Yeah for sure - Klay’s quick release is very valuable and his release point is perfect for catch and shoot as he catches it right in the shooting pocket. And I know they aren’t all open but they’re definitely less contested than Dame’s.   IIRC klay’s percentage actually declined the year he got injured. So I don’t know how you concluded that he’s improving.   As for who would you trust to get a 3 in a game situation? Again it depends. Dame can get his shot at any time hence why he’s hit far more clutch 3’s compared to nearly anybody else.   I would be interested to see what Dame’s “open” 3 point percentage is. Same for other players that take a lot of tough contested 3’s off the dribble like James Harden.  There’s a big difference between shooting as the number 1 or number 2/3 option. If klay was “the man” like Dame is and had to face double teams and have teams completely zero in on him off ball, I can almost guarantee his percentages would drop and he would get less clean looks per game.   Not trying to hate Klay at all - Ray Allen used to be my favourite player so I love watching Klay because of their similarities. But there’s just something awe-worthy about the types of shots Steph and Dame take and make that you have to acknowledge."
James Harden knew that team was trash and the record proves it.
Where the hell is james harden?
"yep that's pretty much what he's gone through, right down to the early success he hasn't matched. he was actually on one of the most interesting teams of the modern era, the early 2010s oklahoma city thunder. that team had just drafted kevin durant, westbrook, and james harden and it was clear that at least durant and westbrook would be stars. they had success right away and went to the finals in their third year together, losing to lebron's stacked miami heat. everybody assumed they would have many more appearances together as a group. they had very poor timing with injuries, and one by one each of them left. that was the only time they went to the finals, all 3 ended up winning MVPs in different seasons."
Well he did have Kevin Durant and James Harden for a bit.
James Paul       Chris Harden
"""I have no doubt James (Lebron/Harden) is going to make a huge impact in this league. He's going to be a hell of a player. ... I have great belief in James."""
1. Russel Westbrook - 182 2. Oscar Robertson - 181 3. Magic Johnson - 138 4. Jason Kidd - 107 5. LeBron James - 99 6. Wilt Chamberlain - 78 7. Larry Bird - 59 8. James Harden - 58 9. Nikola Jokić - 56 10. Fat Lever - 43 11. Luka Doncic - 35  We used to consider Jason Kidd a Triple Double Machine.
"To be fair you guys have the most emotionally fragile set of stars currently in the league, possibly of all time: Mr. Kyrie ""dunning Kruger, Flat earth, I don't talk to pawns"" Irving, James playoff choker harden, and Kevin ""hardest road, yell at my agent and make a bunch of Twitter burners"" Durant. Totally set for playoff success."
"I honestly can’t even think of who would do it. Rockets James Harden is the only one who had the usage and scoring ability to get there, because he could do it off a combo of 3s and a lot of FTs."

"And what a surprise, suddenly Lebron James Harden are both probable to return just in time for the playoffs"
"""James Harden may return for the Nets""  ""For the Nets""  Ugh."
Bill Simmons' most hated player lineup:  PG: Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: LeBron James  PF: AD by default I guess? He hated on him plenty through the trade  C: Dwight always and forever
james harden good at basketball!???  this fucking sub bro lmfao
My favourite player is Lowry. I think I play like James Harden
"Maybe they will. Kinda depends on where they’re drafted though. Are we still talking about Kawhi in the same way today if he wasn’t drafted to San Antonio?   If these guys are drafted to OKC, they’re likely to become superstars. That organization has produced Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Domas Sabonis, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and now they’ve turned guys like Dort into productive NBA players. Their player development is off the charts.  If these guys are drafted to somewhere like Cleveland or Sacramento, chances are they’ll be squandered in a bad organization."
"I’m Aware of where they are ranked. I’m saying it’s hard to take that into actuality given the fact that their roster as been ever changing and so many key plays have been injured   Blake, Claxton, Harden, and KD have all missed considerable time and those are their 4 best defenders (Blake hasn’t been injured but he spent the majority of the season not on the Nets, so the defense does not account him for as much)   I said it’s probable that the Nets could be an average defensive team when they actually play their full rotation   Shamet, TLC, Green, Mike James, Perry, DAJ, Alize, Chioza are all players who are bad at defense and have all played more minutes than they would have in a normal set rotation   Some of those guy won’t see a single minute in the playoffs and the ones that do (like Green, Shamet, maybe DAJ) will see spot minutes"
James Harden would have this stat if he wasn’t traded to the Nets.
Player A is Steph   Player B is James Harden
It's the same way teams beat James harden in the playoffs
Alright. James harden at 22 vs Steve Nash at 22... Larry Bird at 22 vs Kevin Durant at 22.   Magic Johnson as a rookie vs Kobe Bryant as a rookie.   It’s fucking ridiculous to say a player can’t do this or can’t do that because of his circumstance right now. How do you know what he’ll do in the future? I don’t. I’m just saying if you watch this dude play it’s clear that his potential is super high and he can be all time great scorer.
"Harden wanted out after the 2019 Warriors series.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30528130/inside-james-harden-houston-rockets-breaking-point%3fplatform=amp  “Rockets management believed those issues could be ironed out and wanted to run it back with the Harden-Paul duo last season. Those plans changed as soon as Westbrook became available.”  “Harden insisted the Rockets get the deal done, saying he'd demand a trade if they didn't find a way to bring his childhood friend and former OKC teammate to Houston, sources said. The Rockets paid a price that was considered steep at the time -- Paul, 2024 and 2026 first-round picks, and swap rights in 2021 and 2025.“  But yeah, they would’ve been in a better position if they kept CP3"
"james harden in the playoffs is an interesting thing. if we set aside his notorious stinkers and look at overall performance, he’s incredible in the playoffs. way above average numbers in every area on great efficiency.   but in the context of six seasons worth of playoff runs, 2/1/2 and -4TS% is a *huge* drop. and it’s hard to find the right language for a player who plays consistently worse but still well in high-importance games"
hot take:   LeBron James Worthy would beat LeBron James Harden   you give Worthy’s post game with LeBron’s body and he’s scoring every single play in 2 on 2
I always thought it was closer to 28-30. Dame and Kyrie look better right now than they’ve ever been. James Harden started his Jordan-esque scoring run when he turned 28. It varies but I think most players are still developing when they’re 24-26
"James Harden is a f-ing BEAST. I knew he put up crazy stats but he almost single-handedly makes this team into a juggernaut. I'm not saying he's better than Lebron, but at Lebron's age and the way Harden's been playing, I wouldn't automatically put him as better than Harden at this point."
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."
"well let’s see.   steph played with 2, maybe 3 hall of famers in their prime    james harden is on a bullshit 2k team that’s gonna sleepwalk to a title  lebron has had his fair share of help  kd literally has not won a championship without being on a super team   kawhi got his first ring on one of the greatest sports dynasties ever.   and what has giannis played with? khris middleton and jute holiday? hm."
Gonets too. I swear half our sub is bipolar and gets real life depression after every loss this year. I blame James Harden for winning too much until he injured his hammy for this expectation. The one exception was our loss vs sixers this year where our backup bench almost caught up vs embiid and Simmons.
Bruh is that Cam Payne or James Harden out there...
nobody including you wants to watch that as evidence by people complaining that james harden shoots too many free throws as is.
James Harden with low body fat
Yeah but James Harden did it in reverse.
Russ had pg13 and a great thunder roster for 2 years and James harden last year I mean what else can u give him at this point?
LeBron James Harden
"James Harden  Ok, hear me out. Yes, on average his stats in the playoffs are phenomenal. But when you watch the games, when it gets down to the last few minutes where you need your superstar to make plays, he gets passive. I'd watch close games and it feels like he disappeared at the end."
Slightly ahead of James harden but behind Brad Wanamaker
"&gt;Idk why this sub  Yeah, this sub just loves James Harden and defends him from the choker label ALL the time"
1 Kevin Durant  2 James Harden  3 Kyrie Irving
Ask James Harden.
Wasn't Bill Walton MVP and Sixth man? James Harden also
"James harden.   Idk why this sub or his fans try to deny it. Come playoffs he shoots worse and refs call less fouls so his main advantage is minimized. This is confirmed by the eye test, by regular stats, by advanced stats, overall fg %, 3pt fg%, true fg %, efg%, RAPTOR, ELO, old school new school however you want it. His style gets exposed in the playoffs"
Just James Harden not asking much /s
Damn all they need is James Harden and they win the title? That’s crazy
Brother i will let you answer for us:  do you really think the voters are going to keep Lebron James and James Harden off the All-NBA lists..
But he was losing.  He needed Kyrie. Obviously not more than Kyrie needed him but he couldn't have done that without him.  Maybe we should criticize Lebron for losing the 2015 finals then instead of giving him a pass. I mean he did shoot the ball terribly after all.  We should probably criticize Lebron in 2018 too. It's fine to lose against that team but he got swept. James Harden took them to 7 games.
"Drummond also never had KD and James Harden as team mates, he's barely even played with LeBron yet. Westbrook is the definition of ego over winning"
James harden will lose his beard
James harden would be envious
"My point was just that many superstars get easy rebounds as teammates cede them.  James Harden (8 REB/game), Bruce Brown (5 REB/game), and Malik Beasley (4 REB/game) all average about 1.5 contested rebounds a game. Some rookie like Okoro is averaging 1.1 contested rebounds, but is totaling under 3. Josh Okogie is similar (1.3 contested but 2.9 total)."
"And when the times come you really think, “Am I James Harden or just simply a shell of James Harden.” Hours and days pass with the same thought running around in your mind. Eventually you turn to coke."
Idc what anyone says James Harden has been the best player in the NBA for past 5 years
"Good question, let’s ask James Harden"
"We talking about being good playoff player or all time great scorer? Curry don’t elevate or regress his play in playoffs. U got players like GOAT James, Ant, KD, and Kawhi who elevate play in playoffs. U got players like Harden, Giannis, Dame, and Pandemic P regress in playoffs."
And the Nets were down James Harden 🤷🏻‍♂️
"By the time he ends his career James Harden also will surpass Ray Allen in total three pointers scored, I believe."
And post James harden trade we lost by 7. So my point stands.
Playoffs performance  Lebron game 1-2018 finals Regular season performance That james harden game where he had like a 50 pt triple double. Best playoff series Philly vs raptors 2019 2nd round.
Pre James harden trade
"&gt; For reference, James Harden, the scoring leader the last 3 years, had 2335, **2818**, 2191.  My god. Is that good for 4th place?"
"Yeah but Karl Malone and Barkley ran in to Jordan’s Bulls,AI ran in to Shaq and Kobe’s Lakers.Those players didn’t fall short for the same reason as Westbrook. Russ has had Kevin Durant,Paul George,James Harden,and Bradley Beal."
"They really didn't do typical half-court offense though is the thing       Because the Warriors ran motion so much, in their default offense, Steph and Draymond had the ball the most. Everyone else made quick decision type stuff, like spot-up then up to 2 dribbles then pass/shoot/cut.       And if you take Steph out of the picture, Draymond as a playmaker loses a lot of value in PnRs and DHOs. And at this point in their careers, Livingston and Iguodala weren't initiators of offense, really just good connectors.       Players like KD, Kawhi, PG, a lot of wings that can't just run 40 PnRs every game need someone else to start half-court offense, otherwise it can get super iso-heavy. Even someone like Kyrie falls into this group. He's only really tried to be a proper PG once in his career, in Boston, and was way more natural alongside LeBron and Harden because he can't really be a ball-pounding PG.       Nets without Harden AND Dinwiddie have been relying on a replacement level player in Mike James. Clippers last year looked way worse than the players they had, but this year look so much better with Reggie Jackson and Rondo instead of Beverly       This is also part of why the 1 ball stuff for the Nets is nonsense. With Harden, all 3 can play their ideal roles in an offense. And why Harden + 1 works better than Kyrie + KD. But I would argue that if Dinwiddie was healthy, this absence of Harden would not be felt as hard"
"&gt; Im not talking about fucking jimmy butler having one season with a high ftr.  They have virtually the same career FTr lol.  &gt; They are also completely different players, and i don’t watch enough of jimmy butler to have an opinion on his play style.  How do you know they're completely different players in the way they draw fouls, if you dont actually watch Jimmy?  &gt; I understand the ridiculous of it but jimmy only takes like 13 shots a game anyway so when he starts getting calls his ftr jumps up much higher than other players. Its the same reasons centers are so high on that list.  Ah, so it's all fine and dandy to shoot 9 FTA a game in 13 shots, but 11 FTA in 25 shots is too much? Come the fuck on dude.  &gt; We are talking about James harden constantly season after season baiting for fouls.  They still are fouls, as explained a million times by the refs on twitter for everyone to see. There also like a gazillion youtube vids explaining how the rules work and why the narrative that Harden flops and travels is utter BS.  &gt; I’ve also seen ref go on record and say calls that Harden got should not have been called.  Sauce?"
"SAS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS AGAINST THE BROOKLYN NETS I MEAN MY GOD, RUSSEL WESTBROOK! KEVIN DURANT! JAMES HARDEN! THAT OKC TEAM! YOU KNOW WHAT IM TALKIN BOUT PEOPLE I MEAN REALLY, ...but this is a 4 game series, and let me tell you why. Kevin Durant.  MAX: Stephen A I completely agree, BUT YOU ARE WRONG THIS WOULD GO SIX BECAUSE OF ONE MAN. RUSSEL WESTBROOK. RUSSEL WESTBROOK IS A GUY! RUSSEL WESTBROOK IS A DUDE! YOU'VE GOT RUSSEL WESTBROOK ON YOUR TEAM THINGS CAN HAPPEN!"
"For sure, but also missing those players for Denver makes their bench incredibly shallow and forces them to play guys who are an active detriment to the team's performance.  Trying to compare missing one James Harden to like six dudes is dumb for a lot of reasons."
I think Steph is one of if not the greatest offense or forces in the history of basketball game.  But James harden isn’t an offensive force. He *is* the offense.
Are we forgetting James Harden and CP3 nearly beat the KD Warriors?
"For sure, Jokic is the substitute MVP. Since all the real MVP candidates either missed too many games (KD, James, Harden, Embiid), have won previously (Giannis) or don't have either stats or record (Curry, Doncic, Lillard, CP3), we'll settle for him as placeholder this season.  Just can't figure why Doncic isn't favourite for MVP. He's just a seed behind Jokic and has better stats."
"All this talk about the scoring race made me wonder what's the most total points someone's scored in a season. Surprise surprise, it's Wilt with 4029. Second place is also Wilt with 3586. Third is MJ with 3041.  For reference, James Harden, the scoring leader the last 3 years, had 2335, 2818, 2191."
I mean thats why they got James Harden.
This is like the [James Harden eye roll](https://imgur.com/gallery/dMj6UtV) but the Steph Curry 2021 remix
"Has James Harden retired? There is no argument. Nobody would take him over LeBron, KD, Curry, Harden and Kawhi."
"I don't think he's anti-vax. I just think he's vaccine hesitant. I think there's a difference. Part of my family is the same way. The tuskegee thing gets brought up a lot. Some of my family members say they want to wait for it to be out a year, even though its been in trial for almost a year before it got to the public.   Luckily my parents and the people most at risk came around, but some of my family members are still holding out until they feel its safe.  I think if LeBron James is taking proper precautions, it is what it is. If he went to an event that vetted and was a bubble like event, then he's being somewhat responsible. He's not LouWill, James Harden or the rookier from houston. He's not going to strip clubs. So personally, I'm not too worried.  My only concern for james or any nba star would be once fan capacity starts to go up, how the hell is he going to protect himself? You can still get covid if you're vaccinated, it just won't kill you or have an adverse effect. But there's still a small chance you can get it. I think its stupid of LeBron to leave that to chance. Or any player. Play the numbers. Get the vaccine and be done with it.  I have a feeling players on my bandwagon team aren't vaccinated either. It would suck if we get lakers vs clippers and health and protocols kick everyones ass."
"Ah yes, NBA Superstar Caris LeVert who has been competing for the title of best player in the league against the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard."
I would take James Harden as most impactful... but I respect your opinion also. Dame has taken his blazers to places they didn’t belong
Is that what that is? Its just hard to tell when it's in the shadow of James harden
"Having Stephen Curry on your team inherently skews the Warriors percentage to be higher than what it is.  Both the 15 Rockets and the 07 Cavs have better defensive ratings then this Warriors team  Harden was not doubled full court constantly like Curry was that's just a straight up false statement   Ahh yes the same Larry Hughes who shot 37% from 3 in 06 and had teams guard his 3 point shot instead of sagging off him and doubling LeBron full court all game, if you watched the league back then you'd know that teams actually guarded Larry and he wasn't just some bum ass player you can leave open.   The Rockets argument is an actual joke 2015 Rockets where ranked #1 in 3 point attempts because guess what, James had shooters around him and Dwight.   the Rockets Teams aren't even comparable to this Warriors team, the Cavs ones are the closest and that happened in a time before the 3 point revolution and LeBron was strong enough and fast enough to get to the rim and finish through contact anyhow, it's just not comparable at all."
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"Again, lazy take. I just cited stats for their entire team having an anomaly season when they play with him and you imply he’s not creating for them because he doesn’t James harden iso drive and kick out. You don’t see it in the box score it must not exist.   And you mock the gravity thing after watching a game where he was doubled 35’ out and when he off ball was being guarded over the top with a roaming double the entire time lmao. They’re almost always in a 4v3. Something something gravity for ya"
James Harden...
"Keep in mind that unlike someone like James Harden, Curry was coached by a guy who would sit him in the middle of runs by the opposing team because that was his designated time to sit. When criticized for this, he responded with snark and indignation. Substitute in Mike D'Antoni, and the Warriors win several close games that they lost due to this asinine strategy, and are never in the play-in tournament in the first place."
"Average is a surprisingly high bar in the NBA. I feel like I can name 15 better passers than Steph. In no particular order (mostly going by team record this year), Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Jokic/Lebron if they count, Trae Young, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, Rubio, Lamelo, Lowry, Vanvleet and Wall is 16. I’d probably put Derozan as well but idk if I’d call him a point guard."
You didn’t watch James Harden in Houston then. Also it’s harder to double team those guys because they’re much better passers than Steph.
Welcome to the James Harden hater brigade. A Cleary great player doesn't win so it's exclusively his fault.
No because James Harden actually reaches the playoffs when he doesn’t have 2 other all star teammates
Wardell curry is a poor mans james harden
"Today anything in any hemisphere is legal in the NBA.   Ja Morant drive to go up five in OT co pletely puts hand under ball, pauses and ball stops, crosses over, spin move, floater.   James Harden used to take one or two dribbles to get over half court putting his hand completely under the ball.  I remember watching it thinking how brilliant it was.  If refs arent calling that, they are never calling anything in the half court."
"Curry must be exhausted, playing like James harden when the Lakers Swarmed him last year"
He had to play 2nd fiddle to James harden to even get to the WCF. Russ made the finals and 4 WCF before CP3 ever once made the conference finals. And CP3 was in the league for 3 years before Russ.
Average thoughts of a James harden fan  Wait are these jokes still doable ?
Some James Harden bullshit
CP3 made his only conference finals appearance with MVP James Harden. His play off performances haven’t been all great. CP3 is a legend but he has been underwhelming in playoffs in majority.
"Anyone that puts Jokic, Luka, or AD, in the top five right now are out of their mind. I get it that there are a lot of great players in the league but you can’t forget that players like James Harden, are miles better then Anthony Davis or Luka. I think these guys are the top 5 players in the league in 6 or 7 years though."
"A.I. didn’t carry the ball, just like James Harden doesn’t travel ."
"Bill Walton is the first to win MVP, then 6MOTY  James Harden is the first to win 6MOTY, then MVP"
"As non-competitive as it is for Durant, Harden, and Kyrie to all be on the same team - I was still ok with it if Harden ended up with a ring. Seeing the way a legend like Chuck gets treated because he's ""missing a ring"" is very annoying, I wouldn't wish that on another legend like James Harden.  I will happily trade that timeline for Russell Westbrook dethroning all en route to a first ever, 8th seed championship."
1. Westbrook 2. Vince Carter 3. LeBron James 4. Blake Griffin 5. James Harden 6. Allen Iverson 7. Shaq 8. Luka 9. Jokic 10. J. Cole

"Bring back rights for defensive players. Offensive players should not be able to encroach on a defensive players space and has a foul called in their favor. It rewards bad offense.   Lou Williams, James Harden, Trae Young, and Lillard are all craftsmen to varying degrees. I don’t blame them for it but it sucks to watch (doubt I’m saying anything controversial here)"
"Isn’t the phrasing here a little off? Russ was traded because he asked to be traded, not because he got hurt in the playoffs. He wasn’t happy with things on the Rockets before that. Paul got traded because he had a falling out with James Harden and, according to Tim McMahon, Harden demanded Paul be traded. Yes, part of why these guys struggled was injuries, but Morey had no interest in trading Paul, he wasn’t going to be traded that off-season because of the injury. He got moved because that’s what Poppa and ownership to wanted.   If Russ was done wrong it was probably about what happened while he was on the team, the stuff he complained about as far as Harden’s leadership and how they handled the covid protocols. That he was traded was his own wish. Washington isn’t a great place to get traded to, but there are limits working with his contract."
Bill Walton and James Harden have him beat
"&gt; As much as I like James Harden as a player, I don't think he's a top 10 guy who can lead a team to a championship. Jack of many trades, master of none. He's more of a Joe Johnson type of player, 2nd round and out. Perhaps Morey has his eye on Howard next... Lin-Harden-White-Monty-Howard lineup sounds fearsome.   This comment is pretty funny in hindsight"
Jimmy wanted Harden and the Miami front office didn't want to give up to much for James. I wonder if that caused some friction.
The thunder were in an extreme tank when they took James Harden and Russell Westbrook to 7 games back in September?  I'm sorry what?
Played literally nothing like James harden lmao
"somewhat like james harden, premier shooting guard and a flopper"
"James Harden was the #3 overall pick dude.  The equivalent would be if LaMelo was a 3rd option on a great team, put up good stats, and got the keys to his own team after."
"What do you mean he got to play for OKC? He was drafted by the Seattle Supersonics, he spent his career in Oklahoma because of a shady handlings by their ownership group.   The same ownership group was responsible for dealing James Harden for peanuts with a year left on his rookie deal, while saddling KD with poor coaching and spacing throughout his tenure with the Franchise."
"WHAT? Prime KD, Kyrie, and James Harden on the same team in their prime are odds on favorite to win the title??"
"😂. Nah be honest he only won MVP because the rest of the players were injured. I would take Giannis, Harden, Durant, Curry, and James over Jokic. But he is definitely up there with the best. The gap isn't even that big in my opinion."
"James Harden and Joel embiid,    Russell Westbrook/giannis"
"Yes a lot of the same Westbrook takes you see today had already started, and IMO the Thunder always looked better when James had the ball vs Russ.  That said I’m biased bc I watched an inordinate amount of Arizona St. and James Harden was the first college player I knew that had an NBA game."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Dare I say it...Brooklyn Nets point guard James Harden belongs on that list of most enjoyable players to watch on the position all time...and I thought he was Hitler in Houston because of his dribble isolation heavy playstyle.
Just pick two modern teammates. James harden and kevin durant have 0 degrees of seperation since they played together on the 2021 nets.

"Look man, I literally agreed with everything you said up until the last sentence.  I’m not saying NOW, But if you rewind like 3-4 years, James Harden was literally a folding chair. I’ve been watching nba since 2000 as I immigrated and instantly fell in love with the sport and I can assure you I have never seen any player, down to the last seat on the bench  through all these years, be as bad as Harden was a couple years ago.  I know his defense is improved since he’s gotten heat for it. But my god, he was literally fucking shameless on D."
"Certainly there's Asian bias, I'll even provide you with some examples:  * [1st team all state (California) alongside Ryan Anderson, James Harden and Chase Budinger; co-MVP with Kevin Durant of McDonald's All American game](https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team). Despite these accolades, he doesn't get any scholarship offers to notable colleges, aside from a walk-on at Stanford and a full ride with Harvard. * Slam Online article ""Life in the Fast Lane"" shared Lin's Draft Combine scores (or BAM):AVERAGE SPEED Jeremy Lin: 16.66 mph Derrick Rose: 16.60 mph John Wall: 16.48 mph Kyrie Irving: 15.67 mph Lin wins this battle.START SPEED Lin: 13.93 mph Wall: 13.25 mph Irving: 12.64 mph For Rose, BAM has only average speed data. Lin wins this battle too.TOP SPEED Lin: 18.85 mph Wall: 19.30 mph Irving: 18.74 mph Lin comes in second to Wall.Yet he's ""deceptively athletic"" * [Michael Lewis, economist and author behind Moneyball talks about why Daryl Morey passed on Lin; despite his metrics demanding he be drafted in top 15](https://youtu.be/tQ5hfd2lkLs?t=314)  Mind you, the evidence of bias I've provided is all based on Lin prior to joining the NBA. While we can argue that he's not in the NBA currently due to age or injuries, I wonder if perhaps things would be different had he gone to an actual top 16 college; or been drafted where the scouting metrics had him; or been acknowledged for his physical attributes.  Your 50 downvotes are certainly due to fans of Lin who are biased in their opinion, but the greater bias lies elsewhere."
"It's pretty ugly.  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 8 out of 100: James, Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 13 players, only 6 were top 3 picks and just 4 were first overall -- over 20 years."
Does James Harden not exist
james harden nickname is hitler
Kevin Durant&gt;James Harden&gt;Russell Westbrook
Media literally slanders Curry for one bad playoff series every time he’s on air. Literally Skip Bayless put James Harden in front of Steph all time due to playoffs. Lmfao last I checked harden shits the bed 75% of his playoff career while Steph is top 10 all time ppg in the finals
Ahhh so you really can’t read  &gt; i don’t understand rockets fans shitting on russ when james harden is a notorious playoff underperformer  That’s the comment that byrocket was replying to where yukeynuh brought up Harden lmao. Then he sent me some Westbrook playoffs stats (in a series where he was clearly injured) trying to deflect from Harden. That’s when I brought Harden BACK in the mix and then your ignorant ass came in here spewing some more hate towards Westbrook even though I already said numerous times that Westbrook is bad in the playoffs.   Instead of worrying about Westbrook and how he performs in the playoffs how about you worry about how your team can’t sell out a playoff game in one of the biggest cities in the country with three of the best basketball players in the world lmaoo. That’s the definition of a poverty franchise.
It wasn't because of Jokic that the Jazz lost. And the problem against Houston was James Harden.
James Harden would like a word.
"&gt; Like last night LeBron had a triple double with only one turnover and the game winning shot, so in a sense that was a great game from an NBA player, but that wasn't an example of LeBron being great.   Because it wasn't a great game, He scored 22 with way below average efficency. He had a great second half after AD and him having awful first half. Overall it was a good game.   &gt; He got a bunch of free throws, so his TS%  Wel yeah, that's the best shot in the league. Getting FTs is a good thing, don't understand why you are phrasing it as a negative thing.   &gt; but he was only average from 3 (37%)  He averaged 37.8% for the series when the playoffs average was 36%. Also the average % of assisted shots in the playoffs was 81%, Harden averaged only 33% assisted 3s. So he was more efficient than catch and shoots while ISOing and creating his 3s.  &gt; and was well below his scoring average in a series that wasn't terribly competitive with his team losing 4 straight games by increasingly larger margins.  His high usage teammate guard averaged 20ppg on 48% TS%. Kind of difficult winning against LeBron James and AD like that. LeBron had a great series in 2018, sometimes having subpar teammates is a very important issue. The team wasn't the same between the playoffs and regular season.  &gt; If you were making a list of the best playoff series in Harden's career, that wouldn't be on it.  How many players in the history of the game averaged 30ppg on 65% TS while playing against a top 3 defense? And he was being doubled."
Bill Walton who had a similar trajectory as DRose  James Harden
"&gt;DID NOT WIN IN 2015  I thought I was losing it until he wrote that. I was looking at those 06-07 numbers and going... huh? how is the worst output by a scoring champ ever? it looks.... pretty fucking good!    then he somehow says: &gt;EDIT: That 2005-06 season was also used by OC as a metric of how good Kobe was at scoring, adjusting for pace. But, again, look at that season in terms of efficiency, WS, VORP, and it's not pretty.  Even though I just proved that his season in terms of efficiency and VORP are above averages..    And considering that he had the 2nd highest scoring output out of those 25 seasons I listed only behind James Harden, and typically efficiency decreases as usage increases... Idk, I think that's pretty fucking good.   It's not pretty? only Curry in 15-16 and KD in 13-14 have put up higher win shares in the last decade than Kobe in 05-06 with 15.3."
"A bad game from guys like Harden or LeBron can still be ""great"" but you wouldn't say they had a great game if they played well below their average, would you? Like last night LeBron had a triple double with only one turnover and the game winning shot, so in a sense that was a great game from an NBA player, but that wasn't an example of LeBron being great.   Last year against the Lakers James Harden still had a great series for an NBA player, but I have a hard time saying that was a great series for Harden when for him it was well below even his average output. He got a bunch of free throws, so his TS% was good, but he was only average from 3 (37%) and was well below his scoring average in a series that wasn't terribly competitive with his team losing 4 straight games by increasingly larger margins. If you were making a list of the best playoff series in Harden's career, that wouldn't be on it."
James Harden and Hakeem Olajuwon have 1 degree of separation
Nets clippers games early when all the stars played was pretty iconic to me. Nets comeback from the 28 point deficit to beat the suns. Led by james harden and some scubs🤣
"They’re only on sale for $40 if you purchase a group of 4 tickets at the very top at staples center lol, James Harden is literally on social media pleading for fans to buy tickets, sit this one out. We’re top 10 in attendance almost every year"
That man literally kicked James harden in the face once.  Like he’s 6’6 and you managed to kick him in the face?
Using points per 100 possessions doesn't help Kobe much because the slower pace is mostly canceled out by starters playing more minutes.

The James harden laying on a player comes to mind.
I'm picturing an old ass gray bearded Harden version of Bill Russell in 2045. Just handing the trophy to some kid who flails looks like he got shot in the legs when James puts his arm around him for the photo op.
The James B. Harden Lifetime Achievement Award
Still James Harden even though he stabbed me in the heart
"But they were also perfectly designed around him. 3 point shooters, defenders, secondary all-star ball handler, and a center who can roll to the hoop. It's not the same as a lot of other teams where if they lost their best player...the Rockets built a team around James Harden.  Don't forget about the accomplishments of CP3 and Westbrook btw."
"Tbh if you want to focus on the aspect of how valuable to individual was for the team, I think James Harden probably deserves more than 1 year. Those Rockets teams were lottery-bound without him."
"Personally, it's frustrating as a Warrior fan because I was told he can't be MVP when his teammates were too good. Now he can't be MVP because his teammates aren't good enough. At the end of the day I think Steph has been the most individually valuable in the regular season for like the last 5 years (outside of 1 James Harden season)."
"&gt; Curry wasn't always revered by his peers in this way. Six years ago, Curry won his first MVP as he led the Warriors to 67 wins. But that season, the NBPA, fed up with what it saw as biased and unrepresentative media voting, held its own awards show with honors voted on by the players. They picked James Harden, not Curry, as their MVP. &gt;In the 2016-17 season, the league added player input to the long-existing fan vote for the All-Star teams. Curry won the fan vote by far that season, *but finished a distant third in the player vote for Western Conference guards, behind Harden and Russell Westbrook.*  Damn, I forgot about that.  This season does seem to have gone a long way towards Curry earning the respect of Lebron and a lot of his other peers. Dude proved he could carry a team."
"LMFAO they're clearly not trying their hardest in some circumstances. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI5CanDFfPM). and [here's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkfqfOjVWrQ), and [another](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/worst-call-ever-kevin-durant-goes-out-of-bounds-james-harden-is-in-shock-january-3-2019/vi-AAKaQj5). these examples... they don't really seem to be trying that hard bud, even on TNT."
Flopping has become normalized by harden James and others and you guys still wanna bitch and complain when it happens to ur team?
Well okc James harden and Houston James harden may as well be different players.
James Harden is so good he doesn't even have to play on Nets for Nets to win. That's why he's the MVP. /s
The team with James HARDEN
"No, LeBron wasn’t the first or the worst. Tony Parker and Manu Ginobli were first; at least in my memory. James Harden is probably the worst right now.  LeBron is just the most famous."
"Here you go champ: https://imgur.com/a/fYH9Kzl  LeBron may be a flopper, but of all players, Draymond is one I would 100% expect the contact to be legit.  https://images.app.goo.gl/rNDUFBA7K3bX1aoY7  https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/05/05/rockets-draymond-green-pokes-james-harden-eye/"
"But it makes us a worse team. We could’ve lost this game today, and if we were a team that had AD starting at the 5 from the beginning it probably would’ve been a way more comfortable win. That’s the issue for me. Frank doesn’t move AD to the 5 until we’re in trouble, and that’s kinda crazy to think of a team purposely not using their best lineup. It’d be like having James Harden off ball until they’re down 10 and being like, “alright enough! Let Harden run point!” Like yo we shoulda been doing this"
"[James harden be like, first time? ](https://images.app.goo.gl/yFDuSw653XXfx5qVA)"
"Are you a doctor? It looked perfectly fine from my perspective, he’s in LA, he acts, he’s LeBron James... Harden looked like the dude from District 9 &amp; didn’t sell it as hard as this man just did."
Players work on specific skills in practice. Not scoring was probably part of the plan because he was probably strictly working on something else probably playmaking. How do I know? James Harden gets buckets where and when tf he wants to.
"Look up harden after his eye poke from green.   People don’t care now that the warriors are a super team, but green is one of the dirtiest players in the league and absolutely deserved an ejection for that foul on James."
Harden James
It happened with James Harden the last time the Warriors made the playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Harden played with a bloody eye the entire series.
The James Harden experience
"if James Harden has the ball on those last two Warriors possessions instead of Curry, he gets fouls called twice"
James Harden remembers
James harden is at the strip club blushing over these flops
*I think he kicked out his leg*    #curry not james harden dont do that
"this is all just nonsense bullshit. ""James Hardon ***on his slight statistical dip...""***   i mean - who the hell asked him? and who cares? is there some massive narrative that Harden is putting enough stats? no. there is not. is there some media blitz hating on Harden for his ""slight statistical dip""? is *anybody* seriously talking about this? no. stupid for OP to even post this. we're all responding to nothing and just stirring our own shit up."
"Nice job moving the goal post. James Harden has underperformed in the playoffs but to say he's as bad as Russ is a new type of insult lol. James Harden has never shot under 50% TS for a series while it'd be considered an above average series for Westbrook if he did.  James Harden's rockets has never been a heavy favorite in a series and choked it away in 5 games (cough Jazz Cough blazers).  If the KD-warriors didn't exist, Harden would probably a ring. He's shown he can be a #1 option on a championship team. As for Russ, idk if he can even be a 2nd option on a championship team at this point."
Nah it’s just that everyone talks about James harden historical offensive season for why he should be mvp but at the time giannis was also considered to be having a historical season on both offensive and defensive
"It doesn't happen all that often, but I totally agree with James Harden here."
"Well rested? He has a nagging injury and he spends more time at the strip club then he does in the training room, it's evident just by looking at his body. 🤷‍♂️  Here is some food for thought: imagine James Harden minus strip clubs eating healthy and taking care of his body. He might be one of the greatest point gods ever if he did that, same could have been said for Iverson."
Harden &gt; Curry &gt; Dame  There have only been 2 other players besides James Harden to average over 36 points per game in a season and those two are Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Thats how insane Harden was that season.
James Harden must not be aware that he’s a 2 seed. Also weird flex saying that he’s getting carried by KD and Kyrie
Where have you been? Is this the first time you’ve paid attention to James Harden?
"Crazy that a player who scores primarily at the rim scores more efficiently when he gets to play with James Harden and three shooters, and the GM trades away the team's only center to accommodate said player because neither of them can shoot"
"I'm as big a Bucks and Giannis fan as you'll find, but let's not pretend like there's not a meaningful skill discrepancy between James Harden and Giannis. Obviously he doesn't just run and dunk, but Giannis' physical attributes (not just his size, but his extreme flexibility and explosiveness) really add a lot to his game."
Heat must have regretted not doing the James Harden trade 😂😂😂
"they didn’t receive any high end proven talent that’s worth giving up James Harden, no. but they got 5 unprotected first rounders and 5 pick swaps in total out of him, and that by itself easily more value than the Heat could have offered"
Rj wasn’t valued more than James harden
"They were sorting each other by least likely to be traded for James Harden, that’s why Herro is on top."
"Harden is one of the greatest offensive players in the history of the NBA...in his prime. We don't actually know what was real or not in terms of actual trade opportunities but you give up anyone that isn't Bam and Jimmy for Harden.   The chances of Herro, Robinson, and Nunn put together being close to as valuable as James Harden is, is very low... let alone 1 or 2 of them getting anywhere close to his level.   If you have Harden, Jimmy and Bam that makes the game so much easier for roles players to come in and knock down shots or make plays. Fill out the rest of the roster with just about any other player and that team wins a lot of games. Do a little a bit of work and sign guys on team friendly deals or guys looking to win rings over getting paid (which happens every season) and you can build a solid team and become a real contender.   IF they actually had a real shot at Harden and didn't take it then it was a HUGE mistake."
"Nah. Pat Riley has been in this business a long time to know that you don’t win every year and I doubt James Harden alone puts the Heat over the top. They would have to reconfigure the entire roster because if you take out Herro and Duncan, the Heat don’t have any reliable 3 point shooters left.   This is just another bait thread to mock a 21 year old who plays basketball for a living."
He averaged 36 with 6 free-throw yall acting like he's James Harden
Herro was playing injured this playoffs. He’s been injured all season. His foot never recovered.  However let it be known that I was on the #TradeTyler team. Lmao not trading a second year player for James fucking harden is ridiculous.  And I’m glad we got swept instead of making it competitive. I knew this group wasn’t gonna be enough to get it done and now the FO knows to blow it up and not resign anybody except maybe Dunc and Dipo for the low.
The Heat never panic. They just retool without giving up the bank. No one knows what Herro will be but we all know what James Harden is. Heat have cap space and a bunch of young pieces. I think people need to stop the slander. They were the 6th seed and were expected to lose. Milwaukee wasn't expected the lose in 5 to them last year. That to me is more embarrassing. This young Heat team lost to the eventual Champions in my opinion.
"Less efficient, way less cool OKC James Harden is an even better comparison."
"Herro, Robinson, Nunn and picks for James harden would be a steal for the heat. 1 solid player who's gonna get overpaid in free agency this offseason, 1 could be a decent starter down the line, and another solid role player for Harden? Attach as many picks as you can and call that in immediately."
No James Harden trade because of Tyler Herro 🤧🤧🤧
"you'd trade them for james harden, yeah  tatum said he'd trade himself for anthony davis lmao"
James Harden is nice but he's no Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. Those two can be anything. They can even be the next James Harden.
You would be lucky if one of them even became a borderline all star level player much less as good as James Harden  We saw both the culture argument and the selfish ball hog one get disproven in Brooklyn
It was so fucking funny. People were doing backflips to argue James Harden wouldn’t make their team better
And they didnt wanna trade him for james harden. lol
R/NBA hates the Hawks too. All the hated teams need to band together to form some alliance. James Harden can lead us and we could be called the Axis teams or something.
"James Harden is James Harden, but Tyler Hero could become anything. Heck, he could even become James Harden, and you know how much we’ve always wanted one of those! - Pat Reilly"
bruh try James Harden lol
Idk something tells me James Harden or Kyle Lowry would have averaged more

Everyone needs to chill on the Tyler Herro slander. It was Pat Riley and the Heat FO who made the decision not to make the potential trades for James Harden and Kyle Lowry
Ok but how many Jack Harlow video appearances does James Harden have
"I mean, how good is James Harden actually though? You've got to sacrifice 4 cards and ETHBB is pretty much a guaranteed 2400 attack monster when you're playing a Disney Deck. Just doesn't seem worth the sacrifice."
He finally stopped getting the James Harden whistle
At least they don't have James Harden now..
"I do find it funny that no teams were ready to cough up a real package for Harden. Even sixers wouldn’t even put Maxey in the Ben Simmons package. No Murray, Brown, MPJ, Herro  Like it’s James Harden. I don’t understand what in the hell these teams were afraid of."
"Put Herro in a trade package to get James Harden, oh wait....."
"The lighter version of Tyler Herro aka James Harden only had 40 last night, no big deal."
1 reply to that tweet really said  &gt;James harden &amp; the Miami culture don’t mesh
Never forget that Heats fans didn’t wanna trade Tyler Herro for James Harden because his ceiling was too high lol
Imagine playing yourself out of James Harden because you were bamboozled by a bubble
"I swear I always see more takes like this about the Clippers from Nets fans.  On twitter, half the time I see ""Clippers run L.A."" it's a James Harden Nets profile pic."
Dang I didn’t know James Harden and Carrie Underwood worked out together
"James ""Li Ion"" Harden"
"I've been watching the NBA forever 50 years unfortunately has a bullets wizards fan.  I'd have to disagree with you about free third disparity meaning nothing.  Certain players and I think this is inarguable get far more free throws in anyone else. James Harden isn't my mind the best example or the worst example of this.  He drives a lane throws his head back and a foul is called.  He's been doing this from his earliest days in the league with Oklahoma City, And it's got more pronounced and now the refs just give it to him.  Michael Jordan got more fouls than anyone else.  Shaquille O'Neal who was pounded more immersively than any player I've ever seen got far fewer free throws and he was a bad free throw shooter too.  Has a bullets and wizards man I will tell you that Alvin Hayes got a lot of foul calls and he shot a fall away but he had that same little quirk that James Harden did a falling back or throwing his head back as if he had been struck.  Early in his career Michael Jordan did not get a lot of fouls called but Phil Jackson put together two years worth of tapes and sent them to the NBA offices showing all the times Jordan had been hit and didn't get the calls and from that day forward he led the league in free throws.   In my case watching wizard games the last six seven years Bradley Beal and John Wall continuing excessively drove the lane contact was evident yet frequently no fouls were called.  One of the other unseen and important issues with the referees calling more fouls for one team in the other is a diminishes the depth of the team that is getting called for more fouls.  You wind up sitting important players because they picked up two or three fouls early.  This year because several veteran referees retired and because there was a covered out break among referees ( you should read up on this), more younger referees were called up from the minor leagues ( G league,etc.  More than 7 right now).  The difference in the speed and the size of players in the NBA and those in the minor leagues is not unlike the difference between professional baseball and hockey minor leagues.  This has been the worst year for referring I've ever seen.  It was interesting to watch the playoffs last year in the bubble when they had the same veteran cruise working all the games and it was some of the best and cleanest basketball you'll ever see, professionally."
It’s really best to make predictions based on a specific game with specific players and announcers.  You can try something you know will happen but won’t kill you.  Every time James Harden hits a step-back three.  Every time LeBron James makes a skip pass.  Every time Giannis misses a foul shot.  Every time you can hear Tom Thibodeau yelling at his players.  You get the idea.
James Harden literally falls after 90% of his shots and you guys have gotten plenty of awful calls / no calls this series. Get out of here with this.
Except for James Harden wrapping his arm around a defenders arm then flailing around like a fish out of water. That’s exactly like Naismith intended

I mean he did make the finals in 2012 but that OKC team was insanely balanced. imagine being a bench player and getting james fucking harden as your defensive assignment lmao i'd clock out
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"If my theory is correct than these should be the teams that jump up in the lottery that lost a star and haven’t been compensated yet  - Rockets (Lost James Harden)  - Raptors (Lost Kawhi Leonard and about to lose Kyle Lowry)  - Oklahoma City (Lost Westbrook,PG and Cp3)  4th team will be some random team  Orlando won’t jump up because they got a lottery pick from the Vucevic trade anyway and the Spurs won’t move up because they still have Derozan"
this just in: James Harden is really fucking good
James “Adolf Hitler “ Harden
"Curry deserves all the credit more so than KD, because Curry and Draymond were the LEADERS of that team, leadership men’s s a lot outside of the stat line. Also Curry and Kyrie were the last great All star guards to be on the finals, besides Lowry of course who is also a great leader. Before that we have to go back to Tony Parker and Jason Kidd, this goes to show how’s difficult is to make it to the final when led by a small guard as your best player. Nash couldn’t do it, AI almost did. Kobe is a big guard who can play forward, as is Dwayne. This is why Curry and Dame get a pass more so than KD, Lebron, Giannis or Embiid. Also Dame loses series where he is expected to lose, he has also won when he wasn’t suppose to.  The player who doesn’t get enough criticism in my book is Porzingis who has fell off which can be chalked up to injuries, but still. Demand Derozan use to be talked about with Klay, PG and Jimmy. Jimmy redeemed himself from losing that series up 2-0 on the Celtics after rondo got hurt, thanks to his finals run, but now his performance this series another disappointment, even as the underdog. Kawhis leadership in the clutch, as well as James Harden. Russ Westbrook only gets triple double in the regular season has made 1 second round appearance since KD departure. Brandon Brandon Ingram with a third straight season of leading his team to the lottery. Jayson Tatum is #1, Jaylen Brown is second fiddle, that convo is over."
I've seen it with James Harden so many years. Amazing game 1s but as a series goes on defenses figure 1 star teams out
"Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Jaylen Brown made the All Star game over Trae. Julius is a Forward."
"In order to make the top 5, you have to rate as equal to or better than Durant, Curry, Jokic, Harden, Giannis, James… and possibly more. Who are you removing?"
He knows he’s teammates with James Harden right?
A better version of James Harden. Which is an all time great.
"Jayson Tatum, Deuce, Marcus Smart, James Harden, and Luka Doncic."
Says a fan of a team that had James Harden flop his way to #1 on the free throw leaderboard for 6 straight seasons
Absolutely robbed. Also how is KD saying thats not basketball when he literally plays with James Harden ??
You have James Harden in your lineup man - can hardly talk.
Those 2 flops against James Harden a few years ago is easily one of the all time flops
James Harden has been criminally underused the past few minutes
JAMES HARDEN I FUCKING LOVE YOU
"As someone who obviously has no bias here, I don't think James Harden gets too many free throws at all."
Fuck James Harden and every team he joins. He's the reason a whole new generation of players is flopping and foul baiting right as they join the league. Fucking weak ugly bitch.
James harden is so damn boring
"You know what, I’m about to say it: James Harden is the best player on the nets"
James Harden and KD ain’t missing. I’ll stop my Celtics slander if they steal this game.
"James harden got two moves, drive and smack the ball into your hands or shoot the three and fall down"
James harden needs to go rocket mode
James Harden is on the Nets lol
How can JVG seriously argue about flopping and fouls regarding the team opposite of James literally hitler Harden?
I don’t think there’s any other HOF player that I’ve hated watching as much as James harden.
Not James Harden that's for sure
"Because I'm not a fan of light skinned James harden, the hawks aren't that good and they're going to get absolutely assblasted by Philly"
Honestly they might as well mercy rule this at the half. I'm ready to sob myself to sleep into my James Harden body pillow.
Just James Harden Things.
James Harden the single reason why Nets are in this game rn. Damn everyone is disappearing
James Harden is a calming force
james fucking harden baby. on fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Let James Harden drop 100 tonight fuck it
"Holy shit, we have James Harden."
James Harden wants to score today
We’ve got Rockets Legend James Harden tonight. O/U 15 FTs?
James Harden.
Lol we'd have 6 FTs if our players were named James Harden
Shrug. Superstars like James Harden don’t become available often.   Two years ago the Raptors won because they traded for one. The Lakers won last year because they traded for one. The Nets may win this year because they traded for one. Sometimes you need to go all in.
"&gt; Clips will let him run the team  Haven't they already let him do that basically? If he tells them he'll only re-sign if they can improve the team, what moves do they have? We saw this with James Harden in Houston, where he told them to get him Westbrook, and when it didn't work out he wasn't interested in sticking around to figure something else out, not when just bailing to a new situation was so much easier.  I know everyone thinks the most important thing for Kawhi is to just be in SoCal, but we really don't know if that's true. Two years ago before he'd ever played for his hometown team, sure, it was apparently what he wanted most. But he also wanted to win, and reportedly refused to sign with the Clippers unless they added PG to make them an immediate contender. If he doesn't think they're contenders this summer will he still want to stay on a team that's apparently heading south? Maybe, but it's far from a guarantee."
"It applied to James Harden on a lot of those Rockets teams. We were best when we had another hyper-efficient guard (CP3) to carry the offense when Harden was out.  It's not that these guys magically make their teammates worse when they're off the floor, it's that the rosters are constructed to complement their skillsets, and that means having a lot of guys who excel at things that aren't enough to run a high-level NBA offense without that star to orbit around."
"Theoretically any team is LeBron James away from being title contenders. Other than that you could insert a guy like Giannis, Curry, Harden, Luka or Jokic into most teams that have like one and a half All-Stars on their squad and they'd become title contenders. Most teams lack a premier offensive, playmaking superstar which has been the mold of championship DNA ever since the Big 3 Heat stepped on the court for the first time. Without double-checking I'd say 15-20 teams lack one of these guys to be contenders. Single player impact is incredibly high in Basketball but even higher in the NBA."
I think they do win it the disrespect James Harden gets is insane
Not James Harden that's for sure
"Not James harden, that's for sure."
"If the answer is no: That's why the Heat didn't make the James Harden trade. We wouldn't have won a championship, and we'd have absolutely no future at all. Jimmy and Harden are 31 and will likely start declining soon, and that leaves the Heat two years from now capped out, with no picks, and the only young asset to build around being Bam."
"I’ll take James Harden over all 4 players combined.  The picks wouldn’t matter because you know, you have fucking James Harden.  Besides, how has not doing that trade gone for the Heat?"
"I don't see how people think the Nets beat Philly, I really don't understand we agree on take 2  James Harden cant be the Finals MVP if he does not make the finals but they are a good team and ECF bound"
but youre getting james fucking harden
* People don't realize how OP the Nets are yet and they're gonna stomp not losing more than 1 game in any series en route to a title * I too agree that the Clips comeback and make the WCF * James Harden wins Finals MVP
Thats cheap for a better version of James Harden
I mean the bubble is like a 20 game sample size. It’s hardly an indicator that Herro projects to be enough of a contributor to warrant not including him in trade talks for James fucking Harden.  It’s not like Herro is 6”6 240 with a 40” vertical. He’s always going to be  limited by his frame and athleticism and while he has proven he can successfully score at the NBA level he does so inefficiently and often times outside the confines of the offense.
"I read your comment brother, ""it is pretty damn likely"" the stars align and he sweeps the 2nd greatest shooting guard of all time, then beats the best sf ever a top 4 sg and an all-star pf who was previously the best player on a separate team.  Are we comparing lukas mavs career to dirks? We gotta do alot of what ifs and hypotheticallys to even have the conversation this early. Regular season stats don't mean much my dude.  &gt;Luka is looking like the type of dude who's gonna win multiple championships and multiple MVPs. And again, yes, I am quite aware that hasn't happened yet. Stop saying that like it means anything, and stop being condescending  Good lord lmao, All I know is Kevin durant was unreal and could never win until he joined 73 win warriors, harden was the best player for like 4 years and never could win, nothing is likely, lebron James never won until he LEFT the cavs his og team.  Do you understand the conversation we are having? Just chill, luka will show us or he won't. But to speculate multiple rings is a joke.  I think he could but do u understand how absurd the conversation is right now?"
"Tatum took a game off the Nets WITH JAMES HARDEN basically by himself, why can't Giannis at least make it competitive? Khris Middleton is a hell of a lot better than the Celtics second best healthy player was too."
"Interesting you bring up the Houston Rockets taking the Warriors to 7, when even James Harden had to leave the Rockets to form a Superteam himself.   The Bucks remind me of the Rockets of the East right now with the Nets being the Prime KD Warriors of the East. The Bucks are still hopeless, that current Bucks team is not going anywhere."
"No one on this sub was. This sub told me the Bucks are indisputably a better team than they were last year because they beat Miami this year. They told me this was going to be a great series. They told me the Bucks were only a regular season team in the past and now they are a playoff team. Imagine if the result is the same, with them actually being a worse team than they were (at the regular season statistics show) and the fact that Miami was a much worse team this year that couldn’t stay healthy is actually valid, and the Nets sweep the Bucks without James Harden, while the Celtics won a game when they had Harden and the Celtics were without their second star and leading scorer. Is it possible, that though the Nets are a good team and hard to slow down, that the Bucks are actually worse than they’ve been and that the regular season stats that say they are significantly worse defensively could actually still be true in the playoffs?"
The Nets have too much firepower. KD is like the perfect scoring machine. At this rate the Bucks might get swept by Brooklyn without James Harden.
"I don’t know, is trading James Harden to the rockets a bad trade?"
James Harden is the best player in the league since 2019
Who else? I wouldn't mind harden or pg getting one. Being ringless hurts their legacies and they're such good players that ran into the buzz saws of golden state and LeBron James
James Harden is better than Steph Curry
Taking out The Nets and James Harden will be the ultimate anime comeback
I said at the beginning of last season when they put the team together nobody would stop them outside of possibly a Denver team if MPJ exploded into superstar status. The lakers as currently constructed had a 1 year window and luckily they hit it. All this was before the James harden addition and obviously the Murray ACL tear as well lol.
Don’t tell that to sixers fans. They didn’t wanna trade Ben Simmons for James Harden
"I kept trying to tell people fans were just trying to hype themselves up into thinking anyone has a chance against the Nets. People would say ""oh they don't have a rim protector"", MF you really out here thinking you need defense when you have KD, Harden, and Kyrie?   People were really out here convincing themselves Giannis, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday were gonna compete against Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Got me fucked up.  I will say one thing I was wrong about, I said the Bucks have a chance if one of the big 3 gets injured but right now it's looking like that's not even true."
You’re just a hater bro y’all so quick to hate on harden but kd did the same thing. James harden will go down as one of the greatest to ever do it.
"Wow, this tells a lot about the game. I am just glad we have fucking Mike Jordan James Harden, long for Mike James."
I’m a Lakers fan who purchased half season Clipper tickets last season because I wanted to see good basketball at an affordable price. Kawhi did not disappoint. The game last season when James Harden hit that step back 3 and made Pat Bev/PG run into each other.. I thought the Rockets had it in the bag and then Kawhi won the game in the clutch. The guy is unreal.
"When Marks got hired Brook Lopez and Thad Young were their best players. Traded Young for Caris, traded Lopez for DLo. Drafted Jarret Allen. Signed spencer. Hired Atkinson. Made it a desire place for Kyrie and KD. Then traded the young guys for Harden and still found gems like Mike James and Claxton. This maybe considered a superteam but they built their way into this team. Sean Marks is one of the best GMs"
Nets fans and others have been up and down on him all year. He came through hard this series. When harden went down he put in mike James quickly and his ball handling was huge for us.   I think most coaches might’ve stuck with Deandre too. He benched him early and managed that situation very well. He’s been amazing all year we’ve been winning with 1 of the big 3 like 65% of the time and scrubs.
Fuck we are struggling with Trae Young. No way we stop James Fucking Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie shiit
"This is without James Harden twice? Watf, hand them the trophy now!"
James Harden and role players is a second round playoff team.
Hahahaha good one. I almost laughed. And if James Harden wasn’t injured we might be winning by 90 instead of 40
Nets are missing James Harden and Jeff Green lol.   Injury doesn't excuse why's occured thus far
James Harden?
You're forgetting an MVP player in James Harden.
I'm gonna watch this game and try to ignore the fact that a team who had James Harden sitting ass blasted the Bucks
James Harden is 6'5 though like 5'11 folks can throw this right back up at him.
"I was bummed to see us lose obviously, but I was still alright with it because of the injuries and our guys still playing hard. Plus, Tatum and Brown aren't even in their true primes yet anyway.  What the Bucks have done so far these 2 games against a James Harden-less Nets team is just... There's not really any proper words, and I cannot imagine how Bucks fans must feel right now."
"No Harden. Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James all putting in good minutes. Defense has taken a 180 since the beginning of the season. Kyrie has taken a step forward and is playing the best basketball of his career. But y’all will say anything except give anybody on the team, including Nash, any credit at all."
"&gt;I wish I could just run -run and -7th feet run and just dunk. Like, that takes no skill at all. Heh. I gotta actually know how to play basketball and HAVE SKILL, you know? I'll take that any day   -[James Harden](https://twitter.com/NBAMemes/status/1402070033023578112)"
"&gt; Oh another new York sports fan dreaming of other people crying, was that part of this same thread where I mentioned that or was it somewhere else?   You’re literally on a sports subreddit after your team got clapped whining about how it’s unfair the nets are this stack.   This is literally what no pussy dues to a mfer.  &gt; 3 in a week, weird ass ny sports fans seem to be real fucking obsessed with tears.   See above.  &gt; Also, complaining to me about unoriginal insults and using ""deer"" jokes repetitively shows you're not the sharpest tool.   I don’t want to waste time thinking of good insults for a team that’s about to be swept. Maybe if you could think of a little something more then glory holes I’ll entertain you.   &gt;”Big baller risky move"", I can't even say anything about that it speaks for itself, and what risk is there to trading for James Harden?  I mean if that’s what you thought I was talking about then by all means keep acting like a baby.  But you’re acting like we didn’t get KD when it was fully possible he would never be able to fully recover. Y’all literally clowned us for how dumb you thought the trade was and now you’re crying about how it’s lead to the beast of the east."
So many people on this sub can't wait to potentially slander James Harden for being injured during the Nets championship run.  We already had the Nets are better without Harden thread.  Can't wait for more takes like this.
"Bucks fans on the Bucks sub really sat there, watched this entire game without James Harden, and said to themselves ""yeah, we can take 4 of the next 5 against this team"" 😂😂😂"
With James Harden and Jeff Green especially likely coming back if the Nets do drop and are in a pinch?
"Oh another new York sports fan dreaming of other people crying, was that part of this same thread where I mentioned that or was it somewhere else? 3 in a week, weird ass ny sports fans seem to be real fucking obsessed with tears. Also, complaining to me about unoriginal insults and using ""deer"" jokes repetitively shows you're not the sharpest tool. ""Big baller risky move"", I can't even say anything about that it speaks for itself, and what risk is there to trading for James Harden?"
James Harden and half the bucks team have the same stat line
[James Harden absolutely feasting tonight.](https://youtu.be/gThoOuKlUhM?t=48)
Here's a scary thought: if not for a freak illness this team could have LaMarcus Aldridge at the 5 and if not for a freak ACL tear they also would have Spencer Dinwiddie in the line-up. Oh and James Harden is in street clothes on the bench.
"Luka is about as pass first as Harden is. Which you see he is willing to pass but then when you factor in the ridiculous shots they take, then pass first seems kinda silly. Chris Paul is pass first, Lebron James is pass first. Doncic and Harden are just great passers with a great basketball IQ, not pass first."
The Nets WITHOUT James Harden are NOT a Superteam
"Mike ""James"" Harden"
Yes James Harden has never been great against a good team not like he had a 3-2 lead on a way better team in 2018 or anything
"Mike James ""Harden"""
James Harden looking like Ip Man lmao
Here i was hoping for a good series thinking James Harden going down would tip it to the Bucks too easily... lololololol
James Harden looking like a chef lol
"Down ~30 points and soon to be down 0-2 to a Nets team without James mother fucking Harden.   Nets are still a great team without him, but this has been a fucking pathetic showing by the Bucks tonight.  This is frustrating to watch as a neutral fan, idk how Bucks fans must be feeling rn"
"“Wish i could just be 7 ft, run and dunk”  — James Harden"
LOL what do you even say at this point? all of this without james fucking harden. I thought the nets were favorites but this is just unbelieveable
And this is WITHOUT James Edward Harden
"This is genuinely one of the most pathetic displays from a team thought to be a contender I’ve ever seen in ANY sport. Not many people really thought Milwaukee would win the series, but they were supposed to be a genuine competitor. No James Harden, and the game is over in the second quarter? Unreal. They had better stop panicking in game three"
Mike Van Vleet James Harden
"“Wish i could just be 7 ft, run and dunk”  — James Harden"
"The clippers series there were clear outliers that were east to see changing. Mavs were fuck you hot from 3 and playing at an unsustainable pace. Meanwhile the clippers actually looked good.   I’m not gonna pretend I thought the clippers were gonna win that series when they were down 0-2, but I definitely didn’t think the series was over. Bucks look like pure shit and have a history of frauding it up in the playoffs. The nets don’t even have James fucking harden and are getting slapped around by 85 year old Blake griffin.   I hope I’m wrong because I absolutely despise kyrie as a basketball figure but the bucks are cooked. Shit is embarrassing. Giannis reputation might never recover if it stays like this."

"inb4 James ""Patrick Ewing"" Harden"
"lakers last year was clearly a superteam as well, dont see anyone said a thing, 2 top 5 players in the league as a duo, filled with quality and experienced dudes signed for minimums. Like i ain't even protecting for Nets rn they playing without james harden"
"But it just looks like such a tall order nabbing 4 games from this team...  So many other teams are struggling with injuries but with the Nets is like “oh look MVP Harden goes down in the first minute! *yaaaawn*... looks like MVP KD gonna get deep minutes.”  And then you got one of the best shooters in the league with Harris, Blake Griffin and his Benjamin Buttoning knees, and even Mike James, who’s playing as well as how Dennis Schroeder thinks he’s playing.   And fucking Kyrie Irving balling out like every bucket he makes kills one of his enemies."
Friendly reminder that James Harden isn’t playing.
"Hahaha Blake griffin ? The guy they said wasn’t a difference maker. James harden ? The guy who isn’t even playing. More like one superstar and another player people don’t even respect enough to put in their top 10 and a supporting cast of bench players n a euro league star. This ain’t no super team vs bucks. When harden is in the lineup, then you have a point."
"I wouldn’t even be *that* mad if it were just Kyrie and KD. Sure, neither of them were drafted or developed by BKN and only chose it as a NY market, but knowing they have James Harden of all people just sitting on the bench too, disgusting."
They’re beating the brakes off one of the best teams in the league while James fucking Harden just chilling in street clothes
James Harden has played 45 seconds this series. Blake was a buyout player. I guess that don’t fit the narrative.
"I am SHOCKED that a team with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Blake Griffin is moonwalking to the NBA finals"
"What the hell, Bucks? The Nets don't even have James Harden out there. What a shitshow."
Imagine if the Bucks went all in on James Harden or Chris Paul instead of holding on to Khris Middleton lmao.
"This Nets team currently is without James Harden they are not better than KDWarriors, its not a Superteam and it won't be a cakewalk( This is without Harden)"
"giannis should give his 2019 MVP to harden at center court  i'm sorry james, I believe they gave me your award by accident"
I want a game of Michael Jordan Poole v Mike James Harden 1v1
The fact the nets are like this without James harden is insane. The NBA should ban this type of team stacking.
"Mike James ""Harden""."
"#JAMES HARDEN NOT EVEN PLAYING. BUCKS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING???"
This series is over. They Nets are down James fucking Harden and the Bucks are down almost 30 points in the second quarter. Fire Budenholzer.
Mike James Harden
this is not a superteam they dont have james harden rn lmao. its just how good KD is. he's on another level.
I wonder what James Harden is thinking? Does this team even need me?
James Harden is the next Carson wentz.   Helped his team get a high seed but injured while they win a chip 🤣
We had to play against James Harden.
James Harden is our most important player. The offense is night and day with James off the floor vs him on the floor.
"Who’s more exposed here, bucks or James harden?"
Mike James is the new James Harden.
Imagine if this team we are watching right now had James Harden and LaMarcus Aldridge lmao
Can the Nets just redistribute James Harden to the community? It’s only fair
Cs won one game against this nets squad with James harden. Giannis needs to not get swept
...and that's without James Harden
"Imagine telling someone in 2015 that Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Blake Griffin would eventually all be on the same team"
"Could It maybe, possibly be the Nets for James Harden?"
"This team is missing James Harden and LMA, let that sink in"
Why is James Harden dressed like a cult leader?
"The Nets are MISSING James Harden, lol"
To be fair to Milwaukee there’s only like 60 games of film of the nets without James Harden.
"In no way do you acquire James Harden mid season and become a weaker team, but oh well, I’ve said my peace. Enjoy your ring"
"Are you joking? The team worked for it for half a decade after the Paul Pierce trade shit show that left our team in the depths of hell. We built it from the bottom up to build a foundation of young talent and a desirable organization for players to come to. We then were able to trade two of those homegrown young players for James Harden. Give me a break, we sat through a 12-70 season and have never been to an ECF in nearly 20 years. Not to mention nearly every team that has won a finals since the Celtics in 08 has been a super team."
These guys have James Harden on the sidelines. 😂😂😂
Lmao and this team has James Harden sitting on the bench. Shits not fair
Reminder: Nephews thought the Bucks would challenge the Nets without James Harden
This shit is bad for basketball. They don’t even have James Harden
"The Nets pregame:   &gt;“You know they say all teams are created equal, but you look at me and you look at the Bucks, and you can see that statement is not true! See normally, if you go one-on-one with another basketball team, you got a fifty-fifty chance of winning. But I’m a genetic FREAK, and I’m not normal. So you got a 25 percent at BEST at beat me! And then you add James Harden to the mix? You the chances of winning drastic go down!”"
The nets are so unfair.  What team can lose a James Harden and still be favorites to win their division?
"Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers? That's cool and all, but we have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and that handsome fellow James Harden on the bench."
This legitimately gave me more confidence in the win that hearing James Harden upgraded to doubtful
that wasn't even as bad lol  You have James Harden who played 46 minutes on an injured leg. Giannis who is in contention for the most dominant player in the league gets a switch on him. And the motherfucker takes a midrange fadeway...
The MVP should be able to score on a one leg James Harden though
James Harden is 99th percentile of skill too
I just can't believe the Nets won while playing an obviously slowed and not ready to be back from injury James Harden for almost he entire game. The Bucks are not real contenders.
"""What a tough win, man. They've got great players there. Middleton, Jrue, and Brook Lopez.""  - James Harden after playing hobbled for 46 minutes"
"...James Harden is 6'5"". That is 99th percentile. That quote lacks any type of perspective. He wouldn't be in the league if he was 5'8"""
"They put Jrue on him. If it's Mike James, you can get away with Lopez or letting Giannis be there as the free safety.   Having Harden changes your defensive scheme by quite a bit"
"You think playing him when hes so injured he couldn't even score 10 fucking points, as james harden, is going to help him in any way? And yes. You ARE a bandwagon fan. Kyrie and lebron are my two favorite players and I'm not out here simping for either of them or rocking a lakers or nets flair. Look that word up bro lmao. Tell me how it doesnt apply to you."
Or you trap and force the ball out of KDs hand.  Let someone else beat you like idk James Harden on half a hamstring.
Game on the line. Giannis is posting up James harden. A defender comes to help but James waves him off cause he’s banking on Giannis to make the wrong move.    Giannis does a fadeaway on the baseline    Smfh
Exactly. There’s a difference between James Harden missing shots and Mike James missing shots.
Mike   Giannis taking a fadeaway on a 1 legged james harden is an all time dumb play but Bud literally played giannis 4 less minutes than harden smh
"someone please put ""behind 5 pts from James Harden"" as the player featured in the PGT title lmao"
His presence on the floor matters it’s still James harden a top 25 player ever
James Harden really just played a whole game without the RT button and won
James Harden clutched his hamstring so Jeff Green could walk.
Just having another ballhandler and someone on the court that you need to stick to was big. He was shooting awful but he's still James Harden and they had Jrue glued to him all game
Yea lol you should have seen the game thread and twitter people were on his ass  Even though he shot like shit it was either him or like Mike James since both Harris and Shamet were bad too  Also he provided playmaking and leadership Harden was pivotal to that 3rd quarter run
This is the most fun I've had watching someone play basketball probably since 2018 James Harden
"He was still crucial for his playmaking work though. I love Mike James, but he isn't better than 50% of James Harden."
For some reason Bud had them playing single coverage on a supernova KD so they could keep a body on James Harden???
We deserve literally every single comment in this thread.  Bud and Giannis with low IQ shit cost us a game we were gift wrapped.  The ghost of James Harden played more than any of our starters fucking lmao
"James Harden played more minutes on a bad hamstring than Giannis did. The more you look, the worse it gets"
"Honestly Harris has been really underwhelming.  Hard to hold it against Harden though.  It probably was worth having him out there over Mike James.  He still made a lot of good passes.  He also played 45 minutes, more than any player on Milwaukee, what the fuck."
James Harden was right about Giannis
"Key play: James Harden pulling on a defender arm and pulling him down, defensive foul. NBA lmao. Should change the B to V for Vegas."
"Yeah, and when the team needed him to score and match Kevin Durant when it came down to the wire most of what he could muster were transition pullup threes and turnaround fadeaways over James Harden and his 1.25 hamstrings, both of which he bricked because he's a terrible shooter."
"No idea but this is the best game I've ever seen Durant play. No superteam teammates (but I'm sure the history books will count 1/10th of James Harden somehow), just Kevin Durant vs. the world and delivering. That floater running three he hit to bail the Nets out of the shot clock was unbelievable."
The bucks let Jeff green run through them while  James harden went 1/10 from the field and 0/8 from three and your saying it’s rigged ...?
"Bud and Giannis both shat themselves in full public view down the stretch. Bud failed to make any adjustments at all and Giannis though he could shoot...again (Bro, you're not a shooter. Just deal with it ffs).  KD with the legendary performance while being aided by legit broken down James Harden was great. The man could barely function but he can still facilitate for the other guys."
James harden and his flops had way more impact than any of us can ever imagine. Can't beat the nets and the refs
first he should demand for himself not to take a 17-foot fadeaway over the corpse of james harden
Don't disregard the gravity that Bruce Brown and the corpse of James Harden bring
But he didn’t. He took terrible shots towards the end of the game. Who tf fades on James “the corpse” Harden. Giannis should’ve backed him down but he choked. Then he fumbled a pass and choked again. Any other complaints?
"&gt;Offensively, we were just trying to find whoever James Harden was guarding. That’s who we thought we’d have the opportunity to score on.  He didn't learn from the shit he talked during that ASG"
"Bucks need to fire Bud now. How do you not have a game plan to attack Harden on defense?? Instead, let’s iso everyone else that isn’t James Harden."
"Kevin Durant might be the goat, idek anymore. This was probably _the_ greatest playoff performance, at least the most impressive.  Played all 48 minutes, a 49 point triple double to carry the corpse of James Harden and a couple of role players in a series-commanding game 5 to the win? *Sheesh*  I'm just happy I was here to witness history."
Like James Harden said man
"I was looking at my screen in disbelief for the last 20 minutes thinking ""There is no way the bucks screw this up. How are they looking so bad? Oh my god now the nets are up. They are really losing to Kevin Durant and the player is formerly known as James Harden. Why did Giannis just pull up for 3 like he was actually going to hit that shit? Did Middleton just hit the backboard? How can a team with this much talent look so bad?  ""  Unbelievable performance by KD but holy shit but unless the bucks come out possessed the next two games this is an all-time choke job."
HAHAHA BUCKS SCORED JUST 108 ON JAMES HARDEN WHO PLAYED 46 MINUTES ON 1 LEG
yes  James Harden was bootycheeks
"James Harden was hurt. Without him they lose, even if he was ""bootycheeks"""
"Bad bad coaching in the second half and KD just feasted, he's an all time great.  On the other hand, James Harden will never be an all time great.  The Bucks just lost the series, they were up by double figures, and then they went cold"
"Credit to James Harden for playing 45 minutes with that injury too.  He may not have played well, but gotta give him credit for getting out there."
KD with a godlike performance jesus christ.  Harden probably ended up deserving to be out there over a guy like Mike James.   Harden playing 45.5 minutes with a hamstring injury while Giannis played 41 minutes perfectly healthy is fucking embarrassing.
bucks really choked..... badly need a new coach.  How u gonna give up a lead and lose without kyrie and james harden scoring 5 points
"Fun to watch James Harden play 1 on 1 with Kenny Mauer down the stretch!  But seriously, KD is a monster."
"With a chance to take the lead, time on the clock, giannis gets James harden on the iso and settles for a fucking fadeaway"
"There's absolutely zero excuse for Budenholzer to not have his entire offensive game plan tailored around attacking a player who is coming off an injury, out of shape, rusty and literally known for not expending energy on the defensive end.  Chris Paul would've attacked James Harden so many times on the defensive end that he would've forced Nash to take him off the floor."
"I can't believe the Nets are about to win. Also, why the hell did James Harden play so much??"
i think james harden has a nice butt
imagine being giannis and taking a fadeaway jumper instead of driving to the net when james harden calls off a double team and chooses to guard you one on one
"This isn’t a super team right now , James harden is just a corpse out there and Kyrie is dead wtf are you talking bout"
I don't think James Harden will play this badly again but I am not sure if Jeff Green and Blake Griffin can keep shooting like that either.
it’s james harden he gets any call he wants
Nah fuck that James harden put em up 2 with the worst type of play
Fuck best player in the league. How many people on planet earth are better at anything than KD is at basketball?? Dude is a fucking assassin.  The Bucks gave KD their best shot so he laughed and asked James Harden to point shave too. Just to make it interesting. Still wasn’t enough.
Post Game Thread should be titled “The Brooklyn Nets beat the Milwaukee Bucks with a triple single by James Harden”.
bro James harden needs to shut the fuck up he has 5 points💀
**James Harden quote**
James Harden hyping up the crowd after sending Giannis to the line says all you need to know 🤦‍♂️
Nets won w a bitch made play by James harden. That is all. Y’all didn’t deserve that shit
James Harden has 4 points and they are guarding him like it's 2018 Harden
"James Harden is putting on a James Harden Playoff Special.  1-10 from the field, including 0-8 from 3."
"james harden step back 3 pointer depend on his posterior chain muscles, and since his hamstring is hurt, he can't make those."
James harden just stands there with the ball. SMH.
James Harden was as bad as Kevin Durant was great
"Harden hooked brook lopez, knocked himself down to the ground, and was rewarded with two huge FTs at the end of a massive game.  This is the NBA.  Fuck James Harden.  Biggest pussy in the league"
"IF anyone other than James Harden or Joe Harris on the Nets shoots it, they're pretty much making it tonight. KD has been unreal."
People don’t realize that James Harden quote led to that turnaround jumper by Giannis   \#Chess
Bucks absolutely refuse to put James Harden in any action this might be the worst shit I’ve ever witnessed if they do lose.
You have a 7 foot tall oaf in brook lopez standing on the 3 point line instead of posting up James harden
Ok I understand wanting to give the ball to your best player.   But how about putting James Harden in some action.   Jesus Christ. I hate the Bucks.
James Harden manages to always “get wrapped up” w players. Almost like he does it on purpose.
james harden the master baiter
How can anyone be a fan of James Harden?  I will absolutely never understand
James Harden reminding me why I always root against any team with James Harden on it.
Fuck James Harden
"Ah yes, known tough defender James Harden."
Fuck James harden lmao
I’m convinced that NBA refs get discounts at any strip club James Harden goes to. That’s the only explanation.
"James Harden getting rewarded for non-basketball plays, what else is new?"
I don't think I can full articulate just how much respect I've lost for Steve Nash.  That he has allowed James Harden to ruin this game for the Nets is shocking
Fuck James Harden
James Harden. Doing the ONLY thing he knows how to do. Draw fouls. Plz be overturned. This isn't soccer James.
James “fatass” Harden has to rely on the Bucks being trash 😹😹😹😹 this is your mvp?
40% harden is still 10x better than 100% mike james
James Harden is an embarrassment to the game of basketball
"No way did Giannis Antetokounmpo just settle for a fade-away against an injured James Harden? Nope, my eyes are deceiving because that just doesn't make fucking sense."
"James"" Elite post defender"" Harden"
Giannis really took a fadeaway with James “can’t run” Harden on him lol that’s a major L
Flopping James Harden
A Giannis turnaround jumper with James Harden on him is just cosmically terrible
How are you gonna shoot a fadeaway jumper as a 6’11 poor shooter posting up against James harden
Rain or shine James Harden can flop
"""*Oh yeah, I remember how to get foul calls.*"" - James Harden"
why settle for a turn around jumper against james harden there?  Just dumb
James Harden is Don Cheadle with a beard
I did not just watch Giannis take a fadeaway middy on James Harden. Fuckin yikes.
"I mean no one wants to miss James Harden instead of Hasheem Thabeet, right?  It’s the same argument. Both types of players are valuable."
"It's crazy to realize this Hawks team is not even full strength. Missing some nice pieces. No matter what happens in this series, it's nothing but love for Atlanta fans. Fuck James Harden, Blake Griffin, and Mike Dunleavy."
"&gt;… Paul George had some words on the play after the game, saying it was “a bad shot.” r/NBA, no surprise, hates Paul George. Why is that? He switched teams, a damning sin to r/NBA (unless it’s to the Lakers or Raptors, in which case force your way there by all means.) His wife also used to be a stripper. To r/NBA, for some reason, this is a massive point of both comedy and insults. Why? I could not tell you, I can only guess. My hypothesis is that the same people who like players because they’re white also hate any sort of “sexual degeneracy.” See Authoritarian Right on the political compass. Back to Lillard, r/NBA really started liking him after he metaphorically dunked on Paul George, a player that they hate. They started praising Lillard for being one of the more “well spoken” and “educated” players in the league. I shouldn’t have to spell that one out. They’re calling him **“one of the good ones,”** essentially. Now onto Giannis. Why do they like him so much? It could be that he won the MVP against James Harden, a player we’ve established they hate, or it could be that he’s European. Much like white players, r/NBA has a love for all European players. They think they’re tougher, scrappier, less thuggish than american players. **Again, they praise him for being “well spoken.”**Apparently, he’s one of the good ones too. Now all of this has just been conjecture. In fact, you might even be skeptical of r/NBA’s racism at this point. So let’s move on to the blatant stuff.  TL;DR Giannis is may be technically black but he’s European. He’s way better off than these overrated AAU breeds who just showboat and ruin the game of basketball. Also he’s one of the good ones."
"I applaud James Harden but wtf was Steve Nash doing. He claims that he wouldn’t put his guys’ long term outlook in danger but then proceeds to play Harden 46, 40 &amp; 53 mins.  Dude had no explosion/burst. I know the season was on the line but man, imagine if he would’ve torn his hammy or done permanent damage.  Kills me that people wanna blame him for the L’s. Dude gave it his all. Showed a ton of heart."
"I don’t know if I agree with this. I think Luka’s style of play and ability are great fits for the modern NBA.   It might sound nuts, but I think explosive athleticism (at least at this point in time) is less valuable than high IQ, shot creation, and craftiness. We’re seeing guys like Luka, Jokic, Chris Paul, and even James Harden dominate based on these things rather than elite athleticism."
"Lmao it was as close as could get with KD and 15% of a James Harden. I don’t think even Milwaukee fans would disagree they were amazingly fortunate they didn’t play a healthy Nets squad.  That’s no fault of their own, of course, and they’ve got a legitimate shot at a championship. But let’s be real."
Which I think is fine. I hated seeing KD fuck his leg up while playing injured that one time and James Harden probably shouldn't have been out there hobbling around on a bad hamstring.
James harden change his mind? Good for him tho rest that hamstring aslong as possible.
Trading James Harden for middle schoolers to own the libs
But also don’t forget who is the goat of our franchise  It’s not a guard like James Harden  If we were to draft Mobley we would have the best mentor possible lined up for him to use
"As it says in the article,  &gt; They brought in a new front office last season led by GM Troy Weaver, a longtime Thunder executive who played a key role in their great drafts in the late 2000s. Everyone knew Kevin Durant would be a superstar. But it’s easy to forget that Russell Westbrook and James Harden were controversial selections at the time. Weaver showed that he’s willing to buck consensus when he signed Jerami Grant to a massive deal in free agency last summer, a move that was widely panned but now looks brilliant."
James Harden obviously
The best player being hurt wouldn’t affect the outcome lolol.    James harden coming in fat and kyrie Irving / ad being constantly hurt along with kawhi sitting out of he stubs his toe does not take away from the fact playing through injury as a great player affects outcomes lol.
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men’s Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‘92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
"I want defenders to be able to hold their arms out horizontally lol. If a defender wants to t-pose at half court with their eyes closed, James Harden shouldn’t be able to draw a shooting foul. If a defender arm bars a player that’s obviously hitting the player ergo a foul"
"As someone who doesn't watch NBA, but is aware of it, as I keep an eye on most sports, it seems like the only NBA players that exist are Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry &amp; James Harden."
James Harden was an iron man before my guy
"You must have missed the last decade of james harden, nephew"
James Harden has withdrawn from the 12-minute news cycle of joining the 12-man Team USA.
"I mean, wouldnt the easy explanation be that they were able to get James Harden, who is unquestionably better than Kyrie and has taken over the duties as the primary ball handler, and Kyrie is their only tradeable asset and theyd be better off adding depth and/or more complementary players?"
"No media agency is going to willfully turn away clicks to report on something nuanced and genuine.   It is way easier to report on who James Harden or Ben Simmons is dating, or another Flare-up of Lavarr ball saying that the ball family in their prime could have single beat the 1992 Dream Team than it is to dissect all of the Suns shrewd player moves over the last 2 years"
FWIW James Harden tips and him and his crew are respectful to restaurant employees
"Fultz was pretty consensus #1, but if anything, there were WAY bigger fit concerns between Fultz/Simmons than there ever would have been with Tatum/Simmons.  The Fultz comp was James Harden.  So the concern was about how you fit James Harden next to Ben Simmons when they both need the ball in their hands.  In hindsight it didn't matter as Fultz didn't work out, and it further doesn't matter as Simmons is likely out the door soon as well."
.....gassed to shoot freethrows?  Hardens elimination game stats BEFORE game 7  James Harden is averaging  23.8 PPG - 38% FG - 25% 3PT - 6.7 TOV in his last 6 elimination games
"Via Nets Wire:  &gt; Sullivan is the author of “Can’t Knock the Hustle: Inside the Season of Protest, Pandemic, and Progress with the Brooklyn Nets’ Superstars of Tomorrow,” which released on Tuesday. In a conversation with our friends from Celtics Wire on their podcast, Celtics Lab, Sullivan said that Nets ownership was unhappy with Irving over his midseason “pause,” and that Irving could be available for the right offer.  &gt; Celtics Lab: “Kyrie Irving has a player option for ’22-’23. Kevin Durant has a player option for ’22-’23, and James Harden has a player option for ’22-’23. Do you think that the Brooklyn Nets win a championship in, let’s say the next five years, and is it with that big three?”  &gt;Matt Sullivan: “Let me give you guys a little news, I’m not sure that’s been out there. I’ve heard that Nets ownership was quite upset with Kyrie’s ‘pause,’ especially that maskless party that turned his psuedo-paternity leave into more like a COVID suspension. And in the last week I’ve heard rumblings – whispers, really, because cracking the Nets is kind of like breaking into the Kremlin, that Brooklyn GM Sean Marks would maybe, possibly, apparently be willing to at least listen to a trade offer for Kyrie this offseason.  &gt;Now, I’m not sure what the market for Kyrie is at this point. It’s not like Ben Simmons giving you the headache on the court. It’s that complex personality that comes from off the court. I think it’s been annoying some people in the franchise. I can’t speak to his teammates, who obviously want to play with one of the world’s best and get him back there.”"
Remember when James Harden shit in his pants??
"It's a bit of a technicality, but you could argue Harden counts because he isn't the best player with the name James (LeBron)"
1. KD  2. James Harden  3. Kyries Irving  4. Pat Beverly.   The four shittiest players in the NBA in order.
"and Jesus was violating Roman law. Just like your example, mine has no connection whatsoever to the bullshit Trae Young and James Harden pull."
He also set a screen for someone which James harden has also never done
Devin Booker just did what James Harden never could. He won WCF games with Chris Paul out. Why is nobody talking about this?
"the nets traded for james harden which seemed like a guarantee for a title but kyrie/kd/harden we’re all hurt at some point in the season and eventually 2/3 got hurt in the playoffs so they got taken care of by a healthier bucks squad.  the 6ers were the one seed and looked good in the regular season but their lack of playmaking and shooting came back to bite them in the ass vs an atlanta squad with shooting and playmaking + some pretty good rebounders. also ben simmons had the worst 2 weeks  of basketball games in his life, probably.   the heat, even though they were the surprise finals team of last year, still massively disappointed as they suffered from the quick finals turn around -&gt; regular season + injuries and covid throughout the year ruining any flow to the team.   everyone else out east pretty much followed the script we expected them to follow. jayson tatum went nuclear and took a game off the nets in the first round by scoring 50 and the wizards took a game off the 6ers in similar fashion."
James Harden having a heart attack cuz he’s not clutch like chris Paul
Why is he the villain and not James Harden?
James Harden would've chucked at three. Devin Booker is the mid-range King
devin booker &gt; james harden
"lol so weak, I hate that james harden bullshit"
Found guilty of making James Harden realize he couldn’t win with those cats
Devin “James Harden” Booker
Players are too used to doing it for all players not named James Harden
How about a rule against whatever James Harden does to get to the free throw line.
