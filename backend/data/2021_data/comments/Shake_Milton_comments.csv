shake milton
I thought Philly should start Shake Milton over Tobias Harris
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
His backup is basically Shake Milton who definitely doesn't suck so that's probably not the case.
Shake Milton is too good of a name to be abbreviated
"I think he's just using grant as an example. With more teams, there would be more opportunities for guys who wouldn't have had those opportunities without expansion.  Let's pretend that they bring in 2 expansion teams next year and shake milton is a starter and primary scorer for one of those teams and was putting up decent counting numbers on a bad team. In theory,  he'd be a player in the situation op was talking about"
"&gt; What injuries have slowed Simmons down this season?  He is clearly still bothered by his knee, he sat out a couple of games with swelling in that same knee earlier in the season. You don't have to be Einstein to figure out the knee was limiting him on the court but also it is clear by watching him, and many others noted this in the Sixers sub, that he was favouring the leg, not being nearly as explosive nor jumping up for blocks/rebounds in situations he would normally do that kind of thing.            Even if you put his injury aside, the Sixers have been transformed into a new team in terms of the coaching staff and their FO. The way Doc is utilising Ben is not the same as the way Brett Brown did. Doc has openly stated he doesn't care about his scoring that he's using him as a playmaker, likely understanding that to be a number two guy in terms of scoring that you have to be an all court scorer - post ups, mid range, threes. Ben isn't close to this kind of scorer right now but that doesn't concern Doc because he's also got a rejuvenated Tobias (47% from 3), a highly efficient perimeter scorer in Seth Curry (52% from 3) and a dynamic bench scorer in Shake Milton to support the main guy in Joel. Ben is essentially the number five scoring option on that team, he is the quintessential glue guy. Draymond was this player in 2015 and 2016 and was arguably the second most important player for the Warriors in this period. He doesn't have to score, he's the one setting guys up with his gravity on drives, defenses collapse on him and he routinely dishes out to wide open three point shooters. It's why he's one of the league leaders in assists that lead to three point field goals. He is at career lows in field goal attempts so this backs up that theory.                   &gt; Isn't something I've heard.                   Go to the Sixers sub whenever Ben has a bad game, you'll hear it plenty..."
I'd definitely agree if Shake Milton didn't exist haha.
the only shake remaining in his life is Milton
"Sixers connections to the g league are deep: Robert Covington spent a full season in the g league, Danny Green hung around there a couple months too.  Shake Milton putting up 15 a game this year after spending most of two seasons down in Delaware iirc."
Right now Shake Milton
The league literally forced them to play with 7 players. They were missing Jojo and Simmons multiple games along with Shake Milton.  They couldn't play do to contact tracing.
"Sixers preferred having in season flexibility with the MLE for the buyout market.   Had essentially no cap space and while he was definitely good, don‚Äôt think he really improves the team all that much one way or another.   Shake Milton is under contract for years cheap, and it‚Äôs more worth it to give him mins to develop. Korkmaz, while extremely limited, can play a bench shooters role. Drafting Maxey, giving more mins to Thybulle, trading for Danny Green and Seth etc. also factor in.   Sixers prioritized having a bench big so they signed Dwight.   Would‚Äôve been happy with Burks back, but doesn‚Äôt change all that much"
"The Spurs were one missed Shake Milton 3 last year, from making it 23 times in a row."
"Comparing within one team to show how RAPTOR gets a little crazy:  Shake Milton, Def. On/Off RAPTOR: +7.6 Ben Simmons, Def. On/Off RAPTOR: -5.2  Sorry, but any stat that considers Shake Milton to be a significantly better defender than Ben Simmons isn't passing the eye test."
How about Shake Milton and Klay?  Obviously *Shake n Bake*.
99.9% of people don't know who Shake Milton is
"That‚Äôs what the problem is. We know that Simmons cannot be the main ball handler for a championship team, so that duty is delegated to dudes like Tobias Harris or Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz, who are simply not good enough offensive engines."
"&gt; Devonte Graham, Michell Robinson, Shake Milton, Gary Trent Jr.  Who are those? Do you mean DG, MR, SM and GTJ?"
"You‚Äôre overlooking the 2020-1 Sixers: 3x DPOY Dwight, 3x NBA Champion Danny Green, with 2x MVP (2021,2023) 3x DPOY (2021, 2023-2024) Embiid, DPOY (2022) Ben Simmons, 2025/2027 MVP and scoring leader Shake Milton, 2026/2028 MVP and 2032 MIP Tyrese Maxey, all time 3pt leader at retirement (2033) Seth Curry, and 6x Emmy-nominated James Michael Scott, OBE."
"Sixers winning this game wasn‚Äôt a surprise. An absolute elite team and anybody who disagrees haven‚Äôt been watching much Sixers basketball this season. Embiid is top two for the MVP (so far) this season and he‚Äôs not two. Ben is playing elite defense and getting his teammates involved in all aspects of the game, even without shooting jumpers (as a Sixers fan it makes me mad he hasn‚Äôt expanded his game, so slander can be made here) but if slander is made, at least acknowledge how valuable he is in other areas of the game as well. Tobias is playing arguably his best career basketball. Seth Curry is lights out and shooting career highs. Shake Milton is a 6MOTY candidate, if not front runner. Dwight Howard is adding a much needed spark in the absence of Joel when he is on the bench.   And last but not least, our commander Doc Rivers is the much needed coaching expertise our young core needed. Sixers by an absolute million and I‚Äôll see you guys in the finals.  Edit; Sixers are an elite team barring any major injuries to Ben Simmons or worse, Joel Embiid, since he is the heart and soul of this squad."
SUGA SHAKE MILTON
"I don‚Äôt think Utah has a Shake Milton, they could really use someone like SM"
"He‚Äôs been fantastic in limited minutes. The first person in Embiids career who can somewhat hold down the fort when he sits.   The Dwight/Simmons minutes look brutal (as expected) but when he runs the floor with Shake Milton there seems to be a ton of chemistry.   In an ideal scenario, he‚Äôd play about 16 MPG with Shake when Embiid and Ben take their rests   His motor for offensive rebounds and his rim protection have been awesome. The most surprising part is how he seems to be a huge locker room presence and is really committed to helping both Ben and Jo. He‚Äôs been a big part of our teams turnaround"
"Now he has Ben, Joel, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey"
We've played 17 games so far.  * Mike Scott (missed 9) * Shake Milton (missed 3) * Furkan Korkmaz (missed 12) * Matisse Thybulle (missed 3)
"Shake ""James Harden Trade Bait"" Milton on his 6moty tour rn"
Shake Milton averages 16 ppg on good efficiency and improved in every stat for 3rd straight season . Very valuable coming of the bench for 76ers .I'm not sure about him becoming a star but he is the definition of underrated literally nobody talks about him
make it 190 minutes and they‚Äôre sizably behind Tobias Harris and Shake Milton ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Agreed, but Giannis is never going to guard Embiid. Coach Bud would put him on Shake Milton in the corner"
‚ÄúProtein‚Äù Shake Milton  Not really but......maaaaayyybbbee
Danny Green and Seth Curry change things.  Shake Milton will have his nights.  Furkan can get hot.  We just have more shooting now.
Shake Milton is the best finisher on the Sixers. Finishing is not our strong point.
Shake Milton has taken a huge step
"For those non Process Trusters reading this, he‚Äôs referring to Shake Milton."
"Trade Lavine for Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton and the Sixers first has entered the chat."
"Didn't realize he was only 22 / year 3. Looking down the list into the late 2nd round, this was a damn good draft. Shake Milton, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr."
"is 2017 really deeper?   2018 is luka trae ofc but there's also JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Ayton if you go in lower tier player but still very good you get Shamet, Mikal Bridges  even the second round is  stacked w/ Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, De'vonte Graham Shake Milton or Gary Trent Jr  there's lot of work to be done but imo 2018 will be an all time great draft"
This dude just called curry and shake milton trash what a casual
"Yeah, it‚Äôs full of actual NBA players. Even real roleplayers, like Shake Milton or Donte Divicenzo. 2018 was a great year and will definitely be noteworthy with Luka playing like a future Hall of Famer and Trae, Jaren, Shai, and Sexton all playing like future All Stars. If another one of those turns into a HoF player, it‚Äôs gonna be remembered for sure."
"Sexton‚Äôs been trending way upward since the back half of the 19-20 season though, I think based on season-to-season jumps, it‚Äôs definitely just Grant and Wood in the lead rn.  I‚Äôll throw in a super-homer vote for Shake Milton tho"
Please don't leave shake Milton by himself anymore.
Brad Stevens secrit scheme: leave Shake Milton wide open
Josh Richardson of the Mavericks is an Oklahoma guy and so is Shake Milton of the Sixers. Josh might give Blake griffin a run for his money on the ‚ÄúActive‚Äù section for Oklahoma. I guess if it‚Äôs all seasons considered I‚Äôd still pick Blake but in recent years I‚Äôd argue for Josh
"Will be keeping an eye on Dort, Chris Boucher and Shake Milton this season. All three seem to have stepped their game up so well. You love to see it"
"Shake Milton, paid something like 2 mil a year as well and is averaging 25 over the last 6 games or something, on top 10 efficiency with good defence."
"Hmm as good as Dort has been he‚Äôs not really even close to Christian Wood, Jeremi Grant or Shake Milton IMO"
"Shake Milton has blown me away, I‚Äôve always been high on him but he is seriously incredible. He‚Äôs playing with so much confidence and went from being mostly a shooter off the bench to a legitimate and efficient three-level scorer. I think his ceiling is so underrated, he‚Äôs only 24 and with more minutes would have a legit chance at being a 20 ppg scorer."
Yes.   Shake Milton also averages more free throws than Tatum.
Shake Milton üò§
Ben Simmons + Danny Green or Shake Milton
Shake Milton being the next Harden? /s
Thats kinda appropriate actually considering thats where it comes from. His dad was called the Milk Man in college. Here's the full story behind his 'name'...  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/shake-milton-nickname-sixers-starting-point-guard
"Oh I don‚Äôt expect a sweep either, but Shake Milton and Austin Rivers aren‚Äôt going to make a noticeable difference. Jojo is gonna have to have a huge game."
We were a Shake Milton game winning three away from potentially keeping the streak alive.
"OK? Shake Milton is scoring way more on better efficiency than Draymond, so clearly the Shake &gt; Draymond Green. It's an utterly stupid argument, Steph has looked horrific defensively while LeBron has looked really good defensively. Steph putting up more PPG on better efficiency does not mean he's playing better."
Combo of a lot of things.   Mentally: I‚Äôm sure being in trade talks and essentially being told you‚Äôre being traded must be weird if it‚Äôs your first time  Physically: people forget he had legitimate back problems and knee surgery all in the last 12 months  Gameplan/roster: much different roster with lots of needs. New coach. Doc wants him to be the facilitator and get looks for all the added 3 point shooters. Shake Milton becoming a better player also eats up more time with the ball in his hands and more shots.   Currently averaging 12.3/9.3/8.0 with 1.5 steals and 1.0 blocks despite his struggles. He‚Äôll be fine.
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don‚Äôt see how you stop them"
Shake milton and seth curry have both been great this year anyway so maxey isn't even really needed though
Like.. Shake Milton?
Fucking Shake Milton
"Shake Milton and Jordan Clarkson are gonna be neck and neck. Also, if Lamelo stays on the bench as the 6th man lowkey he could win it too."
Shake milton

Shake milton?
3. Tobias Harris 4. Seth Curry/Shake Milton
Imagine harden being a bench player his entire career. Imagine fvv a bench player his entire career. Imagine 24 shake milton a bench player his entire career. You get where im going with this. Hes too good and too young to not improve and warrant a bigger role. He warrants a bigger role.
Where is the love for Shake Milton?
"Hmm  Philly says: Yes. Improve now and arguably later too.   Bulls say: yes. Levine by himself doesn‚Äôt get top notch return. The Sixers would on only give up Simmons in the case they were covered on the ‚Äòintangibles‚Äô end, which Lowry provides. You can argue that the first is for Simmons, and they need some type of return for Levine. Maybe a Shake Milton, Korkmaz, or Ferguson. And as far as the Bulls giving up an unprotected first, you have Lauri, Carter, Coby, and Williams. You have enough lottery picks it‚Äôs time to turn the corner and Simmons, flaws and all, does that. Odds are agaisnt a lottery pick being as good as Simmons, flaws n all   Raptors say: yes- Assuming they just continue to get worse, an unprotected first from a lottery team for 34 year old Lowry is gold and you can‚Äôt pass. And you happen to trade him to the one place where you can spin it from a PR standpoint bc he‚Äôs from Philly   This is a rarity: Great fan trade proposal"
Shake Milton
This season? Ben Simmons and Shake Milton
"Exactly, if we‚Äôre going to use initials at least make it someone important like Shake Milton"
"I told people Doc Rivers was amazing for developing players when he was still looking for a HC position last year, right after blowing a 3-1 lead. No one believed me.  Now a 24 year old Shake Milton is suddenly legit, Ben Simmons actually tries shooting 3s, Tobias is playing like an all star again, and overall, the team just looks more confident in themselves.   Also, unrelated, but Milton has a 7'0 wingspan. Goddamn lol"
Imagine Shake Milton being your second best scorer
Shake Milton
I question the validity of a stat that says Payton Prichard brings almost as much value as Jayson Tatum or that Jeff Teague is better than Marcus Smart or that Shake Milton is the second offensive player on Philly behind Seth Curry and also the second best defender.   There are so many glaring discrepancies in this stat that I doubt there should be much stock put in it.
"Okay, let's analyse that timespan then by possession:  1. Harris blows by Fultz and help is stuck with a shooter (Green and Curry) while Aaron Gordon is way too late to help because he either hesitates with Simmons at the top of the key or he reacts way too slow, could be both to me. 2. Simmons brings the ball up, Fultz tries to steal it and gets called for a reach-in. From the inbound, Curry and Embiid attack the basket with 3 guys at the rim except for Gordon who guards Simmons, but he focuses much more on the paint/ball than Simmons. 3. Simmons drives down the lane himself and kicks out to a \*wide open\* Seth Curry who hits the three. Not much here either. 4. Simmons stays in the dunker's spot for nearly the entire possession, Embiid hits the jumper. Not much here either. 5. Simmons runs up the floor, gets attention from two guys, passes to Harris who hits the 3. The attention could also have been to prevent a Simmons drive and open dunk/layup so unclear too, but probably not because of his three-point threat. 6. Simmons brings the ball down the court. At the top of the key, his man (AG again) seems more concerned with getting around the Embiid screen than a Simmons three, despite the large gap between the two. Embiid then makes a gorgeous move to dunk on Vucevic, but Simmons in the dunker's spot didn't have any three-point threat this time either. 7. Curry and Embiid in a pick and pop with Simmons in the corner. His man doesn't seem concerned with a three though, which might be because a pass out to Simmons from Curry's position would have been very risky, but he is at the edge of the paint either way. 8. Simmons isn't at the three-point line at any point in this possession. 9. Simmons drives down the court in transition, gets doubled and passes to a trailing Harris who hits the lightly contested three. 10. Simmons passes at the beginning of the shot clock but stands in the dunkers' spot until he screens for an open three for Shake Milton. 11. Simmons isn't even a part of the offense, as he crosses half court after Harris gets it to Embiid in the paint who earns free throws. 12. Embiid draws a foul early into the shot clock, no special attention for Simmons again.  So I guess you were right, as Simmons didn't get much extra attention (\*maybe\* in that 1st possession I guess) at the three-point line, but he wasn't in that position very often either. A better explanation for this (difference with previous season) would probably be that the Sixers defense got them many transition opportunities (in which Simmons does excel) and that guys like Green, Curry and Shake force guys to think about their shooting before they help out/double Embiid or a driver. Maybe you could bring a bit more to the table to support your argument than just ""lol"" next time I guess."
"Shake Milton is a homer pick, but his PPG has gone up 7, his assists have gone up, and his defense is much better. He‚Äôs got a solid argument as the third best player on the team at this point.  That said the objective pick is Christian Wood."
"Fine, Shake Milton"
shake milton
Shake Milton
"I can see how MJ and LBJ are confusing because you might think it‚Äôs Michael Jackson or Lyndon B. Johnson, but SM is obviously Shake Milton."
"Shake Milton was a problem all game and the Sixers started putting the clamps on towards the end of the fourth.  This is a very good team with the ability to go far this year with everyone on the court.   It just seems like Simmons should be more of a bully inside than he is. He hit a beautiful turnaround jumper late, creating space with his size, but he never consistently looked for it. I don't tend to keep up with teams that aren't the Grizz during the year so I'm not sure if this is a regular problem or not.   Nonetheless, gg Sixers. I'm sure the game will be competitive when we meet again in Philly."

Mmm Shake Milton has gotta pretty compelling case too
Embiid can definitely be the best player on a championship team if we‚Äôre counting offense and defense as best player.  Sixers just need another guy who can consistently drop 30 on offense.   (Shake Milton?!?‚Äô)
"Or ROMEO ""SHAKE MILTON STOPPER"" LANGFORD."
Shake Milton 6MOY
"Is it crazy to say that shake milton is the 3rd best player for the sixers?  Ben simmions defensively his impressive... but his scoring ability just looks even worse. He seriosully looks disinterested to attack the paint, he just doesn't seem to look even like ben simmions of previous years.    For your post  until seth curry comes back i would start shake milton, or just bring him off the bench but play him 30+ mintues. Ben maybe he should move to the foward poisiton, but i doubt that will change his scoring ability. He doesn't attack the rim as much anymore, and in the 4th he hinders the teams offense since he just sucks at shooting."

"Those three SMU lads are gonna have super solid careers as rotational vets--brown, ojeleye, and shake milton.  I'd take all three on the dubs in a heartbeat"
&gt; Tyrese and Shake  I prefer Maxey Milton
"Yea, that team is way better constructed. Harden/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias/Embiid with Shake Milton and Dwight coming off the bench is a more balanced team than KD/Kyrie/Harden and a bunch of G leaguers."
Shake Milton is the chosen one
Shake Milton 2 years older than Fultz
Tyler Herro gets lightly tapped on the elbow: Four point play.  Shake Milton gets an entire mans draped all over him: I think his foot was on the line
"Simmons on Durant, Danny green on Harden, Shake Milton on Kyrie"
Shake milton isn‚Äôt 36
All this to stop shake milton
"LAL Caruso was a summer league guy in 2016, Kostas picked by us and traded for Shake Milton ATL Bruno Fernando was originally picked by us and traded to ATL"
"Neither. Calling Shake Milton ""SM"" just immediately made me think of that thread."
"Shake Milton possibly, don‚Äôt see him catching Grant though"
"definitely. Apart from having Murray who's a great scorer, Porter Jr, Barton, Monte Morris, Millsap, Gary Harris, Green, PJ Dozier and Campazzo are decent or good rotation options.   Sixers have just Embiid, Simmons, Harris, Curry, Green, Shake Milton and Dwight as decent rotation guys. Then the likes of Korkmaz, Thybulle or Maxey who are way too green for the current nba  denver has 10 nba guys vs the Sixers 7"
Why is shake milton on instead of seth curry
Damn shake Milton legit Donovan heating up tho
Shake milton is a good damn player. Much improved from what I remember
Shake Milton would like a word
"Honestly, is there a single award that Sixers fan's don't feel like someone from their team shouldn't be the frontrunner for?  Tell me more about Shake Milton. . ."
Shake Milton is the clear MVP right now
Shake Milton...
"No need to be a condescending dickhead. What I said isn‚Äôt really that outlandish. Think it was actually relatively objective.   Yes, Smith was a miss. The circumstances around his situation sucked. Was high on him before the draft and would‚Äôve loved to see him actually develop. But, overall it was still a successful draft considering that year we got Shamet+the heat pick - which became our third ‚Äústar‚Äù in Tobias Harris, while also grabbing Shake Milton who is our best bench player.   Paul Reed was the 58th pick of the draft. If he can become our cheap backup, how is that not a win? We pay max deals to 3 players. We need to find value in later picks. Reed is currently averaging 21/12/2 with 2 blocks and 2 steals shooting .587/.412/.714 in the GLeague. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a fucking star, just saying we‚Äôre able to find good value.   Every team misses on stars in a draft. Hell, even your Bulls passed on SGA for Wendell Carter. Shit happens"
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he‚Äôs taken some spectacular leaps)  I‚Äôd say the last few years we‚Äôve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"Shake Milton, but the point stands, our roster was just constructed so poorly last season"
"I think Shake Milton is underrated. He's averaging 14/2/3 on 44/33/88 splits with 57% TS% and a TS+ of 97. He's a really important bench piece for y'all, and the ~~third~~ fourth highest-scoring bench player in the league, but no one talks about him."
"I‚Äôm going to sound like a little bit of a homer but Sixers have been decent recently, had Landy Shamet in a later first round pick, Shake Milton in a second round, Mattise Thybulle in the late first round, and Maxey who has looked okay so far."
"Maxey is waayyy more valuable than Nunn. Nunn will be 26 next season, he's likely in his final form as a bench spark plug. Maxey may have shown less, but he's over five years younger, that makes him more valuable. I think Precious/Maxey are basically on the same level, but Philly also have Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz, and Shake Milton (who, notably, has been putting up numbers similar to Nunn while being two years younger.) Then there's picks: Miami has given up most of their picks in trades, Philly has most of theirs and a number of potentially valuable seconds (Knicks this year, most favorable of us/Hawks/Nets in 2023, Heat 2024.) Finally, as far as filler, Heat are giving up Iggy/Olynyk, whereas the 76ers are giving up Danny Green, Mike Scott, and one of Terrance Ferguson/Tony Bradley. Those last two are a wash, solely useful for being expiring, but IMO Danny Green is a better player than either Iggy or Olynyk, and can help the Raps retool while remaining competitive."
"Philly could give young talent, Shake Milton, Maxey, the vlogger with really good defense + salary and potentially picks is a decent trade."
"I am not sure why anyone thought otherwise. We went from jrich/horford/trash version of tobias/shake as our supporting cast for Embiid/Simmons, to all star tobi, seth, danny green, shake milton, dwight as a backup.      Meanwhile the celtics lost Hayward and the best player they got back is Tristan Thompson, Kemba is only getting worse and his playstyle doesn't complement the Jays. I had the sixers above Boston in my pre-season predictions, but I didn't predict the Celtics would be this bad... I'm not complaining though."
shake milton was robbed
"Why has nobody mentioned shake Milton ? If he goes to philly that's who I would be looking for him and thybulle . Be hard to make the salaries work have to be Danny Green , mike Scott and Terrance Ferguson to even get close. Olynyk and Meyers Leonard have to go for Miami to get close too . I could see the Clippers in a three way trade Beverly Lou will and zubac ."
I'd be asking for shake Milton and what else .
"Good insight that mostly reiterates things I agree with, thanks. It's a crime that Ben gets listed as the PG so the organization never does anything to upgrade the position. Hopefully Morey is smarter about this.  The bench units were complete dumpster fires that gave up massive runs because Shake Milton missed 3 games, any Sixers fan who thinks a stretch 5 is the biggest need is delusional."
i see guys do what he did all the time and it not get called so I'm definitely pissed. it was sloppy and I wanted DJ to get the ball so this was what I'd call an awful end to watch. it reminds me of the Bubble game where we lost on the game winner by Shake Milton. inexcusable fuckup allows the other team to win on the buzzer beater. rough. lmao
"shake milton, tyrese maxey, and seth curry all take minutes at the 1-2"
"As someone that's watched them all season, they need everything to go perfectly in order for their current roster to work. They have just enough ball handling, just enough perimeter defense, and just enough shooting to be a contender on an average day, but if someone is off or a key player is out you can really see their flaws amplified. It was really evident how thin our margins were when Shake Milton being out destroyed our bench and ball handling"
That foul call made all the Sixers so sad lmao. Shake Milton looked like he'd just been forced to watch Sophie's Choice.
"I think you're underplaying other team's reliance on a few guys while overplaying the Celtics.  The Blazers only have two ballhandlers. That's pretty much it. Dame and CJ. Everyone else are just shooters or defenders or post scorers.  &gt; The Raptors just full stop have a creation problem  Lol definitely agree there  &gt; Spurs have multiple ball handlers and guards.  Guards and ball handlers sure. But who's creating for the Spurs? Keldon Johnson? For the majority of the season on the majority of plays it's just Murray and DeRozan.  &gt; Clippers still have Lou William's  Who's been pretty bad this year and even at his best was only ever a decent passer.  &gt;  the Bucks have 3 creators + other guards that can get to a shot   ... Who? Jrue has missed most of the year. The offense has just been Giannis and Middleton. Every single other player is just 3&amp;D.  &gt; Sixers have multiple ball handlers and scorers  No they don't. Shake Miltonis their third best ball handler/scorer and he's mediocre at best.  &gt; The Celtics have a broken Kemba  Who, imo, is at worst comparable to Milton/Lou/Keldon. Celtics also had Smart before he went down who's a decent creator and also comparable to the guys I just mentioned.  Yes, I 100% agree that outside of Brown and Tatum their ability to create goes down significantly, and outside of Kemba and Smart as well no one else on their team can create at all. And I'm saying that's pretty much true for a lot of teams."
Shake Milton
Shake Milton didn‚Äôt like that shit
Please comment this on my thread about the lack of highlight for Shake Milton
*laughs in Shake Milton*
"AD has only missed 7 games. You also shouldn‚Äôt ignore that earlier in the season the Sixers lost half of their  lineup due to COVID tracing to the point where it was Embiid and the 9th-15th man available. Seth Curry and Shake Milton have also been out for extended periods of times as well. Those guys obviously arent as valuable as Davis, but we lose the only players we have to run PNR"
i guess but the level of iso player isn‚Äôt available unless lavine suddenly becomes attainable   shake milton is better than anyone we could realistically acquire in that role this season
Emphasis on the last thing. You can find good fits and contracts. Shake Milton caliber names don‚Äôt grow on trees
"They'd have to find a way to make the contracts match but yeah I can't see how the Sixers don't have everything it takes to get Lowry.  Maxey, Thybulle and Shake Milton are all valuable trade pieces. Toss some picks in there and you've got a soup going."
"tatum has been out two weeks (and still suffering from covid setbacks), kemba has missed a lot of time and is finally starting to get a rythmn back, smart's out now too, JB in and out of the lineup with knee issues. Also missing a lottery pick from last year. Keep ignoring context. And yeah the shake milton I've seen sixer fans praise constantly"
"Only player injured is smart, tatum brown kemba playing and sitting nicely at 14-14. Aww no other viable options left??? Like sixers using Shake Milton in replace of Ben Simmons??????!!"
Yeah tbh I think part of it is teams still arent smart about how they attack bad defenders. I remember last year seeing all these Josh Richardson post ups vs Trae Young just fundamentally useless. It's like how teams try posting up James Harden instead of exploiting him off ball in transition and in help defense/rotations.   Think for that series I might kind of ditch Danny Green and start Shake Milton. Make Trae either guard Shake in pick and rolls or especially Seth coming off screens. Because Trae is a bad enough defender still where even for a guard he alone if you go at him right can make it significantly harder for a team to field a good defense when he's on the court.
"He is relegated to the dunkers spot for a lot of their half court sets and isn't even the primary initiator for a lot of them. It's pretty funny to see. If people think this isn't a problem, I don't know what to say. Their best half court creators are Shake Milton and Tobias Harris."
"Dear god, you acting like Shake Milton is miles ahead of him too. You acting like 54 overall picks usually become  decent role players. He was 54 for a reason at the time."
Shake Milton.
"Shake Milton was a late second round pick, and is better than Donte."
Shoutout to the player who voted Shake Milton (probably Shake himself tbh)
"Lmao I was just joking, the draft really is deep as hell. Didnt mean to try and undermine your opinion. Like shake milton, mitchell robinson, hamidou diallo, jalen brunson and devonte graham all drafted in the second round is a great pool of talent to choose from. Could be they are in situations good for them, but the skill and potential between all of them is amazing."
"I still think we matchup decently well with y'all due to being able to stick Embiid on Gobert and defend your shooters with the rest of the starters. However, we definitely need to figure out our shooting situation. Can't go against a team like the Jazz that chucks 3s and expect to beat you by shooting half as many. We were shooting 3s at a better volume earlier in the season, so hopefully Doc can figure it out. It's not like we lack shooters completely.  Our bench is also apparently hot ass without Shake Milton initiating offense, so y'all ran us off the floor during bench minutes (along with all the other West teams on our road trip)"
Shake Milton looked like someone who was gonna be vying for that award like 3 weeks ago. Kinda fell off since then
Well Sixers fans were saying Shake Milton but I think they might have different thoughts now
"Every game someone (or multiple guys)go lights out from deep against us. The perimeter defense is just not closing out and not making life difficult for shooters.   Until they can figure that out, it‚Äôs just gonna be some rough games.   Need Shake Milton back desperately to give SOMETHING from the bench.   Sucks to waste the best game of Simmons career.   Onto the next. Gg jazz fans"
? isn‚Äôt my flair [PHI] Shake Milton?
"The Jazz have the best bench I‚Äôve ever seen. Conversely, the Sixers without Shake Milton look like the worst bench I‚Äôve ever seen"
Maybe because there‚Äôs a difference between mike Conley and Joel embiid. Conley‚Äôs more comparable to us missing shake Milton
All of those Philly fans trying to hype up Shake Milton as 6MOY -- are you still feeling like he has a shot over Clarkson?
"I thought for sure I‚Äôd go back and look at the draft history and laugh my ass off at how shitty they‚Äôve done but tbh, it‚Äôs not been that bad. Not a lot of stand outs below their draft positions. Shake Milton? Maybe quickley but who knew. Ojelyeye doesn‚Äôt look that bad considering what came after him."
Both teams missing their MVP‚Äôs Mike Conley and Shake ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna slap the shit out of you‚Äô Milton
"Any team can pay a max player a max contract, it‚Äôs players overperforming their contracts that really create juggernauts.   With that in mind I‚Äôd compare the ‚Äò21 Celtics to the ‚Äò20 Sixers, we‚Äôve got a max player just not creating positive impact (not saying that as an indictment on him, but it‚Äôs the reality) and next to none of our small contracts are creating positive value (Theis, Pritchard). This year the Sixers solved a big portion of the $70mil of problems they had last year. Kemba has to be absolutely excellent on offense for us to perform with his contract, obviously we could also get positive value from any of our - what, - 10? young players, we could have a Shake Milton hiding on our bench, but in general the value of getting a role player from a rookie contract is small potatoes compared to the problem of a max contract player underperforming."
Good thing we have Shake Milton I guess.
‚ÄòOther then Milton‚Äô  You say this like Shake Milton isn‚Äôt on the team.
If we can somehow get Shake Milton for him I‚Äôd do it
"Pretty wild how crucial Shake Milton has become for this team. Without him, our bench unit looks BAD. At least he can score and create.   Hope that ankle isn‚Äôt too ba"
"Booker turns into Michael Jordan against us. I think this is his 7th straight game scoring 30+ against us. At least he kills the Celtics too, so maybe he just hates East Coast teams. Dudes a monster  On another note, the Sixers have been missing Shake Milton these past two games. Our bench unit looks awful right now. Also, we don‚Äôt attempt enough 3s per game. I think we‚Äôre in the bottom 5 in attempts which doesn‚Äôt make sense considering we have a Curry"
I think the Sixers have been missing Shake Milton on the road
"2018 2nd round draft is panning out pretty fantastic; Devonte‚Äô Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr, Hamidou Diallo, De‚ÄôAnthony Melton and Shake Milton. Most of these guys are going to make a nice chunk of change this offseason."
Not including stats... absolutely love me some suga Shake Milton

Shake Milton
What you're saying could apply to literally any contract ever. If he had signed the contract and then balled out and missed out on a big pay day then you could say it went the other way. That's what happened with Shake Milton here in Philly. What Noel did wasn't detrimental to the team in any way.  What I'm looking for is a situation where a player forced themselves off a team or acted out in order to get something and it didn't work out for them.
Shake Milton
Anything you need to deflect from Shake Milton being a good defender. You are a good sheep.
Yes I do watch the Sixers. I don't think you're giving Milton the credit he deserves but I expected that. I don't expect him to actually make the all-defense team he hasn't built up a narrative.  Shake Milton has the same defensive on/off RAPTOR as Rudy Gobert.
Needed a guard. The Sixers are the #2 ranked defense. Shake Milton has the 2nd best defensive rating on the Sixers (behind Matisse Thybulle who is not a guard) and the 6th best defensive rating in the entire league.
"I'm sorry, but what in the world is Shake Milton doing on here?"
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
"Don't forget Shake Milton. Led the G league in scoring, got his game up to speed and now he's a key bench scorer for the Sixers."
"Anybody who thinks this is controversial should watch just one Sixers game without Ben Simmons. Obviously Kyrie is a lot better than Shake Milton or Tyrese Maxey, but the team looks so unbelievably lost without Simmons out there for 30+ minutes every night. Offensively and defensively, Simmons *is* the Sixers.   I know every fan base overrates their guys, I'm guilty of it myself, but with Simmons, I really think more people ought to watch full Sixers games and they'd appreciate just how impactful he is on both ends of the floor."
"You mentioned Shake Milton, but didn't mention Matisse Thybulle. You might want to watch a Sixers game at some point üòÇ"
"The Celtics have 3 players to guard the Nets big 3, they are the only team in the East that have 3 players I trust to do that, also they have scheme versatility defensively, their bigs can get of the paint to contest Kyrie and KD out of PNR they have the best defense against Brooklyn.  &amp;#x200B;  Offensively Boston and Milwaukee (unless Brookly gets another center), Kemba and Tatum can kill Jordan's drop coverage, just like Middleton, and Brooklyn has no good option on Giannis.  Embiid can kill the Nets inside too, but I'm not sure you can rely on EMbiid iso vs Deandre to be more efficient than KD/Kyrie/Harden in a series especially because one of them will have Seth Curry/Tobi Harris/Shake Milton on them.  Miami's off ball movement can destroy the Nets defender, Harden especially but both KD and Harden are pretty decent match up's for Butler.  So I's say Boston &gt; Bucks &gt; Philly &gt; Miami"
"Nah pretty sure that was kinda the intention of the joke. He's joking about [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kpaw7d/can_we_please_stop_calling_players_that_90_of/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=nba&amp;utm_content=t1_gmnz5vr) of which the guy is complaining about exactly what you said  &gt;Way too common of initials my guy.   in regards to ""SM"" aka Shake Milton"
Who the fuck is SM?   Shawn Marion? Shake Milton? Stephen Marbury? Sean Marks?  Ohhhhh you mean Shooter McGavin. That makes sense.
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"Why would the Sixers go with Lou over Shake Milton who is a better 6th man? Idk the Sixers situation rn with Maxey, but if he isn't getting minutes atm, I'd rather see what he could do as a 6th man than go for Lou as well."
Shake Milton
Ben Simmons for playing way better and Shake Milton for playing worse.
Just searched Twitter for this and there‚Äôs a lot of Sixers fans saying they wouldn‚Äôt want to give up SHAKE MILTON for Kyle Lowry............  Those weird lies people told about Lowry never being good in the playoffs really permeated
"Nah I‚Äôm a tempered basketball fan. Realistic expectations and a firm grasp of reality. I bet you think shake Milton is the second coming of Gilbert arenas, huh?"
"Doesn‚Äôt the fact that you‚Äôre using one guys lack of minutes played as an excuse for why he has shown literally nothing in his career and defending a 6 foot rookie who will get run off the gym in the playoffs kind of make my point for me? Like comparing that to the sixers main guards off the bench of shake Milton, Thybulle and George hill whenever he gets here is a stark contrast. Like tyrese maxey and Isaiah joe aren‚Äôt even in the rotation and they‚Äôve both shown more than Langford as rookies"
"George Hill and Shake Milton bench backcourt coming soon (maybe, possibly)"
its so annoying not having any perimeter players to punish teams for going big against us.  The best guard embiid has played with is probably shake milton and he is average at best.
Shake Milton us undoubtedly the WORST player in the league when it comes to final plays of a quarter. The dude completely loses his head. Still loev him though :)
Yo wassup shake milton
"That's a hard question honestly, Herro has been shooting rather poorly this year so he'd not be the best fit for the 6ers. Clarkson's role could overlap with Shake Milton, but they could be fine running the second unit together, he's a tunnel vision kind of player tho. Considering we have a bench PG now in Hill and that Herro is bigger with better playmaking anyways, I'm going for Tyler."
Shake milton&gt; gary trent
"or just leave guys like green, curry, korkmaz, shake milton, et cetera wide open for 3...yeah totally a great idea"
"Shake milton went to SMU in Dallas.  You should just be a Mavs fan. We're in the west, it's like the A team conference anyway."
"So you think the Sixers made a mistake trading away Fultz, who if we kept, would've likely meant the development of players like Shake Milton wouldn't happen due to the team likely trying make Fultz fit in with the team in any way possible?   What a team gets in return isn't the only reason to consider when trading players."
"We probably won‚Äôt see him until the last 10-15 games but George hill is a huge addition for the sixers and really helps solidify our bench and rotations for the playoffs.   Hill fits perfectly on the sixers as a starter or off the bench. There‚Äôs not a lineup he won‚Äôt compliment.   So in addition to the offensive and defensive versatility he brings, he will also allow Shake Milton to play fully as a shooting guard/combo guard off the bench which is where he plays his absolute best.   Our bench rotation for playoffs will likely be:  Hill, Howard, milton, thybulle and korkmaz dependent on matchups.   In Simmons, green, hill, thybulle we have high level wing/guard defenders. Milton is no slouch either, and Harris has been very good on defense as well.  Won‚Äôt know until we see, but I love how much hill fits"
shake milton and 14 lebrons

"He shores up their backup guard rotation come playoff time with a proven veteran with playoff experience, instead of depending on a very inconsistant player in Shake Milton or an unproven player in Tyrese Maxley, but that's like if I told you that the best Nuggets adquisition of the trade deadline was Javale McGee."
Shake Milton killed a 22 year old playoff streak
1 crucial difference. Shake Milton is definitely not at Iggy's level
1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven‚Äôt seen George Hill yet but I‚Äôd imagine he slides in right under Seth
"Philly, they have Ben and Joel under contract for the next few years also unlike many other contenders Philly still has various first round picks over the next few years. Also they still have young and upcoming players such as Matisse, Shake Milton, Maxey, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe. They have a great combination of win now players and assets to help the team get better over the next couple of years."
Shades of when Shake Milton went for 60 pts against us at Staples Center
"Terance ""Shake Milton"" Mann"
Returning the favor for last year's Shake Milton game. I will now just assume Mr. Mann does this every night.
what is it about this building that turns shake milton into michael jordan
Shake Milton gonna drop 40+ on us again.
Shake Milton should stop turning the ball over imo
They have shake Milton
No shake Milton ???????!!!!!!!?!????
"Wanting to maintain a winning culture is not an emotional take, trading an all star away for a 2nd round pick and shake Milton doesn't fix our ""roster construction"" and having a bad center doesn't mean we have ""poor roster construction"" it just means we have a bad center.   You really trying to say that Lowry/Norm/OG/Siakam with a good center is bad? That's insane.   We're playing every single game on the road, and have been playing with half a g league squad and no coaching staff for a while now, our record doesn't speak to the quality of this team in the slightest."
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
And either Shake Milton or Bol Bol win Finals MVP
Cool.  Your team just got rode on by Furkan Korkmaz and Shake Milton.
"Let's go through our bench.  Dwight Howard: Very solid backup Center in limited minutes. Strong on D, okay on O with quite a few dumb mistakes. Count on 8 points, 12 boards and 4 Fouls (with 2 of them being Offensive)  Shake Milton: Supposedly our 6th man. Started season very hot, hurt his ankle and has not been able to hit the broad side of a barn since. Always been a streaky player, but this is exceedingly cold. Had a nice bounce back later in the game, but still a bad shooting game.  Furkan Korkmaz: The most divisive player on the bench. He's just as likely to go off for 25 points and 6 3s as he is to turn it over 6 times in 8 minutes. Goes ungodly cold and nuclear hot at random, but also likes to play like he's Lebron for some reason. Liability on D, but active enough that he can sometimes cheese a steal.  Matisse Thybulle: Legitimately one of the best defenders in the NBA, but is having a horrendous offensive season. Shooting something like 35/25/60. Gets plenty of play because he's good for 3+ steals in 12 minutes, but really bogs down the offense.  The rest of the bench are all pretty much scrubs or rookies that will not see play in the playoffs."
Shake Milton needs to go for at least 20 too
Tobias Harris al horford josh Richardson shake Milton I think jj reddick? Or did he leave? Do you not know the roster last year or what?
This motherfucker talking about Shake Milton.
"Have you seen the rest of the roster? Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz are all pretty terrible defenders  Also what do you mean Jazz defense is better? Sixers have the 2nd highest team d rating per NBA.com this season to the Lakers"
"I think most people would have Ben-Tobias-Seth as the next best 3 over Murray-MPJ-Barton(? has he been the 4th best Nugget idk) but probably AG now and the overall team comp for solid defense, Sixers are clearly better.   Shake Milton is pretty solid as well iirc then they also got Danny and Dwight"
"There are times when he leaves in Ben or Tobi with the bench and it works fine  But then there are times when he forces a Hill, Milton, Korkmaz, Thybulle, Howard lineup and the offense goes to crap because it's just Shake trying to force up shots while Korkmaz pretends he can dribble like Kyrie"
"Shake Milton. He‚Äôs a very complete player. He can play on or off ball. He basically carries our 2nd unit playing hero ball and does it on high volume at ok efficiency. I think his numbers would get much better if doc let him play with embiid, Simmons, and Tobi more. He almost exclusively gets all his mins in bench mob but the lineup numbers are really good when he‚Äôs out there with our best players.   Besides what he does on offense, he has a lot of natural talent on the defensive end. He has a legitimate 7 foot wingspan and his numbers defending the pick and roll are rock solid. I kinda think the sixers are trying to rank his value alittle bit for contract negotiations.   All time, Andrew Toney. Injuries derailed his career but he could hang with any two in the league during his prime. Excellent scorer, shooter, and defender. I just don‚Äôt think a lot of people even know who he is today. My dad used to talk about him all the time. Him and Bobby Jones."
"100% is. We didn‚Äôt have a second best player. It was probably Shake Milton. You still have Smart and Kemba. And yes, current Kemba is still better than Brett Brown Tobias. We had a bunch of players specifically designed to hamper our own win condition (Embiid)."
"Fine  Several stats, including defensive rating, say that Shake Milton is the Sixers' best defender"
"Love Maxey, but I doubt that. He's too raw right now and Milton has playoff experience. I don't expect any non-garbage time minutes for anyone outside the starting 5 + Thybulle, Howard, Furk, Shake."
Dude defensive stats literally say Shake Milton is the best defender on the Sixers lol
"Skill boost - Ben Simmons, 3pt shooting. Improves spacing and makes Ben Simmons ball handler pick and rolls so much more effective. Since Ben is already a good passer, he'd be pretty dangerous.  Honorable mention - Embiid, playmaking. Embiid is already extremely hard to guard, but if his playmaking was better he'd be laughably unstoppable.   Athleticism boost - Shake Milton. Shake has average athleticism I'd say. He's already able to drive well because of his craftiness and his length. Extra athleticism would probably make him a starting tier player as it would improve his scoring and turn his defense up a notch.   Height boost - Matisse Thybulle. Imagine have two Ben Simmons running around on defense lol. He'd still be shorter than Ben at 6'8"" but still. Honorable mentions - Seth Curry, being taller he'd get his shot off easier. Maxey, would probably immediately take over Shake's role with added height."
"Seth Curry and Shake Milton are both really really bad (especially Shake), Danny Green has been pretty meh this year and George Hill falls under that too now that he is there.  The Lakers have one guy that could be considered really bad, Drummond, and he isn‚Äôt even on Shakes level.   Why is this concept so hard to get man"
"This would hold up if we were talking about 1 or 2 people, you are saying there are 3 individuals better than anyone on the Lakers. Not to mention the Sixers are also rolling out Dwight Howard, Danny Green and Tobias Harris to round out their rotation.   The only negative defenders in their top 8 rotation are Seth Curry and Shake Milton, both guards."
Shake Milton man cmon
Shake Milton
1. Jokic 2. Beal 3. Edwards 4. Joe Harris 5. Shake Milton
Shake Milton
"Its more than that. You can't just go by stats He's not being asked to score. He's a tertiary shooter at best when he's the floor. Sixers have other veteran shooters when he's on the floor. If you were a coach on a playoff caliber team, who are you asking to shoot Shake Milton, George Hill or Thybulle? Seth Curry,Danny Green, Tobias Harris or Thybulle? Come on man... Plays is not running through him right now.. Theres a huge difference when you have plays ran through you instead of playing clean up. He might have to get his shine on a different team but its there. His real weakness is his ball handling. If fixes that he'll have better shots."
Gobert is 3rd on the Jazz  Shake Milton is 1st on the Sixers  Defensive bum Rudy Gay in 6th in the league üòÇ
Fate of the universe... I want ~~IGUODALA~~ SHAKE MILTON
  shake milton finals mvp
"we've needed a combo guard/wing since jrue holiday.  We had Butler for like 20 games and were like ""nah gimme horford""  the best player of that archetype embiid has played with is likely shake milton who is average at best and a blackhole on offense so hes not making anyones life easier by passing."
"Yeah, like I said Embiid is gonna get his on anyone. But the role players will let him down and Simmons is a liability in the playoffs.   Kemba was absolutely washed in the playoffs. How are you gonna tell me lol. He only looked half decent against the 76ers because he was being defended by Shake Milton lmao. Thybulle guarded Kemba for one shot attempt that entire series, he was too busy getting put in the torture chamber by Tatum and Brown. Kyrie will make light work of Thybulle and I think it‚Äôs pretty disrespectful to suggest other wise."
&gt;We were a game winner in the bubble away from probably being the 8 seed last season.  Ironically against the Sixers. Damn you Shake Milton!
"They have Seth, Danny, Furkan, Embiid, and Tobias who are all shooting &gt;37% from three on good volume. Not to mention Shake Milton who‚Äôs shooting around 40% from three since the ASB."
Shake Milton = Chadwick Boseman
"Barring Fultz, Sixers have done really well in the late 1st - 2nd round for role players  Shamet, Korkmaz, Shake Milton, Thybulle all are playoff team caliber bench players"
"If Simmons is a major liability in the playoffs on offense, then why were the Sixers much better on offense with him in 2017-18 (108.9 offensive rating) and 2018-19 (109.1) than they were without him last year (105.1)? The Sixers started Shake Milton in his place who's a decent offensive player and the offense still cratered. It was significantly worse than their regular season rating while the two playoffs with Simmons they were near or above their regular season ratings.  With Simmons at the helm the Sixers have had the #5 playoff offense and #9 playoff offense by rating. The Nuggets have been #10 in playoff defense and #12 in playoff defense the past two seasons with Jokic (with both ratings being significantly worse than their regular season rating by the way).   Your implication is that Simmons is unplayable on offense in the playoffs, stats don't back that up. If anything he's been more useful on offense than Jokic has been on defense. You can't focus on just AD when Jokic played 19 games in the playoffs and wasn't matched up with AD for every game."
Our offense is pretty  balanced after Joel and Tobi  Ben Simmons - 14.6 ppg  Shake Milton - 13.3 ppg  Seth Curry- 12.2 ppg  George Hill - 10 ppg  Furkan Korkmaz - 9.6 ppg   Danny Green - 9.5 ppg  Tyrese Maxey - 7.5 ppg
How Shake Milton fell all the way to #54 overall two years ago I will never know
like how shake milton got on his ass immediately too.
Philly with Shake Milton and Dwight Howard would go like 16-3 en route to a title in 2019
13. Shake Milton.      https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2878708-76ers-shake-milton-sets-nba-record-for-most-consecutive-made-3-pointers
Shake Milton is tied for the record with 13.
Shake Milton was crushing it early on too
Shake Milton.  Has it in his locker to take games over and is a solid ball-handler/shooter/hustler on D.

I get the Ben excuse but shake Milton dude? Really?
"I have to admit, I can see it being considered top 4 all time in a decade, depending on how the guys develop, but there's a ton of talent. Besides Luka probably being a future MVP, this draft could overcome other top-heavy ones with it's depth. I think Ayton, Bagley, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Mikal &amp; Miles Bridges, Michael Porter Jordan, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Timelord, Gary Trent Jr., Shake Milton are the notable ones."

Shake Milton played 27 minutes you liar
shake milton banked in a running 3 lol
Would CP3 start over Shake Milton though?
"See this is my point, you don't really watch our games.  When Ben sits we have to rely on Shake Milton as our backup ball handler and Doc runs Shake with the entire bench.  You're really gonna use offrtg without any context?  YOu need to actually watch our games if you're gonna have any kind of an idea on what you're saying.  You're just looking at box score and stats without any kind of context."
I feel you bro  At least your streak wasn't ended by Shake Milton
Who??? Shake Milton?
Shake milton &gt; Joel baddid
yea he had a good wing for one year and they were championship level.  That was also his 2nd year in the league.  Proves my point even more.  Get him a wing/guard that can dribble and create to make his life easier for once.  The best guard hes played with is???  Can you name anyone?  Shake milton possibly who just got benched for the 2nd half for being awful.
shake milton completely tanked us tonight
"Man, there's always some late 1st/2nd round prospect that I'm irrationally high on who ends up going to the Sixers.  Really loved Paul Reed in last year's draft, was *obsessed* with the thought of drafting Thybulle the year before, had soft spots for Shake Milton and TLC in previous years."
"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
shake milton is fucking terrible
I am being terrorized by Shake Milton and Phillies' hitting with RISP.
All I know is dude has one of the coldest names in NBA history along with Shake Milton
Shake milton. One of the most up and down players I've seen but I love the dudes game and think hes eventually going to put it all together
It‚Äôs justified until Cousins bulldozes Shake Milton a few plays later with no call.
I'm just relieved that Shake Milton didn't berry us with 3s
Shake Milton redeemed himself there
Shake Milton bulldozing them bodies
"Hello again Mr. Shake Milton, I have not missed you."
"Sixers have a great bench. George Hill, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Matisse Thybulle, Dwight Howard, Mike Scott."
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
"Nickname team of dame, Steph, d‚Äôlo, dbook, bam, melo, shake Milton, SGA, poku                      This was off the top of my head so don‚Äôt get mad if I missed someone. This is a team of players that are called by not their first name, initials, or last name."
Ah yes DPOY candidates Patty Mills and Shake Milton
"Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz, more specifically Furkan."
AND we drafted Shake Milton after Brunson. Too bad we traded him away immediately.
"I'm kinda sick of this take.   Brown coached us exceptionally well in the playoffs vs Toronto when we got bounced by Kawhi. The front office did Brett exactly 0 favors that offseason. Our roster construction was so dogshit that I'm not sure Popovich, Kerr, or Nurse could have fixed it.   Going into the year after that Toronto series we replaced Jimmy with Jrich and JJ Redick with Al Fucking Horford. Right off the bat we lose not 1 but 2 of our most important offensive options from the previous season, 1 being a ball handler/shot creator and the other being our only reliable volume 3 point shooter who had one of the best 2 man games with Embiid EVER. Shake Milton wasn't a reliable player at that point and we almost cut Furkan because he was actually ass early on. So now instead of having an ""ok"" offense we have some amalgamate of bigmen 4's and 5's and a single ""guard"" in J Rich who doesn't even shoot the 3 well enough to make up for everything that offense lacked.  The Brett Brown slander is such revisionist history based on last season, he was a fucking fantastic coach who got fucked over by the front office/ownership."
"Shake Milton isn't a bad shooter. He's just had a down year because Doc has played all-bench units where he is the only competent ball-handler. See him play with Simmons? Go to the corner, catch and shoot, easy 3.  Need George Hill in Philly sooner than later. Really wanna see Shake operate off-ball like he did last year."
"This is like one of those situations where if they can't put their whole squad out there, they might as well punt this game so they can get a look at a healthy Sixers, while the Sixers can't get a healthy look at them.  Shake Milton is about to score 35, 25 in the 2nd half after it's been decided."
"Shake Milton comes to mind.   Dort is better defensively, but much worse on offense. Putting up similar numbers on a much worse team, on more minutes, while being less efficient. Those 2 are obvious standouts as they had their breaktrough when they signed there 4year / 1,5-2mil contracts."
"Seriously, like curry and Embiid got 73 between the two of them, and no other player on the team got 10, Tobi, who is often a certified bucket, had like 4, Ben Simmons is just Ben Simmons, The random spark Shake milton had 5 I think, Korkmaz was the next highest scorer, with 8"
Shake Milton is like 75% of the way there
"Yeah agreed, while the Sixers could have used Lowry the required price due to salary matching and assets was STEEP. And arguably would have left the Sixers in a more of a risky place.   To get Lowry they would have needed to trade Danny Green, and let‚Äôs assume the Raptors would take Maxey and not Thybulle. Sixers would still need to add 8m worth of salary, which means trading Mike Scott AND 2/3 of Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, &amp; Shake Milton. Which cuts into their already not exceptionally deep rotation. And then asking for a FRP plus another second? That‚Äôs an absurd price to pay and leaves your roster extremely vulnerable to injuries come playoff time.   Asking for picks and a young player is a fair price for Lowry, but in the Sixers case the salary matching requirements would have cut too deep into their rotation IMO to be worth it. And might have harmed them as much as Lowry could have helped them come playoff time. Not to mention the commitment of future money to an older player required with Lowry, the loss of picks that could replenish that depleted bench roster, &amp; the issue of roster space for the Raptors (even losing TD2 and Matt Thomas would Have left us needing one more roster spot).  Deal would have been tough, and might not have helped the Sixers as much as originally hoped."
Doc showed the whole world how useful a 1st Team All-NBA Defensive player is that can't shoot free throws. Forced to take him out of the game they are winning to stop the hack-a-simmons. They put in shake fucking milton when they were up 6 because they were scared of hack-a-simmons. Like in what world do you take out your best defensive player in a game you are winning. I can't even blame doc but like wtf?
sorry shake milton is not a good player. i know it just by the way he runs
üëÄ Luka for Simmons and Shake Milton. Who says no?
Shake Milton is 25% Lance Stephenson
Welcome to the Shake Milton experience lol
shake Milton new record holder for flattest 3 point make in nba history
Shake Milton is terrible. Why is this unit ever in the game longer than 1 whistle.
At this rate Finals MVP is gonna be somebody like Ingles/Bridges/Joe Harris/Shake Milton because those will be the most talented players left.
Everyone called the bubble a Mickey Mouse ring and now Royce O‚ÄôNeal is going to battle Shake Milton for finals MVP smh smh smh I hate injuries
Isnt def RTG based off stats and shot pct And HEAVILY Decided by who you guard stats can be misleading especially if Cam Reddish is Guarding Tobias Harris and Trae is Guarding Shake Milton :/  Put Cams DRTG around other wing defenders and actually watch some film and make a Informed decision
Everyone was talking about how clippers have ez path for the title after cp3 news. Ik some shit was going to happen to the clippers. Finals MVP will be shake milton at this rate
"Do casuals understand yet how much of a difference being able to score off the dribble makes? That is why Durant is drastically better for winning team basketball than Giannis. That is why 76ers have performed drastically better with Shake Milton than Ben Simmons. That is why Durant leaves Westbrook to play with Curry and Kyrie. That is why the top teams in threes made make the conference finals at abnormal rates. Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.  We've already known this for 15 years, and I truly believe it will take another 20 before most people posting here actually understand winning basketball. They'll just react, act like they knew it all along, and then keep drastically overrating and underrating the wrong player types the next year and learning absolutely nothing about basketball, even though everyone feels the need to give their opinion on everything anyways."
You do realize they already have a stretch 4‚Ä¶ the Sixers also then have to start Shake Milton at point guard and george hill as their backup.   If you think replacing an all star point guard with a really good forward makes them better you‚Äôre either disingenuous or stupid. Judging by your spelling of Ingram‚Äôs name (ingraham? Really?) i‚Äôm going to go with stupid.
You cant play Simmons late in the 4th and he isn't dominant to make up for it in the other 3 quarters. The fact Shake Milton has to bring the ball up with 6.6 seconds left and Simmons is sitting on the bench perfectly healthy is the answer to your question.
There was also a poll on Twitter on a Heat fan account and like 51% didn't want to trade Tyler Herro for James fucking Harden lol. Also i remember looking at the Sixers sub back then and most people were fine with trading only Ben Simmons for Harden but pretty much everyone disagreed if Tyrese Maxey or Shake Milton was included lol
"He's disappointing. Simmons does many things really, really well, but there's no realistic way to build a championship team when your 2nd best, max contract point guard, literally will not shoot a basketball from farther than 5 feet from the rim.  Simmons' refusal to at least attempt to shoot absolutely kills the 76ers when it comes to deep playoff runs. During the regular season, his positives outweigh the negatives, but when you are playing the best teams in the playoffs, when they have time to scheme against you, he basically becomes Bismack Biyombo on offense. Having an all-NBA point guard sit in the dunker's spot for the entire 4th quarter of playoff games and wait for lobs and tip-ins, while Shake Milton runs the offence is not a winning strategy.  He needs to have a credible shot, he needs to be willing to shoot when open, he needs to be able to hit a reasonable number of foul shots, and he needs to be able to be a positive in a half court offence. If he doesn't, the sixers will never win.  It is honestly embarrassing at this point."
"It's not about defense, or even the box score it's about having a clutch player, which is arguably the most important guy to have in the playoffs. Defense is fine and all but the game is heavily offense-sided nowadays.  We can't rely on Embiid being almost the whole offense every game, we got bailed by Shake Milton last time ffs.  I still maintain that the best shot we had at a ring was when Butler was with us, the dude was closing games left and right and was there in the critical moments.  Simmons is supposed to be the 2nd best player on the teams and just disappears for huge stretches of time."
"I want him to play poorly. I want him to get frustrated, have some techs thrown at him, and make mistakes.  Of course all of that depends on him playing hurt, but that could end up helping us.  You know who scares me right now? Freaking Shake Milton. Whenever he is in, it looks like we cant keep up with him. Its kind of how i would feel about playing against a younger Lou Williams. Like even though he isnt a starter, he can gets buckets and run up the score."
"I was literally on my couch shouting ""take him out of the fucking game!"" when Embiid was playing the entire first 10 mins of the 3rd Quarter. He looked like he was struggling on both ends of the floor. Didn't have his movement around the paint to contest when others got inside, and on offense looked like he just wasn't able to move people around the way he normally would.  Couple everything with the refereeing last night where they basically swallowed their whistles and let both teams play with a lot of contact (personally, I'm more than okay with this, but you could see it frustrated both Embiid and Trae Young when neither were getting their usual calls), and Embiid was insanely frustrated because he felt like he was getting mauled on every possession/attempt without getting calls. It ends up with him shooting bad 3s to end possessions.  Doc should have pulled the plug on Embiid in that game, as well as Shake Milton. The announcers kept saying stupid things like Milton having the hot hand, but he single-handedly wasted away at least 4 possessions by forcing up bad shots with plenty of clock left, and ended the game 2-7 in only 15 mins. Embiid may have played poorly this game, but I truly blame Doc Rivers for how that second half panned out."
"Guys like Shake Milton end up on the street when they break plays in crucial moments, take shots, and miss. He was probably afraid of losing his career. But yeah it was open and he should have taken it."
And there is no way Gallo and Lou Williams don't absolutely dwarf shake Milton and Tyrone maxey lol
"Gallo and Lou will are two players who can create their own shot at anytime.  Dwight thybulle and any combination of maxey, Milton and Hill is "" okay let's survive for 7 minutes and hope shake gets hot""."
"Huh??? The 76ers depth features Dwight Howard, maxey, and the recent discovery of shake Milton lmao"
I ain‚Äôt ever seen an NBA player as scared as Shake Milton was to take that last shot
He may be the only player who would have been more wide open than Milton was when Shake passed up the final shot.
"That was prime Shake ""Hawks Killer"" Milton time!"
"Shake Milton needs to shoot that.. Fuck the play you wide open.  On the other hand, Atlanta should've just fouled milton because he wasn't even looking to shoot"
shake milton
Can Shake Milton not shoot or something he had a wide open look?
Shake Milton shoot that wtf dude
Why tf did Shake Milton not just step up and shoot that?
Shake Milton game winner time???
Shake Milton has gotten away with some stiff arms that might get flagged in an NFL game.
"Shake ""Habanero"" Milton"
Shake Milton stepping up huge in the 4th so far
Shake Milton is the Hawks killer
Damn Shake Milton. Same thing happened in game 2. Hawks went up and he went supernova
I cant handle another game of Shake fucking Milton cooking late.
"Shake Milton time, game over."
Shake‚Ä¶.Milton?
"I get so mad at peoples pure ignorance when watching games. How can you look at that Shake Milton play and think ‚Äùyeah, that‚Äôs a travel‚Äù"
How the hell you confuse Shake Milton with Dwight Howard?
Shake Milton ?! On the 76ers? His hairstyle looks pretty normal to me lol.
"Thybulle, Korkmaz, Maxey, George Hill, Shake Milton and Dwight Howard is ""no bench"" in your opinion?"
yeah one game....we're talking about actually getting a team through a series? otherwise shake milton is considered an offensive juggernaught who carried the sixers against an L vs the hawks.
"Why can't you see sixers beating suns or Utah?   Sixers have the best defense in these playoffs, and our offense is cooking. We're the only team with the depth at guard/wing to put up a fight against teams with multiple guards that can shoot/handle (Simmons, Tisse, Hill, Green in theory could be back if we made the finals, and Shake Milton has great lenght/plays solid defense).   We also have Embiid, who is playing like the best player in the league in these playoffs."
"Shake Milton or Kevin Huerter, Landry Shamet &amp; Bruce Brown probably, Mikal Bridges"
Nah I got you. How would you like a milkman Milton and 2ns for him?  (actually I'd rather prefer to see shake perform the rest of the playoffs before I officially make this offer) lol
"zero chance doc plays batum at center in game 7 vs dallas.  doc can make some boneheaded decisions and refuse to correct in-game (putting Danny Green on Trae in game 1 of Hawks-Sixers), which seems like a legitimate gripe about his coaching.  But the flipside of that stubbornness, is that key contributors going through cold spells get opportunities to turn it around. In this Hawks series, Doc kept giving the sixers' sixth man, Shake Milton, spot minutes, even though he had been in a cold spell for over a month going back to the regular season. In game 3, Milton finally erupted for 14 points in the 2nd half (4/5 from 3). That can seem like faith rewarded."
Shake Milton. That dude is a spark plug.
"You know those hockey style line changes that he got roasted for in game 1 against the Hawks?  He went away from them in game 2, he played Shake Milton more, and got great results, right?  In all his years coaching the Clips, he wasn't as willing to make those types of changes that quick.  He was reluctant to stagger the minutes of his starters and would run sub-heavy units even when they weren't working, he had favorite players that he stuck with even when matchups were terrible, and he was just really stubborn about making changes even when they were obviously needed.  The Sixers version of Doc is different from the version of Doc that coached the Clips for seven seasons."
Shake Milton under 2million each of the next 2 years is criminal.
Lol at the people who said ‚ÄúThe Sixers were one Shake Milton from being down 2-0‚Äù. LOOOOOOOOL
Korkmaz and Shake Milton
Shake Milton cakes up

Milkshake? Shake Milton!
Shake milton shows up
Sixers fans never told me that Shake Milton was the reincarnation of Allen Iverson
i thought shake milton was a made-up meme player?
Shake Milton will blow Atlanta's Roof off tonight
# SHAKE MILTON COOKED HIS ASS TWICE NOW
BDSM BIG DICK SHAKE MILTON
"I'm thinking Embiid but I loved the way shake milton played last game, if he had at least a decent game 3 it would make a major difference for the series. Expecting Jokic to have a great game but maybe Porter Jr. Could hit a three or two, that might help."
I don‚Äôt see an option for Shake Milton
Shake Milton
&gt; Like the Sixers might leave Tobias Harris unprotected to protect Shake Milton or something like that.  Maybe last season...
"Not sure about Kareem but teams will sometimes leave better, older players on massive contracts unprotected knowing that an expansion team probably would rather young and cheap guys. Like the Sixers might leave Tobias Harris unprotected to protect Shake Milton or something like that."
Shake Milton looks like 2k generated player.
Shake Milton should be in this conversation.
All I know is the Sixers got robbed!  Embiid was the MVP. Simmons was DPOTY. Shake Milton was Most Improved Player Of The Year.
You lost yesterday because of a career game from Shake Milton. I wouldn't consider this over yet at all.
"He averages 16 a game for his career on 56% shooting. At the rim he‚Äôs 72% for his career. He drives the ball 10.2 times per game, less than shake Milton. But on those drives he shoots 53% and kicks out 46% of the time. When he drives he doesn‚Äôt turn it over or miss, he can get to the rim at will and make a good play there every time. He just doesn‚Äôt do it"
Shake Milton MVP
Embiid is a shake Milton explosion away from being down 2 - 0. I don't think he is worried about the mvp award. He is worried about Ben Simmons free throws.
Are we really sure Shake Milton isn't better than Jokic? One guy is down 0-1 and the other is up 1-0 in games they played more than 5 minutes in against the Hawks
"Bro, that's like saying your two best players are Joel Embiid and Shake Milton. You know that's bullshit. Donovan, Rudy, Conley, Bojan are all starters and are amazing at what they do. Clarkson is an amazing player and the SMOTY, but come on man, you know you're talking bullshit."
Game against the Clippers will always be the Shake Milton game imo
"If Shake Milton was Trae Young, he would‚Äôve gotten that and-1 call on the 3"
Shake Milton University
Doc's one of *those* teachers. He's teaching the Hawks Maxey like he's going to be on the test while not bothering to mention Shake Milton at all. Then the Hawks get the test and towards the end you get a bunch of questions about Shake Milton.  Hate it when that happens.
"Is Shake ""the most underpaid NBA player"" Milton back? I hope this is not just a fluke/hot streak."
I‚Äôve been waiting SO GOD DAMN LONG for a Shake Milton highlight so I could bring it back and I missed it  [it‚Äôs my own post too lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kpaw7d/can_we_please_stop_calling_players_that_90_of/)
"Shake Milton is my favorite sixers player, I‚Äôd love to have him back up Russ and Beal"
"This is false, it wasn't a post directed at Shake Milton. Instead it was about how people abbreviate obscure players on their team and expect everyone to know who they are referring to, and Shake Milton (SM) was used as an example."
"Call him BDSM, Big Dick Shake Milton"
Lol. I‚Äôll trust that our starters have a better game while you trust Shake Milton to save y‚Äôall every game
who tf is Shake Milton and why was he so good this game
Feels good to see SMU legend Shake Milton getting some shine
Shake Milton University
"I think bad both ways. Trae sold calls, Embiid did his usual thing, and a lot of missed off ball calls. What controlled game was Shake fucking Milton dammit"
"Starters struggled, bench got them back in it. Game gets even more physical, enter Shake Milton. That's all she wrote. I'm not butt hurt. You all the NUMBER 1 SEED. You should be beating us. I'm just happy to be nominated. BUT I will call things as I see them. And we still have home court, so there's that."
Don Mitchell on that Shake Milton shit
Lol what? Hawks were killing the 76ers in the 2nd quarter and possibly could've won game 2 if not for Shake Milton
It‚Äôs been a day for bench players hasn‚Äôt it ?   The ginger kid from Atlanta  Shake Milton   Kennard  Strangely the 6MOTY will hopefully get it going in the second half
Right behind shake Milton
"i mean even when he was mostly a post up guy he was posting up from the three point line lol  some of the spacing in his career has been bad, the best guard hes been paired with is arguably shake milton or tj mcconnell.  That gets you no easy buckets"
"Especially in the case of Draymond, where they capitalized on him being underpaid for years (and struck gold with Curry being underpaid at the same time, ofc). But there seems to be a window where hitting on a late pick like that can be hugely valuable if you start getting production out of them before you owe them a bag. To a lesser extent, the Sixers have that with Shake Milton (SM) right now - he's no Middleton, but he's locked in a 4 year $4m contract, and averaged 13ppg last year. That's not nothing and is the kind of think that can really help push a team over the edge."
"&gt;That‚Äôs not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK üôÑ  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
"Jokes aside, I'd trade him for Shake Milton. Maybe Doc can revive pre-Lebron Kuzma, it ain't working for him with Lebron/Vogel. Doubt Philly will take on his contract though."
"Yeah, superstar duo Joel Embiid and Shake Milton"
"So let me get this straight, you add Shake Milton, I'm assuming the Blazers get him since they are getting the worst deal right now...so that means they get Shake and they give up Roco? That makes the trade even worse for them, that doesn't make any sense.  &gt;Ben Matisse maxi and picks is better than what any other contender could offer.   Sure, if all these assets were going to the Blazers directly, but they aren't, most of them are going to the Kings. The Blazers get Fox, Matisse (role player), Barnes (old role player) and some shit picks for a top 10 player AND they lose CJ too...they are losing their two franchise player and only getting Fox, some role players and some shit picks lol I think they can get a better direct return than that.  You're mixing up what the Sixers are giving up vs what the Blazers are getting..you have to take off the homer glasses and think from the perspective of each team in a trade and ask would this make them better off, and this trade as it is now is pretty bad for the Blazers, and you want to make it even more lopsided against them and in favor of your team. Not to be rude, but I think you're being a little delusional here...pretty much any trade that brings you Lillard this offseason is a huge win for the Sixers, don't get greedy."
And why exactly would the Magic give up a top 5 pick for CJ and Shake Milton?
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"I think the question is less sticking him at another position and more adding literally anybody who can dribble to the starting lineup. Ben's never played alongside another point or combo guard in his career, other than TJ McConnell or Shake Milton. Teams need more than one guy who can create, either for himself or others, and the Sixers have never had that.  &gt; There were many possessions he didn't even bring the ball up the court. He'd sit around by the dunker spot essentially playing the front court role.  So I'm curious how Ben looks off-ball if there's a respectable dude handling it, vs. having Tobias, Danny Green, and Matisse desperately swinging the ball around hoping somebody magically gets open."
"you must not visit often.   they roast Ben and any Ben supporters as bad as any Celtic fan does.   also, Embiid/Simmons minutes are still overwhelming positive.    The front office needed to find a Butler level player to handle the half court late game offense.   Fultz flamed out, Jimmy wanted his own team...but still no excuse for it being Shake Milton and rookie Maxey in that role."
"I say the Clippers. The spacing, the chemistry, the defense, the depth would be enough to beat the 76ers. The 76ers with a frontcourt of Dwight and Embiid would be scary. Also having Simmons, prime Danny Green, Tobias, prime George Hill, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, and Warriors Anthony Tolliver would be nice, but I think the Clippers would beat them in 7."
"Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz + Firsts for a shooting wing please"
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton + firsts
"Devin Harris 3 times by the Mavs.  June 24, 2004: Traded by the Washington Wizards with Christian Laettner and Jerry Stackhouse to the Dallas Mavericks for Antawn Jamison.  February 19, 2008: Traded by the Dallas Mavericks with Maurice Ager, DeSagana Diop, Trenton Hassell, Keith Van Horn, a 2008 1st round draft pick (Ryan Anderson was later selected) and a 2010 1st round draft pick (Jordan Crawford was later selected) to the New Jersey Nets for Malik Allen, Jason Kidd and Antoine Wright.

&gt;Can I interest you in a slightly used mike scott plus shake milton then lol   Counter offer: One Ben Simmons? :D
Can I interest you in a slightly used mike scott plus shake milton then lol
&gt;Beasley should get attention from a lot of teams. What do we think his value is?   Well the Wolves fanbase sees a 20 ppg scorer and 40% shooter from deep on 9 attempts but GM's around the league aren't that hot about him since he's a bad defender (size is more of his issue since he has a great motor) and you know off the court shit.  &gt;Would wolves consider George hill + Shake milton + the 28th overall pick for Beasley?   Maybe but I feel like Bolmaro and Jaylen are gonna be the PG's from the bench so any move is gonna be for a forward.
"Beasley should get attention from a lot of teams. What do we think his value is?   Would wolves consider George hill + Shake milton + the 28th overall pick for Beasley?   Gives them a pick, a cheaper veteran backup PG in hill, a decent young player in milton for bench depth.   Sixers get the volume 3 point shooter they so desperately need on a quality contract."
"Mookie Blaylock, J.R. Rider, Diamond Stone, Shake Milton, Jamario Moon, Royal Ivey"
Shake and bake Milton
It used to be Shake Milton but then the monsters got him
"PJ Dozier, Aaron Gordon, Bol Bol, Barton, 2 FRP, 1 pick swap for Simmons and Shake Milton.   Nuggets go with Monte/Murray/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic. Bench of Facu/Shake/Nanji/Green. Not bad"
"Embiid was forced to do **so much** though. I don't think that's a fair point to take a lot of the onus off on the guy who refuses to shoot the ball or be aggressive and put it on the only guy on the team that's aggressive and plays at an MVP-level.   Other than Seth Curry, Furkan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey, of course, but none of those guys are All-NBA caliber players."
"Jazz new FO decides offense doesn't matter and they aren't keeping Conley and can't see Mitchell staying anyway. Says fuck it and trades Mitchell with Bogdanovic to Philly, Philly send back Thybulle and Simmons, and that being in Memphis to get Melton to the Jazz, and Shake Milton and Seth Curry to the Grizzlies. Sixers add wing shooting and a guy who is a star and better in the playoffs, Utah has an image defensive lineup with bad spacing but more salary flexibility without the large chunk contracts, and Memphis turns Melton into Curry and Milton who complement Morant's offensive game perfectly."
Things Doc Rivers has done well.  Utilise Seth Curry in a more effective way than other teams.  Run Tobias Harris at his ideal position  Make adjustments with Tyrese Maxey/Shake Milton to help swing games.  The issue with the sixers is that they don't have a real pg who can properly run a half court offense (unless you count an old George Hill who didn't cut it as a starting PG in 2018 let alone now).  Doc Rivers isn't the best coach ever but just two seasons ago he lead one of the most star-starved teams to the West playoffs in a decade+. He's not the greatest coach but overall he has more positives than negatives.  Also Scott Brooks made the playoffs lol
"The Hawks somehow always get absolutely fucked by the most random players imaginable, Bobby Portis joining the club with Luke Kennard and Shake Milton"
"I love the idea that we'd trade our best scorer for a facilitator to play alongside another facilitator.  We were the worst 3 point shooting team in the playoffs and you want us to trade BEAL for SIMMONS? Oh, but it's okay because you threw in Shake Milton?"
"Alright fine. Embiid, TJ McConnell, Covington, Shamet, Korkmaz, Shake Milton, Saric to name a few"
"Idk what exactly Toronto gets, but this is a 4 team trade idea I have to get 3 players in different situations.   Pascal Siakam -&gt; PHI, Ben Simmons -&gt; GSW, Draymond Green -&gt; POR  Why the Sixers do this: Siakam is a much cleaner fit next to Embiid offensively due to his superior shooting abilities, whilst at the same time, not blocking the development of guards like Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton. Siakam takes over Simmons role as primary perimeter defender. More than anything, this trade makes Embiid *happy* as Siakam is one of his guys since they are both from Cameroon.   Why Golden State does this: This is a bet on Ben Simmons reviving his career in the most optimal situation for him. You are essentially hoping to turn Ben Simmons into the next Draymond Green with some slight differences, Simmons is not the rim protector that Draymond is, which makes Wiseman important, conversely Simmons is a much better perimeter defender and a point of attack defender is needed with Klay likely not being up to scratch in that kind of role anymore.   This is a talent acquisition bet for Golden State, their 5 they would be rolling with would be Simmons/Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Wiseman.   Why the Blazers do this: This is pretty simple, to make Dame happy. Dame and CJ have long wanted to play with Draymond after that 2019 WCF series where they were exposed to just how good he was, CJ went as far as photoshopping him in a Blazers jersey.   I'm not too sure what Toronto ends up with in this scenario, Covington for sure as part of salary matching and I suppose one of Nurkic or Derrick Jones Jr.?   Not sure who would need picks out of this to be properly compensated."
Shake Milton
Giving up future first ballot HoFer Shake Milton AND extra stuff?  What an overpay!
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
SHake Milton is the truth.
"We‚Äôll give you fourth quarter Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle on offense and Shake Milton."
Let me out my 2k hat on. Gimme capela at center (I thinks that 16mil. Moses brown as back up. Jonathan issac at PF (17 mil?) wand tj warren at sf (14 mil? ). Dinwiddie at pg at 11mil and christian wood could probably be pf and you can take warren out and move issac to sf. then a combination of lu dort and tj McConnell and shake Milton for the back court back ups I guess cause I know they have dirt cheap contracts but can contribute. Thats just off the top of my head while at work so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a bunch of much better options haha.
"&gt;Dame is out. Enjoy watching Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and Shake Milton the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Doncic, Trae Young, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, JJJ, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Jalen Brunson, Shake Milton,... 2018 was the year the NBA gods smiled upon Draft Day. At this rate it will be one of the all time great draft years littered with MVP's, All-Stars, 6MOY's, DPOY,..."
You didn‚Äôt even include tobias Harris..his own teammate  Idk why doc didn‚Äôt play shake in the playoffs. I might include shake Milton on this list
Shake Milton
"I‚Äôm not sold on anybody on your roster not named Joel embiid. Ben Simmons is done dude, stick a fork in him, are you old enough to remember nick Anderson my nephew. Go back and look at those missed free throws and look how it affected his career after. Simmons is junk at this point. You guys rolled out to money for Tobias Harris and sometimes he looks good but he‚Äôs not gonna crack more than 20 pt avg the rest of his career. Nobody wants to play for Daryl morrey after that fiasco in Houston anymore.  You had a Chance at James harden but wanted to keep Simmons? Why hasn‚Äôt shake Milton blown up yet btw. Isn‚Äôt he suppose to be your best player off to bench.  Dude I‚Äôm sorry to tell you but embiid ain‚Äôt sticking around, he‚Äôs gonna leave just watch.   Best thing to do is trade Simmons and parts for CJ from Portland"
"I did. Which really adds to the point I was trying to make.  David West had a really good career. Was a 2x All Star and a big part of some of the most successful teams in New Orleans Pelicans (then Hornets) history, then was a big part of a couple runs to the ECF with Indiana, and then as an old guy still was able to contribute off the bench to two titles with GSW.  No one can guarantee me that any one of JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet will have a better career than David West, yet he never comes up when discussing 2003, to the point that I literally forgot to mention him."
I actually like this one a lot - I'm also curious if Turner could be flipped for the 14th pick  I'd probably add Shake Milton for Aaron Holiday swap in there too to even it up a bit
"2018 has SGA as well  they also have a lot of depth pieces in JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet"
"It‚Äôs insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I‚Äôm probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
You‚Äôre acting as if Shake Milton and Maxey are proven that they can score.  Outside of Embiid and Curry no one was a consistent reliable scorer
"Curry was the 2nd most consistent offensive player. Tobias disappeared, Ben was scared to touch the ball, you‚Äôre contradicting yourself.  He should‚Äôve took Ben out, he should‚Äôve took Curry out, Tobias couldn‚Äôt hit shit, other than riding Embiid who has a torn meniscus what the fuck else was he supposed to do?  Maxey had like one good quarter that series and you‚Äôre acting like he left a star player on the bench.  Same with Shake Milton.  George Hill role is not to score heavy points, he played fine for what his role is.  Every ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù you think would‚Äôve been better could as easily made everything much worse.  There‚Äôs no way you can take Curry out when outside of Embiid no one else could score.  There‚Äôs also no way you can say its bad coaching that Huerter scored 27 because he‚Äôs done nothing so far to say that he could consistently score that much. We probably won‚Äôt see that from him again."
"I think we can get better than what the cavs have to offer. Ben has value despite his historically poor showing in the playoffs. Ben can be the center of a trade for like a DeAaron Fox or a Zach Lavine. He won‚Äôt get you a Dame or a steph or a Beal though. It would probably be like Ben, shake Milton, plus 2-3 firsts"
"Shake Milton, Maxey, Thybulle, Dwight, Korkmaz is one of the best and deepest benches in the league.  I agree on there coach though.  Doc sucks in the playoffs"
So basically there was only 1 call that was called incorrectly in crunch time and that was the Shake Milton travel that led to a bucket
"Surprisingly reasonable take from someone‚Äôs mom. This is kinda just human nature. Ty Lue has a ‚Äòwho gives a shit‚Äô vibe. A ‚Äòbeen there done that, I don‚Äôt really care Dude I played with Mike and Kobe, coached Bron‚Äô attitude. I‚Äôve had coaches like him. They help you to not care and just hoop.  Doc? Doc is old school. Seems like he‚Äôs gonna cry at any minute, always yellin. Probably changes up when it gets tight bc he knows like you know that he‚Äôs got that bad rep on his back. Which makes YOU tight   Doc coaches scared. Prime example is Ty Lue is like F it I‚Äôm sitting Rondo and Beverly and going with reggie Jackson and Terence Mann. Doc?  Doesn‚Äôt play Shake Milton who‚Äôs the more dynamic player, a scorer, higher upside. Doc goes with just about the safest player in the game George hill who you KNEW wasn‚Äôt gonna step outside himself"
"To add: It sounds like the only mistake they acknowledge is that the Shake Milton basket should have been a pair of free throws, because he was touched by Collins and then held on to the ball until coming down and committing what would be a travel."
Ben Simmons and shake Milton for CJ McCollum and RoCo
"We also did have a roster with Al Horford and Josh Richardson. Our best shooter was Shake Milton. Our best reserve (with Ben out, forcing us to slide Shake in his place) was Alec Burks. Last year‚Äôs team was GOD AWFUL compared to this year.  This comment isn‚Äôt really meant to be a further indictment of Ben, but even with him, we still likely lose in the first round. Just not in 4."
And adding Ben Simmons to a 0 spacing lineup wouldve helped their chances?  Give me Shake Milton over him any day tbh. At least him and Richardson were making shots
"So what teams makes sense logically to trade simmons to? I still nominate the blazers. Lets be honest, theyre gonna have to go into a rebuild mode unless they can magically grab a star player to pair with Dame. I would never trade Dame from 5 years ago. But dame at his age right now for Simmons at his age and maximum amount of picks allowed in a trade and maybe a Shake Milton or Maxey as a throw in sounds good.  Why sixers do it: Dame is 30 years old. while hes starting to get up there in age, you still have 4 or 5 years of him in his prime. Hes got a killer instinct and knows how to take over a game. Also has knocked down some big time shots. Basically provides the offensive punch that ben couldnt provide. Hes the star that Embiid neees to play besides.  Why Blazers do it: right now, Dame is the far superior player. But as stated above, you only have 4-5 years of his prime left. This is more about securing all the picks you can get for a eventual rebuild while still fielding a somewhat competitve team right now. As bad as Ben was offensively, he still is a 6'10 pg that can dish dimes, rebound, and play defense. And hes only 24 years old. The plan should be to surround him with as many shooters as you can and maybe one star player that can do the main scoring. For the time being you can use bens ability to pass to build inflated value on cj mccollum. Having a milton or maxey will also help with bench production.   Cap wise the money should be close.  Whats everyone elses nomination for a destination? Im a knicks fan so this isnt me trying to dream up a way to get dame or simmons on my team."
"And the ""almost the same roster"" means mostly 3 same players in the regular rotation, because Simmons, Curry, Green and Hill did not play a year ago. Shake Milton played more than 30 minutes a game that series."
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, plus picks for Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Zach Collins. Who says no if Dame demands a trade?"
"Does anybody think the sixers would go for a Rubio/naz/culver and two 2nds for simmons and shake Milton?  Any wolves fans that want to slander me for trading naz away, I would only do this if we landed a guy like Portis or traded Beasley in a package for Myles turner"
They went a ten man deep rotation in a must win game 7 so many bad lineups too. I swear Joel was playing with both Simmons and maxey out ther and no Seth at times and the spacing for him was atrocious. Shake Milton should have also gotten zero minutes in the fourth quarter
"I mean first off, that‚Äôs literally every fan base. I mean even ppl in your fan base overhype the fuck out of KAT lmao  Second off, you have it backwards. Ben is actually really good at a lot of things naturally (passing, facilitating, defense, etc.), but terrible at one thing (shooting).  Third off, who tf says Shake Milton is a super star LOL literally has never been said unironically by a Philly fan, and if someone has said that before, they probably got flamed by other Philly fans"
"Check out that draft's performance in the playoffs. Ayton, Doncic, JJJ, Trae, Mikal, MPJ, DiVincenzo (hurt but would be starting on ECF team), Huerter (greatest player of all time, apparently), Bruce Brown, Shake Milton"
"every offseason Philly fans try to gaslight us into thinking that one of their players who is really good at one thing but limited at just about everything else is actually an incredible player, and they never pan out. It started with Simmons for years, then Shake Milton had his 15 minutes of fame and now it seems like Thybulle is the next. They have talented players but their fanbase spends so much energy trying to convince everyone that they're way better than they are"
"Just like Zion averaging 27 ppg on 60% shooting next to Steven Adams, its a miracle Embiid is this dominant playing with Ben  He quite literally got locked out of the paint by the Hawks due to Ben. Had to resort to midrangers and he's so good that he makes them but the reason that he gets doubled and even tripled so much is cause of Ben  Also Doc's shitty rotations. Playing 10 guys in a game 7, playing Shake Milton in 4th quarter minutes, and running a Ben and Matisse lineup of course the spacing is gonna be trash lmao"
"Also Sexton, Shai, Gary Trent Jr, Shake Milton, Shamet and Donte Divincenzo"
"First of all, if Embiid, Harris and Seth Curry are taking the majority of the shots, how many shots is Ben going to take? And if you have a team where the only legit competent passer is the ""unplayable one"" how many is he going to score unless he's like, Fuck it. Let me put up a bunch of shots so I can prove that I'm a StArrrr!   I don't like how he struggled with FTs but not for the reason you think. We have no other trustworthy ball handler facilitator than Ben on the Sixers. I would have rather had Ben miss a couple of free throws especially since he's important on the defensive end than have Maxey(a rookie) and Shake Milton who's not a natural PG. Doc panicked and even Larry Brown who is a Hall of Famer said that he would have never took Ben out for missing FTs and used Ben Wallace as an example. So um yeah, it's not as simple as ""score PoINtZzzzzz and we WiNNNzzzzz!"
Seth Curry and Shake Milton played pretty decent roles didn‚Äôt they?
How does Shake Milton only get 5 minutes total playing time for game 7 considering his play the previous games??
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
"I've always defended Simmons here. He's a great player by every advanced stat. He's one of the best defenders in the game and one of the best passers. And he gets his 15 points or so in a very efficient manner. That's a very good player to have, even if he's not going to go for 30.   But holy shit, tonight - I have never felt more embarrassed for a good player. He totally disgraced himself. It's one thing to miss a bunch of shots, throw some bad passes, miss some FTs, but the guy was simply afraid to fucking *participate*!  I've never seen anything like it. He got pulled from the game with a minute left, but it honestly should have been the entire 4th quarter. Give me Shake Milton, at least he'll put a fucking shot up.  Ok, you can't shoot. Neither can Giannis, but he managed to get points, create opportunities when it counted. He wasn't afraid to participate in the fucking game. What did Simmons do in the entire 4th quarter???   What an embarrassment. I'm rooting for him to bounce back, but this has to do a real number on your psyche."
"If Kings, I thought of Buddy, Bagley and multiple picks  If Bulls, they would need to blow it up and we would offer Ben, multiple picks, shake Milton and another asset or two (besides Maxey and HOPEFULLY not Thybulle) for Zach..."
"Ben Simmons has real problems but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a hot take to suggest he could add some value to a shake Milton, Josh Richardson, Alec Burks, Raul Neto rotation."
I thought the 76ers had some hope when they made that run that put them up 78 to 77 before scoring a little over 2 minutes later 80-77. It was over when the 76ers had to sub out Ben Simmons for Shake Milton (who wasn't a liability on offense when the 76ers needed points).
"are you serious lmao. let's ignore ben, 6ers top players are the mvp runnernup joel embiid, a pure scorer in tobias harris, flamethrower seth curry, all nba defender matisse thybulle, a veteran george hill, shake milton and a pretty good rookie imo tyrese. you wanna do a side by side against the hawks' best players?  even by your argument that the hawks are at the nare minimum very close to philly, philly got outcoached"
"&gt;So you get to Keep Matisse, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Embid and all you gotta do is trade Ben Simmons and 3 first round picks?!?!? PHILLY IF YOU DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER I SWEAR TO GOD  This comment got downvoted to -12. Speaks to how delusional the /r/sixers sub was about Simmons lmao."
"Get this: Ben Simmons actually had a positive +/- (+1), unlike everyone else on the team not named Furkan Korkmaz or Shake Milton. Idk if that's because he was benched early or what, but at least he has that going for him."
"In a game 7, the Sixers wing rotation for the final set play was Seth Curry, Shake Milton and George Hill. Ben Simmons not even playable.  Meanwhile Kyle Lowry somehow improving his value without even playing. The list of ""Wish we traded for Kyle Lowry"" teams is now at 3!"
"Ben Simmons had 12 assists on 2 turnovers and the offense was way way way better when he was on the floor, he did not have a bad game. They don‚Äôt come close without him. They don‚Äôt have an actual playmaker at all outside of Simmons.  Doc made a bad decision to take him out regardless of hackaben cuz u can‚Äôt get a good shot without him At least for screens and rebounding he‚Äôd be better than having a cold Shake Milton. Just don‚Äôt have him handle it down the stretch.  Game 1 they also made comebacks because of Simmons Traps and imbound steals. You‚Äôre still better off with that out there."
Philly has shake Milton and a rookie on the floor over Ben Simmons.   He‚Äôs untradeable I think. Who would want a player that is that much of liability on offense?
LMAO Shake Milton travelshot. Love it
Lmfao shake Milton that was amazing
Shake Milton is a god
Wow Shake Milton
Shake Milton is such a fantastic basketball name.
Holy shit shake Milton with the blatant as fuck walk
Shake Milton got fouled where‚Äôs the call?
Put shake Milton in
i dont think shake milton is really provide more benefit than seth curry out there.
Shake Milton coming on in the 4th of a game 7 to YOLO a 3 is why I‚Äôm watching
Shake milton lol what are these rotations
Shake Milton lol
Where is curry!?? Doc rivers is a mych worse version of bud with his restricted minutes and lineup. Shake Milton is useless. Sixers need shooting
Will shake Milton save them tonight
"It's a joke. Awhile back someone went off about unnecessary/confusing abbreviations and mentioned SM, for Shake Milton"
"Korkmaz is trash. Dude shouldn‚Äôt be playing at all, have Shake Milton take his minutes"
*laughs in Shake Milton*
I need a Terrence Mann vs Shake Milton finals.
"Bucks really need that Jordan Clarkson, Lou Will (Shake Milton? Lol) type who can come off the bench, take the pressure off the stars a bit and just score"
Simmons? Thybulle? Maxey? Saric? Vucevic? RoCo? Jerami Grant? Landry Shamet? Shake Milton?
Shake Milton?? lol
"Shake Milton as well for almost single handedly saving game 2, and Korkmaz as well for helping Shake in game 2 and helping Maxey in game 6."
"Plenty of late talent. Maxey, Thybulle, Shake Milton, Shamet, Korkmaz, Jerami Grant, Richuan Holmes. TLC solid bench guy."
" &gt; Now Mitchell Robinson at 36 and Shake Milton at 54 in that same draft? Those are great second round picks.  The standard you were critiquing was ""pretty fine"", not great. If you're a 2nd rounder who gets a 2nd contract, you're doing better than average for 2nd rounders. You don't need to be contributing what Shake or Robinson are for that to still be a positive"
"Wouldn't have played a minute in any playoff team's rotation this year except maybe the Eastern Conference dregs.  If he fixes his shot and figures out NBA defense over the next couple years, yeah, this is a hell of a great contract. Until then, he's indistinguishable from every other 2nd rounder.  Now Mitchell Robinson at 36 and Shake Milton at 54 in that same draft? Those are great second round picks."
"Bro this. Wasn‚Äôt like Danny Green was playing spectacularly out there. Even in game 2 the Sixers pulled away mostly because shake Milton decided to go supernova. I get that he‚Äôs a very useful player for the system, but he had been playing fairly mediocre to that point in the series."
"Thank you so much. I work overnights and needed that hearty laugh in the middle of my shift.   ‚ÄúThe Jazz could use someone like SM!‚Äù  That got me rolling. Shake Milton.   I know some are more insider, like Lakers fans call Talen Horton-Tucker, THT. I get that, because who wants to even start with a hyphenated name, but has he earned that? Not many Charlotte fans are going to recognize what the hell a THT is.   Some guys have really cool acronyms, so I also get the AK47s of the world. Andrei Kirilenko was better still, though, than SM and THT."
‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo fuck you‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo fuck YOU‚Äù  Three hours later you get Shake Milton traded for Khem Birch and a top 43 protected second.
"Ah yes, the insurmountable Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz. It's a wonder Maxey ever saw the court at all with those guys on the roster!  You are being a clown level homer here. Maxey is a nice player, but he was worse than both Bane and IQ last year. Maybe he'll be a better player moving forward - still way too early to tell. But saying those guys would be buried on the bench but not Maxey is just laugh out loud level fingers in my ears homerism here."
"A rotation player for who? The Pistons? The Thunder?  So basically a dude you need to find minutes for if you are actively trying to tank?  Which playoff team's rotation would he have cracked?  If he's good, why did Presti trade him away for a half season of a some other non-impact player?  If he's good, where are teams trying to sign him? He's a free agent, and his qualifying offer is only $2M.  I mean, yeah, 2nd round picks are hard, and this is a good try. But it's not a hit.  76ers grabbed Shake Milton at 54 in the same draft. Career 37% 3 shooter, put up 13 PPG playing over 20 minutes a game for the time that had the most wins in the Eastern Conference.  That's a hit."
"I think people want too much of both things. More bench but not more bench at the same time because when the bench was on, they sucked too. Aside from game 6, Maxey was meh, Shake Milton/Korkmaz/George Hill were meh too and one of them would've been on for Simmons instead.  There's been a lot of shit thrown at Doc Rivers. Fine, whatever. But I don't know what the solution would be from any other coach anyway when 2/3 of your supposed to be star players are inconsistent on offense the whole series or non existent, the 3rd has a busted knee and is still playing a lot of minutes to keep them alive and the bench is inconsistent as expected.   In game 7, Yes Embiid starting possessions from further out didn't work but he was being hard doubled by Capela and Collins. There's only so much you can scheme around that."
"Well the sixers have some good young players that will likely be included with a pick, then probably Sacramento, wolves, my guess is Portland get something like Bagley, Haliburton, Maxey, 2 first from sacremento, a first from Philadelphia and maybe an extra player like Buddy Hield or Shake Milton if they don‚Äôt want Simmons."
"Sixers get Dame, Warriors get Ben, Portland gets Maxey, possibly Shake Milton and all the picks Philly and GSW are sending to make it work."
Oklahoma  PG: Trae Young  SG: John Starks  SF: Josh Richardson  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Ekpe Udoh  6: Shake Milton
"Dame Green Korkmaz Harris Embiid. Seth Curry, Shake Milton and Drummond off the bench. All of the role players are complimentary to Dame and Embiid."
Can we throw in shake Milton and Reed and get back Powell?
Shake Milton
Does that make Shake Milton BDN?
"I think we‚Äôd offer literally any package as long as it didn‚Äôt  involve HALIBURTON or Fox. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for us to trade one of those guys for a package for Simmons. It would have to be a better player, But, these opportunities don‚Äôt happen often. I think Davion Mitchell, Barnes and Hield plus firsts for Simmons and one other guard, Shake Milton or Springer, is the best we can do. I think a third team being involved would help to if it redirected more talent to the Sixers faster. A team that would take the picks and even Bagley, in exchange for good starter. I think Philly can hold our a longgggg time and wait for something involving Dame or something. Their best package available is better than the Kings so‚Ä¶."
"I went to the Sixers second game against the Hawks this year, and Embiid dropped a playoff career high 40 while Shake Milton caught fire to end the game. Wells Fargo was electric.  Thank god I didn‚Äôt go to the later games of that series lmao  EDIT: Honorable mention to a game a few years back where Justin Anderson led us to a win vs the Knicks and got into it with Melo lol"
I might be misremembering but didn't Brett Brown try that in the bubble? I thought they were starting Shake Milton at PG at some point with Simmons at the 4.
"Yeah, specifically being both short and slight. Short guys can get by on defense if they‚Äôre bullish-ly strong, and slight guys with length can still make do (like a Shake Milton, not strong and not a hugely smart defender, but long wingspan that just helps do enough on that end)."
"Not trying to be that guy but you could say that about most dudes in the nba who get regular playing time. Shit, shake Milton in the bubble playoffs had runs where he was on and it looked like no one could stop him. And what casual fan has even heard of shake Milton"
"In case you're wondering how the Sixers managed to avoid this penalty with Embiid, Simmons, and Harris all on maxes, the rest of their roster is currently:  Seth Curry on a stupidly good contract, Andre Drummond on a minimum, and a bench where the oldest player is 24 year old Shake Milton"
"&gt; Choked almost as bad that series as...   By that do you mean ""choked much worse""?   You're comparing role players, bench rotation guys and a 20 year old to the superstar, self appointed leader in his prime.   Thats like saying that Shake Milton, George Hill, Korkmaz and Maxey choked more than Ben Simmons."
He was getting locked down by Danny green and shake Milton too
Do they call him Master Shake Milton?
"2 of them are bottom 10 picks in the draft which are almost garbage.   2015 draft: 9/10 never played a game, the other lasted half a season  2016 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups cut before finished their rookie deal, 2/10 were backups who finished their rookie contract and left the league  2017 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups who didn't last their rookie contract, 1/10 finished his rookie contract and did not resign. 1/10 is **Monte Morris**  2018 draft: 2/10 never played a game, 5/10 did not last one season, 2/10 are playing backup minutes today, 1/10 is Shake Milton  2019 draft: 2/10 did not play a game, 3/10 did not last a season, 5/10 are backup players the best of which is **Jalen McDaniels (19 MPG)**  2020 draft: too soon to judge but 1 of them never signed with the team"
"I understand it's value is pretty small But you can package it with other things to get actual assets.   And you can find contributors in that range. Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Jalen McDaniels are all recent picks in the 50s who have found big roles in the NBA quite quickly."
I think Cj + roco and maybe a protected first round pick for ben and shake Milton is the most viable trade.
"They‚Äôre not my team but I think they‚Äôll end up in it,  1. OKC  2. Kemba Walker, Darius Bazley, 2021 Boston 1st Rd, 2022 Phoenix 1st Rd &amp; 2023 Denver 1st Rd   3. Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton   4. IDK   5. Simmons is young enough to be a part of the Thunder rebuild and should mesh well with SGA. Milton is solid enough to start for OKC too.   Walker is still a solid PG and I think in the end this id the best they can get for Simmons, Bazley gives them a role player with some upside and the picks give them more ammunition to make other deals to help the team"
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
"How so?  Any 52nd pick or undrafted player who is even a viable bench player is a steal.    The best 50+ pick from 2010-2018 were Jeremy Evans, Isaiah Thomas, Robert Sacre, Ennis, Jordan Mcrae, Brandon Dawson (because he was literally the only one to play an NBA minute), Georges Niang, Monte Morris, and Shake Milton.  Isaiah was obviously an insane outlier.  The rest of the guys are either below average role players or not in the league."
"this is the one i‚Äôve been thinking about. minnesota and philly each send washington multiple firsts, washington gets beasley/maxey/mcdaniels?/okogie/salary filler. they can have shake milton too idc   simmons would be amazing in minnesota"
"Offer Simmons, Shake Milton and a future 1st"
"As a sixers fan I'm gonna be pissed if shake Milton is our 6th man next season, that inconsistent little shit"
1. Shake Milton  2. Furkan Korkmaz   3. Tyrese maxey   4. Matisse thybulle   5. Ben Simmons
Shake Milton lookalike
"No way we can offer Shake Milton, he‚Äôs completely untouchable.  Wolves fans get what I‚Äôm talking about with Jaden McDaniels.  When a young guy scores over 7 ppg, you can‚Äôt give that up in any circumstance"
"KAT for Danny green, shake Milton, and a first. Maybe a second as well"
It is... Would Shake Milton help?
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
Who's gonna run the offense? Shake Milton?
"I‚Äôm sure every fan base will hate this and call me an idiot but here‚Äôs a try:  Sixers get: SGA &amp; 1 of Sengun/Tate/Martin JR  Rockets get: Simmons &amp; Favors  OKC get: Shake Milton, Wall, ‚Äò22 Sixers 1st, ‚Äò27 Sixers 1st, ‚Äò23 Bucks 1st via HOU  Why:  Rockets get Simmons for a Bucks 1st, likely low pick and whichever of their prospects gets agreed upon while moving Wall. Seems like a no brainer and Simmons, KPJ, Green, Wood is pretty nice. Favors is filler.  Sixers get SGA and move Ben. Absolute no brainer. Plus a prospect wing/big to eat some Ben minutes on D  OKC - this is the biggest stretch but hear me out. The team is awful. They are tanking. SGA just got sat for half a season for winning too many games. SGA seems like he wants to play, improve and win and OKC are probably 2 years away from that at best. He won‚Äôt want to sit again so moving him may be more reasonable than it seems.  Wall burns 1 year at OKC to rehab value and either gets traded or bought out next year, final year. This would fit OKC timeline. They get 3 first round picks - add in more draft compensation or prospects from Philly where needed. Shake is a cheap flyer for them.   All fits on trade machine"
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"No shit.  You don't want Shake Milton, Seth Curry, or Tyrese Maxey as your primary playmaker."
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
"He showed good signs in summer league and there aren't any other options, you think Shake Milton can be a reliable playmaker? exactly, lol. Plus Ben Simmons is gone, for a pg, we don't know. So Maxey is the best bet rn."
That‚Äôd be pretty terrible. You can‚Äôt have Shake Milton or Tobias Harris running the offense
LOL fuck no. we're giving up the best player and the highest upside player in that trade. maybe replace maxey with shake milton. even then MEH
"Embiid flashed his jumper at Kansas, also, the sample size is extremely small. Was in the mid 40's in the beginning of the year then came down to .377 which is good but we need a much larger smaple to see if he's really improved.  It takes roughly 750 attempts for 3pt shooting to stabilize.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dyp9x0/fyi_it_takes_more_attempts_than_people_realize/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_num_comments  Embiid shot 154 attempts. It's probably just small sample size variance &amp; not real improvement, give it a couple years.  Shake Milton is a perfect example of this variance im talking about. .318 percent as a rookie. .430 percent as a sophomore which everyone would probably laud hos massive improvement but then this last year .350 percent, which is about league average. The 2nd season was just small sample size shooting variance. Also, like i said it takes about 750 attempts to stabilize but he's only shot 382 3's in his career, it's still too early to claim improvement.  You can throw out Korkmaz's first season it was 5/17 which is so small as a sample it's useless. The next 3 seasons he wen't 291/769 for .378% which is a stable sample. He was always a good shooter, he just needed enough attempts to see his percentage stabilize over time.  Mike Scott is just like Korkmaz, once he got enough attempts up his percentages stabilized, he didn't even attempt a 3 his first season.  Dwight is the same as he's always been idk what you're talking about. Just go look at his pecentahes from every area of the floor on bball ref."
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
"That essentially would've gutted the bench of any potential youthful talent which, maybe you didn't watch the Sixers playoffs this year, has underperformed greatly. Shake Milton had one good game, Maxey had a few nice offensive plays but as a rookie couldn't defend. Picking up Danny and Seth helped but one got injured and the other was a turnstile. Outside of Ben and Joel, Thybulle's the only one with any real defensive talent.  We have a generational talent in Embiid, but as the Nets proved this season, two great players might not be enough to carry a team to the end."
We had 23 year old Shake Milton at the 1 in the playoffs averaging 2.8 assists. The bar wasn't exactly high.
"Philly gets: Peyton Pritchard, Juan Toscano Anderson, AL Horford(money saving purposes next season) 1 first from Boston, 1 first from Golden State  Boston gets: Draymon Green, Shake Milton,  Jordan Poole  Golden state gets: Ben Simmons"
We aren't really a trade match with Boston but this thread was supposed to be realistic trades not jokes. I am not even sure what a realistic trade with Boston would be but maybe Simmons/Shake Milton/Seth Curry and 2 firsts for Jaylen Brown? Obviously a trade like this wouldn't happen but it's semi-realistic
"Lots of blazers fans actually like this deal. CJ is better but not by a lot, and tobi fits the blazers better. I would add in one (1) shake milton."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"What if it was Simmons, Shake Milton, and Curry for FVV + Siakam? You get off a massive overpay, get a promising young perimeter scorer, and a shooter + simmons."
"What about FVV + Siakam for Simmons, Seth Curry, and Shake Milton? Siakam is pretty nasty contract and who knows if he can turn around his play. Raptors get some shooting back + a young player and Simmons."
"Minnesota, with Memphis helping to facilitate.  Memphis gets McDaniels and Shake Milton, Philly gets Beasley, Beverly, Okogie, Dillion Brooks and picks Minny gets Simmons"
Hield/Mitchell/Bagley for Simmons and Shake Milton
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There‚Äôs a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
Blazers.  Simmons + Shake Milton for CJ and a 2025 first
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"Ben‚Äôs impact is a little hard to gauge though since he‚Äôs the only thing the Sixers have had that even resembles a point guard for the past half a decade. Without him, we‚Äôre starting Shake Milton at point guard. I‚Äôm pretty convinced that the roster construction is a bigger issue than Ben‚Äôs shortcomings"
"If the Sixers do this trade they're giving Shake Milton a shot at starting. Mitchell's not ready for that, he's a rook.   Edit: forgot the Sixers have Tyrese Maxey too."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
What happened to shake Milton who dropped like 40
"It's pretty rare that teams trade players 1 for 1.  Nah Portland wont rebuild unless Dame wants out, then theyll blow everything up, otherwise ownerships content making the playoffs and being a 1st-2nd exit.   I'd expect it to be something Simmons, Thybulle, Shake Milton, and 1-2 1st rn picks heavily protected, for CJ, Covington, Simons and a heavily protect 1st + 1-2 seconds"
Shake Milton. Eh? Eh?
"It is kinda tricky, the Kings are just not a good team to trade with for the 76ers. In that trade we desperately need someone who is capable of running the offense. Fox is that guy in Sacramento but I understand he's valuable for them.      THey are also high on Hali, who I think we would take, but he is not ideal for the Sixers, he is not a proven PG and he played a comboguard role. If they believe in Mitchell I guueeeess he could be on the table, but apparently it is not the case.     No way we would take a Hield/Barnes/Bagley based package - that would put sophomore Maxey, Shake Milton, a shoot first microwave guard who shouldn't really handle the ball for too long, and Seth Curry as our only point guards.      Dear Morey, please take the Wolves package and ask for D'Angelo Russell as its centerpiece. Both teams will be happy, D'Lo is a clutch shooter who can run the pick and roll - slow but steady."
"McDaniels is better than springer, Beasley is better than green, and Beverley is as good or better than shake Milton."
"What is wrong with these wolves fans on this subreddit lmfao. Like you are just throwing up horrific trade packages. Would you accept Shake milton, Danny green, and jaden springer for Anthony Edwards?"
I think Shake Milton is the X factor. Also possibly better than Maxey
Dwayne Bacon  Shake Milton  Devin Booker
Shake Milton - SM
Shake milton
Shake Milton.
shake milton??
"Yeah, I don't know enough about Tyrese Maxey's shooting and Shake Milton is out so it's hard to say if they have spacing or if they've been able to make adjustments yet."
"They are thinking all their picks and pick swaps for 7 years, all their crypto, Pat's and Gino's, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, and Tyrese Maxey for Damian Lillard and a Dutch Bros. Location.  Edit: Neil Olshey hangs up then calls Philadelphia Police to do a wellness check on Daryl Morey."
"Injured guard Shake Milton yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Furkan Korkmaz gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Tyrese Maxey yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Simmons hit the locker room door, current NBA great Joel Embiid hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Finally someone said it.   Shake Milton really needs to take responsibility.
"Next practice Simmons goes TOO hard, elbows Shake Milton in the face breaking his nose while securing a rebound in practice. Simmons publicly questions the ATO plays in detail to the media before they are run in a game situation.  Simmons tells Doc that 1 ring off a superteam isn't really an accomplishment and that the Celtics should be upset that is all they were able to win."
"No, they had to eventually bench him in closing minutes for Shake Milton because he was so pathetic he couldn‚Äôt even stay on the court"
"Simmons (LOL), Maxey  Curry, Shake Milton over Isaiah Joe b/c Doc is Doc  Green, Korkmaz/Thybulle  Harris, Niang  Drummond, Embiid"
"Both guys have hardly played.   And look at previous years...   Terrance Mann, Horton-Tucker, Eric Paschell, Bruce Brown, Diallo, Svi Mykhailluk, Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Dillon Brooks, Thomas Bryant...   These guys are actually playing minutes and were drafted in the 40s/50s. Its not that unusual."
"If OKC would agree to make the sixers 2025 1st round pick unprotected, then the sixers will have all but 1 of their draft picks. Seth Curry is on a really good contract and he would be valuable to any tanking team purely to flip for draft picks.  And maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe, are all quality young players. Even Paul Reed, Shake Milton, and Jaden Springer have a bit of trade value. Are any of them elite prospects? Hell no. Notice I said ""decent war chest of assets"". Not the best in the league. There are teams with better war chests.   Let's say dame became available in a trade. The knicks, nuggets and warriors could probably all beat the sixers best offer. But would the knicks be willing to go all in on Dame this early into their rebuild? We all know what Lacob has said about wanting to build for the future. Now maybe the warriors would go all in on dame, but it would cost a pretty penny to beat the sixers offer, and it's not clear that they would do that. And would the nuggets be willing to offer murray AND mpj? They can't even trade MPJ until next year because of the poison pill provision."
"Players averaging exactly 9.7 assists per 100 possessions this preseason: Scottie Barnes, Dean Wade, Shake Milton, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
&gt;You ever have a GF start shit talking you on ~~SM~~ *Shake Milton* after you break up? That's how I imagine this is but 100x worse.  Don‚Äôt think it stood for Shake Milton.
Shake Milton
But what about the great Shake Milton of course
"I mean with Lowry we would‚Äôve had no guarantee he would re sign and we also would lose our two best wing defenders. Despite what some people would like you to believe, it wasn‚Äôt just because of Ben that we lost that series. The Hawks wings were abusing us once Danny Green got hurt. K‚Äôvon Huerter doesn‚Äôt shoot over Seth Curry every possession if we had the ability to play Danny Green over Shake Milton and George Hill. Yes I think having Lowry would help but for the price Masai was asking I think we actually get worse"
Cant wait for Cam Thomas and Shake Milton to go back and forth in the 4th quarter
"Well, we are better off if he plays vs relying on tyrese maxey or shake milton to be our starting PGs, so there's that at least."
I always have trouble remembering Shake Milton is a name that is supposed to be relevant now not in the 1950s
Fine they can have Shake Milton too
Shake Milton absolutely torched us last season in the playoffs. Hes a sniper and shockingly good off the dribble
"&gt; a Milton/Curry/DG/Tobi/Joel line up is ... very Jazz-ish defensively (meaning expecting A TON/too much from your DPOY level player)  Hmmm I don't really agree with this. The lineup would be even worse defensively with Maxey in there. Not that he's a terrible defender but in terms of size, Shake can at least cover a couple positions while Maxey is undersized. Max and Curry likely get cooked by opposing guards and asking DG to be the only good backcourt defender is tough at 34. That's what I'm guessing is the main thinking anyway."
"Nothing makes a player feel wanted like publicly trying to trade him for 2 months after trying to trade him the year before.  Morey fucked this. If he was going to publicly shop Simmons he should have been prepared to actually make a deal, and if he wanted to wait around for Dame or Beal he shouldn't have been drunk dialling GM's at 1 am pitching trade offers. Now Morey has to eat shit whatever he does.  He ain't gonna look so smart when Embiid has his inevitable injury and misses 20 games and Shake Milton is putting up 15 shots a night."
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
This is what happens to bench dudes on lakers.   If Shake milton was on the lakers he‚Äôd be hyped beyond recognition
"That's the obvious one. No reason he couldn't pop in and just share knowledge. If Iverson can manage to teach Shake Milton how to do the last 2 dribbles before the basket, we should give him a full time gig and stake in the team."
I know it isn't his real name but Shake Milton also has such a *basketball name* as well.
The Shake Milton disrespect is sickening
"I'm not saying they're good but this is the list, excluded Joel of course, since Ben got mad whenever the sixers tried to sign other point guards.  Seth Curry  Shake Milton  TJ McConnell  JJ Redick  Alex Burks  Raul Neto  Markell Fultz"
And Shake Milton for a game. And Maxey for a game.   Guys stepped up to help fill the Benjamin void.
"Yeah, Embiid may try his best to carry but Shake Milton as the PG?"
"quitting on your teammates is real alpha dog shit for real lmao. The organization doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre just a business but the guys on the team need you and you‚Äôre just not showing up? Not just the Embiids chasing a legacy but like, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, Isaiah Joe, these guys need the team to succeed, need a role on a strong team that performs well to get them another contract. Not talking about the dudes making 110 million, the guys making $2m and hoping they have another contract in their career so they can set their kids up for life. But I guess if the ‚Äúfuck you I got mine‚Äù is alpha shit then"
Confirmed: Shake Milton wants out of Philly
Tbh that might change when we see Shake Milton as our lead ball handler to start the season lol
so what is shake milton? should he be cut?
"LeBron, Hakeem, Kris Humphries, Chris Lofton, and they didn‚Äôt have one for Danny so I did Shake Milton, John Salmons."
"Maxey is a great young player. Excellent combo guard, but he just isn't a full time PG. The only reason people are even entertaining the idea is because they hate the other guy so much. I'm afraid we will turn a fan favorite combo guard into a polarizing PG like we did Shake Milton. He has too much on his plate."
"Sixers shot themselves in the foot, credit to yall entirely for winning and out playing us but we were the better team we just blew cock. Took shake fucking Milton having his best stretch in like 5 minutes to push it to 7...No way in hell we beat Giannis with a banged up Embiid, he was too good last year.   You guys also did better than expected vs the bucks with a burnt out injured Trae too. I refuse to discredit the hawks anymore they earned my respect."
"Which one though, point guard Shake Milton or the center Shake Milton?"
Shake Milton.
"Obviously Simmons but lowkey a lot of Sixers fans hate Shake Milton too. He takes dumb shots and has a very low bball iq. He also takes away possessions from better younger players like Maxey and Furkan.   Part of this is Sixers fans love Embiid, Furkan, Niang, Maxey, Seth, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe to a borderline irrational extent so anybody else is viewed as lower than them. Even Tobias Harris gets some undeserved hate online."
"Yep, he also has some minutes competition from Shake Milton. I doubt we will see Shake play nearly as many minutes as Maxey for the rest of the season, but we know Doc has some sort of inexplicable need to play Shake 30+ minutes on random nights and that could cut into Maxey‚Äôs overall playing time a bit when the entire team is back healthy.   Also, there is the remote chance that Simmons returns to the team and who the hell knows what happens in that case."
In front of Doc Rivers? What a madman. Or was he shaking in front of Shake Milton? Cold blooded
Shake Milton hit one to end the 3rd too. Wild.
Yall want Shake Milton?
Ben Simmons shooting a 3 =&lt; Thanos Was Right &gt;= Shake Milton at the End of Quarters
"Shake Milton is 25 but I think he'll probably enjoy a long, low stakes career. He'll never be very expensive, can shoot, can handle if needed, usually good defense. I could see him being a guy like George Hill is currently - signing with a new team every year and being their backup."
"well sure, hali is much better than fox  I still think you'd do better with wing upgrades considering how tight your guard rotation is.   Do you get rid of shake milton or korkmaz?  danny green also has a lot of injury issues recently having some good wing depth would be pretty nice for you guys"
"especially since maxey just looks better than fox does, philly already has great guard depth even with simmons sitting out  maxey, curry, korkmaz, thybulle, shake milton  you can sacrifice some of these guys minutes to give some to fox but is it really worth it.   i'd rather have harrison barnes"
Shake Milton is neither young or irreplaceable
Well that could cost them a young player like Thybulle or Shake Milton
"shake milton- has made so much progress on his game but may have forgotten how to shoot threes, ya really hate to see it"
Not the best but Shake Milton 1.85 mil this year and 1.99 mil club option next year is quite friendly
What assets is anyone  giving up for shake Milton lmao
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton = Pistons   Kelly Olynyk + Harrison Barnes + Saddiq Bey = 76ers  Jerami Grant = Kings
"&gt; Simmons, Maxey, Milton, Thybulle  Shake is a serviceable backup guard who is most likely about to get overpaid in free agency this offseason - he's also already 25 and probably getting close to his ceiling.  Thybulle is a defense only specialist who holds no value to a tanking team and will get paid more by a contender than the Blazers would bother with in free agency in another year.    Neither of those two guys are interesting to a team blowing it up.  As for the Sixers picks - well it depends what and how much they'd be including.  In the near term those picks would be very late 1sts.  If you went out 4-5 years when Dame would be falling off a cliff and Embiid could be injured - well then yes those get interesting.  But again -  now it's coming down more to getting the best haul of picks than it is about getting Ben Simmons."
How good of an in game manager is Fox? That's the main thing the Sixers are missing now. Watching Shake Milton play PG with his head down and just chuck chuck chuck isn't my favorite thing in the world.
"This makes no sense. The roster outside of Ben is better than it was last year, and Joel is still Joel, so of course we can still play well when healthy without Ben. How does that say anything about his value? How can you say we wouldn‚Äôt be even better if he was taking minutes from guys like Shake Milton and Korkmaz?"

Yeah well when he‚Äôs second to shake Milton at 19 he definitely isn‚Äôt getting the ball as much as he should
"I would say he‚Äôs in a tier with De‚ÄôAnthony Melton, Shake Milton, Cody Zeller and Jimmy Butler."
[no name Sixer] knows Shake Milton ain‚Äôt passing it
Sixers SUCK Again!!! They need to trade Shake Milton for a bag of pennies üòÆ‚Äçüí®
"What you quoted isn't a slight to UD like he doesn't have friends in the locker room. What is clear is that there is a difference between him and the other players on the roster, with the understanding that he's the only guy who probably won't play meaningful minutes all year. That's not what a normal teammate would be, he is akin to a practice player more or less. He can have all the close relationships and help the chemistry etc. but he shouldn't be painted as just a normal player. He is far closer to coach or practice player than a genuine NBA player. I think that's what gets overlooked inside the Heat bubble.  Normally yes, you don't get much from the 15th roster spot but over 5 years you can convert a two way guy you develop into a rotation player for the playoffs like the sixers have with Shake Milton, Korkmaz, or Paul Reed. It's not a big deal at all, Spo and Riley are gonna keep doing it regardless but I don't think it's smart to do this for so many years. A retirement year or two sure, but 6-7 years? Misuse of resources and it speaks volumes nobody else in the league does this..."
"By that logic we should just trade him to anyone who can contribute. I don't think its smart to view it that way. The teams success has been in large part due to Simmons, we have 4 years of evidence of that. If we are to be a really good team and get back to those levels of 50+ wins each season we need defensive reenforcement, especially on the wing. It's not really a negotiable part of a Simmons deal, either from Portland or a 3rd team we'd need defense.  If our guards are Maxey, CJ, Seth Curry, Shake Milton and Danny Green we'd get cooked lol"
We‚Äôll trade him for shake Milton

shake milton needs to give him the ball
Also funny that Reggie seems to call Shake Milton as Shake Middleton lol
Shake Milton or Brick?
Shake Milton- malik Milton
Shake milton for me. Imagine Eric bledsoe with even more audacity
Shake Milton
"Shake Milton easy, our team will take off as soon as we get him off the team."
Shake Milton when he‚Äôs in ball hog mode
which dumb front office do you think we can offload shake milton to? Someone out there still has to think he's good
Shake Milton
"first, I didn't name Dame, Portland has other very good players.  CJ, Nurk, Norm, RoCo all have value to a potential contender.  second, if Portland were to do a Dame trade with the Sixers, they would probably get a haul in return.  we're talking every pick that the Sixers are allowed to trade, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, maybe they could also demand Tybulle.  And Simmons could be flipped for additional picks.  that's a lot to get back."
"The starters this year outside of Embiid:  Tyrese Maxey, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Paul Reed  Maxey's minutes doubled and so naturally his 3 PA went up. Seth Curry is shooting the same amount of 3PA pretty much (4.9 vs 5.2). Shake Milton is shooting 0.3 more 3PA and shooting 7% worse."

Shake Milton is such a dope name
"Ben Simmons,  Matisse thybulle, Shake Milton, and 2 frp for Tatum.   Neither team does this because they are huge rivals but I think it is fair"
"""Most will survive the next fortnight unscathed. But for this one lowly sophomore, a more treacherous fate awaits...""  \*cut to Shake Milton cowering in the corner as Embiid is about to whoop his ass\*"
"Our draft issues go back well before the KP trade. Our last good player we drafted before Luka was Josh Howard...in 2003. Or maybe Devin Harris in '04. Even on the rare occasions we drafted a player that could actually contribute, we end up trading them away before they do anything here (Olynyk, Shake Milton, etc.). We could've traded all those other picks away for cash and the result would probably be the same lol"
Shake ‚ÄòMagic Johnson‚Äô Milton
Dame is getting clamped one-on-one by shake milton
"I disagree. When Maxey plays, he doesn‚Äôt take bad shots like Milton does and he actually provides solid defense which makes him valuable even when his shot isnt falling. Also, Maxey is much younger so he‚Äôs got potential to be waayyyy better than Shake."
"I don't really think so, a lot of what made Maxey effective is that he was a change of pace. He did most of his damage when he first came in in the 1st or 2nd quarter or whatever, if I'm not mistaken, his only points after that were end-of-game free throws.   I don't think it's any different from Shake Milton or whoever off the bench that's had good games previously going off. You ruin a lot of that by making them start and just play throughout the whole game.   Not to mention you cut the juice of your bench, because Simmons off  the bench isn't doing anything for you."
"He doesn‚Äôt have to get traded but he has to change positions. Him playing PG is a charade, if he wants to handle the ball he has to crash the boards and push it in transition. It‚Äôs ego unfortunately, he genuinely thinks he‚Äôs like a pure pg, he has 50% of the skills of an average pg, that‚Äôs how bad it is. He is a good player his development has just been botched. Brett brown wanted to move him off ball and it basically got him fired. People don‚Äôt get it but Simmons opted for surgery for the same injury Embiid has on both knees last year, he did it like one game after he got moved off ball and Shake Milton became the starting PG.   He‚Äôs a competitor, I won‚Äôt slight him in that regard but he‚Äôs not that good to just be totally uncoachable."
Shake Milton has gotten no minutes? Was he bad last game?
That wasn‚Äôt Simmons fault. Shake Milton is trash and shouldn‚Äôt play
Shake Milton dribbled for 24 seconds and jacked up a shit shot so I think you‚Äôre a liar
Lmao this series would been over if Shake Milton didn‚Äôt go nuclear game 2.. think about it god damn 76ers
Maxey is about to Shake Milton the Hawks...
Were the Rockers really that super-high on Maxey that they hinged the entire deal on him? I get he had some good games here and there but he‚Äôs getting outplayed by Shake Milton right now. Maxey shouldn‚Äôt be moving the needle in Harden trade unless the Rockets are delusional about his value.
"I will do simmons and 2 firsts for him absolutely  we cant afford to also lose seth curry though, if you want shake milton you can have him  but absolutely the sixers should be willing to try to make something like that work"
"even without his injury, they depend on him too much. He's a giant 7 foot center, common sense would suggest it would be hard for him to go all out the whole game on both sides. If you watch the sixers, the most obvious thing in the world is that they have nobody who scares a defense other than Embiid, other teams would gladly live with harris postups or shake milton drives."
"Seriously, does no one remember how awful we looked last year vs the Celtics when Shake Milton was our primary ball handler  Now if you can swap Tobias as well for a capable PG, that might be interesting"
"lol Simmons may be shit and his value has decreased, but he's certainly still a valuable asset.   Also, Curry, Maxey, Thybulle, Shake Milton, and many picks"
"I'm not that surprised. Joel is not 100% and is getting gassed by the 4th in every game. Tobias Harris has always been an inconsistent clutch scorer. Ben Simmons can't shoot. So they don't need to be great defenders. Because the sixers aren't a dynamic offensive team and lou and trae are quick at least and give effort and can stick with Seth. Sixers have won and will win games where Maxey goes off or Shake Milton makes a bunch of contested shots late. I just don't think that is sustainable, if not for this series, the next. Ben Simmons can't take a game over, because he's always at risk of missing 2 free throws. Tobias Harris can take over like once a series and that's it. Jo Jo isn't right and is exhausting himself early."
Lol it happened yesterday. Doc subbed in shake milton for Simmons with 4 minutes left and up like 8 because of the hack a Simmons. Simmons was subbed back in with like 2 mins remaining because they were only up by 4 and knew the hack a Simmons would stop
"Shake Milton cooked us when we played you guys. Of course it's Doc, so he's gonna go with his gut and keep his stars happy instead of changing the game plan."
"The core of a trade where CJ and draft compensation leaves Portland and Ben Simmons goes to Portland seems to fit perfectly for Portland - Ben fills their need of a wing defender, secondary ball handler, rebounder, guy to run the fast break, and a dude who can keep the ball moving on offense, while being the fifth option. Meanwhile they get to move on from one of their two starting SGs to get an actual wing. Dame/Norm/Ben/RoCo/Nurk is an incredible roster.   I think the Sixers could turn some combination  of CJ, Seth, Danny, picks, and young players (thybulle, maxey, etc) into a SF and/or PG. maybe Marcus Smart for Danny Green and a 1st, that way you have your ball handler and defense.   All you need at that point is a SF in return for CJ or Seth plus picks and/or young guys, and maybe George Hill as filler. Maybe some combination of George Hill, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and 1sts for Jerami Grant? I could see Detroit being interested in Maxey, Milton, and 1sts.   Smart/CJ/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Seth as sixth man looks really solid to me."
"&gt;Ben is NOT a scorer.  There is not being a scorer, and there is being unable to score.   &gt;i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him  Why would anyone want to expend the resources to trade for him, eat his massive contract, and then some more resources on top of that for ""the team around him""  &gt;rather than Joel Embiid  Won't a team with Simmons on it always be built around someone else since he can't be the primary star?  &gt; whatever team Ben Simmons goes to will need to build a lineup full of shooters that can hide Ben‚Äôs lack of a jumpshot  You mean like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, George Hill, Joel Embiid, Furkan Korkmaz, Isiah Joe, and Shake Milton... all of whom are 35%+ plus 3PT shooters, most of whom are ~40%+ shooters....  &gt;hich would open up the lane for Ben **to drive and then either finish** or kick it out to a shooter.  They can already do this and Ben doesn't because he knows he's gonna get hacked at miss more FTs."
"Tbf Curry feasted, but the sixers don't really have another guard to take advantage of the mismatches. Maybe Shake Milton but the Hawks were ready for that lol."
Definitely!!  They really made Maxey the holdup in the Harden trade.  In reality Maxey and Thybulle are just role players. Thybulle is literally the second coming of Tony Allen and Maxey is a chucker.  They hyped up Shake Milton only for him to barely get any PT in the playoffs.  Sixer fans could convince people that their earth is flat
Embiid was lights out the first quarter. I think it was a career high playoff quarter. Seth curry had the best game of his career. The sixers were shooting 80% from the field for the first 3rd of the game. Korkmaz is shooting the best hes ever played. Everyone makes excuses for the 76ers like they're just playing bad.  I can do the same thing. If shake Milton didn't have the best moment of his career going on a solo 15 run itd be 4-1.
"Am I wrong for thinking that Shake Milton can take that role? I'm not a 76ers fan by any means, but Ive been a fan of Shake all year. It just seems like he produces so well when he's out there and meshes well with the starters, plus he has great court vision for long passes and can knock down midrange 2s and 3s better than most on his team"
So you would agree with a little shake milton for SGA trade then? Perfect
"Philly fans have an annual tradition of trying to gaslight the rest of us fans into thinking that [insert young player here] is miles better than he actually is.   Simmons, Shake Milton, Thybulle, etc. They are good at one thing and Philly fans act as if their one good skill is so elite that it makes up for everything else they lack."
"10 minutes in and he put in George Hill and Shake Milton at the same time. Hill, at least on the Sixers, is consistently the worst player on the floor,  Shake if not hot, which he rarely is, is right there with him. This whole series is frankly on Doc and his inability to creative sound lineups and get his players to at least make an attempt.  Should‚Äôve had Embiid rest the first game for his injury and risk the L so he would be able to play more than 25 minutes without dying. Shouldn‚Äôt have put Green on Trae basically the whole first game when he just kept getting cooked. Should‚Äôve taken out Ben every time they started intentionally fouling him.   Our players are ass but our coach is the entire digestive system."
Larry Brown coached him well at Shake Milton University

"This is the type of stuff that makes me turn games off sometimes as much as I love the NBA. James Harden jumps 5 feet forward into the defender and gets the foul call, Shake Milton slightly exaggerates his shot motion to draw contact on Herro who's already completely in his space playing illegal defense and no call? Just so dumb."
"Shake Milton is such a great name, he could be a folk hero or something with a name like that."
"Tilman sucks and all, but do we really know that Morey was offering Simmons?  Harden got pretty fat and stopped giving a shit so his value at that point was an all time low. Add in the fact that A) Morey prolly hates Tillman and B) Everyone knows harden wants out so his values even lower.   I honestly could see Morey just offering a package of shake milton, Mattise and maybe 1 or 2 picks that fertitta declined in favor of more picks from Brooklyn (although I think those picks will be shit)"
SM = Shake Milton + Sixth Man
"Ohhhh shit, Shake Milton is a real person"
Shake Milton  Milt like the first 4 letters of his last name. Rhymes with milk.   Milkshake ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-&gt; Miltshake
"Shake ""Slim Harden"" Milton"
Shake ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna smack the shit out of you‚Äô Milton
"Shake ""Stop talking about this Maxey guy"" Milton"
SMOY Shake Milton of the year
"Hmm, well i started watching NBA last year, and i got to say that Shake Milton is the goat. Thoughts?"
Where‚Äôs that dude that made the post about how dare people refer to Shake Milton as SM? SM all the way baby!
"Easy win, but obviously Miami is in a shitty spot right now.  This win means as little as the results of the previous three games where either our or/and the other team were not fully available.  Shake Milton is legit a contender for 6th man  With all the scorers on this team maybe Ben really will be a DraymondGreenOnCrack kinda supportive guy. Don't give a fuck if he averages 20 or 13 as long as we win"
I love shake milton
I can‚Äôt believe we are paying Shake Milton $7.25 an hour to score 31 points in an NBA game
when shake milton banked in that 25 footer to end the first quarter it was over from there
"The dude that hit the game winner only played the last two minutes lmao. At least the guys played with effort, all u can ask for when u got 8 guys back to back games. Shake Milton looked like McCollum out there"
Shake ‚ÄúSlim Harden‚Äù Milton
Shake and Bake Milton was cooking tonight damn
I heard the Rockets called Morey saying that they would trade Harden for Shake Milton in a straight up trade.  Morey hung up immediately.
Shake Milton is Tyler Herro if he could defend and didn‚Äôt have T-Rex arms.
Shake Milton is such an absolute baller in the Doc Rivers 6 man role
Shake ‚ÄúKobe Bryant‚Äù Milton
Does anyone else thing that Shake Milton looks kinda like Chadwick Boseman?
Shake Milton
Sure but some rings have much stronger arguments for why they're weaker. I can argue shake milton is the goat but I'm not gonna get very far
Just imagine the duo of NAW and Shake Milton going up against the Clippers lol
This game reminded me of that Sixers game last season when Shake Milton went Super Saiyan but we still won.  Kennard needs to get more aggressive or just become a catch and shoot guy.
I remember Shake Milton went for 39 against you guys
&gt; Sexton/Garland/KPJ/Okoro/Allen future babyyyy  KPJ? Is that Shake Milton?
"Jarrett Allen &amp; Levert are better than Maxey &amp; Thybulle?  Wtf is it about Sixers prospects/former prospects and getting hyped to high heaven. Shake Milton, Shamet, Maxey &amp; Thybulle are future All-NBA locks if you only read this subreddit and don‚Äôt actually follow or watch basketball."
shake milton doesnt know how to handle the ball?
shake milton??
 ‚ÄúMaxey can play but he reminds too much of Shake Milton on a team that doesn‚Äôt need another Shake Milton‚Äù Are you nuts I‚Äôd love to have another Shake Milton on this team
&gt;Maxey can play but he reminds me too much of Shake Milton on a team that doesn't need another Shake Milton.  I don't understand this at all. They're very different. One is a true 1 with great quickness that makes his driving ability (plus his floater) impressive. The other is a combo guard who has better shooting ability right now and a slower driving ability that relies on his length to score.
"I think if PJ Tucker is involved in this I would side with you on this. If he isnt.........man that's hard.   The perimeter/wing defense becomes an issue with this trade(of course you still do it but doesnt mean this isnt true). Lakers had to put AD on Jimmy Butler last year because Danny Green couldnt do it. Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Tobias Harris, James Harden, Danny Green, those are your realistic perimeter defensive options  It's close. If the cost of PJ Tucker is it requires me to give up Maxey instead of Thybulle I would do that though."
"&gt; At the end of the day, a team can‚Äôt win a championship with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer and Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz as the secondary ball handlers.  Why not?   Our team this year actually built around Simmons strengths and Embiid's influence on the defense.   If Seth Curry and Danny Green get hot at the right time we are one of the best teams in the league.  Great defense and 3 pt shot making/creating with a dominant interior presence.  Meme all you want but Simmons is arguably the best player at getting his teammates good looks from 3.  The problem has always been we werent able to spread the floor enough for him to do it especially in the playoffs because him and Embiid arent a great fit.     Outside of shooting a tad bit better, Simmons is similar to Giannis.  The difference being one team has a top 3 center and the other doesnt so they were able to build a more functional team around what Giannis does."
Shake Milton ? Assuming because of flair
Shake Milton has entered the chat
"Yeah sure however you have to also realize the Sixers were without some of their key players like Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, and Matisse Thuybulle."
He's not a front runner now but Shake Milton will be in the conversation if he gets his 3P% right.
You‚Äôre seriously complaining about giving up *Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey* in a trade for James Harden? Seriously?
"Salary doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs about 4 million too much for the Sixers to take back, and the bench is wrong. You‚Äôre missing Shake Milton. You could add mike Scott but then we don‚Äôt have a backup 4."
"Shake ""Lil Milkshake"" Milton is in his third year, put some respect on his name."
"Good question. My picks might be understandably controversial. Shake Milton, OG Anunoby, and Terrence Ross."
Yes he is. And thats great...you go ahead and rely on seth curry and shake milton to be the next best scorers. Ill take one of the greatest of all time in harden.
Did not help that Tobias was shooting bricks and literally no one outside of Shake Milton was an actual threat from 3.
"That's Philadelphia 76ers All-Star guard Malik ""Shake"" Milton to you, heretical Heat fan!"
Damn I was ready for Marv to call Shake Milton Milkshake!
Ya you need any consistent shooter tbh. Seth is perfect. But he is going to have to be able to create off the dribble consistently for them to achieve. Shake Milton is decent tho I like him
Shake Milton is a top 30 player and I‚Äôm not hearing a word otherwise
"This is unrelated, but some excellent pro-Shake Milton propaganda in this stat"
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
"It doesn‚Äôt take long to see he can play.  With better shooters around him, he will look even better.  Curry, Korkmaz, and Shake Milton make him better.  Hell, he has even looked good with Simmons in the dunker position."
almost like missing 3 starters (4 if you think danny shooting 0/8 doesnt count as a starter) and shake milton vs missing 2nd stringers makes a difference
Shake milton head ?
"I could see Philly wanting him to get a pg that‚Äôs not Simmons that can space the floor. Plus Lowry can go to his hometown . The package could be shake Milton, Matisse thybull, and a second pick"
"It makes sense for Talen Horton Tucker.   Abbreviating to THT makes more sense than those examples.   Shake Milton abbreviated to SM isn't the same.  And Russell Westbrook abbreviated isn't either.  Announcers say ""THT"" all of the time, so do talking heads, journalists and everyone in the basketball world that's talking about him, whereas no one calls Russell Westbrook RW when announcing him, or writing about him. ""Yet here we are"" to two totally different things.   If a player is referred to by an abbreviation all of the time, that's what he's known by. Just look it up. Other than that I do agree if someone is abbreviating dudes like Russ, etc. That never makes sense."
"It's a callback to the SM, Shake Milton post a few days back."
Or as his father refers to him. Milk Man's son Shake Milton aka MMSSM.
Shake Milton? You mean SM?
And what I hope the Sixers do with Shake Milton the rest of the season
"COVID protocol Shake Milton, COVID protocol KD, and 3 injured players on my squad... All this week.   Yeah my match ups are screwed for the next two weeks =("
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
"The Philadelphia 76ers guard, Shake Milton, had 39 points against the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2019-2020 season (Thanks Magic)"
&gt;Start him what they waiting for  He's being blocked by Shake Milton in a 100% healthy lineup. He'd already be starting on most other teams
How about ‚ÄòShake and Make‚Äô for the duo of Maxey and Milton!
"Shake ""future HoF"" Milton to you"
"Ok? Shake Milton is on that list dude, and Wall literally played only 5 games lol  He's been aight, nothing more"
There was a post about it because someone used SM for shake milton. It was pretty funny
Shake Milton
Shake Milton though
They also called Tyrese Maxey Shake Milton at one point. They're a mess.
"I get that their playing well, but man, every single issue that they've had for past years reared its head during yesterday's game against the nets. 0 spacing, team looked better with shake milton running the offense vs simmons tbh."

"To be fair, that is literally where the nickname 'Shake' Milton comes from. His father was nicknamed 'The Milkman' in the NBA (which is objectively dope), and since Milton was his son they called him 'Milkshake'. Which was shortened to just Shake. Kinda sweet honestly."
Shake Milton is too much of a ball hog to start.
6ers with a shameful performance. Shake Milton can‚Äôt be your best player. Even when the Nets are missing their 3 best players
Apparently everybody called Shamet or Shake milton
Shake Milton is who Landry Shamet thinks he is
Marv calling Shake Milton Milkshake was hilarious though.
Philly hasn't realized that they need to run the offense through Shake Milton??
"He called Maxey, Shake Milton earlier. Close enough is good enough I guess."
Philadelphia 76ers All-Star guard Shake Milton
Shake Milton reminds me of a mini KD
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Shake Milton and Tobias Harris seem way better than last season
Shake Milton All NBA player name
Shake Milton 6MOTY
i know y'all need the karma but in reality embiid averaged 30/13 last playoffs while the rest of his team was either injured or doing fuck all besides shake milton
"Seth, Danny and Shake Milton in a bigger role are going to be massive difference makers for the Sixers this season. Their shooting abilities are really allowing Embiid to thrive more in the paint and the whole team is just clicking really well in general."
"Russ on defense gets blown apart by Seth Curry and Shake Milton. On offense he doesn't initiate fast break anymore, opting to hunt the rebound and bring the ball up slow. He doesn't drive. He doesn't draw fouls. What he doesn't give away as turnovers, he gives away as shitty mid range shots.  Russ isn't the problem, but he is a problem."
the only shake is milton
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"Embiid actually has space to work, they have legit 3 point shooters and Embiid has also improved a lot at passing out of the double team.  So basically, Embiid will kill you if you go against him one on one but if you double or triple him he can kick it out to Curry or Green who are legit 3 point threats.  Curry has actually exceeded expectations as well, playing more like a fringe all-star than the solid role player people expected.   Tobias is playing great. Might be the Doc Rivers effect as Tobias had his best years under him.   So the offense is much better and the team is locked in defensively (besides the most recent game against the Wizards) with Simmons looking like a DPOY candidate early on  Finally, they have a much better bench this year than last year. The Sixers would cough up so many leads last season due to a bad 2nd unit. This year, Dwight has been great as a backup while Shake Milton and Maxey have been solid as well."
But is he better than Shake Milton+Seth Curry?
Luke Kennard out here playing like Shake Milton

All these Sixers fans calling the Jazz a fake 1 seed lmao. Yall a Shake Milton run away from being down 0-2.
Shake Milton
"We just need to ensure the likes of Solomon Hill don‚Äôt have to start for us. Best perimeter wing defenders are injured still. Harris is a great scorer but he can‚Äôt score as easily on Hunter as he did on Hill.   I‚Äôd rather us keep our depth, that‚Äôs what gets us through games when Trae is off. The only problem is literally all our starters shat the bed at once lmao and we were one Shake Milton run out of competing down the stretch"
The legit co-star is Shake Milton.
The entire problem with Shake Milton was he didn't have his snickers yet.

Shake Milton slander will not be tolerated.
SHake Milton = Sixers cheat code
Is Shake Milton the second coming of Jesus Christ?
Embiid just proved he‚Äôs the best player in the league. I don‚Äôt even think guys like KD or Kawhi can sit back and watch Shake Milton take over this game like Embiid did tonightüî•
Looks like Shake Milton owns a percentage of that casino he bet in
Milton had enough of the bench‚Äôs drought and turned the arena into a Shake Shack!  Philly crowd was amazing during that last quarter
"""Shake Milton"" pffft we fuckin know it's you AI, take off the mask. You think you slick?"
Shake Milton activated team takeover near the end of the 3rd. They had a 23-4 run at one point.
"When you prepare for Ben Simmons, but get Shake Milton on the test"
That might've been the most boring fourth quarter of basketball I've ever watched. Poor execution. So many stoppages and foul baiting. Shake Milton saved the night.
Shake Milton would be the best player on your bum ass team.
are you trying to say that shake milton never plays point? please type that out to me
Dude went off. You don‚Äôt game plan for Shake Milton. It sounds like the salt is coming from you as a Knicks fan....
"Tough outcome but Hawks fans gotta be happy with how the first two games of this series went. Stole game one and stayed competitive until Shake Milton turned into Steph. Gotta be optimistic that while Embiid is gonna get his no matter what, we have a solid chance at outscoring his supporting cast back home in Atlanta   Game 3 will be telling"
Shake Milton lol
Hawks fans are so salty lmao. Your brilliant coach can‚Äôt stop shake fuckin Milton????
shake milton
Shake Milton
"Hawks fan, very happy.  76ers were one Shake Milton nuclear explosion away from this being a very tough game in the 4th, even with Trae not having any made 3s and the Sixers shooting 50%+ from 3 for the game.  Hawks had a TON of sloppy turnovers tonight. Philly crowd almost definitely getting to them a little, but we're a young team - first playoff run, and we clawed back from big deficits twice against the 1 seed while on the road."
How did Embiid even get MVP votes with Shake Milton on the same team smdh
Took their best punch early and rallied back. We‚Äôll see if shake Milton and Scott foster show up in game 3. Going home 1-1 I‚Äôm im feeling good tbh
Shake Milton going off there was the game-changer. I thought it would be Maxey giving us fits off the bench not him.
The Hawks worked so hard to fight their way back and take the lead only for Shake Milton to walk on the court and run them off the floor
Shake Milton is a myth
Embiid just proved he‚Äôs a top 5 player in the league. People might say it‚Äôs guys like KD but I don‚Äôt even see him sitting back and watching Shake Milton take over this game like Embiid just did üî•
"This game is close if shake Milton doesn‚Äôt blow it wide open.  Despite philly D having trae absolutely in a cage hawks were still fine.  Trae won‚Äôt be held in a cage for 3 more games, shake won‚Äôt wake up for 3 more games.  Hawks probably pretty happy with 1-1 and home court advantage."
SHAKE MILTON.

How about Shake Milton?
I'd understand if he were left off a few. But somebody out there really thinks Shake Milton was a better 6th man? Bobby Portis? Campazzo? Some of those votes must have left him off given how many ballots he wasn't on.

Shake Milton got a 2nd place vote....
"It‚Äôs such a deep class too. You got Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, Shake Milton, De‚ÄôAnthony Melton, Alize Johnson all carving out solid careers or showing flashes as second-round picks. 2018 might just turn out to be one of the best classes ever tbh."
"Guys like Alec Burks and Shake Milton are so valuable, just absolute walking buckets off your bench."
"lakers will really lose game 1 in a series theyre favored in and r/nba instantly rushes to their computers to post about how they're ""probably gonna lose this series"" like bruh would you be posting ""should the suns trade devin booker and chris paul for shake milton"" if the suns lost lmao"

Shake Milton has the record for most consecutive 3PM

Who is Shake Milton?
"Up to this day, I didn't know there was a NBA player named Shake Milton."
shake milton with the driveby. RIP
At first I was like- who the F is Shake Milton?!?  The after about 10 minutes of research I realized you meant SM.
That's future all-star shake milton to you sir
was he talking about shake milton
"Are you sure you don't just suck at picking up on the context clues? I never seen anyone call someone by their initials in this sub unless they're already well known by initials or if the player is being discussed in the thread. So chances are you seen SM in a thread about Shake Milton or at the very least, a thread about the 76ers. Context my dude."
Shake MiltonüòÇ
Shake Milton Head
Who the fuck thinks the Jazz needs shake milton on there team? Maybe their Gleague affiliate does but goddamn
LMAO I was not thinking sm was gonna be shake milton. Dude is nowhere near having an initial nickname
I like shake milton
this made me holler. why tf would they say SM for Shake Milton. I'm dead.
&gt; *‚ÄùJazz could use someone like SM‚Äù*   tbh the first person I could think of  (without reading the next sentence) was Shake Milton
"as a sixers fan, I'm happy yall are already calling Shake Milton 'SM'. He is getting stronger."
I will now start calling Shake Milton SM
Shake Milton hype train
"Wapo, Dems, and presser are nothing even remotely like SM for Shake Milton. Old man yells at cloud."
"It‚Äôs probably just cause he played for my university, but I immediately thought of Shake Milton when OP wrote SM"
Isn‚Äôt Jordan Clarkson a lot like Shake Milton?
Protein Shake Milton
Shake Milton is the truth tho
&gt;_AND I HAVE TO WASTE 10 MINUTES GOING THROUGH THEIR POST HISTORY AND GOOGLE TO FIND OUT THIS __MF__ WAS TALKING ABOUT \*SHAKE MILTON\*_  MF? Michael Finley? Markelle Fultz?
Lmao shake Milton
"Shake is already his nickname. I'd rather call Shake, 'Shake', than SM.  [Here's the article.](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/shake-milton-nickname-sixers-starting-point-guard)"
You missed the whole point of the post. He‚Äôs talking about people referring to random role players by their initials ie. SM Shake Milton
Whoever abbreviated Shake Milton deserves to be shot
There's a guy called Shake Milton?
"As a Sixer fan I don't recall seeing anyone refer to Milton as SM. Shake, Milton or Shake Milton but not SM. A guard named Shake is already pretty cool. Why use an acronym? And I'm not saying you didn't see someone call him SM, I'm just saying I never seen Sixer fans call him that."
 &gt; AND I HAVE TO WASTE 10 MINUTES GOING THROUGH THEIR POST HISTORY AND GOOGLE TO FIND OUT THIS MF WAS TALKING ABOUT *SHAKE MILTON*  Who the hell is MF......
Shake Milton is untouchable !!!
&gt; AND GOOGLE TO FIND OUT THIS MF WAS TALKING ABOUT *SHAKE MILTON*    who is MF?
"Shake ""malt"" Milton"
"To be fair, the first name that came to mind when you said SM was Shake Milton"
Shake Milton
"&gt; AND I HAVE TO WASTE 10 MINUTES GOING THROUGH THEIR POST HISTORY AND GOOGLE TO FIND OUT THIS MF WAS TALKING ABOUT SHAKE MILTON   Man, why are you wasting your time doing this? Just move on with your day, do you really care that much about what some nephew on /r/nba has to say?"
"I have been clowning on Tobias Harris since his early-season slump last year. Holy shit, outside of game 1, he‚Äôs looked really good to start this season.  I think he and Doc link up well. Also helps that we finally have two legit threats from deep in Seth Curry and the continually impressing Shake Milton.  I‚Äôm a little worried bc I feel hope right now, hahah"

How did they not sub Trae Young earlier in this 76ers run?  Should have happened as soon as the Sixers got a double digit lead.  Questionable if not idiotic coaching.  Might cost them the game.  Shake Milton too gud

"In all fairness, this is the Shake Milton of 2020. He's been so cold post all star break, but at one point was our 3rd leading scorer per game behind Embiid and Harris."
Shake Milton having double the points of Simmons in 27 less minutes is kinda funny even y‚Äôall gotta admit that Philly fans

"Shake Milton, its a bold pick"
What was the last game Shake Milton played in?
Would you rather have Roberson or Shake Milton on the floor during crunch time?  I‚Äôd say Roberson
Shake Milton and the 38 second playoff game. Stepped out of bounds with the ball nearly the moment he got into the game.
Fucking SHAKE MILTON was getting minutes at the start of the 4th despite being like -40 in the series versus the Wizards. I was beside myself and then before I knew it Shake stepped out of bounds with the ball like the first second he was in. 38 seconds of absolute panic from me.
"I feel like they have to play Shake Milton. I like Maxey but he doesn‚Äôt really spread the floor, especially when he mostly plays with Thybulle and Dwight."
The 76ers bench units just have no offense at all right now. It was Maxey trying to carry and then they got Shake Milton in trying to bring some juice
I forgot Shake Milton played for them
"Is Shake Milton injured, is Grant Hill dating Doc's other daughter, does Doc have another daughter, why is Hill in when he does nothing and Shake is a scorer? So little makes sense about philly right now. Danny Green is embarassingly bad at defending short guards."
"Ah, a fellow clippers fan with pstd from the shake milton game"
What happened to shake Milton?
"I think you need to attend to the definitions of these terms that people provide. You've taken ""replacement level"" to basically mean ""unplayable"". That is *not* what the makers of BPM used the term to mean.  [From their explanation](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html)  &gt;-2.0 is a bench player (this is also defined as ""replacement level"")  AKA they are saying that a very good g-league player/overseas player is capable of stepping into the role of the average player that comes off the bench and sees minutes. -2 also serves as a CUT OFF, with everything below that falling into a replacement level group. Replacement does *not* mean unplayable, and they demonstrate that by saying:  &gt;Below -2.0 are many end-of-bench players  AKA NBA teams all have a few of these players and they're typically the benchwarmers.   &gt;Zero wins doesn't mean that a player isn't hurting a team -- it means that they're a substantially liability when they're on the floor  Based on what? [Read how wins are estimated and calculated](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html). A player that does not get a share of the win does not mean the player hurt the team. That's what negative win shares are for. Because again, it would make no sense statistically or practically to assume that all players coming off the bench are hurting their team. If only we had a word that could communicate when something isn't significantly impacting something in one way or another....oh yea...neutral.  &gt;if the worst guys in the league who sometimes see minutes by necessity are neutral,  But as BPM states,  what you've described here is the replacement level group that falls below their replacement level cut off. You're assuming players *at the cut-off* should be described with everyone in the group. This isn't the case. It's why players at the cut-off are assigned neutral cumulative value AND why the person who helped to identify a replacement level group in the NBA identified that the players at the margins are always the issue. It is not meant to be a sharp cut-off at which players at the level contribute no value, and the author struggled with this because several players that were clearly contributors were falling into his replacement level group at the margin.   Because of this, a replacement level player, especially AT the cut-off, is capable of contributing to an NBA bench according to BPM. What you're confusing is the cut-off with end-of-bench level/deep into the replacement level group. Those players have *negative* wins added because they are *detrimental* to a team.   Replacement, especially at the cut-off, doesn't mean *this player shouldn't be in the league*. [Again, the person the cite for their discussion on replacement level  just did it by taking an arbitrary group of bench players are declaring them replacement and then played with the numbers post-hoc until he identified an acceptable group](http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/what-is-a-replacement-level-nba-player). Replacement is a concept taken from baseball used to assign the relative impact of a presumed player, in this case from the g-league. So statistically we know that replacement isn't set at the ""this player shouldn't be in the league"" or ""this player is actively hurting the team"" but rather ""another professional player could likely contribute this for the league minimum"". Which is why *I said* considering his role (bench) and salary (minimum), his impact was neutral at worst. That's *just* going off the impact and ignoring [chemistry](http://philipmaymin.com/papers/Maymin%20Maymin%20and%20Shen%20-%20NBA%20Chemistry%20-%20IJCSS.pdf), which dictates *why* the majority of teams will still have young guys and/or veterans that seem to be at replacement level in their rotation even during the playoffs.     It's because of this we can do a real world test and see most of the playoff teams have/had a player at that cut-off that is a part of their rotation: Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Solomon Hill, P.J. Tucker,  etc.   &gt;You should just name names for ""many of them"" because there are only five reputable all-in-ones, being generous to RPM, and they disagree about how to turn plus-minus into wins even though they're all designed to approximate RAPM.  I think part of our issue is I'm not sure you're interpreting replacement level correctly and I'd love for you to cite where *you're* getting your interpretation from."
"Ben Simmons, Shake Milton and some firsts/swaps whatever."
"Probably not. We have 3 or 4 guys on our bench who are better or equal to him in how they impact the game. (Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, George Hill). I might trade Korkmaz for him (though that‚Äôs close because I REALLY like Furkan) I would trade Shake Milton for him with no hesitation."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
"Ya lmao, I share a birthday with shake milton"
"They should just trade him to the Sixers so he can finish his career playing alongside his brother.   George Hill, Isaiah Joe, Shake Milton, Paul Reed and a 1st. Make it so, Daryl."
"2018 could be top 5 potentially, it's got quality and depth. Ayton, Luka, Trae all have HOF potential. MPJ, SGA, Sexton, JJR, Mitchell Robinson all have all star potential too. Then u got decent role players in both Bridges, Timelord, Divencenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr, Bruce Brown &amp; Shake Milton near the end of the draft. K Nunn and Duncan Robinson went undrafted this year too. Had so much fun with this class in 2kmygm."
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
"Maxey Thybulle Simmons and 2-3 1sts is a great offer.  Not sure it would take all of that honestly. Sixers probably wouldnt want to give up Thybulle if theyre losing Ben.  Throw in a Paul Reed, Isiaha Joe or a Shake Milton."
How dose shake Milton sound
Shake Milton
no love for Shake Milton?
"Shake Milton was drafted 58th in 2018 and traded to Philly. I know Shake stock is a little down right now, but he still is a good piece for the Sixers."
Shake Milton too!
Ben is the glue in philly   People won‚Äôt realize till he‚Äôs gone and they‚Äôre relying on Shake Milton
&gt;I feel like people are hung up on the idea of Richardson rather than actual player  Exactly. We will be pulling this same scam with Shake Milton in the offseason. Anyone want a combo guard who can shoot the ball and playmake in a pinch?
"Yeah and the bench was excellent tonight, they held us in the game in the 1st half. Shake Milton, for whatever reason, has not found a fit in this new offense though, he took a slight step back this year."
RIP Shake Milton minutes
"Or our buddy named Shake fucking Milton could go for 25, that'd be nice."
"It wasnt just a couple of plays but the whole night they let the Wizards play rough defense while the Sixers got called for every little touch. In the 4th quarter the most obvious ones were the Danny Green ""hook"" foul on Gafford, Westbrook's non flagrant, Shake Milton getting hit in basically every drive.."
"Dude did you even watch last years playoffs. We were starting Shake Milton and had no consistent shooters. Al Horford made Tobi play out of position and he really struggled. Also the fact that we were the best home team prior to the shutdown and the bubble was a death sentence.   This year we replaced Richardson with Seth and Horford with Green, essentially unlocking Tobi and giving Embiid and Simmons two 40% shooters. Not even factoring that our bench got a lot better with Dwight and Hill."
"Shake Milton, now Tyrese. Philly keeps finding these gems."
Rolo is flat out shoving milton and getting away with it. I think its fair for shake to be pissed by now
Shake Milton has never taken a FT
I'm going to be so bummed if Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey go off this quarter
"Fuck Shake Milton, all my homies hate Shake Milton"
Shake Milton couldn‚Äôt buy a foul
"lmao our whole team hasnt been allowed to play defense today.  ben and dwight get punished for the weakest shit, and shake milton gets decked and he gets no call but anyone on the wizards has a finger touch them they go straight to the line.  refs calling ganes like this in the playoffs is a disgrace. at least we get to win in philly now."
Shake Milton need not be in this game. Doc needs to lay down his foot and play our starters. Game isn't close to over
"i mean that has 0 correlation to what i said, what im saying is our guys go through a bunch of contact and get no calls but wizards get rewarded for barely anything. prime example what just happened to shake milton, like clear obvious fould dont get called for us but ticky tack shit goes yall way eveey single time."
"It was Simmons, picks, and Rockets pick 2 of 3 guys between Thybulle Maxey and Shake Milton"
Is it shitting on Russ to say without KD and Harden on his team he hasn‚Äôt won an away game in the playoffs ever?   Is it shitting on Russ to say he‚Äôs been bounced in the first round 4 of the last 5 years?  Is it shitting on Russ to say his RAPTOR metric is literally barely above Shake Milton?  Or are those just facts?
"I can't say this enough, for like 4 minutes the Sixers closed an NBA playoff game with  Furkhan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, Mike Scott, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe.   In a win. ü§Æ The disrespect."
Shake Milton is a damn walking turnover this entire series. He's had his good stretches but man he picked a bad time to slump hardcore in the final weeks of the season and now here in the playoffs.
I just wanted to see Shake Milton play
"Appreciate your dedication to watching film  - I agree with the Simmons post ups. Why not help off Embiid/Thybulle and others rather than let Simmons walk his way under the basket. Seems stupid when you have a physical mismatch that big  - I don't mind the idea of zone defence but I don't think the Wiz have the personnel to pull it off. The heat have much better wings and and have practiced it a lot. Wouldn't hurt the Wiz to try it but I don't think it will get results. Also have to point out a lot of the clips you posted are with our bench unit out there. Much easier to play zone vs Shake Milton and Korkmaz, than Harris/Embiid  - I think you might be underrating Nunn as a scorer. He's much bigger and better at getting his shots than Neto is. Makes sense to attack Seth with a guy like him, but Neto cannot score like Nunn can. Nunn was scoring efficiently in the finals vs the best defence in the league. Neto got cut by us (not that he's terrible or anything)"
