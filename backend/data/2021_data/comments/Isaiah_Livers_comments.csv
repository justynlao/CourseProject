"2nd rounder probably, but Isaiah Livers"
"There was a pic posted yesterday of him standing next to Isaiah Livers, who measured 6'5.75"" barefoot at the combine. https://www.nba.com/pistons/sites/pistons/files/rookies_jerseys_1600_210730.jpg  Based on this he is definitely 6'6"" in shoes and not barefoot. I don't see it as a big deal, since that is still a really good height for a point guard, but I can't recall the last time someone was exaggerating by that much."
Wiki says Isaiah Livers who he's standing next to is 6'7
"Not quite hometown but Isaiah livers is from Kalamazoo, went to Michigan, and now is in Detroit"
"Oh well in that case...  The absolute disrespect to not include Isaiah Livers in your original comment lol, he was picked higher than the other 2. Not so high on him?"
Isaiah Livers is a second round Serbian player? I don't get it.
"BOI, I LOVE THIS DRAFT, I'M GONNA NUT.   CADE IS OUR ATARTING GUARD.   ISIAH LIVERS IS OUR BACKUP WING; GREAT VISION AND UNDERRATED ATHLETICISM, JUST NEEDS TO HEAL.   LUKA GARZA IS THE PERFECT BACKUP FOR ISAIAH STEWART. AN ALL DEFENSE DUDE IN STEWART WITH AN ALL OFFENSE DUDE IN GARZA.   I'M FINNA NUT."
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
That too with Isaiah Livers injured for the tourney
I dunno how this Pistons team is going to defend y'all with Isaiah Livers out.
"I don't think most people here have actually watched much of him either at Michigan or for Orlando. I also think a lot of people find it hard to look past the fact that Franz is white, even if subconsciously, and limit his ceiling based on that.  * He was arguably the best defensive player in college basketball, and so far has been one of the best if not the best defenders on the Magic. He's guarded everyone from Julius Randle to KD to Trae Young for entire games and done a decent job, less than 15 games in. He's 6'10 with long arms and moves his feet like a wing. * He gets steals playing on ball, he gets in passing lanes, he blocks shots * Can handle the ball, and play in pick and roll as the screener or the ball handler. * He's a really good passer and had one of the best AST/TO ratio's in the draft, and if you watch a [compilation of his assists](https://youtu.be/qa61lfMpHwc?t=2262), some of the passes he makes are super impressive. We haven't even really seen that part of his game yet in the NBA. * He's an excellent shooter, and his college 3P% is misleading because he was at 39% the whole season over 24 games, and then an injury to Isaiah Livers forced him to become their no 1 perimeter player and tanked his percentages in tournament (in just 4 games). * Great athlete, he's very bouncy for 6'10  When you look at his attributes in totality, I find it really hard to see what is limiting his ceiling. The only thing he's really missing is high level shot creation, and if he can get that he's Kevin Durant. He can already dribble and shoot, he just needs a bag.  To put it another way, if someone described a player that was:  * An athletic 6'10 with a 7'1 wingspan * Great defender that can guard 1 through to 4 for entire games, can switch on anyone * Great off-ball defender as well as on-ball * Can shoot 40% from 3 * Can be the secondary playmaker and run an offence * Very high BBIQ and is as effective off-ball as on-ball. Great cutter.  You would think they were a superstar. He's barely 20 and the youngest player on the Magic."
