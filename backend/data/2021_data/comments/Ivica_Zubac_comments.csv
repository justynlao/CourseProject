"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"

"""Through 7 games, Myles Turner is defending a league-leading 10.3 shots at the rim and holding opponents to a league-best 43.1% on those attempts.  1. Myles Turner - 43.2% on 10.3 DFGA 2. Ivica Zubac - 47.4% on 5.4  3. Rudy Gobert - 48.9% on 7.8 4. Joel Embiid - 49% on 8.2""   - from https://twitter.com/iPacersblog/status/1346537083544940544  Another helpful stat in evaluating Myles is the Pacers being 4th in OPP FG% inside of 5ft. Point is, Myles is currently playing Rudy Gobert level defense while being a legitimate 3pt threat on offense. It is early, so I understand hesitating before putting him top 10 for centers league wide. But if this trend continues, he could end up being one of the best value contracts in the league, especially in light of the albatross contract Gobert just signed."
"&gt;You’re ignoring the fact that the Lakers were barely a .500 team when LeBron played.  THEY WERE MISSING ALL OF THEIR STARTERS FOR DOZENS OF GAMES EACH.  Keep reading that sentence until it sinks in.  &gt;if LeBron hadve been healthy all season  Look up how many times James has missed the Finals.  &gt;same with Lonzo, Ingram, and Rondo  You are missing some people.  Like Caldwell-Pope, who we know now is good enough to be a starting guard on a championship team.  And JaVale McGee, who now has three rings.  And Tyson Chandler, who was also on that team.  And Ivica Zubac.  They would've been a nightmare matchup for someone like Denver, for example, with all those bodies to throw at Jokic.  They had very good perimeter defenders too -- James, Rondo, Hart, Ball, Caruso.  If they were healthy, they would not have been fun to play against, and James has certainly taken lesser teams to the Finals.  &gt;Over the Nuggets, Rockets, Blazers, hell even the Thunder with prime PG and Russ.  The Thunder won just 49 games, and bowed out in the first round in 5.  Denver needed 7 to get past the 48-win Spurs, whose best player was DeRozan.  None of those three teams were better than these Lakers, if they were healthy.  The Nuggets would've had a big matchup problem, as noted above.  Houston would come down to Harden versus James, and I, for one, would not be betting on Harden in that matchup, and I would have history on my side.  &gt;Also chill dude it’s a friendly debate in reddit comments no need to attack me like that Jesus  Welcome to reddit -- when you talk out of your asshole, someone is likely to call you on it."
"You guys don’t call Montrezl MH, or Ivica Zubac IZ?"
"&gt;Thinking the Lakers had they not brought in LeBron would be a playoff team in the West is preposterous.  It's not remotely.  They were 12 games out of playoff spot in 2018 -- starting two 20 year-olds, and one each 22, 23, and 24.  Only 1 player over 25 played over 700 minutes for that team -- Brook Lopez.  That was one of the youngest NBA teams in recent history, when weighted by minutes-played.  They were barely older than a college team.  They also had 20 year-old Ivica Zubac and 20 year-old Thomas Bryant.  They traded Zubac to make room for Davis, and he immediately started for the playoff-bound Clippers.  Bryant is starting in Washington -- who are not a playoff team, but he'd certainly be a capable backup.  They also would've had plenty of cap space to re-sign Brook Lopez, who is also capable of starting on a playoff team.  Plus Ingram, Randle, Ball, Caldwell-Pope, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, Clarkson, and Hunter -- all guys currently playing well for various teams.  Or, they could package some of those assets -- with the 3 firsts and second round picks they used on Davis -- to acquire other players.  For just two examples, they had more disposable assets than Miami needed to trade for Jimmy Butler and still had more than Indiana needed to trade for Malcolm Brogdon.  Just to name two very good players who have recently been on the trade market for much, much less than the Lakers spent on one season of Davis.  They were on their way back to playoffs, even without James -- exactly because of the original topic here, they drafted very well year after year, and that left them with a wealth of young assets."

"&gt;Ivica Zubac on playing fourth quarters: ""It is turning out to be great. I love finishing games, I love playing fourth quarters.""  Should've done it last year too"
"Those are incomplete numbers for this analysis.  Do the math on available attempts.  Some of those players played with Bryant -- good luck getting more than a couple shots a game in that situation -- and as shown by this very post, the Lakers were deep with young players who need lots of chances to figure out what works for them, and what doesn't.  Ingram: 11.5 FGA in Los Angeles, 17.8 in New Orleans  Clarkson: 12.6 FGA in LA, 13.4 in Utah  Russell:: 12.7 FGA in LA, 17 in Brooklyn, 19 in Golden State, and 17 in Minnesota  Ball: 10.3 in LA, 11.2 in New Orleans  Nance: 5.4 in LA, 7.3 in Cleveland  Randle: 10.6 in LA, 16 in New York  Russell, Nance, Randle, and Ingram have also seen their minutes rise since heading east.  There's only one ball ( lower-case ), and it's tough to develop that many players ( and Thomas Bryant, and Ivica Zubac and Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma and Mo Wagner ) in such a short span -- especially when you have Bryant and James.  There are recent ex-Lakers all over the league in part because they just drafted so many good players that they had logjams everywhere -- and that probably hurt almost all of them, to so degree or another."

"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"Ok this is interesting to me if it is true. I know that he is from Montenegro but if he considers himself Serbian then why he just did not make it 'official'.   There are so many people from Bosnia that consider themselves as Croats and they are. For example Dragan Bender, Ivica Zubac, Marin Cilic etc"
"Hunh?   So the Clippers have Kawhi (elite defender), PG (elite defender), Pat Bev (elite defender), Ibaka (very good defender), Marcus Morris (good defender) and Ivica Zubac (good defender) but somehow have the #14 defense in the NBA?"
"What about the return of Raptors legend, Lou ""Maple Pepper"" Williams? Throw in Patrick Patterson and Ivica ""close enough to JV"" Zubac. We can probably get Amir from the G League for peanuts too. It's 2015 all over again."
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"that is crazy. he's good  another interesting stat: 5 of the top 25 seasons, as measured by TS%, are happening this year  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_season.html  1st. Joe Ingles  12th. Ivica Zubac  22nd: Richaun Holmes  23rd: Jarret Allen  25th: Joe Harris"
"They have a strong correlation, but they're not the same thing. Take a look at the [league leaders in TS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) as an example. Do you think that Joe Ingles, Ivica Zubac, Richaun Holmes, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris are elite scorers? No, they're good in a more limited role. If they needed to shoot as much as someone like Embiid their efficiency would likely crater. Being an elite scorer requires being efficient at a high volume. So yes, they're related, but they're not the same thing."
"Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala. Even though it's been 2 years, really Magic???"
"Ivica Zubac is one of the best Jokic defenders in the NBA, that ain't no fluke, without Harrell to go off on Jokic is going to have to hit seriously difficult shots.    Rondo should be added help as well against Jokic, he tore them up last year, would've loved to have him over Jackson tonight."

Ivica Zubac and Jerome Robinson on the Clippers
Ivica Zubac
"The Clippers last year:  Lue: ""So, what does our center rotation look like?""  Doc: ""Okay, so we're going to start Ivica Zubac. But we're only going to play him like 18 minutes per game.""  Lue: ""What about the rest of the time, including crunch time?""  Doc: ""I'm glad you asked- We're going to play Montrezl Harrell at center the rest of the time.""  Lue: ""That guy's like 6'8"", are we going to send help when he's defending a bigger player in the post?""  Doc: ""Here's the brilliant part-- No."""
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."

"Yeah this team isnt winning a title and if I spent more time on it I wouldve looked for a few guys to address the rebounding issue. Someone like Ivica Zubac or some defensive big who's started &lt;50% of games could easily find one.   This would frankly be a pretty fradulent playoff high seed, they wouldnt win more than one round and arent even a lock for that if its a bad matchup.

"I'm sure that 90% of the fans doesn't know what PER. +/-, TS% (and other term for that matter) stands for. Not to mention the meaning if big number is always good or not, just like the recent confusion of Defensive rating.  Again, it's  is a tool. Hate it or not, it's here to stay. Why do you think Doc Rivers was axed by Ballmer in the first place?   I'll give you a clue:  &gt;Two philosophical points of contention between Rivers and the organization were, more recently, his insistence on playing backup center Montrezl Harrell over starting center Ivica Zubac and, at large, his reluctance to develop or empower the team’s younger talent throughout his tenure.  &gt; After a Sixth Man of the Year regular-season campaign, Harrell missed a month in the bubble due to the sickness and eventual passing of his grandmother. Upon returning, he was visibly not himself, offensively or defensively.  &gt; Yet Harrell’s postseason role was that of an effective rotation player (18.7 minutes per game), despite the Clippers posting a team-worst minus-11.6 net rating with him on the floor in the playoffs, including a mind-blowing minus-30.1 net rating while sharing the floor with Leonard and George.  &gt; In comparison, the Clippers had a plus-17.7 net rating with Zubac on the floor in the playoffs and a plus-11.1 net rating with Zubac alongside Leonard and George, both marks ranked No. 1 among the team’s rotation players.  &gt; It was clear to many that Zubac was the better matchup on both ends versus Dallas and Denver. There was an internal thought process of “How does Rivers not see that Zubac is the more productive player and the better postseason matchup?”  &gt; A common criticism from some within the team — inside and outside the locker room — was that Harrell’s energy and effort was only consistent on the offensive end of the floor, multiple league sources said.  &gt; Meanwhile, Rivers maintained, publicly to the media and privately to his staff and the organization, that Harrell was the better player, in spite of all of the evidence to the contrary  Edit: words"

You can't blame Ty Lue for Marcus Morris shitting the bed in both games, Paul George launching bricks until the 4th quarter in game one, or Kahwi disappearing in game 2 in the fourth.  What you can blame Ty Lue for is his line-ups and rotation. For a playoff team, the Clippers have no idea who is going to play in the game and how long they are going to play.

And Larry Nance Jr.'s son Ivica Zubac
Magic also the guy who gave up Ivica Zubac to the Clippers for practically nothing at all
"&gt;It would be Lebron, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, DLo, Josh Hart, Ingram, Nance, Lonzo, Randle, Clarkson and Thomas Bryant; rest would be guys on the min.  You forgot:  * De'Andre Hunter, the #4 overall pick who they traded for Davis * Ivica Zubac, who they traded to make room for Davis * Moe Wagner, who they traded for Davis * Isaac Bonga, who they traded for Davis * Jemarrio Jones, who they also traded for Davis -- but is a G Leaguer who makes no difference, just mentioning him for completeness  &gt;Very thin on big men  Not so thin when you include Zubac, and to a lesser degree Wagner.  If they somehow had all those players, they'd have the deepest roster in the league by far.  Hunter and Zubac both routinely start for playoff teams, and you didn't even include them.  Their bench would be a playoff team in the East.  The huge challenge would be finding minutes for everyone, and getting all these players to mesh offensively -- both are which are parts of coaching that Frank Vogel struggles terribly with.  Luckily for Vogel, with the most talent in the league, there would probably be many good choices on how to play them, so he might accidentally stumble across a few excellent lineups."

"Imagine having Pat Bev, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard and having fucking Ivica Zubac guard Luka. Ty Lue is trash."
Ivica 'Fried Chicken' Zubac
"LeBron James is the biggest magician of them all, he tricked everyone into believing that Ty Lue is a good coach, the same Ty Lue that six games into his career without LeBron was 0-6 and got fired AND was the assistant coach of the Clippers choke last year. Like seriously? You are switching Luka freaking Doncic into Ivica Zubac in the playoffs? Has this coaching staff watched a quarter of Luka playing all season?   Last night Luka hit ONE shot with Kawhi actually defending him, every other shot after the first quarter was on either Morris, Zubac and Pat Bev or with Kawhi going under a screen. PG13 also only took him consistently in the first quarter.  You have two of the best perimeter defenders in the game and you are going under screens and allowing him to switch with ease, that's a fireable offense. Can you stop him completely? Fuck no, but you can atleast try to slow him down."
"Not anymore - that's the one area Luka improved the most this season.     &gt; If you’ve been following Doncic’s season, [it’s no surprise how improved  he is in the midrange](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/5/26/22454327/luka-doncic-turned-the-tables-against-the-clippers-ivica-zubac-powering-the-mavericks-to-a-2-0-lead). After taking just 51 midrange shots last season,    he took 183 of them this season, making 89 of them (48.6 percent)."
"Ivica Zubac is a bonafide scrub! He can’t play! No disrespect whatsoever,the man cannot play the game of basketball.  He has small hands, he can’t catch the ball. He has bad feet, he can’t really move even though he’s mobile, doesn’t really know what he’s doing"
"Exactly.   And it doesn’t help that the “rim protector” they decide to play for a good amount of the game is slow-footed Ivica Zubac.  Combine that with the personnel the Mavericks put out there… well, you know what happened. Lol.   Where tf is Serge?! Is he still on a minutes limit? Not that this would change the result… but I mean he’s got quicker feet than Zubac."
Do you know how to pronounce his first name? I've got Zubac but I don't understand Ivica lol.
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars.

"Don't know why everyone is complaining about the low score. I felt it was just as intense as any other game, perhaps even more so since the value of each possession was greater. The fourth quarter felt like the fourth quarter of the 2020 All-Star game, but in a playoff environment.  You don't need to score *x* amount of points in a game, you just need to score more points than the other team to win, and winning is all that matters in the playoffs.

"Booker has had a strong postseason but his postseason is a mix of crazy good games and mediocre games without much in between.

Also Booker's wretched footwork defensively keeps showing up and is the reason for alot of these defensive fouls. This [will not get it done either](https://go.nba.com/y86v). Just gotta probably use him more off ball to start game 4 to get him going. I do think he'll figure it out and wont stay tricked by Beverley. The more he runs and incorporates Ayton in pick and rolls the better generally it is for him.   Cameron Payne injury is a problem, CP3 went back to some of his bad traffic cop habits from the beginning of the year needlessly slowing down the pace sometimes in the first half.  Ivica Zubac really was what won this game for LAC. Batum's minutes have yo-yo'ed the entire postseason it's back down lower than what its ever been, Mook is still banged up, youll get 30 min of Zubac again in game 4 and what he does is one of the big hinge points that will decide the game."

The Ivica Zubac game
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."

"Tinkering ty be tinkering  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers starting lineup  Patrick Beverley   Reggie Jackson   Paul George   Marcus Morris   Ivica Zubac"
Unless you’re Ivica Zubac
It’s insane to me that he can’t shoot these without any form of touch and overthinks the fuck out of it and a guy like Ivica Zubac just handles it like any other smaller guard and shoots it with a solid percentage.
"Under the radar on the whole Wiseman development thing is that the Warriors have brought in a new assistant coach to replace Jarron Collins this offseason: Dejan Milojevic, a guy who's coached several eventual-NBA-level big men with Mega Basket in Serbia--Goga Bitadze, Ivica Zubac, and most notably Nikola Jokic. While Jokic's passing isn't something that can be taught, Milojevic is apparently an excellent teacher of footwork, which is quite promising."
Did Nerlens Noel play like shit this year? Did Ivica Zubac? Did Dwight Howard? Cause those three guys combined made less money than Adams did by himself. $20+ million for a traditional center is a ludicrous overpay. Sorry.
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."

"&gt;Three future THTs  1 Horton-Tucker, 1 Marc Gasol, and 1 Ivica Zubac.  The Lakers' draft record is ridiculous.  Almost 3 dozen All-stars despite making the Finals nearly every other season.  Doesn't matter where they pick, they find players."
"the following players are all better than any of your roleplayers, in most cases significantly:  * Nic Batum  * Marcus Morris  * Ivica Zubac  * Yes, Serge Ibaka  * Reggie Jackson (if he re-signs)  The following players are at least as good as any of your roleplayers:  * Terance Mann  * Luke Kennard  In general, not only do we have shooters at least as good as yours, but unlike you, ours can also defend."
"Good question! I'm not a cap wizard. I think at 32 it's probably still fine to be drafted, but by the 40s you're better off not getting drafted IF you can prove yourself.  UDFAs have little leverage. Technically they can sign any contract they want, but most of the time they sign a three-year contract with the third year not guaranteed. Success stories in UDFA are few, but if you bet on yourself and it works out, you can enter RFA earlier and earn bigger money quicker.   Fred Van Vleet signed a 2-year 1.4 million contract with the Raptors under the old CBA in 2016 after going undrafted (partly through choice). Then he entered RFA in the 18-19 offseason and had already signed, by then, a 2/18 contract.   Compare that to the 32nd pick in 2016, Ivica Zubac - he signed a 3/3.2 contract with the Lakers and didn't start earning real money until 2019-20, when the Clippers extended him for 3/21. So comparatively, FVV got to start earning real money sooner.   An even better example is Wes Matthews in 2010, who signed a 1/457K contract with the Jazz, and played well enough to get a 5/35 offer sheet from Portland as an RFA the following offseason which the Jazz matched.   When you get down to, like, the 50th pick, it gets dicey. Georges Niang signed a 3/2.5 contract with the Pacers and got waived before his second year started, and he only earned 750K from that first contract total, with the second year guaranteed only 100K. If Niang believed in himself and could sell himself well enough (and if he was, uh, better), he could have signed a 2-year guaranteed deal with another club like Freddy."
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here.

"If you really missed him you wouldn't be pushing the narrative. Dude has been solid in the 10 minutes he's gotten to play each game for the Rockets and Clippers.  For him to get back to his old self, he needs to be the starting center, not coming off the bench for a few minutes after IVICA ZUBAC comes out.  This is like the Melo situation all over again, 90% of this sub thought he wasn't good enough to be in the NBA, but he just needed the right opportunity."

Rob “use full MLE on Montrezl Harrell then get Andre Drummond and promise him a starting spot” Pelinka.  I remember when Laker fans were crying about him not getting GM of the year in 2020. Please. He signed LeBron who goes wherever he wants, and traded what was probably too much for an All-NBA player who said he only would go to the Lakers and refused to play otherwise.  What’s he thinking with this move? IDK, circus music?"
Toss up between Luka Doncic and Ivica Zubac.   National Balkan Association.
"i dont think ive seen any reasonable non troll say the bucks would have gotten crushed. The bucks are a fucking good team. The suns are a different story, and while they deserved their berth in the finals too, we cant really just ignore the fact that every team they faced this playoffs, including the bucks, had a major injury on their squad.  If bucks had donte divincenzo, its possible that bucks sweep or win in 5, never mind lebron, ad, murray, kawhi, and the plethora of smaller injuries like kcp, schroder, caruso, michael porter jr., pj dozier, serge ibaka, ivica zubac all playing a factor. Suns were the best west team this year because they beat everyone else in the battle of healthiness this year. But its magnitudes easier for most fans to accept bucks as champions because they have proven their quality of team over a longer period of time"
"Kawhi, PG and Ivica Zubac"
"Ivica Zubac for TJ Warren  Both good players. But the Clippers would lose one of their better big men to add another guy to a crowded forward rotation  Zubac is good but the Pacers already gave Sabonis and Turner, there would be limited minutes at C"
"Top 2 is just something the media and r/nba says.  Im not saying Luka is better, but in  regards to the original comment, I am saying the comparison is fair, especially if you consider the fact that LBJ didn't make the playoffs until his 3rd year while Luka made  it in his 2nd year.  Not to mention LBJ dominated weak eastern teams but for the most part against the best teams in the league, he looked a bit more like his normal self if not worse in the playoffs.  Luka played a team that was geared to stop elite perimeter players and he torched the ever living shit out if them anyways two years in a row even though he lost.  Luka's TS% in the playoffs is only pedestrian because his FT% is remarkably subpar, but his eFG% is through the roof and blows LBJ's out of the water at this stage of their respective careers.  LBJ is by far the superior defender, much more athletic, and is another monster altogether when trying to stop him from getting to the rim, but Luka is the considerably more skilled offensive player in spite of his athletic deficiencies; the threat of his 3 pointer, his step back 3s and the volume of which he launches them is a level of deep range marksmanship LBJ has never achieved at any point in his career, his mid-range and post up game is elite, and he is also as efficient a finisher at the rim as LBJ. Luka is so good that he literally rendered Patrick Beverely, a very good defensive player unplayable, and single handedly played Ivica Zubac, who is a very solid center, off the court."
Reggie Jackson   Luke Kennard   Paul George  Marcus Morris  Ivica Zubac   That’s not getting you a top 6 seed in the west buddy. That’s the 2017 Detroit Pistons backcourt.
Ivica Zubac is the greatest offensive player of all time
"You make it sound like *you* didn't watch. Kawhi and PG each played 11 minutes in the 4th quarter of Game 7 of that series and combined to go 0-11 for 0 points in that period. Explain to me how that is Doc Rivers fault. For the game those two combined to go 10-38 from the field for only 24 points in 82 minutes of playing time. Montrezl Harrell and Ivica Zubac outscored them in only 40 minutes of playing time, with Trez scoring 20 points and Zubac scoring 6.   Your star players choked, there's no way around that fact. Sorry."
"Yup. Definitely. The Lakers love guys like THT throughout the years.   ""Young with potential"" who were late picks.  We've had a few who didn't turn out well like Darius Morris, Devin Ebanks, Andrew Goudlock, Anthony Brown etc.   But we've had some success too with Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, David Nwaba.   THT has been good enough. It's just that Lakers fans are just more vocal and lakers players get more spotlight.   JC and AC were better prospects IMO but they don't have THT's physical gifts which the Lakers are banking on."
Ivica Zubac. The guys a 7 footer who would tower over your average pick up baller. Buckets in the post and elite rim protection and rebounding cause he’s taller and stronger than your average pick up baller
"Maybe not, but he can lock up the opposing teams best guard in a way that Rondo even in his prime couldn't manage. Clippers didn't need another playmaker/ball handler like the Lakers did. We needed a stout defender who could hit 3's.   (all following quotes come from this Sports Illustrated article - https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/how-patrick-beverley-silenced-doubters)  &gt; Pat Bev answered the call. In the 45 possessions that Beverley guarded Mitchell in the playoffs, Spida scored just 10 points on 23% from the field, turned the ball over 4 times, and was blocked 5 times. In the 72 minutes that Mitchell and Beverley shared the court, the Clippers were a +29.  &gt; Coming into the WCF, Devin Booker was averaging nearly 30 PPG in the previous two rounds. His dominance helped Phoenix eliminate the defending champs in the opening round, and sweep the MVP in round two  &gt; After Booker put up a 40-point triple double in game one of the WCF, Ty Lue inserted Patrick Beverley into the starting lineup for the remainder of the series. While the Clippers were unable to overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard, Ivica Zubac, and Serge Ibaka, Pat Bev had Booker locked up. In the 110 possessions that Pat Bev guarded Booker, D-Book shot just 28% from the field, turned the ball over 7 times, and did not make a single three-point basket.  So, again, currently they are pretty even they just have different skillsets"
"Check where ivica zubac placed in the WS column and you'll understand why its a damned statistic.   Stats tell a story, but they don't tell the full picture.   The Spurs made Tim Duncan.  You know how in the nfl there's this term called ""system qb""?   yeah Tim Duncan was the System Quarterback for the spurs."
The Lakers traded Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala
I still think that Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala is one of the worst trades.  Not because Zubac is an all time great player or anything but because everyone except the Lakers knew how bad it was and then it turned out pretty much exactly as bad as everyone expected.

"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.

"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
