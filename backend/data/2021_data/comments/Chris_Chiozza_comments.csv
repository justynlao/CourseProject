"No, I am not saying casual fans have no grasp of the sport, rather, I am saying that casual fans don't care about whether someone accidentally calls Landry Shamet ""Chris Chiozza"".   If the announcers are out here calling LeBron James ""Joel Embiid"" then sure it's an issue but Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza nobody cares."
"Yes, I read the article.   I think you are grossly overestimating what a casual fan cares about. No casual fan gives a damn about DeMarre Carroll vs. Jarrett Allen or Chris Chiozza vs. Landry Shamet. Those might as well be computer generated names for all they know.  It's about atmosphere, stars and nostalgia."
Chris chiozza and norvel peele didn’t ply either but they’re listed
Lmao we played Chris Chiozza and Landry Shamet 20+ minutes that's not called depth bud. The Sixers aren't doing jack shit this year.
Those three plus Chris Chiozza? That’s just unfair
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"I dont think I'd really pay attention to someone with chris chiozza, fred vanvleet, or cp3s body type"
"I don't even think their bench is that bad honestly except at the 5 spot.  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown / Chris Chiozza   SG: Harden / Shamet / Tyler Johnson   SF: Harris / TLC  PF: Durant / Jeff Green   C: DeAndre Jordan / Nic Claxton  With Kyrie being out, they have a bit of backcourt flexibility which is nice. Their center depth is atrocious though. Get Whiteside for a second rounder or something."
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Chris Chiozza, Reggie Perry and Tyler Johnson"
&gt; Chris Chiozza  That can't be a real name
Chris Chiozza against Memphis
"Dude he called Chris chiozza on the nets, Shamet, multiple times last night... I get they’re both light skinned.. but come on"

"Marv Albert could'nt differentiate between Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza all game, and Weber called Prince Demarre Carroll about 8 times. Horrible announcing."
TIL Chris Chiozza is actually Landry Shamet
There was never a chance Marv was going to know who Chris Chiozza is
Philly thought they were getting a good test finally. Sike!! You’re playing Chris Chiozza and the gang
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Chris Chiozza gonna drop 101

March Madness legend Chris Chiozza with 12 points
"79 points and up by 20 at the half without James Harden and with KD playing only 8 minutes.  Shamet and Johnson are out too. Obviously not great players, but both being out means that G League Chris Chiozza is the only other ball handler aside from Kyrie."
I'm sure Chris Chiozza is livid that Harden doesn't get yelled at like he does
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
All this just to beat Chris Chiozza smh
Thats Chris Chiozza for us  If we ever have no need for him it wouldn’t surprise me if he became a bit of a journeyman too
"Shump, CC (Chris chiozza) and nets pick. Our best offer."
Are you sure it's not Chris Chiozza?
"You think this is good, just wait till their real star comes back from injury.  Chris Chiozza"
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
Idk he hasn’t played in a year and has no chemistry with basically over half of his teammates. It’s probably better than Chris chiozza or whoever your other option would be but it’s not a game changer
&gt; \-The third best player on the Brooklyn Nets   Well this is bs. Chris Chiozza never said anything like that.
Chris Chiozza? Isn’t that the guy who does all the think pieces for CNN?
I was wondering why the nets wanted another Chris Chiozza until I saw Chiozza broke his hand.
Chris Chiozza
Even though it’s a joke the Nets do need a PG.   Chris Chiozza was the Nets 2Way PG who was getting playing time due to Harden and Dinwiddie being injured. Chiozza is now out for the year.   In theory the Nets could sign Lin to the Aldridge spot if they found some Wing/PF/C Depth from the G-League.
Me and Chris Chiozza
"Lukas been watching some Chris Chiozza, I see"
[Chris Chiozza is an NCAA tournament legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ2bQwMIW9w)
"LUKA ""CHRIS CHIOZZA"" DONCIC"
"Except every time he misses out other stars are forced to play more minutes, essentially raising their risk of injury more. Chris Chiozza had to play for Kyrie yesterday and he got injured. They’re already bedridden with injuries right now. Harden is out with an injury and Durant is on minutes restriction. Him missing out doesn’t help their cause."

"Losing all of your depth at what was theoretically your deepest position is the roughest part  Healthy Nets have the best guard rotation in the league, current Nets might be the worst in the CSF round, maybe at the level of the Nuggets  Like the only point guards left on the roster are Mike James and Chris Chiozza"
Go to bed little troll. And Chris Chiozza must be better because he didn’t get swept. Good players never lose...
The only player to not score on the nets was Chris chiozza. No surprise there but he only took one attempt. This was an all out massacre.
Wizards legend Chris Chiozza
Chris Chiozza and Mike James look like different versions of VanVleet
"Mike James comes out for even smaller Mike James, Chris Chiozza"
Mike James is just evil Chris Chiozza so i cant blame you
Is it bad I thought mike James was Chris chiozza this whole time
Yeah Chris Chiozza mad underrated
That’s not what he meant when he said perennial all star. How about you give Chris Chiozza the respect he deserves
Harden on one leg is better than Mike James or Chris Chiozza
Depth?? 3 of our 5 PGs are injured with 2 being unable to play.  Harden  Kyrie  Dinwiddie  Mike James  Chris Chiozza  How many PGs do you expect them to have lol
No team is putting the game in the hands of guys like Bryn Forbes and Chris Chiozza
Start Chris Chiozza you cowards!
Haha I always see him and am like “Wow Chris Chiozza getting playing time? Very interesting.” And then I realize it’s Mike James
Chris Chiozza &amp; Mike James not being the same person is such a mind fuck
I still sometimes mix up Mike James and Chris Chiozza on first glance
"There are lots of little guys in the league right now doing good stuff. Jalen Brunson, Ish Smith, Chris Chiozza are all solid guards in the league right now.   J.J. Barea and Isaiah Thomas were also huge for their team's success when they played."
"If you struck the 2nd and 3rd players on every single team and then had them all compete, I don't think the Nets would rank particularly high because their roster past Joe Harris was old and/or devoid of defensive or playmaking talent.  ""But only the Nets lost their 2nd and 3rd best players it wasn't everyone"" yeah well that's just how injuries work in sports. It's next man up and the next men up for the Nets weren't good. Having better backup ball-handlers than Mike James, Tyler Johnson, and Chris Chiozza would have made a difference in the Bucks series but they instead opted for the ""put together a big 3"" route. It was a risk/reward proposition that they lost, and declaring that you're the rightful ""best team""  anyway is basically deciding the team should be absolved of that risk."
"The Nets gave guys like Chris Chiozza, Mike James, TLC, and even Andre Roberson decent minutes last year. If he plays like he did in SL there’s definitely a world where he gets regular minutes off the bench."
"Hard question to answer because usually the guys that don’t dress above a certain level aren’t even considered by media, so we usually have no clear idea of who dresses better between for example chris chiozza or jordan nwora, because they aren’t in the spotlight for fashion"
I remember watching Chris Chiozza throw down some insane dunks in the layup lines at a UF vs. UT game.
"Mills is much better than Mike James, Chris Chiozza, and TLC (their backup guards from this past season). His acquisition will allow Harden and Kyrie to rest a bit more. They do need to acquire a center though. DJ isn’t going to cut it, and Claxton isn’t ready to start yet."
"Chris Chiozza: Gator legend, Wisconsin nemesis"
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
I guess thankfully Wizard's IT had a smaller role. It was still hard to watch though.  We should have just gave Chris Chiozza his minutes
Would he be a servicable PG though?  We're picking from.  Quinn Cook Isaiah Thomas Arcediacano Avery Bradley Darren Collison Gary Payton II Chris Chiozza  Cook has a Championship or two... always shot well.  Knows the system extremely well.  I think this is actually the one they pull trigger on gut feeling.
"also chris chiozza on the two-way, no one knows anything about him but kenny atkinson from brooklyn must think well of him from their time together.  he's short and has poor shooting splits but he makes assists at a high rate."
Chris Chiozza doesn't help. Dude looks like Steph and Bazemore fused together.
"This is all because they got rid of Chris Chiozza, nets fans were certain he was great last year"
"Yes. Deandre Jordan for some reason gets blamed the most about his defense on the Nets when in reality he was probably one of the better defenders on the roster. You can only cover up Shamet, Kyrie, and Chris Chiozza so well on that end"
Chris Chiozza is our two way player bru. Doesnt make a difference
Lakers losing to Chris Chiozza and Damian Lee 🤣🤣🤣
Or Chris “ 6ft steph curry” chiozza
Steph Curry   Michael Mulder   Jordan Poole   Klay Thompson   Chris Chiozza
"It should be at least a little concerning that Steph can go 4 for 21, the warriors can play heavy Chris Chiozza - Bjelica lineups down the stretch, and still make it a close game in PHX."
If the Warriors weren't playing Chris Chiozza and Bjelica big minutes in the 4th....
Chris Chiozza needs to sit down tf
No that's Chris Chiozza
"I thought it meant the #2 greatest post defender behind Trae Young, Chris Chiozza was in?"
Chris Chiozza iso-ball lol
Chris Chiozza. AKA Dollar Store Steph.
Chris Chiozza. He's a 2-way player that is a clearance walmart Steph in both his looks and his shot.
Chris Chiozza. Used play for the Nets.
"Chris Chiozza, we had to sit him in the sixers game so they could have a chance"
"what?   put it this way - it’s better if you lose to steph curry than if you lose to jordan poole, because curry is an mvp level player. Similarly, it’s better to lose to jordan poole than to chris chiozza."
"Chris Chiozza is 5'11 175lbs, I think that is as close as you'll get lol  Former player Raymond Felton was 6'1 205lbs"
"I take it back, our most hated player isn’t Wiseman but Chris Chiozza. CheesePizza just a Curry lookalike with terrible D"
those chris chiozza minutes are still pissing me off.  literally 0 reason to play him over gp
Just watch Chris Chiozza
Incoming Chris Chiozza 40 pt game
Wym? Chris Chiozza didn't play
They also mixed up Chris Chiozza with Steph Curry a couple times. Also mixed up Juan T with Otto Porter lol.
"and the bonus points are Chris ""Big Cheese"" Chiozza"
And Chris Chiozza
"For his birthday, we gave Chris Chiozza 20 minutes, and he didn't let us down. Love it."
Do Ayesha also mistakes Chiozza as Curry for like 1sec before realizing its Chris not Wardell
"Chris Chiozza strong representation for 5'11"" guys."
"Warriors Fans: We want Curry!   Steve Kerr: But we have Curry at Home!   Curry at home: Chris ""Steph Curry"" Chiozza."
"... Steph has a beard though?  If you mean the guy who looks like shorter, squatter Steph with tattoos that Chris Chiozza"
"Chris Chiozza-&gt; Jordan Poole-&gt; Steph Curry is a Pokémon evolution tree.  Also by the strictest legal definition, this was in fact, an NBA game."
"Chris Chiozza-&gt; Jordan Poole-&gt; Steph Curry is a Pokémon evolution tree.  Also by the strictest legal definition, this was in fact, an NBA game."
"Chris Chiozza, two-way player. Manages to look like he has dwarfism even though he's 6' tall."
We can put a #30 jersey on Chris Chiozza and send him their way. Looks similar enough.
"Just wait when ""Mini Steph"" Chris Chiozza comes in."
TIL Chris Chiozza is on the Warriors
Who is the 15th man on your roster? I wouldn’t mind 41 year old Dray motivating and giving advice over Chris Chiozza or Jeff Dowtin.
Chris chiozza
Free Chris Chiozza... with purchase of a cheeseburger of equal or lesser value.
"Add the two 2-way players in Jeff Dowtin and Chris ""Chibi Steph"" Chiozza."
"Kerr: ""Over my dead body! Where's Chris Chiozza?"""
There’s not really anyone on the main roster for the warriors this year so I guess Chris Chiozza on the two way contract.  Pretty spoiled right now
"Chris ""Wanamaker"" Chiozza"
I said mildly contested. You don't watch the game so you don't see him constantly passing out of WIDE open 3s. If you can't take wide open 3s you're not an NBA level player. Only guys like Draymond gets a pass because he can actually defend. Athletic Alchemy who actually watches the game pointed this out numerous times.   &gt; He's fantastic at driving and super aggressive going downhill.  When the lane is wide open. Despite that he is shooting 45.5% from 2 and shooting 33% from 0-3 feet. Just sit down moron   &gt; He was -5 because he played with Chris Chiozza and Lee was missing everything.  Chiozza played 5 minutes and Damion has one of the best impact metrics on the team. He shared big minutes with Poole and Curry this game or did you not watch?   &gt; he's trying to help and carry the entire defense  Jesus imagine believing this
"What an utterly idiotic comment. A 10th man isn't meant to create for himself on offense. He's not meant to shoot contested 3s either lmao. He's not a shooter. He's fantastic at driving and super aggressive going downhill. He's fantastic on defense, a great passer, and great IQ. Cherrypicking is ridiculous. He isn't losing his man, he's trying to help and carry the entire defense. He was -5 because he played with Chris Chiozza and Lee was missing everything. He carried us on both ends. Ridiculous."
"Chris Chiozza already did that, and grew the beard too"
damn i mean sure... we'll give you chris chiozza if you say he's really that bad.   Plus i know how brad loves his short point guards
He's not gonna get that many minutes I doubt because I still think he's gonna bust out of the league. He's an infuriating player to watch. If Kerr gives him some run and he fails I don't think Kerr will baby him. He barely plays Kuminga and Moody while giving run to Chris Chiozza. If Wiseman ends up being great then all is good. If he busts though Kerr won't let it fuck up our season.
