"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"That is Ricky Rubio (career 32% three point shooter), Jake Layman (career 31% three point shooter), Naz Reid (33%)  and Jarred Vanderbilt (25%) standing around the perimeter while rookie Anthony Edwards (who has less than 10 career post up possessions) tries to post up.  What's wrong with that?"
Shoutout Jarred Vanderbilt! Him and Mcdaniels are some more bright spots
Not the same  If I were to make a thread saying the Celtics should trade Jaylen Brown for Malik Beasley Jarred Vanderbilt and a first then we would be talking
Dwight howard last year  Christian wood going to the pistons now the rockets  Oladipo going to the pacers  Terry rozier  Jarred vanderbilt
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
Jarred Vanderbilt and Jaden McDaniels
"The TWolves desperately need a defensive anchor at center since KAT can't do it. He is an awkward fit defensively at the 4, but he is also an awkward fit at the 5.  I'd rather roll with Turner at the 5 and finally have some rim protection than continue sticking Jarred Vanderbilt at the 4."
"Moses Brown, Jarred Vanderbilt, and David Nwaba."
What about KAT next to jarred Vanderbilt lol? Because that's what it is now
don't they have jarred vanderbilt and they had Roco paired with KAT before and the defence was still suspect
"If you think Friday’s annoying, wait till you hear my jarred vanderbilt takes!"
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"You almost have to throw the advanced numbers out when evaluating this Wolves team due to injuries and the resulting lineups it resulted in.   KAT missed 22 games. Russell missed 30. Beasley missed 35. That sometimes meant guys like Ant had to play alongside some BAD teammates in some BAD lineups. This was especially apparent early (when KAT missed time), when Ant was coming off the bench. There were tons of games where Ant was asked to lead a second unit of Jordan McLaughlin-Josh Okogie-Jarred Vanderbilt-Naz Reid. That meant he was either jacking up contested 3s or driving into a jam-packed paint. There were numerous games where he was something like 4-18 and it wasn’t because he was just jacking shots. The Wolves before the break were PAINFUL (they had the worst record in the entire league for a reason). Because Edwards didn’t miss any time and was there for all of those god ugly days, he’s naturally going to have a gnarly set of advanced statistics."

"Willie Cauley-Stein, Malik Monk, Immanuel Quickley, Jarred Vanderbilt..."
Jarred Vanderbilt. He's like a mix of Rodman and Jordan and Pippen all in 1. But like...better
Jarred Vanderbilt has been great this year for us
"RHJ was on a non-guaranteed contract, and the role he would've filled has been firmly taken over by Jarred Vanderbilt, who's younger and has more room for growth"
"The one good thing we’ve seen this year, and one credit to Rosas’s roster building, is we’ve been finding a lot of guys who are out to prove something. Jarred Vanderbilt and Beasley are bringing a ton of energy and effort. KAT looks more dialed in on the defensive end than we’ve seen in a while. I’m hopeful that this most recent Spurs series and the 2 games before KAT went down is a sign of the defensive potential once this team figures out how to play together."

They've had a bunch of guys who left after their Sophomore season that flopped or did nothing in the league too - Aaron Harrison, Andrew Harrison, Dakari Johnson, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Briscoe, Wenyen Gabriel, EJ Montgomery. All of those guys were top 20 HS prospects once upon a time."
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters.

Look at the role jarred Vanderbilt played on offense for the wolves last year. Now imagine he's way more athletic and has the hand eye coordination to actually finish plays
&gt; Jarred Vanderbilt has been one of my favorite players so far this season  He is also the next player EG has claimed would be a future all-start after he prophesied Jokic's MVP. So you guys got an MVP in the waiting
I didn't realize how exciting good defense could be until my team actually started playing it. Jarred Vanderbilt has been one of my favorite players so far this season on the Wolves due to the amount of hustle and effort he plays on the defensive end to contest shots and passing lanes(he has been showing the same hustle on the offensive board too).

Catch all stats are always going to be hard to make perfect. DRAPTOR is pretty solid defensively. The real problem with advanced stats is people taking them as gospel truth instead of using them to compliment what they see. Defensive stats can suck but if I go see Jarred Vanderbilt is 17th in defensive RAPTOR over the last two seasons then it gives me something to watch more closely when I go watch the Wolves

"It's 2021, the NBA has been dominated by forwards for the last decade, and the forwards on that roster are Jaden McDaniels (pretty good defensively, but ultra raw on offense), Jarred Vanderbilt (great rebounder, has some talent, but a bench guy), Josh Okogie (really a guard, can defend, is abysmal on offense),Taurean Prince (is in the NBA because for some reasons NBA teams always assume a guy with dreads plays good defense) and Jake Layman (is in the NBA because he's white so people assume he's a shooter)  You don't win in the NBA with 0 quality forwards"
Dlo is a poor playmaker/slasher and is a chucker  Ant is exciting but a bit of a chucker.  They run no plays for KAT (been an issue ever since he's been drafted)   KAT is a below average defender surrounded by below average defender and Jarred Vanderbilt who has no offensive game at all.  All the other players on the team are one dimensional either being a net plus on defense whilst being an offensive liability or the other way around.  No lead guard who can properly run sets and involve their teammates.  The coaching isn't actually too bad overall and compared to last season is an absurd level of improvement. I would expect the team to improve to a 9-10 seed and probably lose the play in game.
jarred vanderbilt got called for an extremely crucial one this year i recall
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
"yes youre missing everything good he did lmfao. jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick. naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too. okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win. he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick. he overpaid juancho a little bit (but $7 mil a year is certainly not horrible), but then flipped him and culver for beverly, which significantly improves guard depth, experience, and defence to replace rubio while giving up two players who barely belong in the league and no picks.   rubio trade was bad, yes. dlo in minnesota is significantly better than wiggins was in minnesota, and theres a very good chance kat wouldve already demanded a trade if dlo wasnt there. it was worth it just for keeping kat happy if nothing else.   youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no. the wolves just have had horrible injury luck the last two years, that’s no fault of the GMs and its really stupid to judge him on that."

"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"

"I feel like Jarred Vanderbilt from the Timberwolves fits this. I have no idea what he is supposed to be good at, but he always bring the energy at least."
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted.

"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
Great post   I hear Jarred Vanderbilt is also pretty good defensively. How do wolves fans feel about him? I’m thinking the Bulls should grab him in FA
"Jarred Vanderbilt. He just turned 22, and while his offense is still super raw, he’s an excellent defender and rebounder. 6’10 and played some really nice D on guys like Trae, Fox, &amp; Butler last year when switched on to them."
I turned Jarred Vanderbilt into a 93 overall in 2k21 once
"Must be an old ass tweet, because even in an article titled:     &gt;The Timberwolves’ lack of activity at power forward all seemingly points one way: Ben Simmons    There is a section on Vando:    &gt;Jarred Vanderbilt will factor into the mix as well. He is a restricted free agent and has been locked in a long negotiation for a new contract, but he will be back next season. He will either get a multiyear deal (things are pointing in that direction) or sign the qualifying offer and play one more season before reaching unrestricted free agency. He showed flashes of strong play, rugged and versatile defense and, maybe most importantly, is a superb rebounder. He averaged 11.6 boards per 36 minutes last season, his first fully healthy campaign in four years. He started 30 games for the Wolves last season, and it would not be a surprise to see him back in the starting lineup should the Wolves hold pat on any more roster moves before training camp begins at the end of September.     Vando coming back was never in question and again this deal changes absolutely nothing about the principle pieces offered in a proposed Simmons deal."

Stay in your lane Jon and give me an update on that Jarred Vanderbilt re-signing!
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
3. Jarred Vanderbilt   2. Thaddeus Young   1. Draymond Green
I think we only have $7M in cap left and we are planning to re-sign Jarred Vanderbilt for some of that. We've been rumored to be interested in Millsap but we only have the MLE and odds are he's going to get a similar or better offer from a contender.
Na his defence is still fine. And he can playmake a bit. But he was a black hole on offence.  At the end of the day he was completely redundant to us when Josh Okogie and to an extent Jarred Vanderbilt do the exact same things as Culver but better. We couldnt have 4 bench guys all incapable of scoring. And thats why Jaden McDaniels and Jaylen Nowell both got chances ahead of him
"I kind of understand how the Wolves won the trade - Culver needs to be another team's rehab project and most Wolves fans are just completely out on Juancho but my God your forward rotation outside of McDaniels is absolutely awful.  Ant's too small to defend the 3 + doesn't have the defensive acumen yet. Okogie's undersized and is a black hole on offense.  That leaves you Taurean Prince (solid enough as a rotation guy, but he's also an expiring that I don't see being on the team in the future), Jarred Vanderbilt (basically a small-ball 5 but okay maybe you can work around that with KAT), Jake Layman (oh boy)."
"Maybe superstar is a bit much, but I’m a huge fan of Jarred Vanderbilt"
"&gt;Get some great defenders and some pass first players and you'll have a great team  Like Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, and Jarred Vanderbilt? It was sure better than having DLo to have Ricky out on the floor with those guys. And yes, I am telling you he is just as good as those guys as a playmaker. In fact, he has better passing touch and a wider pick and roll vocabulary than those 4 minus Ja. When he was the sole focal point of the offense in Brooklyn (like Ja and Lillard are), he also averaged a couple more assists getting him to 7.0 apg and led them to a playoff berth. I'm not saying he's as good a player as those guys, because he isn't as good as them, but as a passer, he's undeniably gifted."
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)). They posted their own Three All-Defensive Teams ausing the G/G/F/F/C format and . I would like to bring them here!

"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"Same Defensive rating before and after Vooch trade. Thad young is a loss defensively on the interior absolutely. Our perimeter defense is miles better. Temple was injured often and was playing SIGNIFICANT minutes for us. Dude is too old to be heavy rotationally. WCJ was feasted on and gave career highs to a stretch of stars before being traded.   Theis/Thad are the big defensive losses, with FA still going and Lauri still in our pocket if we got someone like Khem Birch as a backup big/Sign for Paul Millsap or trade for Jarred Vanderbilt we will shore up our weakness on the interior for sure.  Pretty terrible take to assume we would automatically be worse on defense when our perimeter defense is overhauled completely and gives Vooch a huge upgrade as vooch is NOT a bad defender. He just cant defend the perimeter, because of our trash perimeter defense he was being forced to switch often.   If you keep Vooch in the paint hes actually an average defender."
So Jarred Vanderbilt is the starting PF next year then? I'd laugh if it wasn't all so sad.
Jarred Vanderbilt
Jarred Vanderbilt too
Jarred Vanderbilt is another one.
