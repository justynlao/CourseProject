"Injury Report before anyone asks ""Why are the Heat 6-12?"" tomorrow:  \- Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Avery Bradley, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, Chris Silva all OUT"
"Blazer fan here. We basically brought in Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. to fill the vacated roles that Maurice Harkless and Al-Faruq Aminu filled during our WCF run a couple years ago. They are here to play good defense and if they can hit some shots on top of that great. Otherwise fine leave it to Dame, CJ, Gary and Melo. The more important and urgent matter other than Roco’s 3p% is the team health. Both Roco and DJJ are currently out with a concussion and a right quad contusion respectively. Hopefully we’ll get them both back in a week or two but we will still be missing Nurk and CJ for a while. To be clear Dame is literally our only healthy starter right now."
"Plus some guys get incentives in their contract to shoot above a certain percent.  [Mo Harkless had one that sorta backfired for portland cuz  he stopped shooting 3s near the end of the season since he was close to 35% and he didnt wanna lower it](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/maurice-harkless-and-500000-question-shoot-or-not-shoot-3-pointer#:~:text=Harkless%20this%20summer%20signed%20a,better%20from%20three%2Dpoint%20range.)  &gt;Since March 1, Harkless saw a marked drop off in three-point attempts. After attempting nearly three a game leading up to March, Harkless since then went 10-for-30 over the last 21 games. His bonus-clinching night came April 3 at Minnesota, when he made 3-of-5."
Let's get rid of Maurice Harkless and get DJJ back

"Stotts is a coach who specifically is good at getting the best out of his role players, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Seth Curry, Shabazz Napier, Allen Crabbe, Maurice Harkless, he’s extremely good at putting players into positions to shine with their particular skillsets and it’s why we’ve had so many reclamation projects or seen so many journeymen get paid after stops in Portland.  Hell, look at how good he managed to make Hassan Whiteside look after he wasn’t even seeing the court anymore."

"For real. Still not a good look overall:  &gt;The incident took place in the third quarter after Kings forward Maurice Harkless drove through the lane and threw down a dunk over Bitadze, who just stopped and watched it happen at the rim. &gt; &gt;Bitadze then hit a 3-pointer at the other end on the next possession. **As he was running back down the court to play defense, he appeared to turn to Foster and tell him to “sit the fuck down.”** &gt; &gt;That didn’t sit well with Foster, who erupted and started screaming at Bitadze as soon as the play was dead and the game went into a timeout. &gt; &gt;Bitadze finished the night with five points and six rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench."

Maurice Harkless revenge game
"i would be mad but this trash team absolutely deserves ridicule. i love fox but he’s not really an alpha to me, even when he goes sicko mode and averages 35 PPG for a week i don’t really see him as the soul of the team like someone like jimmy butler. our team has no heart, most of the team has had no reaction to our losing streak  and i didn’t follow the knicks closely during the fizdale era but he cannot be worse than luke walton, i swear that an AI could coach this team better. walton literally had maurice harkless as our center down the stretch last night"
"Ahh yes, cause a team consisting of Maurice Harkless and Al-Farouq Aminu as the starting forwards is a championship contender."
maurice harkless- lol
Who else they gonna start? These idiots let Crowder walk for nothing and signed Maurice Harkless. Riley is horrible he lucky Lebron got him 2 rings
" The Knicks traded Morris to the Los Angeles Clippers in a three team trade with the Washington Wizards on February 6, 2020, sending Maurice Harkless to New York and Jerome Robinson to Washington"
Bucks Torrey Craig was Heat Maurice Harkless level cheek
"Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless, MCW, Elfrid Payton, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz  That one time they drafted Mikael Bridges but opted to trade him for Zhaire Smith.. idk how much of who overruling who at that time but the scoutings were def into Zhaire Smith enough to convince acting GM Brett Brown to pull that trade"

"Drummond took the min to back up Embiid.  Wow.  Also, Maurice Harkless got the exact same contract as Bobby Portis.  Man that contract is great for MIlwaukee."
Maurice Harkless and Alfarouq Aminu are on their way out of the league
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Jimmy Butler trade:  July 6, 2019: As part of a 4-team trade, traded by the Philadelphia 76ers to the Miami Heat; the Los Angeles Clippers traded cash to the Miami Heat; the Miami Heat traded a 2023 1st round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Miami Heat traded Josh Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Miami Heat traded Hassan Whiteside to the Portland Trail Blazers; the Philadelphia 76ers traded Mathias Lessort to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Portland Trail Blazers traded Maurice Harkless to the Los Angeles Clippers; and the Portland Trail Blazers traded Meyers Leonard to the Miami Heat. $110K (top-14 protected)  76ers trade both Jimmy Butler and Mathias Lessort.  Next time don't be so adamant you're right and be an asshole about it, especially trying to use text that doesn't mean what you think it means as justification."
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
"&gt; Josh Richardson was acquired by the Philadelphia Sixers in exchange for Jimmy Butler and the draft rights to Mathias Lessort. Hassan Whiteside was acquired by the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Maurice Harkless and Meyers Leonard. Maurice Harkless, the draft rights to Mathias Lessort and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own) were acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for cash. Jimmy Butler, Meyers Leonard and cash were acquired by the Miami Heat in exchange for Josh Richardson, Hassan Whiteside and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own)."
I gotta think Presti would have demanded both in exchange for a couple less future picks.   The Clips had to do the last minute Maurice Harkless trade just to get the extra pick that put the PG deal over the goal line.  They didn't have enough to get it done before that and I'd think OKC would have demanded both SGA and MPJ in the initial talks.
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
"&gt;Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney   I strongly disagree with this. I think the 5 players would win.   The thing about these star players is that they force help defense from a second defender and create an imbalance. Defending them is about weighing up stopping them vs creating the imbalance.   If you have an extra player then you can help out while everybody else stays home.   And the 5 will get an open shot at the other end almost every time down."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
He should pull a Maurice Harkless and stop shooting 3s after he hits 40%
"2011 - Vuc -&gt; Shumpert  2012 - Maurice Harkless -&gt; Royce White   2013 - MCW -&gt; Steven Adams   2014 - Embiid -&gt; Aaron Gordon  2015 - Jah -&gt; Kristaps  we'd be god awful, man.  Any scenario in which we don't draft Embiid and this team is essentially the Kings"
"I know. I always thought his full name was ""Moe Harkless"". I didn't know it was actually Maurice until I read the above comments."
That lineup down the stretch... What the hell  PG: Davion Mitchell  SG: Buddy Hield  SF: Tyrese Haliburton  PF: Maurice Harkless  C: Damian Jones  &amp;#x200B;  The Alvin Gentry experience is changing things up
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
"Maurice fuckin Harkless. Dude plays his role so well, doesn’t try to do too much but will slash and shoot some 3s from the corner to spread the floor. Runs well in transition. And most importantly, the dude plays damn good defense. Versatile at that too. A lot of guys are rightfully getting credit but Harkless has been very positive for us."
"I think probably because he was a young socialite on the Lakers. Nobody talks about how Maurice Harkless, Royce O’Neal or other random middling players play. Kuzma sparks many love/hate boners for people for some reason lol. All those boners are irrational."
