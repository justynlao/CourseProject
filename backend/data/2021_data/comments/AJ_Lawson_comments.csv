"PJ Dozier.  He is a top 15 player in the league no matter how much people try to deny it.  Also since you said basketball player and not NBA, AJ Lawson. He may fall in the upcoming draft but he will be a star like PJ.   Sindarius Thornwell too. Get this man a contract."
AJ Lawson
Agreed. AJ Lawson pick 46 to Raptors will have the best career

AJ Lawson is arguably the greatest NBA player since PJ Dozier or Sindarius Thornwell
To me it really looks like AJ Lawson threw a bad pass in transition and then committed basket interference. But nice job by Mays saving that.
"Lowry, AJ Lawson, Derozan, Butler, Bam sounds like a great lineup with tons of shooting to me! AJ was stroking that thing in college."
