Mavs guard Josh Green in there too üëÄ
"Gotta watch the games man. His defense this season has been insane by his standards, it‚Äôs been a huge revelation. He also has a midrange game now that‚Äôs damn near automatic that he for sure didn‚Äôt have last year. He‚Äôs added huge facets to his game while still keeping up the standard for the things he‚Äôs always done well.   The team‚Äôs just doing worse. We started josh green for multiple games. Got new players, new rotations, new strengths and weaknesses. If anything, the only constant has been how well luka has been playing this season.   To me, he‚Äôs a much improved all around player this season as compared to last. The only problem is that the record of the team doesn‚Äôt reflect that improvement, and that‚Äôs certainly not on him."
"Damn, is this what it‚Äôs like to be hated on by rNBA? I know not everyone can keep up with every team but context matters.   We‚Äôve had some combination of our 2nd-6th best players, including our 3 best defenders, out for the past 10ish games, which happened to be what everyone pegged as the hardest stretch of the season even before Covid hit us. We are maybe the hardest hit team by Covid to not get any (sans 1 I think) games postponed. Several of our guys were legitimately sick and are just now starting to look like their legs are back under them. It would have been nice to have the last two weeks off to recover instead slogging our way through a meat grinder of a month but it didn‚Äôt work out that way. Our best 3 point shooter and defender only just came back tonight. I mean we‚Äôve been starting Wes Iwundu, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Josh Green most of these games. Yeah Kristaps has started slow like usual and we still could have performed better in January but I‚Äôm not gonna throw in the towel after losing to a good Suns team on the first night all season all of our starters actually played together. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfall from grace‚Äù. They‚Äôll figure it out."
"Should've traded up heavily to get Haliburton. Josh Green pick, DFS, Brunson, and the 31st pick.  That or drafted like Sadiq Bey or Precious."

"For the thousandth time.  We. Have. Been. Ravaged. By. Covid. And. Injuries.   Until these past 2 games he was playing alongside Josh Green, Wes Iwundu, Caulie-Stein, and KP who is just a shell of himself right now.  I don‚Äôt think he should be an MVP candidate right now but he‚Äôs still been playing great, especially considering the circumstances he‚Äôs in."
OMG JOSH GREEN
Who the hell is Josh Green
"Can we just have a stickied post on /r/nba that says the Mavs have missed 6 of their best players for 10+ games (COVID and Porzi≈Üƒ£is surgery)? Like I'm so tired of just typing out the same response over and over to folks that just look at record with no context.   We've been starting WCS, Wes Iwundu and Josh Green ffs. Of course we are 8-10."
"2019: PJ Washington  2020: Jalen Smith, Deni Avidja. I'm high on all of the wings from last year's draft as well (Okoro, Nesmith, Saddiq Bey, Josh Green)"
they've had a stretch where they had to start garbage time players like wes iwundu and josh green and had james johnson run the 2nd unit  don't think it's reasonable to judge them right now
&gt; Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of: &gt;  &gt; C: Willie Caulie Stein &gt;  &gt; PF: Wes Iwundu &gt;  &gt; SF: Tim Hardaway Jr. &gt;  &gt; SG: Josh Green &gt;  &gt; PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  The Mavs haven't started that lineup at all this season.
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porzi≈Üƒ£is missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porzi≈Üƒ£is is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
"lmao these guys are acting like LeBron would turn Wes Iwundu and Josh Green from 14% and 9% 3PT shooters into 40% 3PT shooters.   LeBron is obviously incredible, but if he's on the current Mavs they are maybe 10-8, instead of 8-10. Luka is creating great looks, our role players and 3rd stringers (who are having to play 20-30 MPG due to COVID) are just not hitting wide open shots.   Iwundu and Green are in the bottom percentile of players for 3PT% on wide open (defender is 6+ feet away)  shots. LeBron isn't going to do much to change that."
"Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of:   &amp;#x200B;  C: Willie Caulie Stein  PF: Wes Iwundu  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Green  PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  with a bench of Boban, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, James Johnson  &amp;#x200B;  Porzi≈Üƒ£is came back a few games ago but is still rusty and until last night we had been missing 3-4 starters. We were 6-4 before COVID hit, keep in mind that was also without Porzi≈Üƒ£is. We have not played a single game with our projected starting lineup.   If you watch our games you will see that Luka is the only reason we are near 0.500. We've been garbage without him on the court. This is also coming from a huge Luka critic. I can't deny the impact he's had on our team. His 3PT shooting has been bad, but he's also had no spacing, and defenders are not respecting our shooters, so the lanes are clogged and teams are able to triple team Luka and leave Iwundu, Green and WCS wide open. Iwundu and Green are shooting 14.3 and 9.1% respectively from 3 and they've been two of our starters the past month.   If Dallas is still treading water when the COVID guys are back and get their conditioning back, and Porzi≈Üƒ£is is in his groove, then sure, there are some valid concerns, but as it stands now, Luka has kept us in the playoff race despite being down our 2nd-6th best players for over half the season."
Bruh we a g league team rn too. Cauley Stein and Josh Green both starting when Texas Legends have a better frontcourt than that hahah
Josh Green 3 finally!
Josh green low key lookin pretty good the past 2 games as well
"If I have one complaint about how my Mavs are playing it‚Äôs that there are several players who are just bricking wide open threes. Teams are openly using double team coverage on Luka to dare our other shooters to shoot it and we are just no converting them enough. I‚Äôm convinced Wes iwundu has never shot a three in his life with the way he shoots it. We signed him for defense only. Josh green bricked a couple, but I‚Äôm gonna give him a pass. He doesn‚Äôt get many opportunities on that end and he‚Äôs still a rook with development potential and playing great on defense and transition offense. Glad we are getting our other starters back. If the Mavs can hit threes at the league average, they‚Äôre gonna be a scary team on the west."
"I mean he‚Äôs not entirely wrong, but it‚Äôs definitely a combination of both. Horford absolutely wrecked our spacing and we basically swapped him and Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and Danny Green in the starting lineup"
"It's a testament to his greatness that it isn't lower. He was playing with James Johnson, Josh Green, and Willie Caulie Stein a lot of the time - do what you will with that information."
Danny Green and Seth Curry aren‚Äôt in his way like Horford and Josh Richardson were last year too.
covid is wrecking the Mavs. That being said Josh Green looks like a promising glue/hustle guy
"Yup, because TS truly encapsulates a player's worth. Why do we even need scouts anymore when we have bball reference? Luka has had all the spacing in the world to help increase his TS the past 5 games, with superstar talents in the starting lineup like Rookie Josh Green, end of bench piece Wes Iwundu, vet min Willie Cauley Stein, and injured Tim Hardaway with the recent addition of rehabbed Kristaps Porzingis!"
Am I the only person who just learned about NBA player / highlight maker Josh Green?
No one can say Josh Green doesn't try
Josh Green is one (just looked up least ppg per 36 among qualified guys)  1.5/2.1/0.4/0.2/0 (added together is 4.2)  does that in 11.7 mpg  4.2/11.7 is 0.358
I like Josh Green man he's solid
"Josh Green, rookie and elite perimeter defender"
Josh Green looking nice

That‚Äôs my man Josh Green of course
Josh Green has shown flashes of being an elite perimeter defender but he is a little foul prone right now
"Normally I‚Äôm not one for excuses, but nah man. There‚Äôs nothing we can do at this point.   The entire core of our team is out, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre just missing a few guys. Everyone who can shoot the 3 on our team is out except KP, and he‚Äôs rusty still. All of our core wing defenders are out, Josh Green and Wes Iwundu are now our 2 main defenders.   Missing your entire 3 and D core is a death sentence in today‚Äôs NBA"
"What? We started Iwundu and Josh Green, who would get 0 minutes on a normal day in a close game. We literally had third stringers playing first string. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been smoking to think the full health Bulls roster is worse than Mavericks with 6 of their 8 best players out."
"Josh Green is literally just Justin Anderson 2.0, I don't understand Donnie."
"can‚Äôt handle this joke season, how are the mavs even playing an nba game with 6 of their top 8 out. josh green gets 0 minutes on a normal day and he‚Äôs starting"
Tyrell Terry is Poor man's Seth Curry. Josh Green is really poor man's josh richardson.
I counter you with this trade.   Lakers get: Josh Green  Mavs get: Lebron James and AD
Poor Josh Green he‚Äôs had the most unlucky game
holy shit that Josh Green defense!!
Josh green getting the rookie whistle right now lol
I am so frustrated for Josh Green right now
No doubt. I saw Josh Green out there in the first half and i was like ‚Äú???‚Äù
"Starting lineup for our last game was - Doncic - Tim Hardaway Jr - Wes Iwundu - Willie Caulie Stein - Porzingis  we played a 9 man rotation featuring those 5 plus Josh Green, Trey Burke, James Johnson, and Boban  should look similar tonight"
"Think you‚Äôll see a drop off but still will be much better than last years. With additions like josh green, j rich and James Johnson, the mavs shouldn‚Äôt be in the bottom half of Defensive efficiency"

Shoutout to Josh Green who balled out today.
"I never want to see Wes iwundu play again, give all his minutes to josh green"
Josh green is a hell of a defender
"We call that our Opposum play, play dead by having Boban get confused about the screen and Luka drives by all 9 players while they‚Äôre all watching him argue with Josh green"
Josh Green is basically the same as a 1st round pick anyways
"Realistic offer could be something like Josh Green and a second, not sure the Mavs do this given the fact Oladipo is expiring."
"As we know, only one person can shorten their name as a nickname  It's why Josh Howard is the only Josh allowed in NBA history  Also why I always make sure to say Jeffrey Green lest anyone disrespect Jeff Teague"

"We'll just have to see. I think that makes sense   At the same time, i think Shake will close games in a lot of matchups. Better defense now that he's gained weight, better creator, and still a very good shooter.  It will depend what they need, but the overall construct is so much better. If Josh and Danny Green are about the same type and level and contract,  then we exchanged Horford for Seth Curry plus an improved Shake - holy shit."
"yeah def agree with everything u said here. I do like THJ as a player but like u mentioned, replacing OPJ with THJ doesn‚Äôt really do anything for the bulls since it‚Äôs an expiring contract for an expiring contract. Maybe the Mavs could throw in Josh Green (even though probably super unlikely) since OPJ is kinda of what Josh Green would project as anyways? But yeah, I love OPJ and def think he would flourish with Luka at the helm with the Mavs."
Luka KP Maxi DFS Brunson Dwight Powell (sigh) JRich Josh Green

I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs the case.   The reason why we‚Äôre winning so many games because of Simmons defense.   People underrate how impactful he is on the game. They focus on his shooting but watch how it impacts a game.   Josh Richardson was not a good pairing with Ben Simmons last year. He‚Äôs not really a shooter. Now that we have Seth and Danny Green it‚Äôs completely different.
"I've been noticing this for some time. It certainly seems to have become fashionable for a lot of guys to execute their dunks in as plain and routine of a way as possible.   It's hard to argue with guys just wanting to get the job done while utilizing minimal energy and creativity (this is likely big among the ""dunk is only worth two points"" crowd) but as a fan, I totally miss when guys seemed like they were dying to show what they could do to the rim when given the opportunity.   /u/honditar already mentioned so many, but it's pretty wild in hindsight to think back to how many entertaining dunkers there were just a bit over a decade ago.   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Jason Richardson  * LeBron James   * Desmond Mason  * Ricky Davis  * Tracy McGrady  * J.R. Smith  * Stromile Swift  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Kevin Garnett  * Darius Miles  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Richard Jefferson  * Gerald Green  * Josh Smith  * Chris Andersen  * Dwyane Wade  Today's game is obviously still amazingly skilled and we're seeing shooting like we've never seen in NBA history but as a lifelong mega fan of the dunk, yeah, I miss it.   As an isolated example, tonight 20-year-old Sekou Doumbouya broke out into the open floor for a completely wide open fast break opportunity. Could have been a windmill, reverse, 360, or even just an emphatic one-handed hammer. Instead, we got slow motion skip step and one of those layup line drop-ins. And again, from a basketball game standpoint, that's totally fine (nice for Sekou to score either way) but I miss the funk."

Would love to see some Josh Green minutes here
"For me personally Gerald Green Pat Bev Capela Ariza PJ Tucker and basically anybody from the 2016-18 teams as well as Josh Smith and Corey Brewer for that one game, and Aaron Brooks"
"Nance Jr. and eating Cedi's contract for James Johnson's expiring, Josh Green or Tyrell Terry and one or two 2nds."
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3.

"honestly your team - Danny Green + a late 1st. But I love Josh Hart and would love to plug him into the Sixers starting lineup at the 3, and would trade a late 1st for him straight up even without the other two. Also, even though JJ looks washed this year if you're gonna have a shooter off the bench I'd still rather it be JJ than Green. Also some sentimentality with JJ if I'm being honest."
"What a difference having Porzi≈Üƒ£is, and 5 rotation players back does for you.   Folks that were bashing Luka for not winning more games with Wes Iwundu, Josh Green and Willie Caulie-Stein were pathetic."
Butler is averaging 20/8/8 and I feel like that's pretty reflective of his impact lol  G: Conley  G: Mikal Bridges  F: Josh Hart  F: Draymond Green  C: Rudy Gobert
Yeah Gordon is also a legit floor spacer regardless of what his %s are teams guard him. The anti Josh Richardson per se. Solid on ball defender who can switch actually like him better vs quicker guards than Danny green. He has issues never passes not good at quick decision making and injuries are also a concern. But still I think it‚Äôs worth it   Lowry is hard to gauge he‚Äôs an FA after this year but my guess is he won‚Äôt be a raptor next year. I actually think Toronto would listen even with their recent streak if someone made a legit offer.
so philly sends over their 2021 FRP. but losing green leaves them pretty short at sf. maybe flip thybulle for josh hart?  edit: nvm. salaries dont work out by a mere $2K
"It's a win trade considering the situation. Pop wasn't gonna give the Lakers another Superstar, and again, their offer for Kawhi at the time wasn't close to his value, specially after looking what they sent for AD. The best value of the trade was BI. Lonzo doesn't do much for us. We have enough guards. Josh Hart really isn't as valuable either.  &gt; Ingram at 21  Would have been nice, but Derozan has done his job as the first offensive option. The sole reason we struggled so much last year was having two of the worst defenders in the entire league taking so many minutes alongside Derozan, and we had lost DJ for a season. Plus, Ingram isn't a stud on defense as well. Derozan's job is offense and to facilitate, and he does that well. His defense struggle can be hidden by playing him as a Forward while he's alongside good defensive players. He has bought into the team, and it's also an awesome presence for our young unit. Derozan has saved us many games. He's far from perfect, but he isn't the main issue with our team.   &gt;Lonzo/1st round pick   Why have Lonzo when we have Derrick White and Dejounte? We got a first round pick from Toronto that turned into Big Body, and Jak fills that very much needed defensive anchor as Lamarcus has regressed a lot.  &gt; While giving away D Green  Danny was sent to match salary, and the dude was coming off a bad year. So you can very well say it was Danny for Jakob and Keldon, and both have turned out incredibly well. May not have been that good because we gave up our perimeter defense, but seeing how the team is with Keldon and Jakob, I'd say it was worth it in hindsight.  &gt;  Just doesn‚Äôt make any sense at the time and now  It made sense at the time. Kawhi tanked his value, and with the mystery surrounding his injury, no team was gonna give anything for a year rental. Lakers offered, but for a player like Kawhi, and them being conference rivals, it wasn't worth it. No matter what the team would have done, we would have been clowned, either for not falling for the ""godsend"" offer, or because we gifted the Lakers a free superteam In both situations, we were getting fleeced. People talk about how we could have gotten an AD-like haul or a PG-like, but that type of deal was never offered in the first place for us. Toronto was the team with the best offer, since Pop really wasn't gonna spend his last years in a rebuild, so we took that one. Toronto made the gamble with Kawhi and it paid off. We did made the playoffs with Derozan on his first year, and pushed the second seed Nuggets to 7, but last year we went to shit thanks to Marco and Bryn Forbes playing so goddam much. This season we are in a much better position for now. We were expected to be under 30 games for the season."
"We went 3-9 between Jan 13th and Feb 1st. 5 of our guys got sat for covid or contact tracing on Jan 12th, they came back on the 27th, and spent the next week trying to play themselves back into shape.  Luka carried us so fucking hard, but you just can't do it when you're starting next to Willie Cauley-Stein, Wes Iwundu, and Josh Green. Coincided with the media pile-on about his whining, and 3pt shooting woes. I'm glad it's not January anymore."
"I honestly gave up trying to explain this to my friends lol. I think this may be partially the media's fault, there was so much buzz how we were 7-12 and the worst 3 pt shooting team in the league while we missed 5 key players for like 3 weeks. The reality is that you won't win many games in the West when starting Wes Iwundu, Josh Green and Cauley-Stein"
"&gt;As a Mavs fan all I‚Äôm accepting is. Wiseman, Wiggins and first round pick 2021 (timberwolves). We can give them Josh Green and Cauley-Stein  One of the tweets in the thread. Lmaooo Warriors would hang up the phone so fast"
What about Porzingis and Josh Green

"Wow Josh Green signed it, he helping the cause"
KP hasn‚Äôt been great all year but hopefully that‚Äôs turning around. THJ is hot/cold which can be great and bad. Richardson has alright but also missed time due to covid.  I keep seeing this but I don‚Äôt think people realize how bad our 8-12th men are. I mean we were playing Iwundu and Josh Green extended minutes. 3/4 players we missed were our top 3 defensive players and the other one was our backup PG. It‚Äôs definitely a legitimate excuse. We also went through a brutal stretch of games like that while Portland has had a relatively easy schedule. All this to say that team record isn‚Äôt the best way to judge this.
Yeah tbh I think part of it is teams still arent smart about how they attack bad defenders. I remember last year seeing all these Josh Richardson post ups vs Trae Young just fundamentally useless. It's like how teams try posting up James Harden instead of exploiting him off ball in transition and in help defense/rotations.   Think for that series I might kind of ditch Danny Green and start Shake Milton. Make Trae either guard Shake in pick and rolls or especially Seth coming off screens. Because Trae is a bad enough defender still where even for a guard he alone if you go at him right can make it significantly harder for a team to field a good defense when he's on the court.
The main difference is he can take more pull up trigger threes and he's more decisive with the ball in his hands. Also he now plays the 4 and with seth curry and Danny Green instead of al Horford and josh Richardson. I think that's bigger for tobi.
"Dude you don't know anything about the Mavs to talk about them. Our team is still decimated. 5 of our rotation players were out for multiple weeks and we had only 1 game postponed. We had to play with Iwandu and Josh Green as rotational players. The players that were out came back and haven't looked the same since. Plus KP is having a rollercoaster of a year, but he was out for an extended period of time. Luka and Brunson are literally the only two we can count on to play good basketball."

I love josh green and happy he's on the mavs but bey is a beast.
Saddiq bey is a guy I wanted to draft :( I like josh green I think he‚Äôs going to develop really nicely and I have faith in our FO but owie
I like Josh green but man this guy is a flamethrower
"He had some personality flags and was wildly inconsistent in college, but great value for MN grabbing him at 28. He showed flashes of high end ability at UW and made Josh Green look like a helpless kid in one of their matchups."
"Throw on a puerto rican here and there to honor Barea. Canadian in case Powell goes off, Australian in case Josh Green reveres logic and reason, dropping 50"
Mavs have an Aussie! Rookie Josh Green. No Cameroon or Turks though.
"ha just thinking back to my 2k days growing up I would always trade for guys like josh smith, darius miles, jrich, iggy used to throw some insane dunks, gerald green"

Josh Green once again no minutes... i don't get it. Even if he's not that good rn just fucking play him
There's is no good reason for Josh Green to get 0 minutes in this game while Josh Richardson goes 1-11
"‚ÄúWow the clippers traded Chris Paul, JJ Reddick, Jamal Crawford, Luc Mbah a Moute, Paul Pierce, Jeff Green, Josh Smith, Lance Stevenson, and how many of their 1st round picks for the next 20 years for KD, Kyrie, Harden, and LMA????‚Äù - me five years ago if someone told me that"
"Lol that‚Äôs a load of bullshit, harden made the WCF and was 2nd in the west in 2015 with Trevor ariza, Terrence jones Josh smith, Corey Brewer, patrick beverley, tarik black, Joey dorsey, Jason Terry, 41 games of washed howard, taking up all the minutes lmao  He‚Äôs a great fit with green, harden and green screen and roll would be lethal. What a dumb comment"
Gordon for josh Green and Tyrell terry?

josh green sighting!
"You don't have to sell me on Brunson. I love what he brings to the team, and for me, he's almost untouchable in trades. At the same time, I think he's in the perfect role for him right now. He's already averaging 25 minutes so I don't know how much difference 5 minutes would make. That's definitely a different perspective I hadn't thought of before though, and it's definitely worth considering.  I think my thing with JRich is that he's a ""3&amp;D wing"" and I think we're still short a couple of those guys unless/until Josh Green develops more. But, his job this season has been to guard point guards. Rubio can do that. If memory serves, he was doing that at a high level in Utah. I don't know what his defense looks like now, but that could be interesting.  Thanks for helping me see a different perspective. Really appreciate it!"
I like Josh Green.
"Quickley, Desmond Bane, Saddiq Bey.  But those are all the players the Mavs could have gotten instead of Josh Green sooooooooo"
Kuminga stock has dropped significantly. Looks like the next Josh Jackson. Can‚Äôt shoot at all and just too weak to finish around NBA caliber bigs. He‚Äôs a tier below Jalen Green
"Nah. JR Smith, Josh Smith, Jeff Green had talent. Harden has greatness."
"Nah. JR Smith, Josh Smith, Jeff Green had talent. Harden has greatness."
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven‚Äôt seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I‚Äôm not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we‚Äôve played a lot better than our record so I‚Äôm optimistic for the first time in a long time."
Why is Josh Green not on this list?!
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."

"Well that explains a lot. Luka stans tend to be impatient when it comes to talent development. I guess we can revisit it in a year and a half and see where things stand.   You saying he‚Äôs been cheeks tells me you haven‚Äôt been watching any of our recent games. Bey is looking solid but he‚Äôs on a terrible team. He wouldn‚Äôt be some difference maker for Dallas by any stretch of the imagination and wouldn‚Äôt be getting the same minutes or shot attempts he is Detroit. Green is already looking better defensively, which has been much needed. Bey very well may end up being the better player but Green is our guy now so we‚Äôre going to support him. It‚Äôs part of being a fan of a team and not an individual. Luka clearly loves Josh Green and we believe he has loads of potential too."
Josh green can‚Äôt shoot but damn he‚Äôs got great instincts
Josh Green will slowly eat his minutes if he can't turn it around.
JOSH GREEN GETTING MINUTES LETS FUCKING GOOO
No he called josh green Powell
He called Josh Green Richardson at one point I think
"We literally have a top 5 coach , and people want to fire him because he likes to experiment with lineups, and doesn't play Josh Green enough like really? Main reason we went to 6 last year against the clippers was 1.Luka being Luka 2. Carlisle absolutely shitting on doc rivers."
"Basically look at Dwight Powell's 25-pt, 11/12 FGs game last month, then make it happen more often throughout the season. It would also add another playmaker option, so not having Luka on the floor doesn't mean you're just left with Jalen Brunson.  Can't have the same roster though as the pick used for Josh Green MUST convey to ATL instead."
I love Josh Green
Josh Green gives me joy.
I've meant to ask  What is the Josh Green is Luka's son thing lol?
Josh Green deserves atleast 10 minutes a night .
Josh Green has looked so good since starting to crack into the rotation.
Josh Green and Doe Doe are really the injections of energy Mavs need
"i would rather give josh green a good chunk of richardsons minutes than let him tank him already horrible value even more, we are not going to win the championship this year so we should develop a player that fits luka's timeline. Also he is luka's son"
The west will not be ready for Josh Green
I love josh green man
"Rick needs to tell Jrich that if he takes one more contested midrange shot because he doesn't have the ability to drive, he is getting benched for Josh Green I stg"
Just go ahead and put Josh Green in there for Richardson.
Fear Josh Green.
"The Clippers. The Hawks would be fun to watch with T-Mac, Stackhouse, Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Hinrich, Jeff Teague, Marvin Williams, Radmanovic, Erick Dampier, Zaza, and Willie Green."
Boban and Josh Green
"This is pretty wild. I like Barnes, but the top 5 is pretty set. I‚Äôd go:  1. Cade  2. Mobley  3. Suggs  4. Green  5. Kuminga   6. Keon Johnson  7. Josh Giddey  8. Scottie Barnes  9. Franz Wagner  10. Kai Jones  I do like BJ Boston though."
"I would also be happy if Josh Green became as good as an NBA finals MVP lol. But more realistically, I‚Äôm happy with what he did tonight and am excited to see more from him."
"If this was 2 years ago when they're tanking for a lotto pick, Josh Green would've definitely played. But things changed. In just two years, the Mavs are fighting for the 5th spot with zero margins for errors. The only player I would've drafted over Green is probably Bane of Memphis coz he can flat out shoot."
I'd be happy if he becomes as good as GSW Iguodala for the Mavs -- great on-ball defender/slasher/reliable playmaker. The team needs high IQ players outside Luka. I think Josh Green has it.
Josh Green with an all around good game   Dude is even instrumental on Jrich good game lol
"I know all the talk will be about Hardaway and rightfully so, but if Josh Green can develop on offense he is going to be a hell of a player.   He was all over the place tonight playing great defense, getting rebounds, and making hustle plays."
"I think it's honestly the reverse, we were just a different defensive team the 2nd quarter onwards. Josh Green helped out massively."
"Josh Green has been great, my issue with Rick is he barely gives the Rookies any playing time."
Josh green with 3 steals!
Everyone gonna talk about Timmy but JOSH FUCKING GREEN is a stud
Josh Green energizer bunny so much hustle plays tonight. Definitely earning his minutes and Ricks trust
What about Josh Green?
If this is the Josh Green game I will be so happy
Josh Green +17
Josh Green is all over the court.
Josh Green is straight up hustling right now
Josh Green is our Dennis Rodman?
Josh Green &gt; Josh Richardson
Josh Green is gonna be such a good player I promise
Sigh. At least Josh Green shows the occasional flashes.

Josh Green going for the belt this game
"The Mavs also have 20 mill in cap space after Redick and Hardaway expire. They can sign a big free agent this year and still keep Luka because restricted free agency. Then they could trade Josh Richardson, Josh Green and a few firsts for Bradley Beal. Doncic/Beal/DeRozan/Kleber/Porzingis is a team that could happen. Lebron and the Nets are both aging so this team could be the next powerhouse of the league."
They could give all his minutes to Josh Green in the name of development and I wouldn't be mad
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I‚Äôm not sure where the number four comes from?"
"For sure, I‚Äôm really hoping for Josh green to pan out, I might be homering here but his defense can be legit all-nba defense caliber"
"Mavs fans, why doesn‚Äôt Josh Green play? He looks good on defense"
Josh Green and Tyler Bey
Josh Green looks like maxisnice
Do y‚Äôall want fellow Canadian Dwight Powell??? or a lightly used Josh Green or Tyrell Terry???
"Stylistically, Draymond is a rich man's Josh Smith from his Aflanta days. Smith was a versatile defender with some passing acumen who couldn't shoot from the 4 position. That's Draymond. Green is a far, far superior player, but Smith in his prime was pretty unique."
"Other than 2000 what other ones   01 pau gasol, Zach Randolph, Tont Parker, Joe Johnson, tyson chandler, Richard Jefferson, gerald wallace     02 yao ming, amare stoudemire, caron butler, nene, tayshaun prince, John salmons, Mike Dunleavy    03 is obvious    04 Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, lol deng, andre igouldala, Devin Harris, al Jefferson, Jr Smith, Josh Smith, Tony Allen    05 Cp3, Deron Williams Andrew Bynum, Andrew bogut, Danny granger, David Lee, gerald Green, nate Robinson    06 Rondo, Lowry, Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Jr Reddick, rudy gay"
"Ingles, Delly and Baynes are no slouches on that end either, although the latter two have fallen off a fair bit.   Hoping Josh Green will get a chance to play as well. His athleticism will be useful."
"Looking at the NBA stats links posted above, Thybulle, Ingles, and Simmons are all top-notch defenders, though they'll have to make up for Mills/Baynes a bit. That team should have plenty of offense, too! I'm not sure how their depth is, but at least other names I recognize include Delly, Josh Green, and The Accountant. Their starting lineup should be able to hang with most other national teams, I think."

"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"Just curious, where did you get the TS% stat. If you are referencing the MavsMoneyBall article, that thing is 2 months old and was written right when Porzi≈Üƒ£is was coming back from his injury. Prior to that being published, Porzi≈Üƒ£is was averaging 20.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg on 47/35/86 shooting. He was also on a minutes restriction, he was a -3.6 and was also playing alongside G-Leaguers and rookies since the COVID protocols had DFS, JRICH, Maxi, Powell and Brunson all sitting. Since that has been published, KP has averaged 21 PPG and 10.3 RPG on 49/39/83 shooting and is a +6.1.   So naturally KP is going to have worse numbers when Luka sits and he was playing alongside James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nate Hinton and Josh Green.   In regards to winning games without Luka, naturally we aren't going to be as good without Luka, same with any team missing their best player. Last year we beat the #1 seed Milwaukee with just Porzi≈Üƒ£is. Donƒçiƒá missed a stretch of games and Dallas went 3-3 including close losses to Miami in OT (eventual EC champions), Boston and Toronto (#2 and #3 seeds). We beat the Spurs, Milwaukee and Philly.   I think you are expecting Dallas to play at the same level when Luka misses games and that's just not realisitc, there's natrually going to be a drop off. Even Porzi≈Üƒ£is playing at his best isn't going to drag a team starting Maxi, Brunson, DFS and Richardson to wins over contenders consistently. That's not possible for any team. Look at the Lakers when LeBron sits and just Davis plays. They are naturally not as good as when LeBron and Davis both play.   I guess I just don't get your point. You say that ""whenever Donciƒá sits, Porzingis is not convincing at being the first guy the opponents guard.""  However stats show Porzi≈Üƒ£is is doing fine when he's the primary option, he's scoring well and rebounding well. Then the argument shifts to well we are 1-4 without Donƒçiƒá. Well obviously that's going to be the case, he's our best player. Those are also games that Porzingis hasn't played either, so it seems completely irrelevant. You go from arguing Porzi≈Üƒ£is isn't a good primary option, to he's good at scoring but he can't lead the team.   The sample size is super small for games with Porzi≈Üƒ£is playing without Luka, but he's been able to step up when Luka has bad games. Just look at the last game against Milwaukee where Porzi≈Üƒ£is stepped up in the 4th quarter and brought us to the finish line."
"We drafted Josh Green over Saddiq Bey.  We have so, so many misses over my Mavs fandom."
"He did a great job, guy got rid of Horford's terrible contract for a 2025 protected first and some nobodies. Turned Josh Richardson into Seth Curry, and brought Doc Rivers who was a huge upgrade on Brett Brown. The Danny Green signing was also a shrewd one but unfortunately he's hurt right now. The Sixers got the goddamn #1 seed this year, it's not his fault his players and cosch are suddenly atrocious when it counts."
"Jokic is the only guy besides Kareem and Wilt to put up 30/20/10 in the playoffs. If Jeff Green doesn‚Äôt turn into Houston Josh Smith, KD loses this one as well."
Bob needs to make better picks than Josh Green
"Well, in Moneyball, Billy Beane overruled the scouts to acquire high-OBP players who he felt were undervalued and wound up contributing greatly to the regular-season success of the A's. In this situation, Bob overruled all the scouts to draft Josh Green and Tyrell Terry."
I wonder what the disagreements were for the picks.  I'm guessing people wanted saddiq bey over josh green since bey was way better and way less raw coming out?
"Multiple league and team sources point to the 2020 draft as a particularly egregious example of Voulgaris‚Äô power, an evening one source described as ‚Äúembarrassing.‚Äù Most members of the scouting department joined the team‚Äôs war room remotely through Zoom and were surprised when Voulgaris, attending in person, didn‚Äôt consult them for either of the team‚Äôs first two selections (Josh Green and Tyrell Terry) despite disagreements they held with at least one of the players he picked.  ‚ÄúWhat did (he) sell to Mark to make him believe (he) can do this?‚Äù asks one source with an intimate knowledge of the situation. ‚ÄúNobody knows.‚Äù  It marked another throughline of Voulgaris‚Äô tenure with the Mavericks: that his personality and decision making has steadily irritated and exasperated the team‚Äôs front office employees and players with both his decision making and personality over the course of the three seasons he‚Äôs been employed. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to people,‚Äù that same source says.  That‚Äôs best exemplified by Dallas‚Äô franchise player disliking him. Doncic‚Äôs strained relationship with Voulgaris predated their incident in February, multiple sources say. It wasn‚Äôt the only incident, either. This season, Voulgaris attended his first game in mid January, frequently appearing courtside at home and also traveling with them on the road in the months that followed. In mid-April, during the final minute of a home defeat to the New York Knicks, Voulgaris was seen on the game‚Äôs broadcast footage standing up and leaving with about 45 seconds remaining. While the Mavericks were trailing by 10 points at the time, they cut the deficit to six and extended the game seven more possessions before eventually losing."
"&gt; Multiple league and team sources point to the 2020 draft as a particularly egregious example of Voulgaris‚Äô power, an evening one source described as ‚Äúembarrassing.‚Äù Most members of the scouting department joined the team‚Äôs war room remotely through Zoom and were surprised when Voulgaris, attending in person, didn‚Äôt consult them for either of the team‚Äôs first two selections (Josh Green and Tyrell Terry) despite disagreements they held with at least one of the players he picked."
"Yeah, they were MUCH more talented with Kyrie also in the lineup. Houston never had a shooter near the caliber of Joe Harris. Jeff Green is the perfect small ball center for what the Rockets want to do, as evidenced by his play there last season. Claxton has played very much like a young Capela. Hell, even Blake Griffin is a secondary playmaker out of the front court that the Rockets haven‚Äôt had since Josh Smith.  I would at the very least compare it to the 2016-17 Rockets team, which went six against a 60-win team without anyone the caliber of Kyrie playing second fiddle for the two wins."

"Kp, Brunson, Josh Green for dame"
"Doncic/Finney-Smith/Josh Green/THJ/Kleber/Brunson/Powell/KP?  Who knows how the FO REALLY feels about Porzingis but not protecting him is a free way to get out of his contract, even though it's a huge negative at this point a needy team will give us something in return for him. If they don't protect KP then probably Tyrell Terry considering they picked him over some more NBA ready contributors last year.  If the mavs give up KP then an expansion team is definitely taking him but I would wager Josh Richardson is the one that gets snagged."
We keep:  - Luka - Brunson - DFS - Kleber - Josh Green - I guess KP - Tyler Bey - Bobi ‚ù§Ô∏è  Obviously we'd want THJ too but he's a free agent
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
"People on reddit love to speak on things they really have no business speaking about - like, they may have seen a game or two or they may have read an article or looked at basketball reference but why would they not trust the opinion of fans that watched the team the entire year? Dodo was making a push to put the ball on the floor in the final 10 games of the season but reverted back to being awful in the playoffs; Richardson has been awful the whole year ; KP gets stripped if he ever dribbles with his left hand; Brunson doesn't have good vision or point guard tendencies; Maxi can't dribble; Trey doesn't even play; Boban/WCS/Powell are all centers; Timmy is efficient but never really passes out of drives; etc. So, who does that leave that can realistically dribble and can make plays? Josh Green - the rookie?"
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."
yea the Mavs are one of the worst drafting teams in basketball   a miracle happened in 2018   Josh Green could be good... he has zero offense to speak of though... Terry was really raw coming into the draft and was dealing with personal issues... Tyler Bey had a great G-League performance but he‚Äôs not ready yet
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."

I initially mis-read your comment as just player they had drafted. It seems like a weird thing to criticize DAL over as they had just drafted those players before ATL did. Meaning they had been on rookie scale contracts but they just expired.   Luka Doncic  Josh Green  Tyrell Terry  Jalen Brunson  and then DFS is making 4 mil a year for the next 3 years or so
"It's hilarious how many people will make endless excuses for FO incompetence. ""WhAt WeRe ThEy SuPpOsEd To Do"" is all over this thread. No one forced the Mavs to trade Curry or draft Josh Green. They fucked up last offseason, plain and simple. Hopefully they do better this offseason for Luka's sake."
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"This. When Rick slotted Boban, he took away the paint that destroyed us in games 3-4. He bet that we could match them on the 3s show and was willing to give the mid-range as a tradeoff for actually getting rebounds in the offense (our 7'3 SG isn't good at rebounding, you see). It was a bet? Yes, but we don't have a depth deep enough to allow him to check-mate a team as good as the Clippers. Worked in G6, but we decided to brick 3s in a row, KP decided he did not like rebounds and Kawhi decided he was back in Toronto. Tonight worked as well, but they went frenzy on the mid range and Marcus Morris remembered how to shoot 3s.   Rick is the last one to blame. His only real mistakes were to not give Josh Green some minutes, just to see if he could tick PG off, and to let the 30m 7'3 guy roam around in the court, tricking y'all, doing nothing."
Give me Josh Green over J Rich
Get Richardson off the fucking floor man. Play Josh Green. Nobody. Idc.
How do y'all feel about Josh Green? I personally think he has the potential to make a few All Stars
He‚Äôs also played against Luka Doncic and his son Josh Green.
Mavs haven‚Äôt even unleashed Josh Green yet. World has no idea of our power
"THJ and Josh Green are easily the best.  I like Willie‚Äôs style too, but mostly I like his hair and tattoos."
Josh Green for the Mavs is similar to Ben with his accent. Josh‚Äôs is still there a bit more but sometimes you forget they have one and then they say Basketball real weird
I like seeing them like this. Cubes buying the Mavs was the single best thing to happen to the franchise up until we drafted Josh Green.  I wish other owners were like this
"how about Porzingis, Brunson, and Josh Green to OKC for Al Horford, 2022 FRP, 2023 2nd, Pokusevski, &amp; Isaiah Roby? Or another scenario where you send him to IND along with J-Rich, Tyrell Terry a 1st and Brunson for Brogdon and Turner?"
"I guess I get what you're saying but Doc, Jojo, and Tobias especially have benefitted from Al Horford and Josh Richardson being replaced by Seth Curry and Danny green more than Doc standing on the sidelines. Both Jo and Tobi play in the lane, which was ridiculously clogged last year.   I think Doc has certainly been an upgrade over Brett but it's less of a factor than having a lineup that actually fits has been."
"Mavs only have Luka. Maybe one of Josh Green, Tyrell Terry, or Tyler Bey becomes good, I mean they turn into beasts in 2K and we all know how accurate that is üëÄ"
I‚Äôd rather see Josh Green out there than Burke
Put in Josh Green for DFS
They sell this weird neon green josh smith jersey with the hawk on it at my local lids.
The Mavs as a team almost have nine different countries represented  Luka: Slovenia  KP: Latvia  Boban: Serbia  Josh Green: Australia  Melli: Italy  Dwight Powell: Canada  Maxi: Germany  Finney-Smith: USA
Mavs need their own energizer bunny in Josh Green to play in a similar role
"The Mavs need to acquire Sabonis if Pacers blow it up. They might need to chuck in Josh Green, picks + filler to make it work."
"The season averages are not indicative of the Mavs playoff team.  We were playing Wes Iwundu, James Johnson, Josh green earlier this season and just bricking wide open 3s"
Jesus Christ  Let's put Josh Green on em. It's not like he can be worse.
josh green time
* MVP: Luka Doncic * 6MOY: Jalen Brunson * DPOY: Kristaps Porzingis * MIP: Josh Green * COY: Rick Carlisle * Finals MVP: Boban Marjanovic
"Have you even looked at the Australian squad?   Simmons, Mills, Ingles, Baynes, Dellavedova, Thybulle, Josh Green, Broekhoff are all NBA players.   Australia have come 4th in both the Olympics and World Championships, both times losing the 3/4 playoff with a few questionable calls going against them. That was without Simmons and a number of others.   If they all play, there is no question that Australia could match or beat any national team other than the US. Not saying they are likely to win a gold any time soon, but they‚Äôll absolutely be in the mix for a medal."
"This discussion has been had and discredited a dozen times this year. Right now you have amazing role players. Who you gonna get that would be better in place of our current role players?  Especially as Josh Green has looked like he will develop into a guy like Dorian. And Hinton looks like he may be buckets.   And with the durability issue, you're proving my point that you can't trade him for a superstar.   It's not just wrong, it's dumb. Especially as the NBA requires salary cap matching. Meaning you can't just unload him for draft picks or low cost role players. You're filling the salary cap.   I roll the dice of KP's durability in light of the alternatives every year."
"Richardson will probably go unless he picks up his PO - he hasn‚Äôt fit the best this season (IMO). This summer will be very, very interesting. I am of the personal opinion that Porzingis needs to be traded and we should sign a center. My dream would be trading Porzingis + Josh Green + picks for a defensive back court player who can create their own offense when needed (not like we could get them but Jrue, PG, type of player). Then, signing someone like Holmes could round out our center rotation."
Josh Green gets a double double and yams it on someone.
"In his position off the bench? If it was me I'd go defense heavy and put in Josh Green, love the rookies hustle and defense."

"Our D is stepped up. Jrich, as poor as the mavs sub treats him, is a big addition for matchups like the clippers. Doe doe stepped it up this year. Hardaway remains solid. Kleber is a big that can stretch.  Best part is, Clippers haven‚Äôt met playoff Josh Green."
"Mave are one of the best shooting teams in the league. Their shooters were out covid/knee surgery and where replaced in the rotation with three of the worst shooters in the league, Iwundu, James Johnson, and Josh Green. That along with Dorian and Luka starting the season cold brought down there season averages but that means nothing now. Timmy and Dorian ended the season on a massive hot streak, realistically the guys around Luka and KP should all be around 40+% from 3"
Carlisle saving Josh Green off as a nuclear bomb
"Desmond Bane went to TCU and we could have drafted him, instead we drafted Josh Green who has barely played. Bunch of Mavs fans wanted to take Bane. Nothing to do with playoffs but just that he could be doing that with us"

"I guarantee you Cade or Green don't get you at least the 8th seed. If y'all draft one of them I'd bet you my house and life savings that doesn't happen.  I highly doubt the Pistons with Cade or Green become better than 7 teams currently ahead of them. Sure they'll be better, but better than the Hornets, Wizards, Pacers, Bulls, and Raptors? Even if they're better than some of those teams, they won't be better than all of them.   With that being said, I actually think the Pistons have a bright future if they can get one of those top guys in this draft. Grant looks great, Hayes as well as Bey look promising, Josh Jackson is turning his career around. Casey with all his flaws is still a great developmental coach and not a terrible coach like some people seem to think. The future in Detroit is brighter than people think.   But I can guarantee you Cade or Green would not get you at least the 8th seed next season."
"I completely agree about Richardson, and I don't know how we would replace him defensively unless Josh Green is suddenly ready to play 25 minutes a night. Smart would be interesting, but I haven't been too impressed with him this season. Of course, that's the only reason he'd be available, so you have to take what you can get I suppose. Our trade possibilities all rely on if they move KP and his value, and that's so hard to gauge right now. Anyways, yes, playoffs! It's going to be so good to see the guys balling out!"
"Jalen Green is gonna be a star. Moreso if the Raptors got him. If Rockets got him tho, idk.   Josh Giddey will be the one picked at 10 or later who will take a run at that ROTY. He might be picked earlier tho, I won't be surprised if any team took him at top 5.   Cade Cunningham will be targeted by NBA's elite perimeter defenders. I think it will be like the Lonzo trajectory with awful early season but decent to great later on.   Mobley will get eaten inside."

"Clearly, Dirk‚Äôs prime is clear stat wise and in today‚Äôs era he would be even more effective. The fact is that Dirk, even being as humble as he is, was compelled to say this.   Luka gets slandered for his 1st round exits and many use regular season stats/wins against him. I watched all of this turbulent Mavs season and the common problem is that almost half of the nights the team doesn‚Äôt show up to play. They have a ridiculous undefeated record in the regular season of winning a game when they lead in the first quarter. Luka often only unleashes his full effort in primetime games against star matchups. This Mavs team can beat the Jazz or Nets only to lose to the Kings or Rockets. That is because Luka‚Äôs energy is so varying. This is an offshoot of his ultimate looming problem of bad conditioning.   The playoffs are a different story. I‚Äôve seldom seen a player turn on a switch like Luka does. The Mavs theoretically should not match up well against the Clippers and their style of switching in their defensive scheme. The Mavs role players are one-dimensional, but they do their role so well. However, they were simply way out talented by the Clippers. Luka‚Äôs creation for himself and his teammates was all time great. All the players minus Porzingis and Brunson are meant to be catch and shoot players. Both of these players were disappointing this particular series. Porzingis‚Äôs biggest problem was not even offense, but his defense. I hope the Mavs FO adds talent quickly.   The thing that stood out to me most was how Luka played Pat Bev and Zubac off the court. This added with Ibaka being injured convinced me that the Clippers were in a deep hole. Pat Bev who looked unplayable hit daggers against Utah and locked up Devin Booker in the WCF. All I‚Äôm saying is that 90% of Mavs fans would agree that minus Luka, the Mavs would have been in contention for Cade Cunningham. Minus Kawhi, the Clippers won 2 straight against Utah and took the Suns to 6. Would have been 7 if not for an amazing play by Crowder/Ayton.   The part that hurts most is that after a loss to the Clippers in the bubble, the Mavs should‚Äôve been the team that got better in the offseason. They got worse minus Luka‚Ä¶..replaced a highly productive player in Seth with Josh Rich. Clippers who should‚Äôve had depth issues received great production from Batum and the rookie Mann. Mavs FRP Josh Green had no playing time. Brunson who was supposed to help was targeted on defense and locked up on offense. He got benched for Trey Burke. This team played their 3rd string center Boban for 30 minutes in a Game 7.   Luka is far from perfect and Prime Dirk is clearly better but to me hes already an all time great level floor raiser. One thing improved the most for Mavs in the short offseason. That is Luka‚Äôs midrange. How he added that in 3 months and started shooting like Dirk was crazy. I can‚Äôt wait for the future."

"someone that watching, tell me about my son Josh Green"
How was Josh Green?
"I'm sure everyone else has explained most of it already, but I'm going to try to break it down a bit more. For starters, the Trout/Ohtani combo has only been together since 2018, and Shohei underwent Tommy John surgery after 2018, so while he was still around as a hitter, he wasn't the two-way threat that he is now in part because TJS (to recover from a torn UCL) takes time to fully recover from.   So as for the B.O. years (before Ohtani), the Angels had signed Albert Pujols to a massive 10-year deal. After Trout had his breakout year, the braintrust decided that signing Josh Hamilton to a 5 yr/$125m deal was the way to go, and that their three star sluggers would lead them to the promised land. Except Hamilton had his off-the-field demons, which would rear their ugly head after the 2014 season, and lead to the Angels paying him $73 million from 2015-17 to go away and play for division rival Texas. And by the time they were done paying him, Pujols' decline had begun, which made him a $25+ million albatross stuck at DH. And the only other move pre-Ohtani in terms of a running mate for Trout was signing Justin Upton to a 5 yr/$106m deal, which has been... a mixed bag. The best homegrown hitter they developed was Kole Calhoun, who, while a fine player, was not a feared power hitter.   But the biggest Achillies heel for the Angels has been pitching. Just limiting it to the Ohtani years now, the Angels have made some moves for their starting pitching that looked questionable at best (Jesse Chavez, Trevor Cahill, Julio Teheran, Jose Quintana; all paid over $5 million, all pitched to an ERA above 5) and the equivalent of lighting millions on fire at worst (the ghost of Matt Harvey) from the moment the ink was dry. (which with the aforementioned annual $20+ million albatross, is not good)   Their young pitching hasn't developed either; they've been waiting 6 years for Andrew Heaney's breakout year, Nick Tropeano looked good until Tommy John surgery threw his career out of whack, and Tyler Skaggs only made 20 starts in a season once in his 5+ year Angels career before tragically passing away in 2019. When they say everyone outside of Shohei Ohtani on the pitching staff stinks this season: LITERALLY EVERYBODY OUTSIDE OF OHTANI STINKS. (though a few guys have gotten better in recent weeks) And in baseball, good pitching can carry a team, but bad pitching can wreck a team. And with Ohtani, Trout, Jared Walsh, and Anthony Rendon (their most recent big signee that was to be the new 3-headed hitting monster with Trout/Ohtani), the weakness of the pitching staff has been highlighted.   Tl:dr; bad investments in co-stars during the Trout years that lead to dead money in the form of a declining defensive liability or literal dead money not playing for the team at all, plus questionable yearly pitching investments that didn't work out during the Trout/Ohtani era, plus young pitchers failing to develop to support Ohtani on the pitching side = why the Angels are an average to mediocre team even with two of the best players in the game. And while there is pressure from owner Arte Moreno (who has fired two GMs during Trout's time here), the green light for the big $$$ moves (Hamilton, Rendon, etc.) ultimately comes from Arte. Sorry that explanation got a bit long in the tooth, but I hope that provides some answers as to why the Angels are the MLB's Oilers, without the playoff appearances."
Goulding was amazing  Giddley showed excellence  Australia was locked in  Josh Green and Matisse Thybulle played great.   Nigeria couldn't hit a jumper and then threw the towel in the 4th.  Impressive by the Boomers. Interesting to see how Nigeria adjust in Tokyo
Josh Green brother of Cam
Josh Green has been very much a non-factor unfortunately
"I really want Josh Green to work out. He probably won't, but it would be awesome."
"Mavs would be about $3M away if they renounce Hardaway Jr. That's not insurmountable, it's basically pawning off Josh Green for a 2nd. I don't want them to do it though."
"Spurs get:   * 3rd overall pick  * 2023 1st, top-10 protected  * Kevin Love  Cavaliers get:   * Dejounte Murray  * Derrick White  * 12th overall pick   This is the sort of deal that might entice the Cavs to trade their pick. They get a very good young PG, a solid SG, and a low lotto pick for the crown jewel of the trade (3rd overall), another, protected 1st, and a salary dump (Love). Dejounte pairs well with Darius and White would be a great third guard for them. Plus, they can still get someone promising with the 12th pick. A protected 1st isn't much to dump Love and balance the deal, either.  Spurs do it to get a top tier prospect as well as a veteran who pairs well next to Poeltl. They're guaranteed one of Green/Mobley/Suggs with that pick. Probably either Mobley or Suggs, since top two looks to be Cade and Green. They get a prospect who can be their centerpiece for the future. They also get another first to help them down the line.   Use their cap space wisely on a PG this offseason and some vets for the bench, and they'll still be competitive next season. Something like Dinwiddie or Scroeder /Vassell/Keldon/Love/Poeltl with Patty, (Porter Jr?), Mobley as your first guys off the bench. Maybe they are able to sign two starters, so they also get a SG or SF. Maybe Oladipo or Josh Richardson would come for an overpay."
"Lol they didn‚Äôt even need Melo, they could‚Äôve had Danny Green and that would‚Äôve been a MASSIVE improvement over anything they ever had on the wings.   I‚Äôll forever remember that team for collecting players that spanked them the year before in the playoffs. Josh Smith killing them and then signing with them the next season was just so funny.  You could tell Doc signed him just because of the previous playoffs."
"Even then the Australia team only has 6 NBA players (Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and Josh Green)."
Josh Green (Mavericks)  Will Magnay (Pelicans)   Matisse Thybulle (76ers)   Patty Mills (Spurs)   Aron Baynes (Raptors)   Dante Exum (Rockets)   Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers)  Joe Ingles (Jazz)
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles,¬†Aron Baynes,¬†Dante Exum,¬†Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull,¬†and¬†Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
"Australia's core is now very old. Delly adds very little, Ingles isn't the player he was in 2019, really only leaving Patty to drive the offense. This Aussie team is worse than last time we beat the US in Melbourne and last Olympics. Mattise is fantastic and we are getting good contributions from role players (Kay, Landale, Goulding in particular).   Plenty of talent coming through though (Josh Giddey and Dyson Daniels are both potential lottery picks in 2021 and 2022), Josh Green is handy and Ben would definitely help out if he ever plays for Australia again"
ohh josh green is in

I wanna see more Josh Green please!  Exum showing flashes of being good again!
RIP... Trying to see how my boy Josh Green is looking!!
"I wish on everything that we would‚Äôve picked him. I love Josh Green, but Bey is a baller."
"I mean I thought the Sixers were shit a year ago, and Morey somehow managed to finesse Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and trade Danny Green for that Al Horford contract. Those two players were just what they needed. The team didn‚Äôt win this year, but those were impressive moves nonetheless.   I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ownership was the main factor in a Harden for Ben Simpson‚Äôs deal not getting done."
"I think a lot of my worries for him is that his ability did not get better as the season went along. He peaked in his first two games, and then progressively got worse as the season went along, and had a lot kid trouble generating easy shots off the dribble, at the rim or anywhere else. He does have a lot of Jeff green on him, and also a more above the rim josh Jackson, both good ball handlers"
"Him and Brunson are always messing with eachother, interacting on social media, etc. Richardson has known him for years and talked about how excited he was to come play with him. Luka and Josh Green also seem close.  Gotta disagree with the idea Luka only seems close with JJ and Boban, he seems to have a lot of good relationships on the team"
Same with josh green. Both of them taking a step would really improve our bench.

"He was absolutely garbage at drafting. TJ Warren, Devin Booker &amp; DeAndre Ayton are the only ones he hit on  Len is very meh for a top-5 pick, but tbh the 2013 draft was a shitshow for most of the lottery anyway.  Then he drafted Dragan Bender with the 4th pick in 2016, as if that wasn't enough went and took Papagiannis &amp; Labissiere as well. So thats 3 useless 7-foot bums in 1 draft. He then packaged Bogdanovic/Papagiannis/Labissiere for Chriss  Blew top another top-5 pick in 2017, this time for Josh Jackson who was the prototypical uber-athletic knucklehead wing. Jackson lasted only 2 years before he was dumped to Memphis  And I'm pretty sure the only good trades he ever made was trading Scola for Gerald Green (who was a valuable part of that 48-win team in 2014) &amp; trading Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges"
"Tyrell Terry, he‚Ä¶ he HARDLY EVEN PLAYED THIS YEAR!  Sorry, man, but that is ONE prediction I can‚Äôt see coming true - though I‚Äôd love to see that (or Josh Green, aka Luka‚Äôs Second Son, aka the Thunda‚Äô from down Unda‚Äô, aka Ice in His Veins)!"
Luka and Josh Green  Sophomore leap baby
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
"Caron Butler, Matt Barnes, Luc Mba Moute, Danny Granger, Reggie Bullock, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson. Who was their missing piece in my opinion? Joe Ingles who they had and cut from the team without even touching the floor."
At least you have Josh Green now. I‚Äôm excited to see how he does given some actual minutes unlike on the Mavs
"Lol, the amount of bs in windhorst...his teammates constantly praising luka (even thj and brunson on reddick podcast, go watch dorian mavs conf commending luka leadership), josh green (luka's son), tyler terry (watching slovenia games bcuz luka was playing) on him helping them a lot and then u got these journalists with no connection with the mavs, who dont watch mavs games(""...when u watch mavs games"" u certainly didnt windy), give their cents of what the mavs problems are.  Rick was petty the way he recommended kidd as coach and the other quotes. He's a great but tough coach. It was easy for players to get mad at him. No current player went on social media say goodbye to carlisle. Maybe they did it in private, but anyway, it is still something to consider. They talk about luka barks at his coach but there was still huge respect between both. Besides, they talk about luka when instead KP would make more sense on being the player that would be more mad at Rick since carlisle didnt want porzingis getting any post ups while luka gave it to kp to get him going.  This is just another journalist trying to create some narrative to try to force luka out of dallas and going to the lakers or whatever."

Celtics for sure I believe (could just me being biased but hear me out) if we traded Jaylen and smart since he‚Äôs a FA after this year and will probably be too much to keep them whatver picks or bench guys they want we already improved offensively by a good amount we just lose smarts defense which will be big but we can fill that gap with guys like josh hart Danny green Diallo just a thought tho

"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Nick Nurse is signal handedly one of the worst coaches we've ever had.  Close 2nd round series last year he made as much adjustments to the Marcus Smart pnr and the Tatum dribble hand off plays as Doc Rivers did against the Hawks Pin down / screen and shoot offense. He wore green (opposite teams color) in that 2020 playoff series which tricked Tatum to throwing the ball out of bounds...I've never seen that in sports at any level not to mention Brad Stevens undressed him by locking us down on defense and we couldn't stop that offense.  You want me to talk about the 20-21 season? How about Siakam post ups for the second year in a row?  He's doing to Siakam what doc Rivers did to Rondo (last year in Boston) Paul George, Josh Smith and his latest victim Ben Simmons.    Oh lemme guess ""coaches don't play"" that's absolutely false.  There's 100 plays in an average NBA play book and He Drew All Of Them Up!  If they don't work or better yet you get a rare gem of a player who knows how to ball and continues to improve (Siakam) year after year.  What happened next?  Nick Nurse the Preacher cusses his team like dogs, draws up failing plays, and forces guys minutes off the bench to basically nothing and then they don't play well.  How many more season do we have to give to the Reverse Steve Kerr ? He's terri-fucking-bull!"
"Not a lot of room for an undersized PG on a contending team in the west, especially with Jalen Brunson was a fringe 6MOY candidate.  That being said, wasn't it rumored that Harambob forced you all to draft Josh Green over Saddiq Bey? Oof."
"We have a Jaylen, Jaden, Josh, Jarrett, Jarred, Jake, Jordan and Jauncho on the roster so clearly the Wolves are drafting 3rd and adding Jalen Green."
How much of that was even Doc vs replacing Horford &amp; Josh Richardson with Danny Green &amp; Seth Curry and having pieces around Tobias that actually made sense?
"Throw in Josh Green or Brunson, maybe depending on other offers. Or THJ S&amp;T for George Hill too?"

"Yeah, and while Mavs management deserves to be clowned to some degree (passing on Seddiq Bey for Josh Green was awful), the Mavs also got Luka when the cupboards were totally bare. Getting Luka cost them their next first, and after that Luka was too good for the team to get back in the lottery.   After years of trading all their picks to compete with Dirk, they didn't really have the chance to stock up on talent before they got Luka. Meanwhile, the Suns already had Booker, and the Hawks had Collins, then sucked for long enough to get Hunter before they turned into a winner."
I know but let us see what Morey has in mind. He turned Al Horford  and josh richardson into seth curry and Danny Green after all.
"josh Richardson does hustle but he fumbles the ball a lot. Also makes dumb decisions offensively. Can't trust him to score also isn't really that good of a defender. Josh Green, however, has shown signs of becoming a good passer and makes good defensive plays."
Yeah like Josh Richardson? Josh Green?
"&gt; let Jimmy walk away for nothing  We got fleeced by S&amp;Ting him for Josh Richardson but then we re-fleeced the Mavs by swapping him and a 2nd for Seth Curry, whose under contract for 2 more years for *checks notes* ~$24 mil less than Horford.  &gt; trades Horford for pennies on the dollar  Danny Green for Horford and a 2025 1st is a pretty good get all things considered especially since his contract can be similarly used as filler for a better player.  Just an FYI too it‚Äôs would ‚Äúhave‚Äù not would ‚Äúof‚Äù"
"In sum:  Sometime 2018, Cuban hired Bob to be his analytics director. Bob has a background in poker and NBA gambling (developing programs that beat the odds). He made a few millions on it and intrigued Cuban enough to be hired (Bob is also a semi regular guest on Bill Simmons podcasts).  Donnie the GM has been the GM for over 2 decades, overseeing the Mavs success from the early 2000s and peaking in 2011 with the Dirk+good vets lineup. Since then, he has made hit and miss decisions (hits include Monta, and later Luka) and misses (almost everything else since 2011). Still, he oversaw one of the most successful NBA teams of the past 2 decades.  So Bob comes in and starts having a say in Donnie's decisions, cause Mark listens to analytics guys more and more (and crypto-bro - hurrah!). This includes picking Josh Green over Saddiq Bey for example. Identifying Seth as an FA target. And some other decisions that didn't pan out (Delon Wright). This likely started the power struggle between him and Donnie.   Donnie starts fighting back, because it appears his job is on the line, given the rapid ascent of Luka and increased pressure to build a contender around the 22 year old. He likely supplies Tim Cato, reporter, with info on a hit piece vs Bob.  Bob on the other hand sees an opening in Donnie's tenure and does a reddit video that's kinda hilarious in retrospect, showing off Donnie's GM ""Masterclass"" since 2011. So it's a back and forth game.  Donnie loses, unfortunately. Reports suggest the decision to let him go was made before the hit piece on Bob, and many Mavs fans have wanted a change in the front office for quite some time.  Rick has been with Donnie for 13 years, and they go way back. He likely saw the writing on the wall and decided to leave on his own, knowing he was next if they didn't do better next season. He also does not completely jive with Luka, though I'd argue it's a healthy relationship - Luka needs someone to challenge him, otherwise he'll turn into LuGM.  As for Luka. He loves Donnie. Hit and miss with Rick. And supposedly hates Bob. Part of the friction with Rick is apparently the way Bob is able to overrule Rick on some coaching decisions (I suppose lineups?).   Anyway, end of the day... we'll see what happens. I hate that it came to this, but who knows if this will prove better in the long run?"
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
"He still hangs out with dsj, he was recently at a bar in Dallas and said all those rumors of him not getting along with luka was bs and him, dfs and luka are close friends. Luka is close with jrich, hardaway, dfs, shamgod, Mosley, kleber, Brunson, green, hinton, jamesJohnson and wes when they were here. Etc. U can see this on the court how close certain players are. Jrich or hardaway make a shot and Luka acts like they made a game winner. They constantly crack jokes on each other on Twitter and Instagram, especially luka, Brunson and josh green. He just doesn't like kp lol"
"Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart, Thybulle, O.G. Anouby, Bam, Gobert, Royce O'Neale, Draymond Green, Dort, AD, Paul George, Giannis, Simmons, Embiid, Isaac are some players that come to my mind right now that are currently on my favorite defensive players to watch.  I appreciate defense, especially isolation defense as you said.   Peak Kawhi, Josh Smith, Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, Bryant, KG, are some of my favorite defenders back in the days to watch.   Man, it's almost criminal to this day that Duncan's never ever won DPOY...."
That's the same as wishing Josh Green and Tyrell Terry turning into Dray and Klay next season
"Luka hates how Rick treated his son, Josh Green."
Luka maxi JB DFS DP Josh Green Boban THJ
"I wouldn‚Äôt say Rick didn‚Äôt try anything in the playoffs, for example the Boban move, but he clearly ran out of options he was willing to try. I‚Äôll never understand why we didn‚Äôt give Josh Green a chance to defend Kawhi in Game 7. We put Trey Burke in, who has been mediocre since the bubble, but couldn‚Äôt give our Rookie a chance. Also never making KP be the focal point on offense killed us at multiple points in the series. He‚Äôs not the kind of guy who can play well out of rhythm."
"He would be dumb to decline imo especially given his injury history  All Philly needs to do is replace Ben with a star ball handler and they should be set. Even Tobi is starting to live up to that trash contract  Seth is fantastic especially given that he was the replacement for Josh Richardson, Milton and Dwight are good bench players, and Green and Mattise is solid especially on defense. The only glaring issue is Ben"
"If I'm in the Mavs FO, DiVicenzo would be my top priority. He is basically what we hope Josh Green will become. One of the best backcourt defenders, he is so damn underrated."
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
Reminds me of how Doc would sign players that busted the Clippers up like Josh Smith and Jeff Green (who they traded a frp for lmao)
"Alright there‚Äôs way bigger ones to choose for us I‚Äôd imagine, but I was screaming at my TV last year when the mavs passed up on saddiq bey and took josh green and am still incredibly salty about it"

"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our ‚ÄúGM‚Äù). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
"We need to get rid of one of Wall or Gordon (so Gordon), and then we‚Äôll have plenty of minutes to give out to the young guys. A guard line-up of Wall/KPJ/ Green for most minutes is great and then Augustin and Josh Christopher can soak up the rest.   IMO though, Christopher would really benefit from playing in the G-League primarily so that he can get a lot of on-ball reps. His decision making is pretty mediocre at the moment and he won‚Äôt get the needed on-ball  reps to improve in that area on our main roster.  Next off-season we hopefully buy out Wall and then Christopher can step into the minutes that Wall vacated."
"&gt;stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  Just because the Mavs FO is dumb doesn't mean Morey is a genius.   &gt;got Dwight, Embiid‚Äôs best backup so far, on a vet min   Because the Lakers fucked it up. But where is he now?  &gt;re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  No other team was going to give Danny 10 million a year. Furkan is just a 3 point shooter."
"In his one year in Philly, Morey has :  **Pros**  * got the Sixers to the 1 seed in the East  * unloaded the horrific Horford contract while acquiring Danny Green, a very useful role player  * stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  * got Dwight, Embiid‚Äôs best backup so far, on a vet min  * re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  * drafted some promising young players, such as Maxey    **Cons**   * not acquiring Harden because of a personal vendetta from Tillman  * the George Hill trade was kind of weird in retrospect   I‚Äôm feeling pretty good with Morey at the helm."
Pritchard rises. Josh green drops out the whole draft. Bane rises.
Good for Josh. Still strongly believe he can follow the Danny Green archetype path. Solid wing defender that hits catch and shoot threes at a good clip.
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey

I still think he‚Äôs gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that‚Äôs where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"

"Josh Green couldn‚Äôt get any minutes in the summer league, Chris Goulding was too good for him."
"Josh Green got garbage time minutes for Australia‚Äôs Olympic team, Chris Goulding is too good for him."
"Josh Green couldn‚Äôt get any meaningful minutes for the Australian Olympics team, Chris Goulding is too good for him."
"This is a dumb logic. You are saying you are OK with another year of not having second player maker and ball handler next to Luka and having another mediocre season, just because Tyrell Terry and Josh Green are too valuable. Like I said those are not some premium assets. The only reason we even talk about them is because how little assets the Mavs have."
Mavs holding out for a buyout.....   Dude we don't even want your shitty prospects: Josh Green and Tyrell Terry stinks
Josh Green
Josh Christopher brought them back for the youngins. Then Jalen Green. Oubre and Jaylen Brown I know was wearing them early.
I wanted us to take him over Josh Green. I‚Äôm always a sucker for his sort of length.
Josh giddey will be the 3rd best player in this draft class after Jalen green(1st) and Jon kuminga(2nd) with Cade Cunningham being an honorable mention (4th)
"Could be someone on the bench makes a decent jump. Like Brunson (unlikely), josh green, or terry. Another thing to keep in mind is this is KPs like first off-season healthy in a while so he could come back better than ever but who knows"
"Alperen ≈ûeng√ºn yelled out, ‚ÄúI≈üte gidiyorsun! I≈üte gidiyorsun.‚Äù Sharpshooter Jalen Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Josh Christopher yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before KJ Martin hit the locker room door, NBA great Rafael Stone hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
"No, because he doesn't move the needle and we need to gain control of our future 1sts to have available for trades for players who actually are difference makers down the road. I think it's more likely Dallas would offer someone like Tyrell Terry.   I think Josh Green and any future 1sts are completely off the table."
cade outplayed green in personal play. but green outplayed cade in team play. green had to deal with much heavier defense being played on him. and in the moments his team started falling back green was the guy stepping up the most. also josh christopher and to an extent sengun was able to go off so much because they were focusing so much on green.
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher‚Äôs defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade‚Äôs poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He‚Äôs good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can‚Äôt create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it‚Äôs over. He won‚Äôt get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
"So far it looks like every top 10 pick will live up to the hype except for Wagner.  That being said the second game Wagner flashed a cool off ball game with his cuts and his quick passes.  He has a good offensive player inside of him but I don't know if he's a starter in this league.  He seems like a smaller, quicker Saric who is more of 4 than a 5.  His passing, shooting and off ball movement look really good.  Also Josh Giddy is an unknown because he gor immediately injured.  That's a wait to be seen guy but I get the feeling that because his best skillset is passing we aren't going to know how good he is until he plays with the other starters in OKC.  Him Shai and Dort might just break teams with the size, ball handling and defensive versatility or his lack of shooting will expose him.  Not enough to tell.  But if you told me that Suggs, Cade, Sengun (real winner here is Houston), Kuminga, Barnes, Green, Mobley and maybe Williams and Mitchell all become all stars I wouldn't be stunned.  They all seem like future starters at the minimum."
"Lol no logic in this place. If the mavs didn‚Äôt have luka, they‚Äôd be shit and would‚Äôve probably been in like the top 5 lottery for the last three years.. their team would have like lamelo not josh green."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Sengun is a freakin beast. He moves fluidly, has a safe dribble, a nice bag of post moves, and rebounds well. He knows where he needs to be on defense and when he can assert himself on offense. Also, he didn't do it much, but he can def shoot the 3 (that logo shot though).   He should be a backup 4 or 5 day 1 and will play plenty of minutes with only Wood and Theis in front of him. I wonder if he might even be starting by the end of the season.  Josh Christopher will make a great sixth man some time down the road. I think we'll have to see if he'll be a career starting caliber player, but his skillset of tenacious defense and decent offensive will be great for contending rosters to have.  Don't think I need to say anything about Green. He was fantastic.  Garuba was invisible though. /s"
Why would he? He had a free lane to the basket. People talk like Josh Christopher is just supposed to feed the ball to Green and Sengun when he isn't even a PG.
Josh Green and Duop's dance had be fucking creasing lmao.
Josh green üòç
Pistons so locked in on Green  They forget we still have two HOF players in Sengun and Josh Christopher
"Rockets really got  Sengun, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba and some guy named Jalen Green"
the NBA draft was apparently  1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green  2.5. Josh Christopher
They like him but they aren‚Äôt stupid. They just don‚Äôt want to give up Tyrell Terry and Josh Green. They‚Äôd have to give up all their young assets
I thought it was Josh Green.
Lol. You can have one Josh green.
"I wasn't super high on Tyler bey. Dude looked absolutely raw and lost on offense. Even in the  g league. We just don't have the minutes and reps to be giving to him to develop. We are trying to contend now. And honestly. Between josh green and Tyrell terry, terry might get more minutes because he the better shooter. Dude was an absolute  sharpshooter in college."
Josh Giddy or Jalen Green. Cade ain't sniffing top 5 in voting  You heard it here first.
Where‚Äôs Josh Green? ü§î üßê
Got damn it. I'm still pissed that the Mavs took Josh Green instead of Bey.
We could've taken him... Josh Green may have some potential but I'm having some Justin Anderson flashbacks lol
Same knew Green was gonna be a stud but it was so awesome to see Sengun‚Äôs motor man. Josh showed good flashes too I hope he gets some quality minutes this year.
I already knew about Green  Sengun and Josh really impressed me on both ends  Wish Garuba was out there
"And to think the Rockets still have KPJ as well, who's bound to make a leap this season.    &amp;#x200B;  KpJ,Green, Sengun, Kj and Josh.  Rockets are going to be exciting to watch this season."
"Bro Houston absolutely killed this draft! Green already looks like a 20+ PPG guy with playmaking ability, Sengun looks like baby Jokic, and I like what I've seen out of Josh Christopher too."
"Roster is basically set. Ball/LaVine/DeRozan/Williams/Vuc, Caruso/White/Brown/""Lauri""/Bradley, last 3 spots to Ayo, Simonovic, and Green.   ""Lauri"" is either Lauri, or the guy we S&amp;T him for, or if we're very confident in Simonovic we can send Lauri for picks and sign a guy like Millsap or Josh Hart with the BAE."
"I agree with you on both points that you wrote. Depth is key-I think we have couple of guys on the team that just take the roster spot without any real value-Marjanovic, Burke, Josh Green, Tyler Terry and Moses Brown. Yes 3 of them are young players, but we also have to be realistic-I don‚Äôt see them getting much opportunity. And secondly-we need much more a back-up PG than another PF."
"It's because he's on the Lakers, it's literally that simple. When Lonzo was on the Lakers, twitter would blow up after a bad game. There'd be 30k trending tweets an hour after a game. Same thing with Brandon Ingram, same thing with Danny Green, Julius Randle, same shit with Quinn Cook, Josh Hart too. literally any time a Laker did something bad they would get blown up on social media. Guys on other teams don't have 30k tweets about them every night if they put up a stinker unless they're a superstar. If you're an average roleplayer on the lakers you get as much attention as a star on a small market team."
"We will have Josh Giddey, Dyson Daniels, Green and Thybulle in Paris. Simmons can get the fuck outta here, he‚Äôs a goddam yank"
"Luka had one NBA teammate. Cancar who actually played great all tournament but rides the bench in Denver, for now. Australia had so many they could afford to leave at least one--Josh Green--on the bench the entire game, lol. It's amazing Slovenia made it this far."
"Had Josh Giddey fallen to us, maybe if Patty hadn't left us, and give or take whether or not Jock Landale signed with us, I was going to petition a green and gold statement jersey for the Spurs lol"
The new one is likely gonna be Jalen Green and Josh Christopher playing in AAU.
"We're in good hands with Tisse, Josh Green, Josh Giddey and guys like Dyson Daniels coming through. All learning from guys like Gazey and Patty who know exactly what it means and what is needed to represent your country on the world stage."
"Hopeully that Josh Green dude hangs his bronze medal in Luca's Dallas locker, so we get some mamba luka next year"
Doncic hugs Patty and Jingles but not Josh Green?
Josh green needs to enter so Luka can whip his ass just like mavs practice
Josh green has more hope tbh
Hoping for some josh green minutes
josh green / luka
"Josh Green would be the 2nd best player on Slovenia, and he can't get minutes for Australia."
Want to see Josh Green vs Luka lol
I‚Äôd like to see more of Josh Green. He‚Äôs been okay when he‚Äôs been given his minute or two‚Ä¶
"unleash Josh Green to defend Luka, whoever coaching Aussie"
Well either Luka or Josh Green are gonna come out with a medal at least.
"Josh Green, Giddey and Thybulle leading the next generation. I'm sure they will be fine."
"I'm wondering what the hell Masai actually asked. We had one report of us holding on to Powell, but that came days after a shit ton load of reports saying we were shopping him around, so I'm inclined to think we did want to send Powell and WCS. I have a lot of bias, but this was a deal that would send Toronto a starting C, a starting small ball 5 for a backup PG, but, well, apparently Masai thinks otherwise. The only package I could think of Masai wanting and Nico saying no is one around Josh Green, that Kidd is apparently very excited to work with. I don't think it was a Morey-like offer of DFS, Maxi or something crazy, if it was I'm sure Cuban would leak that himself. If it isn't leaking, then it is one that part of the fans will complain about us not going in.  Well, I am pissed, but I cannot blame Masai here. If you are not the Lakers or the Heat, you need to get as much as you can on trades because you won't have a line of FA asking for the vet min to play."
"Apparently there‚Äôs a Josh Green on the Mavericks though I had to google it, think he‚Äôs two-way"
"Jalen Green, KJ Martin, and Josh Christopher are going to be so fun to watch"
Plus Josh Green is on the Australia national team
"I don‚Äôt know what the person said, but Reggie killed us in the playoffs. Free agency has been as expected. Olympics have been great. I got to see Josh Green play."
"Yeah he literally said Dallas isn‚Äôt interested in trading any assets for him on a Greenroom the other day. Seems like Toronto wants Josh Green/Tyrell Terry and Dallas isn‚Äôt budging, which is the right move. They can sign Dragic next summer."
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
Josh Green is on the Mavs summer league roster and he's still playing in the Olympics lol
Upcoming Luka vs Josh Green aka father vs son battle it is then
Ur the daftest fuck I've ever seen if U think Kay shouldn't have got minutes. Literally does everything well just missed some shots. We also only have three bigs.  We lost when Delly started playing in the second half. Love the man but he provides absolutely nothing that even josh green can't provide.
start going to the low post earlier. At least draw some fouls. The guards could hardly dribble and were panicking. The US were switching on every p&amp;r so their offense got completed shut down. Also give josh green some time. Dellavedova has no business on the court.
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they‚Äôve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.¬†  That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on ‚Äúname‚Äù teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.¬†  On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don‚Äôt match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo‚Äôs preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he‚Äôs really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn‚Äôt afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu‚Äôs contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don‚Äôt think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that‚Äôs only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.¬†  We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.¬†  At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.¬†  Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans‚Äô Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22‚Äô 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D‚ÄôAntoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it‚Äôs not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart‚Äôs rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.¬†  By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.¬†  You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.¬†  Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he‚Äôs expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don‚Äôt do anything else, or they don‚Äôt have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they‚Äôve received, even if this year‚Äôs team outperforms last year‚Äôs.¬†"
Put josh green in ya dogs
Was talking about Josh Green üòÇ
Fuck it out Josh Green in
Lol I was talking Josh green but yes I‚Äôll take that line up at this point haha
Australia could use Josh Green lol
"As a Mavs fan, I‚Äôm offended that no one has mentioned Josh Green."
"Every championship team in the last 15 years.  Heck even the rockets only beat clippers because josh smith and corey brewer decided to go on a tear.  You want me to list?  1. 2011 mavs have the jet and barrea go on shooting tears through out the play offs  2. 2012 mario mother fucking chalmers and shane battier have amazing games   3. 2013 ray allen mario chalmers and the big 3  4. 2014 boris diaw was a major contributor and marco and the big 3  5. 2015 warriors had a team based offense where 1-5 could all share the ball and score. 3rd option was barnes, draymond was actually decent on offense too.   6. 2016 jr smith, rj can both create and score and you had a big 3  7. 2017 warrior had 4 all stars so thats just cheap  8. 2018 same as last one  9. 2019 fred vandewhatever, kyle lowery and danny green pascal can all contribute heavily on offense  10.  2020 kcp and rondo stepped up. Kuzma can also create for himself.   11. 2021 holiday didnt do great on offense but he was still a threat. Lopez can creat for himself. Bobby stepped up   So yeah literally every team that won the last 11 years had a 3rd and 4th option that was an offensive threat."
"Ingles, Delly, Thybulle, Mills, Baynes, Josh Green and Giddey just got drafted  Delly is going to play in Aus unless he's offered a deal in the NBA and a lot of people are ~~hoping Jock Landale gets some looks for a go at the league after playing really well these games.~~  Correction - Jock has landed a shot with the Spurs"
It looks like Australia has a pretty dense 7 man rotation. USA comfortably goes with 9.   I wonder if someone like Josh Green sees more action in a game like this either because of his athleticism or potential foul trouble for Australia.
"Not enough roster spots tbh we already have Wall, Wood, KPJ, Green, Sengun, Garuba, Nwaba, House, Josh, Theis, small DJ, Thomas, Tate, KJ, Gordon, Brooks, and maybe big DJ back. Theis will help Sengun considering he adapted pretty well to the NBA from Europe."
"Dennis Schroeder - PHI      Danny Green - LAL      Andre Iguodala - GSW      Kelly Oubre - GSW      JJ Redick - BKN      Paul Millsap - ATL      Lou Williams - MIL      Avery Bradley - BOS      Reggie Jackson - LAC      Lauri Markennen - CHI      Josh Hart - NOP      Hamidou Diallo - DET      Svi Myk.. - OKC      Khem Birch - UFA (has been signed, Raptors)"

Sign with the Nuggets. Then we'll acquire Draymond from GSW to have a monopoly on Green.  Edit: Forgot about Javonte and Josh.  Make it happen TC!
One of either Josh Green or Tyrell Terry is my guess
"After him, I think Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Josh Hart, and Wes Matthews. Probably holding off for better offers before having to settle."
&gt; Cuban fired Voulgaris for the Josh Green pick  Doubt it.  Voulgaris and his team run a lot of different machine learning models using data they‚Äôve collected. Someone that embedded won‚Äôt get fired over a mid-rounder.   It‚Äôs probably the culture he was creating. I can imagine him being condescending to ‚Äúeye-test‚Äù folks in coaching and front office gigs.
"Why can't it just be the case that Cuban fired Voulgaris for the Josh Green pick, Nelson for the Curry-Richardson trade, and Carlisle for being disliked by the players?"
"We'll see. We have yet to get to the conclusion of all this nonsense.   In the meantime, he's already built up a lot of slack because of how he was able to get rid of Horford relatively painlessly (and get Danny Green in return) and trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry.   As bad as our situation is now, it would be 100x worse if our old front office was still running things."
"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
Indeed. My projected lineup for them is something like  Luka/ Brunson  THJ/ Frank Bullock/ josh green  DFS/ kleber  KP/ Moses brown
"The only idea I've seen is potentially Dallas. The idea is they'd want to get off KP's money a year earlier and give Luka another ball handler.  I could see KP + Powell + either Tyrell Terry or Josh Green for Wall + Danuel House  The issue is I think even though Wall is a miserable contract, Houston is aware that such a deal would be because Dallas wants to get off their money earlier and I think that Dallas would need to attach an asset (i.e. a player or pick) as compensation."

"Javale McGee - Dude had the athleticism and physical gifts to be an all-time great. I guess some dudes don't really care and just are happy making millions and taking care of their families but Javale could've been great.  Josh Howard - Dude weed. Literally. I mean injuries played a part towards the end of his career, but I feel like most teams (at least back then) didn't want to touch him because of the whole weed fiasco which was a huge deal back then, which doesn't make sense when like 95% of the league probably smokes weed or uses some type of illegal drug. You don't get millions of dollars and NOT blow it on drugs and whores, unless you're A.C. Green of course."
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
"I‚Äôll cast my vote for the Rockets, if we‚Äôre counting the draft. A team that was incredibly awful last year, setting one of the longest losing streaks in league history, re-tooled with four supremely exciting rookies in Jalen Green, Alpheren Sengun, Josh Christopher, and Usman Garuba. Considering how the Rockets were the league‚Äôs most moribund team after the Harden trade, with a core of Kelly Olynyk and washed Wall, to have one of the league‚Äôs best young cores (those four + KPJ + Tate) less than a year later actually gives Rockets fans some hope for the future."

"Positions are fluid, so he‚Äôs both. But Luka literally started at point guard this year, because Josh Richardson, Hardaway Jr, DFS are definitely not point guards. Early in his career when he started with Dennis Smith Jr., or games when Brunson starts, Luka is a point forward, not the point guard.  People bring up LeBron being a point guard but he‚Äôs started with other actual point guards for most of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). In the Lakers year where Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradley/KCP would start, then yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Either than that he‚Äôs largely been a point forward."

"the KG point is laughably stupid so I won‚Äôt even address that. LeBron has started with other point guards for the majority of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). So for the majority of his career he‚Äôs been a forward. The year he started with Danny Green and KCP or Avery Bradley, yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Because those other guys are flat out not point guards.  Again you‚Äôre just dodging my original question lol. Who started at point for the Mavs this year? Hardaway Jr? Josh Richardson?"
"But how will the Raptors get Josh Green, then?"
Support the Mavs. (Josh Green plus there‚Äôs a dude named Luka that‚Äôs rlly fun to watch)

"Thanks my friend! I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I‚Äôm an expert on many other teams, but I watch 90% of Mavs games, and I think we‚Äôll improve because:  Covid less of a factor  KP was pretty good in the regular season and has a healthy offseason  Luka got Olympic experience (hell so did Josh green!)  Several impact players have improved year over year and I expect them to continue doing so; maxi, DFS, Jalen  Brown and bullock complement this team swimmingly. I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre a title contender but with Kawhi and Jamal Murray injured and the Lakers old, the west seems more open than the warrior years"
"Brunson and Sterling Brown. The Mavs bench unit is garbage. The team went from 118 points per game to 83 when Luka was off he court, and that can't keep happening. Brunson is getting better, but I need to see him stay consistent. And Sterling Brown is a new acquisition that might be thruster into bench minutes quick, if josh green can't get his shit together."
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun

"The mavs had 3-4 starters/rotation players out for several weeks this season. Jabari, Bembry, and Jones are better than Josh Green and Wes Iwundu."
Giannis is a power forward who often plays center. He is a big.  LeBron is straight up better than those guys. Forwards are inherently more valuable than guards because of their size and versatility. Great help defenders are also generally more valuable and harder to take out of the game than isolation specialists. LeBron is both. You might be able to entertain peak Artest vs. LeBron but his defensive prime was a flash in the pan compared to LeBron's.   Everything I said is reflected in postseason DRAPM which LeBron is #1 in since '98 among perimeter players. Here is what the rest of the list looks like.  Among qualifying players (2000+ MP):      1. LeBron James (2.28)      2. Kawhi Leonard ( 2.09)      3. Tony Allen (2.09)      4. Josh Howard (2.00)      5. Shawn Marion (1.84)      6. Paul George (1.72)      7. Jason Kidd (1.70)      8. Tayshaun Prince (1.67)      9. Rajon Rondo (1.64)      10. Bruce Bowen (1.53)      11. Danny Green (1.50)      12. Mike Conley (1.40)      13. Dwyane Wade (1.37)      14. Luol Deng (1.25)      15. Metta World Peace (1.23)  Kawhi is basically an upgraded version of Jordan defensively and LeBron is ahead of him while playing with minimal rim protection most of his prime.

Luka + 2 firsts and Josh Green for Ben Simmons is his fair trade.  Maybe a couple pick swaps for good measure.

"Gotta be Frank Ntilikina, Josh Green, and Sterling Brown"
"KP defense looks good this season, if his offense looks like last season, i think there's a chance hornets will call, only real nba center in that roster is plumdog lmao, and they need to get PO with Melon-Miles looks good. hayward can be on the move with rise of Bridges, PJ can take his minutes, and they have enough ballhandlers (Ish, Scary Terry, development of Bouk). Like KP for Hayward + Plumdog. later we call Pels for Jonas, if they need young guys to develop again (lmao), we can send Moses Brown + Josh Green (+Powell expiring) + other filler  Luka - Bullock - DFS - Hayward - Jonas, bench : JB - THJ - S.Brown - Maxi - WCS are not too bad"
"it hurts. i was pissed at the josh green pick because he was available‚Ä¶ as always, happy to be wrong on green, but bey looked so good on film and plugged into a role we really needed. all wel, nothing we can do now"
"Mavs: Luka needs more help, so lets go get Josh Green."
"Virgin: ‚ÄúscoTTie bArneS‚Äù  Chad: Jalen Green, Houston Rockets.... Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers. ... Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors. ... Jalen Suggs, Orlando Magic. ... Josh Giddey, Oklahoma City Thunder. ... Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic. ... Davion Mitchell, Sacramento Kings. ... Ziaire Williams, Memphis Grizzlies."
Josh Giddey  Patty Mills  Matisse Thybulle   Josh Green  Jock Landale
Yet they had Josh Green drafted.....
Who's your way-too-early all-rookie team? I got   Chris Duarte / Jalen Green / Josh Giddey / Scottie Barnes / Evan Mobley
&gt; currently trying Josh Green and Ntilikina  None of which got any minutes so far.
"We need guard/wing defense with some level of decent playmaking to pair with Luka.  We've tried Delon, Jrich currently trying Josh Green and Ntilikina. We're bound to have it work out eventually lol"
I'd go   evan mobley   scottie barnes  jalen green  chris duarte  josh giddey
He's been awesome.  I like how you could see he earned Coach Willie Green's trust very early on in summer league and it's now carried on into regular season after Josh Hart went down.  Coach also liked to run some of his old GSW/Draymond Green plays for him in SL.
"He will, he's gonna murder dudes at the G League or play himself into the rotation, but him and Green are two peas in a pod, and Josh will definitely be hungry watching Jalen succeed."
I think maybe we go after him ngl. We‚Äôll give you one Dwight Powell and one Josh Green.
"Nothing, but I know a lot of rap fans wanted Powell+picks/josh green when the rumors spread, but most of mavs fans felt it was too much for him. just curious how you guys feel after a month plus has past"
Jalen Green  Josh Green  Javonte Green  Jamychal Green  Jeff Green
"wasn't just coaching either, that roster isn't particularly good outside of luka and you're just running it back over and over  literally the same starting 5 for the third straight year, dwight powell is not a starting caliber player anymore post-injury.  DFS should be coming off the bench  mavs talk themselves into bringing in frankie ntilikina because he plays OK defense, but then you run into a josh green 2.0 situation where you can never even play him meaningful minutes because you're playing 4v5 offense or even 3v5 if its powell+ntilikina  same issues as last year that get glossed over because luka is phenomenal and carries you a lot of the time, but then when the playoffs come he can't do it by himself"
"I‚Äôm sorry, but one game into the season isn‚Äôt enough to say this is a poor version of shooters around Luka. THJ was one of the best shooters in the NBA last year. DFS and maxi are experts at hitting corner 3‚Äôs, KP stretches the floor, and we replaced James Johnson and Josh richardson with Bullock and Brown who both shot better than 40% on 3 on more than 10 attempts a game combined.   Like, is this a championship roster? No. But Luka/THJ/bullock/DFS/KP  With Jalen/brown/green/maxi/Dwight off the bench, that‚Äôs a great shooting starting lineup. You can criticize interior defense and playmaking, but we have shooting."
"At no point have I ever thought ""I got power over hiring head coach"".  I'm pessimistic, because there isn't much to be optimistic about. We have the exact same starting lineup that we did back in 2019. We went from Rick Carlisle to Jason Kidd, maybe the biggest downgrade in head coaching ever? Definitly the biggest in recent memory.  Jason Kidd, was terrible head coach with the Nets and Bucks. The Lakers offense was bad as well last year. Nothing he has said in the post game conferences or interview makes me optimistic. The offensive plan yesterday was an absolute disaster.  Then we got the owner Mark Cuban, who has his hands in every single decision, so even hiring a new GM won't matter much. As Cuban said himself, ""I write the checks, so I decide"".  We have no draft capital, the last real shot at cheap controlled players in the 2020 draft was a disaster. Of the 3 guys we drafted, 2 are already out of the NBA. Josh Green was picked over numerous others, that even 15 year olds on our subreddit could see were better.  We are fucked cap wise, backing on KP, praying he suddenly turns into a good post player. Praying he can suddenly dribble more than 2 times before losing the ball.  There is 1 positive on this team and it's Luka and the new plan by our head coach is to take the ball out of his hands. ""Get other guys involved"", which would work if the other players we had were starter caliber players who can make decisions on the court. But we dont have that.   Tell me what exactly should I be positive about? We can't improve with the draft, we are capped out for the forseeable future. Replaced our HOF Head coach with someone who has a terrible track record. Are running the same starting lineup we had since 2019. What should I be positive about?  If there's stuff to be positive about, I'd wanna do it. But there isn't. If I'm Luka i'd ask out by year 3 of my max.  If me being realistic means I'm pessimistic, then so be it."
"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would‚Äôve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn‚Äôt have needed to trade up. This meant we didn‚Äôt have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It‚Äôs really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren‚Äôt worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."
"Bigger blowout please Atlanta, give me some Josh Green minutes"
Give us Josh Green
"That seems like a meaningless distinction to make, though, and it completely ignores that the point of having young players is to accrue stars, not role players.   The group of Luka, Moses brown, Tyrell Terry, Jalen brunson, Frank and Josh green is likely to see way more success over the next 5 years than the OKC group.   The OKC group is only a better core if your goal is to have a bunch of good players and turn into the Pacers and be a fun team to watch with 0 playoff equity."
"My bad, I remembered it as ""I like Josh Green over Bay"" not *liked. As for people he was arguing with in in the comments, someone in the media, I believe it was Nick Angstat, sayed some of them worked for the Mavs."
"Kind of dishonest to characterize it as a ""twitter argument"" when he wasn't actually arguing with anyone, he was just posting a general defense of his moves to twitter, not replying to anyone in particular. And if you actually read his words fairly, at no point does he say or imply ""josh green &gt; saddiq bay"""
Maybe it's the childish Twitter arguments with former coworkers about why none of the bad moves were his fault because Josh Green&gt;Saddiq Bay and people in the FO didn't tell him no enough
"If only they were all on Houston they could triple up with Jalen. They night even be able to swing the trade for Josh green from Dallas and Javonte green from the Bulls. They could legitimately get J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, and J. Green on the court"
"He‚Äôs literally the polar opposite of all the guys who played for the Boomers. Patty, Tisse, Josh Green, Baynes all those guys would run through a brick wall for our country. Hell, Dante Exum was a free agent who could‚Äôve done with an offseason but instead chose to play for the Boomers without hesitation. I really doubt Ben would fit in on that team"

"Look at how absolute shit our drafting was from Conley till JJJ.  2008: Kevin Love (5th overall) who was traded immediately for OJ Mayo. OJ wasn't bad per-se, but he wasn't great. Donte Green (28th overall) was traded immediately to Houston for the rights to Darrell Arthur in a 3-team trade. Arthur was ok.  2009: Hasheem Thabeet (2nd overall) was trash. Demarre Carroll (27th overall) was below average on the Grizz and found a decent role later on. Sam Young (2nd round, 36th overall) was below average.  2010: Xavier Henry (12th overall) was trash. Dominique Jones (25th overall) was traded to Dallas for the GOAT Cash Considerations. Greivis Vasquez (28th overall) decent backup PG who we traded to Toronto later on.  2011: Josh Selby (49th overall) was trash.  2012: Tony Wroten (25th overall) was traded to the 76ers after one season and was on the team during the Process years if that's any indication for how he turned out.   2013: Jamaal Franklin (41st overall) played in 24 career games and has been playing in China since 2014. Janis Timma (60th overall) never played in the NBA.  2014: Jordan Adams (22nd overall) was always injured and played in 32 career games.   2015: Jarrell Martin (25th overall) was out of the league as his play style was quickly lost with the 3-ball revolution.  2016: Wade Baldwin (17th overall) was too cocky and never made an impact. Cut from Memphis after 1 season. Wang Zhelin (57th overall) has never played in the NBA.   2017: No draft picks! Did trade for Dillon Brooks on draft night though.   Seriously, that drafting is absolutely awful. Went a full decade without a single guy being even a role player."
"I mean, its 10x more significant than anything Josh Green has done yet lol"
"I think they are properly rated.  They were just really unfortunate the last couple of years and I feel like people underrated them a lot, just because they lost in the 1st round two years in a row and ignore all the context.  19-20  Mavs had the best offense in the league. TOP3 point differential in the West.   They were just abysmal in the clutch. Had an absurdly awful record in close games so in the end they finished 7th and had to play the Clippers in the 1st round. And we all know how it ended. I think we can all agree that it at least would've been competitive if KP was healthy, but he wasn't, so they lost in 6.   20-21  KP can't play at the beginning of the season. Luka comes in out of the shape. So they struggle a lot early in the year.  KP comes back, but then four rotation players get COVID, so guys like Iwundu and Josh Green get 20+ minutes a night and are important part of the rotation.  In the end when everyone comes back, they look great.   They finish 5th and again play the Clippers in the first round.  It goes to seven, Mavs were leading 3-2 and had a great chance of beating the team a lot of people were calling the favorites to take it all.   This year, with healthy KP and a bunch of teams missing their top guys, I don't see why they can't be a top3 in the West if everything goes normal. They don't need everything to go right. They just need everything to be normal."
"If you‚Äôre projecting, shouldn‚Äôt you projecting their outcomes and not what they are right now? Because Bey can create his own offence (step backs, post ups, fadeaways, blow bys to the rim) and you should project that to improve not be non-existent.   Bey projects as an NBA starter for the next decade, giving you 10-15ppg every year. What the hell does Josh Green project as?  People fall too in love with the unknown quantity. Green could be anything, he could even be Saddiq Bey"
I like Josh Green
I would take Josh Green over Saddiq Bey still.
"Cade is going to be as good as he was advertised pre-draft. Somehow, as soon as the draft ended and Cade became a Piston, everyone became a hot take artist that Jalen Green is better and Mobley will also be better. About 1/4 of the way into the season, he will start running point full-time and we will move Hayes to the bench for josh Jackson or diallo."
"Josh Giddey will win ROTY  Cade is gonna have a good but not great rookie year and Jalen green is gonna have bad efficiency numbers. No one else in the class will particularly standout in their rookie year. But Giddey has played awesome in preseason and in OKC, he‚Äôll have all the opportunity and trust that he needs to be successful in this first year. I can see a 14 7 and 7 type of season from him. Similar to Ben Simmons rookie year"
From what i heard it was between  him and Josh Green and greens agents had a better pitch.
I really like Josh Green. Think he‚Äôs a sneaky good passer .
I want Josh green to be a rotation level player so badly. It cannot be overstated how badly Dallas has been at drafting outside of the lottery over the last 20 years. Arguably the worst drafting team in the league.
I still have hope for Josh Green!
"After the draft I was convinced that Tyrell Terry &gt; Tyler Bey &gt; Josh Green. I think it was KOC who had given such glowing reports about how Terry was a mid first rounder who fell because of some reasons. Of all the sharpshooters signed in that draft, he is the only one who hardly played.   I kept seeing his DNP last season even when we barely had any players but I guess that personal reason must be big enough to prevent him from playing even when we were shorthanded. Part of the blame kept going on Rick Carlisle as he doesn't trust 'rookies' especially those that were drafted late.   Now I hope that at least Green turns out OK as otherwise that would be two consecutive zeroes after hitting the jackpot in 2018."
Why not exactly? What has josh green shown?
Didn‚Äôt the raptors want Josh Green? I‚Äôm definitely not willing to part with JG.
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"Josh Giddey aka next season‚Äôs Tyrese Haliburton, special enough to be talked about but will not compare to the obvious future stars when guys like Mobley/Green/Cade are showing huge impact"
"Josh green was drafted over a year ago , you're mistaken"
Btw Josh Green is def Zach Efron's hs musical buddy
"Josh Green is a great 2k end of bench guy, so I keep wondering when he'll break into the Mavs rotation. I was actually mad they drafted him. lol"
I‚Äôd rather not have Dragic and keep Josh Green.

"Covid problems. KP injuried for 15 games or more.  Plus we added Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown. Brunson seems to be still developing. Josh Green looks more confident. Omoruyi and Carlik are good grabs in the draft. Kidd bringed our chemestry from 40% to 90% etc."
"Are you talking about Josh Green?  Dude has a nice jumper, plays d, and has mediocre athleticism.  I feel like mavs fans have no idea who this guy is because Carlisle refused to play him legit minutes even when down three guards."
Josh Green should be held liable for this. Hope Bridges knees were fine though.
Def read this as ‚ÄúJosh Green throws Miles Bridges a poster oop‚Äù and was thoroughly confused
"I hope for your sake. Last year, he gave major props to Josh Green in the preseason , and the poor kid didn't see the floor in the regular season( only garbage time)."
"Assuming the text above is a joke/sarcastic: absolutely, he's a scrub, trade him for Josh Primo.  If it's serious: Jalen Green had one of the best defenders in the league on him the entire game, so I'ma say no, he's probably fine and he just had a rough game dealing with 5-year-veteran defence as *literally* a preseason rookie. OBVIOUSLY NBA defense is a massive step up from lower levels of play, and everyone, no matter how good, needs time to adjust to that."
Probably: Jalen Green   Underrated pick: Josh Giddey
"Name a single draft where a team got that many you g dudes with this much upside. Two of these guys were studs over seas, one of which was an MVP of one of the best international leagues at just 18 years old(ring any bells?), and two other guys in Jalen Green and Josh Christopher who are both look like fantastic picks from all of the information and tape we do have on them.  It‚Äôs not outlandish to think this could be one of the best drafts by a team, if not the best. Hell, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one if the most impressive jobs by a GM in a two year span if you look at the young talent they‚Äôve acquired over the past two seasons."
"Cuban will never be more than a 5 until he stops having final say over personnel decisions. It was clear during their GM search this offseason that he was never going after someone like Masai who demands autonomy over roster moves. He created such a toxic front office structure that resulted in opposing GMs not knowing who had final say on trades within the organization. He let a shadow-GM who made his money as a gambler select Josh Green over Saddiq Bey in the 2020 draft, the last top 20 pick the Mavs will have in the Luka era. And none of this would have changed without the Tim Cato story - which Cuban called ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù before he totally cleaned house.  I‚Äôm not even going to get into the late Dirk prime years where we were constantly being embarrassed by the Dwight Howard/Deandre Jordan chases when we could have just re-signed Tyson Chandler. Chandler Parsons was our go to Free Agent recruiter.   He did a lot of good early on by focusing on international scouting, but I‚Äôm just over the facade of Mark Cuban as trailblazing owner."
Nuggets need Josh Green so they can monopolize the J. Green ownership in the league
"Reports are saying Josh Green is looking awesome. I haven't heard as much about him, but I'm still hoping Tyrell Terry can develop into a Buddy Hield/JJ Redick type as our Seth Curry replacement. That trade still hurts so much."

"Between Luka's shooting mechanic, Moses' overall improvement vs OKC sample and how the 2-way rookies played well, coaching staff so far is doing a good job.  Except for Josh Green. Boy, we need to talk about Josh Green."
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
I mean if I knew back then that the trade was  James Harden for:  3 FRP's  4 pick swaps  Kevin Porter Jr (Came from the Prince in cleveland debacle)  Jalen Green  Josh Christopher  2022 Miami pick swap  &amp;#x200B;  I would've been really really happy actually

"Josh Green also got experience playing for the Australian Olympic team, which would certainly help him improve"
"Patrick Williams, Onyeka Okongwu, Josh Green, Tyrese Maxey. When in doubt, bet on youth."
I liked what I saw from Josh Green in the Mavs scrimmage earlier today. Hopefully that shows through in the regular season. I'd like to see him as a reliable rotation player
"well, *personally* i was NEVER sold on Ben Simmons the way everyone else was. i didn't think he'd end up like this, but it didn't rub me the right way when Brett Brown was at a press conference begging Simmons to at least try to shoot the ball, and he still didn't.  obviously hindsight is 20/20, but from that day on i've been more critical of him, so when his name kept coming up, i wasn't exactly excited. between Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, and Alpern, i'm already happy with the haul we got.  although, im not sure if that's something that happened because of, or in spite of Fertitta."
"In the old 2ks at least. Josh Shelby was an absolute demon. Selby, Green, Terrance Ross, pre-star derozan, Joshua Cunningham, etc all monsters. I miss those days"
"I mean, Morey did somehow dump Horford and Josh Richardson and still get Danny Green and S. Curry. You act like he's done nothing right."
"Morey turned Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Simmons going full bitch mode obviously isnt great but trading him for CJ McCollum gets the team nowhere for Embiids entire prime.  Rather wait and see what else is out there or take back a package with picks and prospects easily.  Look where the Sixers were last year as a 6 seed locked into that horford deal.  You are being way over dramatic, it is not his fault Ben decided to burn this shit to the ground"
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)
"Still wish we picked him at 18, hoping Josh Green at least becomes playable this year"
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."

Josh Hart trying for the Draymond Green double-double
"Why would the Mavs trade a 25 year old Brunson (he's on a $1M deal), they would need to also add Dwight Powell or Maxi Kleber to salary match.  Most Dragic deals were centered around either Josh Green + salary filler or just one of Powell/Kleber."
Cuban go  Give them Josh Green if neccesary.
"He‚Äôs still trying to justify his draft pick when he blew the pick. It‚Äôs maybe not a shot at bey, but it‚Äôs absurd to say that josh green was the right pick when you see the players picked after him, not just bey. He doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for any wrong doings, but wants credit for hypotheticals like wanting to trade up for thybulle or liking Alex Caruso. It‚Äôs easy to say these things now when you are unemployed"
"Willie Green is getting closer to understanding the best players on his roster.  Though he still has Josh Hart (not) guarding Bojan Bogdanovich and, predictably, hemorraghing threes.  Someday the Pelicans might start playing their best players in their best roles. And not playing their worst players in any role."
"Maxey was an incredible pick, he traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, dumped Horford for cheap, signed Niang and Drummond for cheap who have been huge for us. Re-signed Furk and Danny Green for cheap. Signed Embiid to a Max extension. Literally every move he has made so far has been excellent. Only question mark is Simmons"
And probably would ruin the immaculate chemistry.  Unless they wanna pair Simmons with Josh Green to make a duo of Kangaroo Bros
"i'd do unspeakable things to make him come back  god, we can make run in the PO if we play our cards right this midseason trade  i'd start with Powell + Josh Green + Moses Brown + FRP"
"""any playmaking abilities"" he was arguably our 2nd best playmaker after Luka until Brunson started passing better. Josh Green has very good passing idk what you're on about"
Josh green lol
"&gt;That being said, he's usually not wrong.   Because he twists words to make himself seem right. In this interview he managed to sneak himself out of blame for the Josh Richardson trade, the Josh Green pick, and a few other bad decisions that were reportedly his or that he supported.  It's hilarious that he repeatedly referred to other people being Machiavellian, but if you've been following this you know that it's complete bullshit and he's the one being manipulative."
Maybe if we added a first round pick and josh green they would be interested in that. Or is he worth more?
"Jalen is 100% not worth it.  Turner also have 2 years left on the contract so we shouldnt give everything to get him.  2 1st round picks, DFS, Josh Green and Moses Brown may do it. Specially if Turner doesnt plan to resign."
"It‚Äôs not about the wins. It‚Äôs about how are players are being used   Our young players have struggled getting minutes over random vets. We LITERALLY have no offensive sets. It‚Äôs all just do whatever you want out there. Which for guys like KPJ and Green is too much responsibility right now and they are playing awful because of it   Garuba who played in a top league in the world and paid 4m just to break his team‚Äôs contract to come here can‚Äôt even step on the court without us being down 20 points. He‚Äôs now playing great in the g league  We have the worst shooting team in the league by a mile and Armoni Brooks who is a certified sniper can‚Äôt get on the court either.   Josh Christopher our other first rounder has struggled to get on the court as well. Despite being a better passer and shot creator than most of our team.   KJ Martin just recently started getting minutes despite outplaying our entire roster.  Sengun was given 5 min a couple games ago cause Quote by Silas ‚ÄúTheis was playing well‚Äù  Silas is not just not winning us games. He isn‚Äôt prioritizing minutes for our young guys, nor is he setting up our players for success.   So you tell me, what is Silas actually doing well? Except for having a big old grin"
"Turner will be perfect but idk if we have a good trade package to get him.   Any Pacers fan her will take 2 1st round picks, Moses Brown, Josh Green and Sterling Brown for Turner?"
Maybe Harrell?   Idk but they need an upgrade at that spot. Powell and WCS are almost 3rd string players.  Harrell would be a good idea to replace Powell if Mavs want to continue with their current system. If they want to go back to last year system when everyone could shot from the 3 they should look for a stretch big.  As to the assets i think we have 2 1st round picks and we can also send some mediocre prospects like Josh Green and Moses Brown. Maybe Sterling Brown too who is a decent role players but he doesnt seem to fit on Mavs that well so far.
Hilarious part is we had the opportunity to draft boffum and went with Josh green and tyrell terry üò≠
We don‚Äôt have much but‚Ä¶ 1. Alperen Sengun 2. Jalen Green 3. Kevin Porter Jr. 4. Christian Wood 5. Josh Christopher 6. Usman Garuba 7. Kenyon Martin Jr. 8. Jae‚Äôsean Tate
and Josh Green carrying the shit outta the ball while unpressured lol
"It was Cwebb, now I‚Äôd say maybe Billups.  STAT was an mvp caliber guy in NY one year and was great for Phoenix.  Tyson Chandler might have a HOF case, Joakim Noah might not make the hall but he was a really great player.  Luol Deng too.  Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal sticks out as a snub.  Throwback Andrew Toney the Boston strangler.  Joe Johnson was one of my all time favs hope he makes the Hall at some point.  Mark Aguirre bad boy Piston is not in the hall despite an awesome college career and really really good nba career  Andre Miller also one of those guys for even how remarkable his career was has no shot at the HOF but deserves to be remembered by fans  At the time in the mid 00‚Äôs I think most people would‚Äôve assumed that Rasheed Wallace would make the hall before Ben Wallace but that did not happen  Human highlight reel Shawn Kemp is not in  Just some names that don‚Äôt belong in the Hall but deserve a shout out, Derek Fisher, Gerald Wallace, Shane Battier, Kyle Korver, Marcus Camby, Danny Granger, David West, Andrei Kirlienko, Mehmet Okur, Nikola Pekovic, Josh Smith, Gerald Green.  I fricking love the nba so much"
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
Fairly self explanatory if you watch either Romeo or Nesmith play.  It's like trying to claim that Josh Green is a 1st round asset right now.  He's not. Neither are the other two
Ill give you a lightly used Josh Green
"Can‚Äôt wait till he plays on the Australian team at the next Olympics.  Giddey, Thybulle and Josh Green will all be going into their prime. Patty will probably have one last run before he retires.  Still have Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Jock Landale and Aron Baynes.  X-Factor is if Ben Simmons finally joins. Figure he has a shot at it if he wants to redeem his image."
Josh Green needed more playing time last year. He needs more this year
"Josh Green is probably not going to work out, but it would be nice if he did."
We got Josh Green who averaging almost 0mpg a game. lmfao Fuck us
That‚Äôs nothing compared to the GOAT Josh Green üò§
Good thing we snagged the GOAT Josh Green in that draft üò§
"The Harden Trade alone is bad, but he also moved Horford's contract for Danny Green and got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Also his analytics driven approach to... everything just makes it seem like he's more interested in squeezing out hidden value than he is trying to mutually benefit both teams."
"There‚Äôs the end to end speed and there‚Äôs explosive first step of quick burst of speed I‚Äôm not gonna dive deep into who has what too much but   PG: it used to be Rose, Westbrook and Wall. Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it‚Äôs still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven‚Äôt seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he‚Äôs not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."

"Bro, we went from Hinkie getting sacked by the league, to a dude who beyond being a terrible GM in trades and the draft, was literally calling out his best player on twitter on burner accounts, to Elton Brand who never had any experience in that type of role and spent the last amount of cap space on Al Horford.  Morey came into this shitty Ben situation, and was not helped at all by Doc after the playoffs. With zero cap space, Morey traded Josh Richardson for Curry, somehow got off the Horford contract without hemorraging blood, drafted Tyrese Maxey, brought in Danny Green, etc. The Ben Simmons situation has always been 24/7 drama, no one in the organization is actually that upset he's gone, if anything it's galvanized everyone else on the roster. I know everyone loves to shit on Philly and Morey, but just caving and trading Ben bc you feel you have to right this second isn't helpful."
"I question so much why we didn't make Seth more of a starter on the team. We squandered him way too much. At the time of the J-Rich deal, I thought we were absolutely winning that trade. But alas we lost that one miserably along with drafting Josh Green instead of Bey or Maxey.     I'll always appreciate Rick and Donnie but fuck man, they screwed up bigly in some areas. Happy to see Seth get a lot of shine now though. Man deserves it."
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
Like Saddiq Bey?  I was positive the Mavericks would pick him and then scratched my head at Josh Green.
"Nah we are one two-way wing away  Come back black falcon :(  We can give you Josh Green + Moses Brown Kangz, maybe FRP if Nico want all in"
I can't tell you how pissed I still am that my Mavs picked Josh Green over Sadiq Bey.
"this rockets season makes me feel like the people complaining so much either don't watch or understand what is really happening or don't understand reality.  i was very critical of silas last season. and everything i was critical about he dramatically improved on. and is still going to keep getting better the longer he is a head coach. this is his second season as a head coach EVER.  silas is also developing a team with a core of guys who have mostly played less than three or four seasons worth of games in the nba. and trying to develop and integrate FOUR ROOKIES. and still develop players from the season before.  everyone wants things to be fast and immediately happen, but that is impossible. no matter who the coach is they aren't going to play 4 rookies, play them all 30+ minutes a night, and win games right away.  silas has proven he is solid enough with the offensive stuff that it isn't a long term issue. right now he is most focused on developing kpj green and sengun, and has started integrating josh christopher.   kpj is starting to play cleaner, so silas immediately started giving green more time running the offense on a lineup for him. sengun already had a lineup specially for him. now that green is taking his turn sengun has been placed with green more and house has taken augustine's minutes. improving the defense and giving the rookies more control.  the defensive improvement was especially impressive, there are still a lot of things for them to work on but there is a lot more progress than too many fans are acting like.  silas should be there at least until they reach the 3 year window they originally set up for development. and by then i hope silas shows everyone he should be their coach for the long term. because silas is getting a lot of hate for not rushing things, he is doing everything people want but just at a more reasonable pace."
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
"Actually their bench is pretty nice: DFS/Reggie, Brunson/THJ, Maxi/Dwight, Sterling Brown, Frank, Boban for spot minutes. The only real negatives are WCS and the failure of Josh Green to develop, but the former only plays limited minutes if KP is healthy. Agreed of course that Dwight shouldn't start, and especially not as part of a two-big lineup with KP at the 4."

"Honestly. He should've already been in the g league games.   Mavs just sent down Moses Brown and Josh Green, to get reps, because they were just riding the bench anyways."
Josh green is a worse draft pick than Justin Anderson.  Don‚Äôt know why Mavs are obsessed with 6‚Äô5 wing who can‚Äôt shoot or playmake.  We had 3 picks before 35. All 3 of them are useless.
"Trey Burke, Dwight Powell, Josh Green, WCS"
Josh Green is a got damn scrub  I said it
WCS is a complete and utter waste of height. Josh Green simply doesn't have NBA ready skills and might never have them. I also can't see Omurui make it farther than a 2way contract. If we hadn't given Burke such a silly contract he might be out of the league as well and nobody would miss him. Haven't seen enough of McLaughlin.  That's quite a lot for a playoff team...
"The Mavs fanbase is turning on Josh green. He just hasn‚Äôt shown much of anything that warrants being an NBA player. And that‚Äôs not terrible, like players picked in the post lottery are real hit or miss. But it‚Äôs made a little worse by the fact that Maxey and Bane and Bey were all picked not long after, and Bane had predraft interviews saying great things about Dallas and Luka, and he went to TCU. But whatever."

I think they were just too aggressive in trying to field an explosive scoring style offense. Gave up too much defensively for more offensive firepower. The analytics probably weighed heavy into their personnel decision making. Can‚Äôt blame them when you have a talent like Luka that can facilitate for an entire offense though.   The Seth Curry-to-Josh Richardson was really the only clear debacle that the Mavs have made.  THJ is and has been exactly the player that people love and hate. When he catches fire he can win a game by himself but for the most part he‚Äôs an inefficient chucker that doesn‚Äôt do much without the green light. Porzingis on paper was supposed to be a great fit. Shot blocking big that can stretch the floor‚Ä¶but his overall health and inability to consistently create offense for himself made him a bit of a risky acquisition. Powell was looking like a very good player until he blew out his knee and Kleber + DFS are exactly the glue guys you need on a roster.  The Mavs can beat anyone in the league when Doncic + THJ are super efficient  in their FG%/TO. They have enough offense to outscore even the best of teams. In a 7 game playoff series? Unlikely you can maintain that type of reliability offensively to make up for the lack of defensive prowess.
"Yeah idk who else we could offer for him, maybe add in Josh Green if they want a young player idk, Sterling Brown or Reggie Bullock maybe idk."
"Every once in awhile I get mildly sick when I think about how we drafted Josh Green in front of people like Maxey, Bey and Bane."
and thats why you got Josh giddey instead of Mobley/Cade/Green heheheheh
"If we drafted Saddiq Bey over Josh Green I‚Äôd feel so much better about the direction of this team right now, even if that doesn‚Äôt really fix the ball handling problem."
"Also not sure what assets we‚Äôd send. I don‚Äôt think Josh Green is promising enough to be valued by Indiana, especially since Carlisle is there and he never played green"

Porzingis and Josh Green
Horford + smart for KP looks...interesting :) dont mind give young development guy like Josh Green or Moses
"Coincidentally, I think Dallas would have lots of interest. Don't really think there is a trade package that makes sense though. The only thing that really works money-wise would be KP for Horford + Marcus, or something like Maxi Kleber, DFS and Josh Green. And I doubt Boston would have any interest in either package."
"you‚Äôll take josh green, and you‚Äôll like it"
"Josh Green looking meh. Come on, Luka just hit a game winning three."
Mavs should take a flyer. He couldn't be worse than Josh green
Josh Green?
Well a good role player is still better then Josh Green who is rooting on the bench. If we had Bey we could have used the money from Bullock on a big.
i take gordon and plumet for tingus + josh green + moses :(
"I'm still a believer in Josh Green just because he's already a good defender, passer and is very athletic but I think he should probably be looking to go to the G-League to get his offensive game together"
Josh Green. Sterling Brown.
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
"Cut for Josh Green. Clearly the Thunder should trade Giddey and a pick for him. Come on, Presti, do it, do it!"
Jokes on you when we have assets we pick guys like Josh Green üòÇüòÇü•≤
"Still, any one out of these three:  1. not trading Harrison Barnes for nothing 2. not trading Seth Curry for nothing 3. not whiffing on the Josh Green pick  would have our team in a much better position now"

"I was having a decent Friday until I saw the jump he's made this year. I'll never forgive Donnie Nelson for gifting Philly Seth, drafting Josh Green over Maxey, and trading away Milton to them on draft night."
Josh ‚ÄúDraymond Green‚Äù Giddey
"That‚Äôs also true. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs nice to have the option of playing good defense, to overcome this struggle. And also Luka isn‚Äôt in the best form yet and it‚Äôs clearly shown. I was 50/50 for the Curry trade. Yes Curry was phenomenal in the offense, but the Clippers literally target him every single attack in the defense-that‚Äôs why the trade for Richardson was ok for paper. Mavs didn‚Äôt have players that could ‚Äúhide‚Äù curry on defense-the sixers definitely have. I‚Äôm more furious on our bad draft picks (Terry who was waived; Josh Green barely plays-cannot shot a thing) and that we didn‚Äôt get a secondary playmaker or a big (for instance Rubio was dirt cheap)"
"Sooo, Wolves... how do you feel about KP, Josh Green and a Twix?"
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
Josh Giddey Jalen Green Scottie Barnes Franz Wagner Evan Mobley
Porzingis and Josh Green. I would do it in a heartbeat to get rid of KP's contract.
I would do this deal in a nanosecond. I'll even throw in Josh Green if they want. Getting us out from under KP's contract would be worth it just to open up flexibility in the coming years.
They‚Äôve only had one first round pick since drafting Luka and they picked Josh Green. They‚Äôve had two second round picks and missed on both but second round picks aren‚Äôt frequently big contributors so can‚Äôt hold that against them too much. Bottom line is that they invested a lot of money and draft capital into Porzingis and it‚Äôs crippled them significantly.
"Because they gave up all of their draft capital for Porzingis. Only real miss was taking Josh Green, a raw teenager, in the first instead of someone who could contribute sooner, but even the jury is still out on that one."
"yeah but you can't teach that kind of explosiveness and athleticism. I agree.i think KPJ is more of a SG, but you guys are at the stage where you are just developing young talent. if KPJ turns into a 18 ppg microwave type guy like Jordan Clarkson, and Jalen Green can work on his shot selection and start scoring at the level hes capable of, with Woof &amp; Sengun, i would take that core as a top 10 young core in the league. I also like Garuba and Josh Christopher"
Josh Green or Trey Burke?
Josh Green.
"1. Harden trade, nuff said. (I‚Äôd like to see the alternate universe where it‚Äôs OKC and ORL built around picks and JJ Redick who would‚Äôve been great on those OKC teams, and the cascading effect on ORL/HOU/Lob City LAC without Redick)  2. Rescinding the Tyson Chandler trade - I put the Harden trade first as a hat-tip to consensus, but this one kills me worse.  3. Jeff Green over Joakim Noah. I‚Äôm not a fan of Noah really but he would have been a great C for those OKC teams and it prevents the Perk trade.  4. Draft misses - Byron Mullens, Cole Aldrich, Cam Payne, Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis, TFerg (over Anunoby ugh), trading Eric Bledsoe instead of just keeping him, Perry Jones  5. Promising Giannis to bring him over immediately instead of asking to stash him a year, and then taking him over Adams and Gobert over Roberson  6. Re-signing Kevin Martin instead of letting him walk, and moving on sooner from Jeremy Lamb and PJIII  7. The Perk trade"
Happy with Barnes in top 3. But Green 1st makes no sense. Even Josh Giddey has been better then him
Dallas would have interest but not for Brunson. Not sure what a trade package would look like but probably Josh Green + other stuff.
1. Scottie Barnes 2. Evan Mobley 3. Chris Duarte 4. Josh Giddey 5. Jalen Green
"Ryan Broekhoff? He was on the 76ers last season but now he's playing in Australia.  Edit: Nvm, completely forgot about Josh Green lol."
Josh Green is just bad

Shoutout to Josh Green who managed to be +10 while playing 17 minutes
"I swear, Josh Green is just a smaller Dwight Powell. All energy and effort but looks lost basketball wise."
This. Possibly with the addition of Moses Brown. No way we‚Äôre trading Josh Green for a 35yr old Goran Dragic.
Josh Green
"Yeah but if Luka wants him he'll get him, and Josh Green ain't an obstacle. We're talking about his former mentor here."
Dallas isn‚Äôt giving up Josh Green for Dragic. Dwight Powell and Burke is the likely return. Or Toronto can just keep him.
"Eww.  Anyway we've already got Josh Green, the GWS/Mavs cross-over.  Following in the footsteps of Alex Carey, the GWS/Aussie cricket captain cross-over."
Mavs have Josh Green and one of the most fun players in the league (Doncic). Can‚Äôt go wrong with the Mavs!
Mavs! Dallas has an Australian in Josh Green and you get to enjoy luka!
"Mavs have Australian Josh Green and will dominate the NBA for the next 15 years, so they would be a good choice."
"Yeah maybe that is the issue. I mean I have really liked Powell over the years and it would be fitting to send him back to his home town of Toronto. I wouldn't mind giving him up because we still have players like Kleber(who is more of a PF), Boban, KP, and just got Moses Brown from OKC. So it wouldn't be the worst case to happen.  It's either the Mavericks just love the guy or Toronto doesn't want him. Or maybe they are just trying to work out the money side of it who knows.   But you are right about Dragic still having something in the tank. The Mavericks do need a secondary ball handler like that. I just can't imagine them wanting to trade Josh Green(who they just drafted last season) and even more so Brunson. I am super ultra high on Brunson and would honestly rather keep him then get Dragic if that makes sense. But again who knows what the front offices are figuring out right now."
He is not worth more than josh green as an asset. L o l
Josh Green and Tyrell Terry are the prospects.

Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"Josh Giddey, Dyson Daniels, Josh Green and Matisse Thybulle are going to be leading the team in 3 years time."
"Josh Green looked really good in the garbage time, Mavs fans have 2 reasons to be happy about the Olympics this year."
Josh Green too! Amazing depth. Almost every top 8 team has a solid starting 5 but our depth has been a huge differential.
"No problem mate. I assumed he chose not to play to ensure no injuries before the draft, but I‚Äôm baffled that the team decided Josh Green would be better haha"
JOSH GREEN GOT SOME POINTS LET'S GO!!!!
My boy Josh Green
Josh Green aiming for 30 minutes worth of points in junk time alone
Josh Green looking the gooooods
That's Dallas Maverick Josh Green thank you very much
"He was never on the team, only practiced and played exhibition games. Apparently he wanted to play but the team chose Josh Green"
"üéµAt a party, who's Josh Greenüéµ"
Josh Green needs more minutes
Time for Josh Green to shine!
"Get Josh Green out there, give the man some minutes"
Play Reath and Josh Green!
Give Josh Green some run
gimme Josh Green coach :(
josh green needs some mins over sobey
Why don't we try Josh Green instead of Delly? Josh Greens athleticism alone is better than any Delly could bring.
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left

Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I‚Äôd want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
"I‚Äôm fucking calling it on your asses, Josh Green is gonna make MJ look like stepped on gas station sushi."
"We should totally sign Patty Mills. I hate that Mark is always so focused on a big name, when it's smart additions that lead to winning. Would help with Josh Green prob too"
do exactly what the mavs need but let‚Äôs take a flyer on JoSh GrEeN
"So Mavericks' rookie sensation Josh Green can't even get more than a minute?  Hey Australians, does he have anything or just carrying an empty bag?"
I keep checking the box score for Josh Green minutes :(
I wish Josh Green was getting more minutes but I get that he might not be ready to contribute on that team
ooooo we get a Josh Green sighting. idm
"Honestly he was fine in general to start the season, his play just kind of steadily declined until it got to a point he was clearly in his own head.   The game Josh Green came in and outplayed him was the low point for him. Pulling for J Rich to turn it around though, he‚Äôs a great guy and does have talent."
How‚Äôs Josh Green doing?
"Mavs are the only team I can think of with such an excess of shooters with zero trade value. It'll be interesting next year to see if those guys breakout or fall off a cliff under the new system.  Also I wish we would trade Culver for Josh Green. Teams should be more open to trading ""bust"" lottery picks because I think all those guys have the talent to be successful if put in the right situation."
I honestly think Jalen green and josh Christopher are gonna pan out really well for Houston. I can see Garuba surprising people as well.
I was over the moon with Josh Green last year for the same reason.
"Rockets  I think we won this draft man  Green, Sengun and Garuba is truly amazing  Josh Christopher is someone I need to watch tape on tommorow  Hawks, Warriors, Orlando, Hornets and Pistons did good too"
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
Kpj/Jalen green/josh Christopher gonna combine for 55ppg &amp; 3 assists per night and I will love every single second of it
oh shit Jalen Green and Josh Christopher both got drafted by houston they‚Äôre really good friends
Apparently Josh was a former teammate of Green so they got chemistry at least which is promising.
"I want the rockets to get wall out of town and throw their young guards into the fire.  Think they‚Äôll all benefit from it and progress quicker, don‚Äôt know about josh but green and KPJ have that asshole level confidence so them being absolutely ass as the #1 and #2 options wouldn‚Äôt destroy them."
Josh Christopher and Jalen Green reuniting that‚Äôs sick. Were so fun together in AAU

Damn I forgot Josh Green existed wtf is up with him
Bey is the only guy on your roster that seemed gettable without giving up further compensation. We‚Äôd for sure keep Vlatko. Just in draft mode so I‚Äôm fiending for moves to be made.   We‚Äôd 100% give him up for Josh Green.
That was too easy. We now demand Josh Green.

Chris Duarte I think this draft could be very deep with good/solid players. Mobley looks like the next great big in this league I think he can be elite in 5-6 years. Cunningham will be a perennial all-star. Suggs will be a
"1) Jalen Green 2) Jalen Suggs 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Johnathan Kuminga 5) Ziaire Williams 6) Evan Mobley 7) Jalen Johnson 8) Alperun Sengun 9) Josh Christopher 10) James Bouknight/Joshua Primo  I think this is a crazy deep Draft but kinda top heavy with Bust Potential. Not to say all those guys will Bust just that they could, so I'll bet on these guys."

"I think /r/nba is probably in for a bigger shock when they find out not everyone in the NBA thinks of Ben as trash lol. Morey moved Horford for Danny Green and only had to attach a first. He moved Josh Richardson, for Seth Curry who is on an extremely team friendly deal. But yes, it is the MG of 15 years who is in for a ""big shock"". I know it's an easy excuse when he's your GM but these comments are v funny"
"Star: Cade and Mobley. I know, not exactly a blazing take but I really do think both guys can be top players at their respective position, and I think that anybody who has Green over Mobley is going to look really foolish.  Bust: I don‚Äôt see Kuminga being all that good. He‚Äôs a big wing with B+ athleticism and subpar skills. We‚Äôve seen this movie before with Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson."
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Jalen Suggs  3. Evan Mobley  4. Franz Wagner  5. Josh Giddey  6. Jalen Green  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Jaden Springer  9. Moses Moody  10. Jalen Johnson  I biased my list towards high lotto picks that will get the most playing time and chances to succeed.

"Lowry, Doncic, THJ, Porzingis, Noel.   Burke, Brunson, Josh Green, Finney-Smith, Powell.   That's a pretty competitive team if they can get the deals done and Kristaps gets back to his best."
"It‚Äôs pretty prized but not that unusual. Klay, Danny Green, KCP, Gary Harris, Josh Richardson, Wes Matthews before the injury. The difference being that Lonzo is a way better passer than these guys. He‚Äôs a combo guard not a true SG."
Josh Green should get a run over him
"I feel so bad for Josh Green grand total of 10s of action that game, we haven't been able to see him yet."
Him and josh green are home boys as well.
Are Boomers still working out their rotation? Give Josh Green some minutes!
Just remembered Mannion and Josh Green were on a team together.  Would have been cool to see them square off for their countries
hoping to see some josh green minutes
More Josh Green
Epic 5 seconds for Josh Green!
More Reath and Josh Green and less Sobey and Landale pls.
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6.

Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
Maybe having Josh Green on the team will convince him that this is the Olympics and he balls out
"Also you know getting off of Al Horfords terrible contract for a great 3 and D wing in Danny Green and committing arguably the heist of the offseason last year by getting Seth Curry (a guy that averaged 21 on 79% TS in the Hawks series) for Josh Richardson who was space killer and played like 20 minutes total through games 5-7 of the Clippers series, netting unleashed MVP Embiid with all this spacing and a 1st seed finish  But continue"
We literally drafted Josh Green over Saddiq Bey.

"Luka v Josh Green, just as we mavs fans want"
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"
"Josh Green is a fantastic playmaker, not sure why the ball isn‚Äôt in his hands. He does these amazing mid jump passes hopefully we see it"
"Josh Green is a lockdown defender man, gonna be amazing for us"
Liking the hustle from Josh Green
I forgot about Josh Green. How has he been in the NBA?
JOSH GREEN IN THE GAME LETS GO!
"There‚Äôs still a ton of non-star NBA players in international teams right now.   Satoransky, Ntilikina, Batum, Luwawu-Cabarot, Fournier, Mills, Josh Green, Ingles, Thybulle, Exum, Baynes, Bonga, Wagner, Mannion, Gallinari, Melli, Okpala, Metu, Oni, Okafor, Okogie, Vincent, Nwora, Achiuwa, Campazzo, Deck, Vildoza, Hachimura, Cancar, Rubio, Marc Gasol and Juancho Hernangomez are all at the Olympics and on NBA rosters right now. That‚Äôs 32 guys who aren‚Äôt stars providing depth. Plus a bunch of guys who were very recently on NBA teams (Pau Gasol, Poirier, Abrines, Delly etc).   And there‚Äôs a bunch of others from countries that just didn‚Äôt make it. Depth is fine."
Josh green hopefully üí™
"I mean it's Daryl Morey, there's only a few guys that argument works for and he's definitely one of them. Came in last offseason and got us off Al Horford's contract for Danny Green and flipped Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. There's not many others I'd want to be our GM"
