"well it depends. for example, using this past game, i think Pop killed us against the grizzlies., because he didn't sub out LMA when he was getting DESTROYED by Morant, not even putting his arms up to contest. knowing that, he could have subbed him out for Jakob. he also kept in trey Lyles early in the game to put rudy gay at the 3. rudy's been good but that's not awesome for either of them. when you're having problems defensively, going with Devin Vassell would have probably helped more than Trey was gonna help on the boards.  so I say all that to say coaches have a huge impact on the game, whether it's the timing of timeouts, subs and rotations, or actually bring a playcalling genius. even the GOAT has days where he's like ""you know, fuck it, I'm willing to lose this game to see how this lineup holds up"" and some days where he makes nothing but good decisions and it still doesn't matter because the other team gets hot. so basically, it matters, but players are still the ones on the court."
ppl pretend like hes trying. its terrible. i wish we could trade him or waive him. id rather have trey lyles out there or eubanks even. theyd at least be near jokic.
"I don't think he'd even see minutes with the Spurs, he'd be like Trey Lyles with us"
It's good for the spurs but I'm kind of surprised Trey Lyles basically isn't in the spurs rotation anymore after starting last season. He has some offensive skills but he's too slow for a 4 nowadays and can't play center.
Trey Lyles
better than Trey Lyles?
yea this game was over once DeMar got 3 fouls  Trey Lyles minutes is a human white flag
"Lol Trey Lyles, the black Mitch McGary"
Mitchell for Trey Lyles
"Hey man, great post. Here are the best current Canadian players by province (unfortunately this only covers 4 provinces):  Ontario: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 21.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 6.2 APG, 50.5 FG% (Honorable mention : Jamaal Murray)  Quebec: Chris Boucher 16.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.5 BPG, 72.9 True Shooting % (Honorable mention : Lu Dort)   British Columbia: Brandon Clarke 13.2 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG  Saskatchewan: Trey Lyles  7.3 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 1.1 APG (Has only played 7 games so far so the above numbers are his career averages)"
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
and they ended up with Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon... oof
"We really like our young core(Lonnie, White, DJM, KJ, Vassell, jones) Most of us like Jakob but we’ve accepted that he is what he is, he will do well as a backup. We are all indifferent towards trey lyles. We’re all holding out on Luka, he’s young, and we don’t have much to go off of, but most of us are unimpressed with what he’s done"
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
Spurs can offer Trey Lyles and Luka Samanic
It turns out that swapping Demar DeRozan for Trey Lyles makes us a much worse team. Hope we can get a little more of an offense together before the next couple games.
"Fwiw, Grant was one of the few players to pass through here to have a negative net rating in lineups with Jokic. Grant, Torrey Craig, Mudiay, Trey Lyles and that’s about it. He’s positive with everyone else"
"In brief, offensively he's a better shooter from everywhere except at the rim (though even there Jokic is great). Jokic is a better passer which I think sort of goes without saying, both in terms of skill but also passing instincts and placement. Jokic also because of his touch and skill has a more versatile offensive game than Giannis. He can dominate a game with just passing and only scoring a few points, which I don't think Giannis can do. He can decide to dominate by just posting dudes up, or if that doesnt work, can face up and shoot or create from the post, top of the key, the elbow, or wherever. He literally is the Nuggets system in a way that even still I don't think Giannis is - in this way I compare him to Peyton Manning. From an outside perspective at least, the Bucks system seems to be a bit... my turn your turn, Giannis does a drive or PnR, then perhaps Khris Middleton runs a spread PnR, then Jrue (formerly Bled). I could be a bit wrong, and it's undoubtedly been highly effective in the regular season, but Giannis has obvious limitations on offense that even his otherworldly athletic ability hasnt been able to over come yet in the playoffs...  Which leads me to my next bit - Jokic consistently has improved each year, if in more marginal ways than Giannis. But I'm a bit concerned Giannis might be plateauing - it doesnt really seem like he's added anything substantive to his game this year so far, his touch from 3, midrange, and FTs isnt any better or worse than it was last year. Whereas Jokic more than anything, this year, looks just in command of the team and the game. His skills offensively are the same but he's transitioning into an even more active role dictating where he wants his teammates to go, what they need to do. Similarly, Jokic consistently grades out as one of the very best players in the NBA in the clutch - shooting something like 72% in the last two minutes of games and OT, while he also elevates his defense in those moments. In 33 playoff games, Jokic has also been incredible, averaging 25/11/7 on 55/42/84 shooting splits in 38 mpg (so he doesnt get played off the floor at all and only commits slightly less than 4 fouls per game), along with 1.1 steals and 0.8 bpg. Giannis we can remove his first playoff run I think - the last 4 years then, which is 37 playoff games, comparable to Jokic, Giannis averages... 25/11/5 on 55/32.5/63 splits, with 1.1 steals and 1.5 blocks. All this is to show that Jokic's game elevates in the playoffs and the clutch, while Giannis's has been great, but not quite as great as in the regular season.  Defensively of course Giannis is incredible (though I think somewhat poorly used by Bud at times - I don't understand his refusal to at least in the playoffs unleash Giannis as an isolation defender), he's a superior player to Jokic there in every way. Jokic isn't bad defensively, however, is my only point. I won't belabor it but the Nuggets always have graded out better with him on the floor than off defensively, in a whole host of metrics. Jokic is a good post defender, good positionally, smart, good rebounder, etc.  The last two points I have are simply - the game is about getting buckets, and longevity. Jokic I think, as an offensive system unto himself, gets buckets for himself and others at a rate that's literally as good as anyone in the game. Part of my evidence for this - there are only 3 players Jokic has ever played with who have been a net negative when paired with him, and one is Emmanuel Mudiay. The others? Trey Lyles and Jerami Grant. Two of those guys are *barely* NBA players. He just makes everyone he plays with better, for the most part, if they're at least competent. That's probably true of Giannis though too, in different ways. Defensively, and in terms of lightening the load offensively like Jokic. Which is why I mention longevity - Giannis blessedly hasnt had any injuries yet, really, but his game is predicated on athleticism, while Jokic's is not. On balance, my hunch is this means Jokic's game will age better than Giannis's. If he doesnt get bored or tired of playing, Jokic could play till he's 40 like Dirk did and still be effective offensively at least, considering his game is quite low impact. Meanwhile for Giannis the model is clearly LeBron - but LeBron is a better passer, always has been really... and LeBron really learned how to shoot at least well enough that defenses have to respect his shot. Giannis could do that still, but so far he's just been... well, a horrible shooter, every year except his rookie year. And his FT% has gotten worse every year too which doesn't bode well.   Damn I said I'd be brief but look at that, I wrote an essay."
"A lot of this is play style.  Last year, Belinelli, Trey Lyles, and Forbes were always drifting around the perimeter waiting for Derozan kickouts.  Now, Beli and Forbes are gone, and Lyles is halfway to China.  Dejounte, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker are actively getting buckets and driving, and Derozan is finding himself with a few wide-open threes.  The team is actively encouraging he and Aldridge to let it fly."

"Nice! Jalen gonna be great fo sure and I hope he will fit next to Ayton!  Kinda the same situation, we are insanely deep so it's really tough to play everyone. Trey Lyles was supposed to crack into the rotation but he played sooo bad in the Preseason that Pop isn't playing. Drew Eubanks, a G-League and promising role center, isn't seeing his minutes too with LMA playing. Pop is running a 9 Man rotation so it's really difficult but I hope, once White comes back, Pop uses a 10 Man Rotation with Vassell playing a bit.  Good Luck for the SZN! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧"
"Jerome Robinson, Ty Jerome, Nickeil Alexander Walker of those who still have chance to turn it around  Ante Zizic, Trey Lyles, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson of those who probably lost chance to turn it around  Dion Waiters, Michael Carter-Williams, Tyreke Evans and Michael Beasley of those who most definitely wasted their chances"
Trey Lyles... I completely forgot about that guy.
"He kinda has no choice atm. There is no gleague Luka Samanic, Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Keita Bapes Diop are all playing like shit and Derrick White is out but of course he has shown that he can be useful."
"Dtown Nuggets trading Donovan Mitchell to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. I guess you can add Rudy Gobert as well, since we drafted, then traded him for Erick Green and cash.smh The Nuggets really drafted and handed Utah both their franchise players.smh I often think about what that starting line up would’ve looked like with Murray, Mitchell, MPJ, Joker and Gobert.lol Bol bol off the bench. Wild."
"Yes it does. Because the situations have been the same. The Raptors have had the some of best benches in the league for years. The Spurs also have had a better bench compared to other benches vs starting lineups vs other starting lineups. Trey Lyles, Bruh Forbes, Aldridge who are all liabilities defensively aren’t going to help an already off ball defensive weak link in DeMar. DeMar may not have as much “impact” as the higher tier players but he is not ineffective. He has been at least the 2nd best player in Toronto by a wide margin those last few seasons when he was an all star. In San Antonio he is the best player on the Spurs."

you saw trey lyles mate
Objection: Trey Lyles
time to simp for Trey Lyles
"I guess they were right, DeRozan shouldnt be an all star. Trey Lyles should have been though"
Trey Lyles is gonna use this game to justify his shot selection for the next 20 games lmao
"move over julius, trey lyles is the king of new york"
i would like to know what happened to Trey Lyles  this isnt normal
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
i thought trey lyles would be part of a denver nuggets big 3...
"I remember when Book was coming off the bench for that crazy Kentucky team with KAT, the Harrison brothers, Trey Lyles, and WCS.  I thought he was just rated highly since Kentucky was such a powerhouse lol, it’s safe to say that I was way off."
"We drafted Devin Vassell at 11 this year. Rudy Gay was drafted 8th, Jakob Poeltl was drafted 9th and Trey Lyles was drafted 12th"
"all I can say is people were clowning Rudy here for getting posterized (I think by Demarcus Cousins if I remember? Someone threw something nasty down on him) like ""blah blah blah how is this guy a one way player when he lets stuff like this past him"" and no one talks about the fact that Trey Lyles would sidestep to avoid that exact shit. I'd rather have Rudy every day lol"
Nuggets really traded down from donovan Mitchell for trey lyles and the 24th pick which was OG just for him to get picked 23rd
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."
Crazy how the Jazz turned their two biggest whiffs into two of the biggest home runs. Drafted Exum at 5 overall and traded him (and a couple seconds) for Clarkson. And drafting Trey Lyles instead of Devin Booker turned into Mitchell.
"“Trey Burks” wasn’t in the Mitchell trade, it was Trey Lyles"
The Denver Nuggets traded Rudy Gobert for a 2nd round pick (Erick Green) and cash considerations.  And then they traded Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better.

"Well Atlanta’s young as well so we could send some young players. Probably Lonnie and a protected first? If they want a backup big, we have Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, and Luka Samanic (it would hurt to lose Lonnie &amp; Samanic)  If they want veterans for a playoff push, I could see adding expirings from Atlanta and giving Rudy Gay over for added offense and shooting. Idk if they’d WANT Aldridge, but he certainly is available in any capacity.  I’d nix any deal involving DeRozan, Mills, or our other young players, though, and just try and sign him in the offseason.   If Atlanta wants to make a playoff push and need backup shooting, I could see a way we incorporate Rudy Gay to the trade and get expiring back as well. God forbid we"
"if their was more time left we wouldn’t be playing Keita Bates-Diop, Quinndary Weatherspoon, Trey Lyles, Lonnie Walker, and Drew Eubanks if they had a real chance to comeback lol"
"Trey Lyles played nine minutes, got one rebound and went -23"
Trey Lyles for Gobert and Mitchell
Trey Lyles seething rn.
"Lordy this reminds me of the Nuggets. There are just TWO players who have played with Jokic, ever, who have a negative net rating with him. Trey Lyles and Emmanuel Mudiay."
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
"One good way to look at this would be: ""How many players from the spurs roster would still be in the NBA in 3 seasons? Versus the Warriors roster?""  You can't tell me that a supporting cast of Trey Lyles, Rudy Gay, Mills, White is worse than Damion lee, a washed Bazemore, JTA and Mulder.    Kerr doesn't have  a goal to make a middling push to the playoff - hence this stressful period of trying to get everyone to adapt to the next season's game. Whoever can adapt well will make it to the next season and the rest will be cut."
"Nah, nurk was starting for denver before they traded him to portland. I cant exactly remember the sequence of events for mitchell, and definitely dont remember them around gobert, but i think denver picked mitchell *then* traded him (for trey lyles and tyler lydon?) opposed to vice versa. I know they couldve had the trade worked out and picked at utahs discretion, but not the way i remember it."
"Man....  KAT, Booker, Trey Lyles, WCS, Harrison twins"
"Not necessarily true.  Miami could have put forward a Meyers Leonard/Kelly Olynk package.  Two expirings that weren't giving them much value (Olynk has been pretty bad this year).    Perhaps Miami would want to go for Aldridge as a backup big behind Bam.  Spurs would be happy to get Olynk back for the stretch run, since they were sorely needing any sort of depth in the frontcourt - way too much Drew Eubanks, Trey Lyles, annd Rudy Gay at the center position."
Yo Bulls.  We'll give you Lonnie Walker and Trey Lyles for Patrick Williams.  I want Williams and Vassel to join together again.
*looks at Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles*  “Well of course **you** wouldn’t be in any danger”
"The ripple effects of not just taking OG are insane.   If we take him:  A) Trey Lyles doesn't lose us a couple games, we make the playoffs and miss out on MPJ B) Or we land MPJ but then don't need to trade for Grant and have our 2019 pick AND don't need to trade for Gordon  At least we got Morris in round 2. I understand what Tim (our GM) was trying to do-- repeat 2014 when he landed Harris + Nurk for the pick that became Doug McDermett. It just failed spectacularly because we traded too far back.  But considering his hit rate (Jokic / Nurk / Harris / Murray / Beasley / MPJ / Zeke (looks like a steal) / Hampton (landed us Gordon) / Morris and even Cancar   Versus the misses of: Mudiay / Lydon...  It's really hard to complain"
Trey Lyles: 1-time Indiana Mr. Basketball  Donovan Mitchell: 0-time Indiana Mr. Basketball  It shouldn't be an argument by now. Lyles will always be better than Mitchell.
Underpaid? They gave up the GOAT Trey Lyles
"This is a great description of what the Jazz did to get Mitchell.  Jazz were picking in the 20's, offered Trey Lyles, their own pick, a future first to move up for Mitchell.  Hindsight is 20:20, but the Jazz clearly underpaid for Mitchell, yet to move up to the middle of the draft, it takes a lot less than what it takes to get the first pick."
"50 shots, 62.4% usage, amazing to drop 60 no matter how many shots you take but he really did highjack the offense.  That Jazz team was starting Shelvin Mack, Trey Lyles, Jeff Withey and Rodney Hood.  That's the post-2003 Kobe tradeoff, he can get you a decent shot whenever, but he didn't really do much else at a very high level.  Frobe could rebound and defend but those skills waned with time.  As maybe the best tough shot maker of all-time I don't want to diminish his legacy too much, you have to make tough shots against playoff defenses to win big games, but even peak Kobe he didn't bring much else to the table other than his (admittedly breath-taking and very valuable) isolation mid-range game."
"As long as Trey Lyles never plays again, that's fine."
"This year no College team is nearly dominant enough. I do think the 2009-2010 Kentucky team has a chance to hang with a bad NBA team.   PG: John Wall SG: Eric Bledsoe  SF: Darius Miller  PF: Patrick Patterson  C: Demarcus Cousins  Depth is an issue but that starting lineup is solid.   The 2014-2015 Kentucky team is also a possibility. You had Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Trey Lyles, Karl Anthony Towns, and Willie Caulie Stein starting with Devin Booker, Tyler Ullis, and Dakari Johnson off the bench.   Not saying they would win, but saying they’re maybe in the “on a random night” proximity."
... I literally listed the Bucks as a team that made a major fuck up. You can point to a bunch of mistakes those other teams made too. Nuggets traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Traded Beasley despite him going off when he got starter minutes and being an extremely athletic lights out shooter. Blazers traded up for Zach Collins who's mediocre at best when he's actually healthy instead of staying back and being able to draft OG Anunoby and John Collins (both high upside players who were projected as good picks). Jazz are building around Mitchell/Gobert as their core which isn't their fault but also just not good enough to win a championship.
Don't worry. Aldridge was legit the second worst player on the Spurs getting minutes this year. Dude got outshined by every player. Damn Trey Lyles making Aldridge look bad
"Canada  PG - Jamal Murray SG - Shai Gil-Alexander SF - RJ Barratt PF - Trey Lyles/Brooks C - Thompson  Bench - Clarke, Dort , Olynyk, Wiggins, Birch, Alex-Walker"
That bad?  Spurs' big man rotation is one of the worst in the league behind Poeltl (Drew Eubanks and Trey Lyles).
Replace Trey Lyles with Trey Songz
Trey lyles was born in Saskatoon or atleast in the SK area
"How does Trey Lyles post a -8 in a 27 point victory where the opponent scored only 77 points.  Oh, that's right...by being Trey Lyles."
"If last nights game is any indication, Rudy Gay and Trey Lyles now playing a good portion of our backup center minutes. Yup we're thin."
"He always managed to do well against the Pels, especially when AD was still there. I thought the bench role would fit well cause we could use his scoring off the bench. The weird resurgence recently of Trey Lyles looking good and Luka showing some flashes meant Aldridge was eating up minutes that could be better suited for those 2"
"You're right, Spurs don't generally make mid-season trades, so no one on our sub is holding our breath on it.  I doubt we make any roster changes at all tbh. We'll probably just adjust our lineups and rotations a bit more and wait for everyone to get healthy.  But some sleeper picks for potential trades are imo Rudy Gay and to a lesser extent Trey Lyles. The Heat were apparently interested in Rudy since they need to fill their PF depth, and both Rudy and Trey can do that plus their are fairly cheap."
"We're shopping our vets who're on expiring deals like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge and potentially Trey Lyles as well.  I'm not expecting any of them to be getting traded, but those guys are on the table.   Spurs on in the middle of a rebuild, so makes sense to shop our vets. Patty and Demar have been excellent for us, so doubt Spurs will move them unless some irresistible offer comes along. Rudy and Trey Lyles are pretty useful pieces for teams looking to bolster their wing depth. Lamarcus is washed atm, so doubt we'll move him."
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
"No there are a few international players as well that don't fit the NBA mold but for some reason do phenomenal on the world stage. Case #1 Pick Anthony Bennett, didn't do well in the NBA but plays well on FIBA stage. Phillip Scrubb and his brother are good.  But this year:  PG // SG // SF // PF // C  Murray // Shai // RJ // Boucher // Olynyk  Brooks // Wiggins // Dort // Clarke // Tristan Thompson   Cory Joseph // Trey Lyles // Alexander-Walker // Dwight Powell // Anthony Bennett   I mean this is a grezzy team. US is a monster will take years to compete with, but sold lock for top 4 in the world with this roster. Even 2nd is possible."
Yeah but at what cost?? We had to give up Trey Lyles!! And some other guy I can’t remember!!
"yes, there was a lot of hype for this Canadian Generation which was supposed to have Wiggins, Bennett, Tristan Thompson, Stauskas, Tyler Ennis, Olynyk and Trey Lyles all in their primes for the 2020 Olympics and was getting hyped a serious future threat to the USA. It definitely didn't quite live up to the expectations. Reminds me a bit of when people claimed England had a ""golden generation"" in soccer and they ended up failing to qualify for Euros in their primes..."
Better than Trey Lyles?
Trey Lyles is as important to the previous Spurs championships as Mike James is for the CSKA previous Euroleague wins... that's the point. The coach as CSKA is much more important than a guy who has been there for 1.5 seasons and got suspended lol
"Lol Are you lost, buddy? You’re the one that brought up Trey Lyles in response to me mocking the importance of coaching."
"Bruh, you literally just asked whether Trey Lyles was the Spurs best player during multiple runs, he said he wasn't and you went back to saying how the coach means nothing..."
"It was Trey Lyles who went nuclear that game IIRC, but you never know when the best Luka in the league might show up (seriously Pop get your head around it, is he part of the rotation or not? FFS)"
Trey Lyles was the Spurs best player during their multiple runs?
"Bro this is like if Trey Lyles got in a fight with Pop, who do you think the Spurs choose..."
"I'm surprised we're even mediocre with all the shit we had to do. Our big 3 retired, we lost a top 10 guy in the league because he forced himself out after not playing for like the whole year, while doing that we gave up one of the best 3&amp;D guys in the league for some reason, got back DeRozan, Poetl, and  29th pick that turned into Keldon Johnson, then we traded away one of our best 3 point shooters because we thought we'd get Morris WHO FUCKING BACKED OUT after we had basically been told he was in, picked up Demarre Carroll who literally did jack shit and left for nothing, picked up Trey Lyles who's been woefully inconsistent, and let Aldridge walk for nothing at all (but then he retired so that one turns out alright)   But man, this team just keeps fighting and refuses to die lol"
i mean we said the same thing bout trey lyles and he was alright rebounder when he played meaningful minutes
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."
"Bro I found out today that Denver traded Mitchell for the #24 pick and Trey Lyles, I understand they already had Murray and you can't assume a player will turn out the same in a different scenario but you can't help but say Damn."
"Team Canada is looking distressingly stacked with NBA players too, although I'm not sure who has confirmed 100% yet. Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, RJ, CoJo, Khem, Wiggins, Olynyk, Trey Lyles... If I'm their teams' coaches, especially  the guys who played into this postseason, I'm worrying about the damage to their bodies by the end of the summer. It's all just been too intensive since the restart last season."
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
"Hey now. Fuck all sounds way better than Trey Lyles, Tyler Lydon, Erick Green, and cash."
Trey Lyles used to be my neighbor. He likes chicken wings. And that's all I have to say about that.
Imagine if Denver didn't trade Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.   Mitchell-Murray-Porter Jr-Gordon-Jokic
WHERE IS TREY LYLES?!
"Nah, if we hadn't traded for the pick they'd have taken OG Anunoby. Who would'be still been better for them than Trey Lyles lol."
Bruh he's talking about Trey Lyles obviously
Fuck Trey Lyles
Don’t forget to also do your division mates a solid by sending them two All-Star players for Trey Lyles and some cash.
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
"Kanter talked shit on his way out. That's why. He was loved when he was here, but when it was obvious Gobert was the future &amp; Utah traded Kanter away, he handled it like a little bitch &amp; took cheap shots at us.  Idk why?  He made way more money than he would have if Utah kept him &amp; sat him behind the obviously superior Rudy Gobert. But that's beside the point.   Point is, Jazz fans are intense &amp; very passionate about anyone  who ever makes the roster.   They'll love you no matter what for as long as u live, IF you rep for them, &amp; leave with class (see: Millsap, Alec Burks, Favors, Crowder, Neto, Matthews, Korver, AK47), but if you lie, cheat,  swindle or disrespect on your way out,  you'll never be forgiven (see: Hayward, Kanter, Trey Lyles, Mark Jackson, Derek Fisher, Raja Bell, Boozer)"
Trey Lyles
The Mitchell one was the worst because all we got was Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon.....  Brutal
"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
"Then to make it worse, we drafted Trey Lyles. Even as a Jazz fan, it got confusing."
"His defense looks bad, yes, but he's having to be the 2nd biggest guy on his team because the Spurs have been so guard-heavy. Their power forwards have been Trey Lyles who had to play center, LA who had to play a lot of center, and Rudy Gay who wasn't really a power forward either. His defense was ok the last year in Toronto where he got to consistently play SG/be the second-smallest guy (and they also had OG Anunoby)."
"If you want to include trades, the Jazz got Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Jake Lydon."
"Late but the way the roster was constructed last season they DESPERATELY need a stretch 4! Early on Pop decided to glue Trey Lyles to the bench which left Lamarcus, Eubanks and a young player named Luka Samanic who was never going to get decent minutes.   So Lamarcus gets bought out,Luka spends a lot of time in the G league, and Lyles is riding the bench. They signed Gorgui Dieng to mitigate our lack of depth but it was still a glaring hole on our roster.  So now that the Spurs have a lot of cap space to work with I can see why some feel John Collins may be that piece the Spurs need. He spaces the floor and can put up some good numbers and he’s still really young. Add in their semi high draft pick I can see a guy like Kai Jones (hopefully) falling to the Spurs, however another glaring issue for the Spurs is their atrocious 3pt shooting so they just may opt for a pure shooter in the draft"
"I agree - $31M/yr is clearly overpaying for Collins, but I think it might happen - either an offer from elsewhere or Atlanta matching.  Depending on what happens with Derozan, Mills, Gay and Lyles, the Spurs should have about $50M in cap space this summer, without a big FA market to spend that on, or any rookie contracts that will need huge extensions for the time being.  I would rather the Spurs target a few guys in the 15Mish range, whoi are quality starters without breaking any future flexibility, and are easily tradeable if a contender comes knocking.   But it wouldn't surprise me if they go after someone like Collins. (I would rather overpay Collins, than I would Lauri for example). And anything well below the Max is going to be immediately matched by Atlanta. Is Collins worth 25? Can you justify paying an extra 5M if that money can't really help your team otherwise?  It also wouldn't surprise me if Atlanta match a max offer. They clearly don't want to pay him close to that. But if they let him walk, there's not really much room to replace him. You can match the offer and still have the 9.5M MLE to play with. Or you let him walk and have about 15M cap room, with no MLE this year, and then no future cap space because you'll be maxing Trey Young soon. It's a tough position to be in, but it's hiw the cap is designed."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"I think it also really hurt us that we had only 1 real big but having more roster continuity would goa long way. 2 TT, Birch, Boucher or Olynyk being available would have changed things significantly when we gave up size almost every game with Dwight Powell and Trey Lyles as our bigs"
"I recall Coach Cal got criticized for putting too much faith in the Harrison twins.  They were older and incumbent but Trey Lyles and Booker were more talented.  Considering that Kentucky team was undefeated until the semifinals, I think the they were trying not to rock the boat.  Truly a big what if scenario."
Trey lyles reportedly asked for a trade from the Spurs last year.
"I disagree with what you are saying. Posting a SBNATION article about the refs from 2017 which has more to do with the divide between Euroleague governing body and FIBA governing body doesn't prove anything. Keep in mind in my post i'm including Euroleague as well since it's the same type of basketball.   &gt;While there isn't star treatment of the NBA and they don't call the bullshit lean-in fouls that the NBA doe  So, thanks for agreeing with my point...   &gt; you have to pick off a pass to make a steal in FIBA basketball. There's no stripping an opposing player or pressuring them on-ball.  Not remotely true. Not much else to say other than what you are saying is false, i've been watching basketball for decades.   &gt;hat Trey Lyles unsportsmanlike in the Canada vs. Czech Republic game was a shining example.  Something tells me you only watch FIBA when Canada plays. Yes, that was a bad call by one ref, matter of fact i've never seen a similar call in FIBA before. So that's one instance of a horrible ref , even during the discussion of the play one of the refs was correctly saying that it wasn't unsportmanlike , for whatever reason the other ref kept insisting it was. You bring up one instance when i'm talking about the totality of the referring. I even made sure to point out in my comment that yes, horrible calls also happen in FIBA much like they do in the NBA. But im talking about the officiating overall.   &gt;Lastly, any aggressive on-ball defense is a reach, and going for a board on a boxout is an immediate over-the-back.  Again...that's simply not true. You are just talking.   &gt; I think the reason the game is more aesthetically pleasing has a lot more to do with team personnel playing together for 5-10 years and offensive schemes being more team-oriented  lol these are takes that people who don't actually consistently watch FIBA and Euroleague basketball make. Majority of these teams havent been together for multiple years. This isn't the case. Many teams have new players in and out every tournament and in the Euroleague especially rarely does a team remain the same for over 3 years, yet the game style remains the same."
"&gt;Fouls are another. FIBA basketball just overall allows more physicality and contact than the NBA and actually favors defenses more than it does offenses , while in the NBA it's exactly the opposite.  Wow. As someone who watches both, I completely and entirely disagree with this. I think that's how the Nigeria v USA game played out but  I'm actually shocked that you would even make the suggestion that that's routine. [FIBA refereeing is notoriously awful and inconsistent.](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/8/30/16225128/eurobasket-2017-referees-fiba-nba-bad)  While there isn't star treatment of the NBA and they don't call the bullshit lean-in fouls that the NBA does, you have to pick off a pass to make a steal in FIBA basketball. There's no stripping an opposing player or pressuring them on-ball. If they see blood, it's unsportsmanlike and the team is going to the line. That Trey Lyles unsportsmanlike in the Canada vs. Czech Republic game was a shining example. Lastly, any aggressive on-ball defense is a reach, and going for a board on a boxout is an immediate over-the-back.  Anyone who is just beginning to watch FIBA ball will see the truth about referees in no time.  I think the reason the game is more aesthetically pleasing has a lot more to do with team personnel playing together for 5-10 years and offensive schemes being more team-oriented. I think the refereeing is at its best inconsistent and at its worst, head-scratchingly horrible."
Trey Lyles had actually played really well in Utah that previous year. I was excited to get him in that trade. Hindsight is 20/20 but in no way did he look like a bust
"While I don’t think I’d call it the worst all time but one big one I’m surprised no ones mentioned is the Nuggets/Jazz Donavan trade.   They traded #13 for #24 (Tyler Lydon) and Trey Lyles. Neither have remained on the Nuggets and neither did much while there, while Mitchell has obviously become an all star caliber player and even led the Jazz to the number one seed this season.   Even if you wanna make the argument that it wasn’t a guarantee Denver takes Mitchell anyways, I still don’t think trading a lottery pick for a late pick and Trey Lyles who was looking like a bust in Utah was good value anyways, making the trade questionable even without the fact that the pick became a legit number one option for a western conference rival."
Probably not the worst but Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles for Donovan Mitchell was robbery
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
"&gt; But chemistry is for sure the biggest element. People underestimate how far above their level some international teams play just solely due to how familiar the players are with each other. Understanding the tendencies of your teammates as well as just having that deeper trust makes everyone play better.  I know a while back USA Hockey recognized this and put together a US National Development Team Program that trains and plays together to build chemistry. Not everyone wants to take part in it but a number of the top players from USA do. It's paid off quite well at the World Juniors level as the Americans have won 4 gold medals there since 2010 whereas previously they never won anything. I wonder if Canada can consider doing something like that with high school players. It seems like a lot of them jump to the US for their high school ball (RJ Barrett went to Montverde, Wiggins went to Huntington, Trey Lyles moved to Indianapolis, Brandon Clarke played in Arizona.. although in his case he might have grown up in the States to begin with) so they have no familiarity with each other."
"tbf they were our 2 best players.  along with NAW and Dort.  Dwight sucks though tbf we were asking him to play a role he doesn't typically play since we were so undersized, and Trey Lyles really has no business playing professional basketball at a high level."
It’s crazy that Trey Lyles can’t guard a guy who plays in the Japanese Second Division.
Trey lyles
what? That Canada team was stacked...you seem to have very little respect for Trey Lyles...sad.
Yooo Trey Lyles reaction even got me pumped 😂 love it
"Nah, Canada called a time out after that. Trey Lyles had the final shot, he missed obv."
"What’s worse is that it’s literally because we couldn’t field a 7 footer.  Their entire strategy was just dump it to the big guy then kick it out for threes, and our choices were to double and concede three point shots, or stay at home and let the likes of Trey Lyles and Andrew Nicholson guard 7 footers in the post one on one (Powell got in foul trouble).  It’s just so frustrating. If we even had a Center like Aaron Baynes we would have won this game by 15 points.  Y’all don’t understand the pain of watching Canada Basketball year after year with so much of your best talent not playing.   I just realized the Raptors won a championship before Canada even *qualified* for the Olympics again since 2000. Argh.  Edit: fully aware Baynes isn’t Canadian, I’m just saying Birch Thompson Boucher and Olynyk were watching from their couches as Trey Lyles got toasted by someone I’m confident Aaron Baynes could have shut down"
"Ah, I get Olynyk reasoning.  Very unfortunate, since we got nothing offensively from Trey Lyles and Powell.   Forgot about Brandon Clarke as well. He's definitely better on offense than those two."
Yeah bro but it’s funnier on Reddit website to say they traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles
How much Trey Lyles average? I know VC could double that right now
he gave cory joseph and trey lyles too many minutes... also decided to put dort back in the game so late in the 4th when he shouldve done it earlier
"You can't convince me Trey Lyles didn't become a Czech citizen before this game. Pretty sure he left Schilb open all game too. Great Effort by RJ, Wiggins, Dort and NAW. The refs def didn't help either."
ahh the trey lyles special
"As a Greek, I don't know how to feel about this.    But why on god's name do you run a play for freaking Trey Lyles? The play was very well run but still you don't want him to take that shot"
Trey Lyles is skill-less bro i hope the Spurs cut him immediately
Trusting final shot to Trey Lyles lol.
Trey Lyles is so fucking ass
How the hell does Trey Lyles get the last shot wtf
Trey lyles is gonna get way less high fives and apologies when he bumps into someone in Canada
I’m not even Canadian and I want to punch trey lyles in the mouth
Trey Lyles is a free throw merchant with no actual basketball skill i’m sorry
"Trey Lyles taking the last shot?!"
I’m not even Canadian and I want to punch trey lyles in the mouth
Fraud Canadian Trey Lyles
OF COURSE FUCKING TREY LYLES TOOK THE LAST SHOT LMAO
Fuck Trey lyles
trey lyles trying to make canada lose but wiggins said NO
Trey Lyles is my new least favorite player
fucking trey lyles
Yo Trey Lyles please quit shooting
"Trey Lyles was pretty awful, Powell wasn't bad. RJ/Wiggins/Dort is a great trio of athletic wings"
"Cory Joseph, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell"
"CoJo, RJ, Wiggs, Trey lyles and Dwight Powell"
Trey Lyles??? He's more like the foreign Draymond with his elite passing and ability to switch onto guards and play small ball 5. He was so big for the 7 seconds or less Suns and the championship Spurs.
I feel Batum is more athletic.  Diaw is like a foreign Trey Lyles.
Trey Lyles complained about Quin for the intensity of his practices.  I suppose the players you have probably also matter.  Indy might not have the most coachable roster.
"Also - Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris, Desmond Bane, and Trey Lyles. Carsen Edwards isn't from Indiana."
Huge turning point that night.  Our GM wanted Frank Kaminsky or Trey Lyles lol
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"Ah yes, age 25 veteran Trey Lyles lol"
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
Trey Lyles…. the pain never ends
How tf trey lyles go ahead of book??
Isn’t trey lyles on the Spurs.
Ben Simmons and a second round pick for Trey Lyles  Who says no
and Trey Lyles...
"Notable players drafted ahead of Devin Booker in 2015: Jahlil Okafor, Willie Cauley-Stein, Mario Hezonja, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles"
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"Above Trey Lyles, below MJ."
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
the trey lyles return? idk if we need another undersized PF
Trey Lyles and Okafor for Bol Bol?
"Lol, trey Lyles arc incoming"
"If everybody is healthy and chooses to play for you guys you would be silver medal favorites imo with a chance of upsetting USA for gold.  You’ve got Murray/SGA/Brooks/Wiggins/Olynyk   Then Cory Joseph/Dort/RJ/Boucher/Birch  And that’s still leaving off some solid guys like Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell, Oshae Brisset, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  That’s a lot of talent, and if they commit to the three year plan then they’re for sure strong contenders"

"And booker didn’t even start. That team also had Trey lyles, Wiley Cayley Stein, and Tyler ulis"
And for Trey lyles &amp; the 24th pick smh terrible
Anyone could tell Trey Lyles wasn't going to be shit he had been in the league a couple seasons at that point and hadn't done anything. He's not athletic and he didn't have anything he was good at. its not like he got hurt and it derailed his career or anything. He was the fourth best big on the jazz that year. So save you snarky attitude nephew every team makes bad choices. Grow up
Its crazy to think that they should have been on the same team. Trading Mitchell for Trey Lyles and some dude that isn't in the league anymore might be one of the worst trades of the last decade.
"I rushed myself on Trey Lyles on hard, dang. Pretty easy outside of that."
5/6 on Hard... Screw you Trey Lyles!!!
"I will always believe that if Khem Birch (or Tristan Thompson) were on Canada's team this summer, we would've qualified for the Olympics.  Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles and Andrew Nicholson are fine players, but none of them are know for their defence.  We were abused down low in all of the games.  A tough, physical post defender would've changed everything."
If our best players can play I don't see why not. We had Trey Lyles take a shot with our lives on the line that tells you all you need to know about our roster this year
Dudes play out of position in college all the time.  Karl Towns played PF.  Trey Lyles played SF.  College programs are usually about collecting the best players they can get and playing them regardless of fit because high end recruits get the minutes.  Can't always go by college.

Just signed Trey Lyles
"I don't think DET has done that bad. We're still paying Blake's contract this upcoming year so the amount of cap we had to play with was less than 18m I believe. We got back CoJo at a good price (played really well with us last year), signed Olynyk who can shoot and play backup at either the 4 or the 5, and got PF depth with a cheap Trey Lyles deal. No splashes but I don't think we botched it either. Next summer is shaping up to be an all-time free agent class and we will have close to 50 million in cap space to make moves with."
"Trey Lyles, he got a contract"
Was that the same episode where trey lyles complained about how hard Utahs practices were?
"2016 draft to present? I mean, I think we're the only team that drafted two All-Stars, and Rob Williams isn't half bad either. Nuggets technically drafted Murray, Mitchell, and MPJ, although they probably shouldn't get credit for immediately trading Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  I think you're overrating the value of those Hawks picks a bit— getting Trae was great, but a lot of those players haven't proven anything yet."
Best I can do is Trey Lyles s&amp;t
Mitchell for Trey Lyles and pick 24. Oof
Nuggets also traded Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.
"The Tyler Lydon pick in 2017. While he was drafted 24th, Denver had eyes on OG Anunoby, and traded back from the 13th spot (which became Donovan Mitchell) to 24, picked up Trey Lyles from Utah as the compensation to move down, then watched OG go 23rd to the Raptors. Lydon was out of the league in 2 years and Lyles was nothing more than an end of bench guy. Yuck."
Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon or Rudy Gobert for Erick Green and Cash considerations
Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles says hello
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"One or two players change an entire perspective of an organization. For example if Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell weren't so good, I am sure people would be saying the Utah Jazz are bad at developing and/or drafting players after they had Kanter, Trey Burke, Trey Lyles etc for a while. If the Kings drafted Luka, him along with Fox would have change the entire perspective of the Kings. The Spurs have been so good for so long so they get a lot of leeway because they don't get high round picks so we really don't know and they hit it big with Kawhi. If Spurs had the 4th or 5th pick in the 2013 draft for example, I wonder who they would have picked and if that player would have turned out to be a game changer."
"Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Trey Lyles, JJJ, etc. There were a bunch of NBA guys there."
"Timmy is a top 10 (at worst probably top 8) player of all time. So its not like it matters THAT much.  Its just that I dont like how the Spurs basically were so concerned about the ""best 4 of all time"" moniker that they waited until LMA came to call Timmy a center (and probably did it because Aldridge himself hated to be called a center because they did the same with him when he was playing with Trey Lyles)"
"I’ve always envisioned myself if I were an NBA as a power forward that can shoot but do other things, sort of like if Trey Lyles were good lol. I would probably want a team that has a good role for me that was in contention. Maybe being a backup to Jimmy Butler or getting minutes for a team like the Suns or Mavericks"
Trey Lyles
"idk about that these are just the top 14 behind LeBron  2. Anthony Davis – Los Angeles Lakers, PF/C  3. Ben Simmons – Philadelphia 76ers, PG  4. Trae Young – Atlanta Hawks, PG  5. John Wall – Washington Wizards, PG  6. Eric Bledsoe – Milwaukee Bucks, PG  7. Draymond Green – Golden State Warriors, PF  8. Miles Bridges – Charlotte Hornets, SF  9.

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope – Los Angeles Lakers, SG  14. Tristan Thompson – Cleveland Cavaliers, PF/C  15. Trey Lyles – San Antonio Spurs, SF"
"Let’s keep going down the line Jordan Clarkson, Trey Lyles, Eric Bledsoe, Darius Garland, Talen Horton Tucker, Dion Waiters…a homeless person could have done those right?"
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"Holy shit, I would have a chance to meet Trey Lyles?"
"I disagree. I don't think he will be in the rotation, but it would be dumb to give him away for nothing right now. He could certainly get minutes over Trey Lyles, especially when we're clearly going to be bad anyway."
Trading Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and the pick that became Tyler Lydon because you think you’re gonna get OG Anunoby later is peak NuggLyfe. We also drafted Gobert and traded him to the Jazz.   Utah owes their entire franchise to Nuggets incompetence.
Nuggets drafted Donavan Mitchell and traded him for Trey Lyles
TIL Trey Lyles is Canadian
That’s not even the worst Jazz related trade we’ve had this decade. We traded the pick that would become Donovan Mitchell for Trey fuckin Lyles. Now that’s one that keeps me up at night
Then they did the Jazz a solid again by trading Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles
"As a Jazz fan, there are a few that come to mind that could end up looking this bad for other teams.  Dante Exum and 2nd round picks for Jordan Clarkson seems like the Jazz made off with it considering what has come of Clarkson and Exum  The other two are the Nuggets getting a pick and Trey Lyles back for Donovan Mitchell's draft rights and the Nugs sending Rudy Gobert's draft rights for a second and cash."
"He ruined summer league for me. I wanted to see our other players, lyles kept treating it like the trey show dominating the ball suppressing everyone else"
"What exactly does Trey Lyles offer? Like, what's the idea there? He's a decent floor spacer? Is that it?"
TIL Trey Lyles plays for the Pistons. [I’ll never forget his comments after being traded from Utah lol](https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)
I remember when Bill Simmons said he wouldn’t pay Trey Lyles the minimum wage and Spurs fans were up in arms
"Oof, Trey Lyles minutes are ROUGH buddy sorry you gotta suffer through them"
We could really use him. Plus give him Trey Lyles minutes. Please.
does trey lyles still play?
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
Olympic Trey Lyles was not
"Kentucky has had its fair share of wash-out and flop one-and-dones over the past decade too - Brandon Knight, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marquis Teague, Archie Goodwin, Trey Lyles, Skal Labissiere, Kevin Knox, Jarred Vanderbilt, Ashton Hagans, Kahlil Whitney. They've had a bunch of guys who left after their Sophomore season that flopped or did nothing in the league too - Aaron Harrison, Andrew Harrison, Dakari Johnson, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Briscoe, Wenyen Gabriel, EJ Montgomery. All of those guys were top 20 HS prospects once upon a time."
&gt; Trey Lyles fucking sucks  Agree
Trey Lyles fucking sucks   Randle turned it on what a baller
Nuggets traded the Donovan Mitchell pick to Utah for Trey Lyles and a pick that became Tyler Lydon. Tyler. Lydon.
"Too early but I’m liking our bench of   Cory Joseph  Josh jackson Hamidou Diallo Trey Lyles Kelly Olynyk  3 of these guys shoot the three at a solid % while Cojo is good at running the unit along with both Josh and Hami being good cutters and defenders. Not to mention Cojo, Lyles and KO got good synergy being they played for the Canadian National team."
"Yeah but they must've had a scouting report on him and knew that he was a reasonable pick within the range. It's not like they had nothing on Mitchell. They looked at his scouting report, knew he would be around that range and decided to take Tyler Lydon 24th and Trey Lyles.  I'm not trying to say something like they could've taken Draymond because he was a second round pick or Pascal Siakam because he was picked 27th the next year. They knew all the data around him, he was reasonably expected to go within their range and chose to take two mediocre players instead.  Of course, you can make excuses about fit with Gary Harris but ultimately, they're not going into a draft without a scouting report on every possible option."
There's always trey lyles lol
"HERE COMES TYLER LYDON   Seriously the 2017 draft is pretty much my only gripe with TC, couldve taken OG Anunoby at 13 but instead traded down and ended up with Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon who were both huge negatives.  Pretty much all of his other picks I've liked but that draft was horrible"
"Yeah I used to go to Bros every Friday and Saturday night and I would see Gary Harris, Trey Lyles, and Myles Turner there all the time in the off-season. Indy barely has a night scene and they closed a lot of the bars on Georgia Street"
"I just want Detroit to swing a deal for a dependable big man who is a tough rebounder. Easier said than done, I know.  I think at the moment we're projecting a bench power forward combination of Josh Jackson and Trey Lyles. Yikes. Today's game against San Antonio was good but there were more than a few plays where boards went begging because of a lack of hustle."
About as well as playoff Trey Lyles.
Trey Lyles and another pick...which they wanted to use on OG Anunoby. He would have been a great fit on the Nuggets and would have made the trade look less bad...but he was taken the pick before the one they got back in the trade.  They outsmarted themselves just a little bit on that one and ate it.
And Denver had the pick where Mitchell was drafted and traded it to the Jazz for Trey Lyles!
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf
Worst draft decision he made was trading donovan mitchell for trey lyles
Trey Lyles.   That year he played some for denver he got some playing time and looked good.  Also I saw nurk becoming jokic lite on offense with way better defense and hes not that.  Better defender but seems to have been relieved of some offensive duties. Also he gets hurt a lot.
"For the Nuggets, trading our no.13 pick in the 2017 draft to Utah for Trey Lyles &amp; the no.24 pick springs to mind.  Number 13 pick would go on to be Donovan Mitchell, while Trey Lyles did nothing for the Nuggets &amp; the no.24 pick (Tyler Lydon) would do even less."
Only reason we traded him was because Marcus Morris said he would sign with us. I still think Marcus Morris is the reason our playoff streak ended. We got Trey Lyles because of Marcus Morris reneging on us.
when your team sucks so much that you need to play trey lyles 17mins
Not making excuses for AD but he was guarding Trey Lyles who was hot from three and teams try all the time to make him guard a shooter so that the paint is open
lol trey lyles is balling rn
I mean watching from this game it really is a matter of effort. They seem to stand around the basket and hope the ball falls into their lap. Only rebound they got the last 2m was literally the 2nd OREB slipping out of Trey Lyles' hands and landing onto Melo.
Trey Lyles kept getting blocked by the rim
Trey Lyles was drafted above Devin Booker.
Trey Lyles is ass
we don't care because it's the pistons and his big man matchup is trey lyles
There should be 0 minutes where AD is matched up with Trey Lyles. Stew should play every minute AD’s there
Fuck Trey Lyles
I get why Mavs fans feel this way.  Watched him share starting C minutes with Trey Lyles due to neither of Olynyk/TT being available as Canada's bigs in the 2020 qualifiers.   Those two in particular were awful and arguably why Canada didn't qualify for the 2021 Olympics despite fielding one of their strongest teams of all time.  Both Powell and Lyles were consistently getting bodied against random Euro league tier players it was so weird to watch. I have no idea how he's getting major NBA minutes.

"Do you think he's on the block? I'd like the Pistons to take a chance on him if he's available. He'd certainly be better than Trey Lyles, and he could probably play at the same time as Kelly Olynyk when he comes back."
"Charlotte has been ""missing"" for a number of drafts but haven't exactly been ""swinging"". This analogy of swinging for the fences applies to instances wherein the team goes for a prospect with a higher potential ceiling (home run) over the ""proven"" product (single). A lot of times Charlotte has gone to the prospect who was productive, or came from an established program, or had his ""one shining moment"", or ""ready to play"" (or from North Carolina).  Swinging is going for small-school Dame over the ""winner"" MKG, or Giannis over Cody Zeller. Even if Dame or Giannis didn't pan out, it's better to have taken a chance at someone with the potential to be quite special instead of ""NBA-ready"" prospects with low ass ceilings. Given Charlotte's roster in all that time, they seemed to be drafting for a veteran team that was a solid bench contributor away from Finals contention when they should've rather crashed and burned with a Trey Lyles pick than go with a Frank Kaminsky.  I know that Miles was picked earlier but, now that they have LaMelo, this is actually the time go for the Bridges types over MPJ as you now have someone to build around. No one is saying that results don't matter - just that the ideal approach *at that time* called for more risk tolerance."

Ready for Detroit to trade for him. Josh Jackson or diallo and trey lyles maybe a second rounder. We need more young size to go with our young guards

"Olynyk is hurt. Isaiah got ejected. Garza is not ready, at least for big time minutes on defense. Jerami is long but slight. And Trey Lyles... that's it."
Man he really should be dominating vs Garza and Trey Lyles. Garza is a g leaguer and Trey Lyles is like 6’5
"Cool, that Kentucky team not only had as many drafted NBA players as that squad without Booker, but they also had more lottery picks who were better NBA players. The Suns two lottery picks being Chriss and Bender is not a good argument for your side in the slightest, Bender also isn’t/wasn’t good overseas. Out of the 4 starters in that game not named Booker, literally maybe 1 would’ve started for that Kentucky team.  Trey Lyles and WCS are both literally CLEARLY better NBA players than everyone that team not named Booker, other than maybe Len and Dudley, lol."
"Yes, that’s what I said. Ulis was an All-American, Chriss, Len and Bender were top 10 picks. These guys were studs against lower levels of competition. If you don’t count these guys as NBA caliber players then you can’t count Trey Lyles, Willy Cauley-Stein, and the Harrison. Twins as NBA caliber players either.  Looking forward to your hostile reply."
"Yeah I think we def woulda won if Stew didn’t get hurt, he was our only healthy big. Playing Trey Lyles and Diallo at the 5 in the fourth Q was a recipe for disaster against the paint dominant AD &amp; Russ"
"Isaiah just lost it and fired a 5 lb. plate at Lebron. He missed way high and hit veteran center Trey Lyles in the back of the head. He had no idea what hit him. Isaiah actually felt pretty bad about it; Jerami Grant thought it was hysterical. Lyles was out cold and we had no idea what to do. Corey [Joseph], Saddiq, and Josh Jackson carried him to a massage table and laid him face down so anyone who saw him would just think he was waiting to get a massage. I had about 20 or 25 extra headbands in my locker so I just started wrapping those around Trey’s head to try to stop the bleeding."
"We run it back in a week on Sunday, hopefully Beef isn't gone for too long or it wont be much of a game. We really cannot keep up with just Trey Lyles running center"
"The Pistons who are without both of their centers, and have had to play Trey Lyles and Jerami Grant at the 5 since Stewart got ejected."
Trey Lyles outscoring all of the Lakers except Dwight Howard. I'm going to pretend that's what I expected to wake up to.
Three way trade:  Lakers get Jerami Grant and Buddy Hield  Kings get Russell Westbrook and Trey Lyles  Pistons get THT and Marvin Bagley  Who says no? All three teams?
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the “Core 4”  - Pistons can’t trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they’re angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about “character” and how talent doesn’t matter if their character isn’t what they’re looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I’ll say, Weaver hasn’t been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian’s the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this “interest” was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
"How's it gonna happen with us? What young player are we not playing?  Our young 20 year old center just got injured, we've been giving Trey Lyles his minutes  23 year old Frank Jackson is pretty much our 6th man now that Olynyk is out  Killians been having hand pain, if you saw last night he was holding his hand a lot.    Cade has the most usage out of anyone on the team and is given the greenlight, I just wish he was given chance to shoot the last 3"
"Detroit should be ashamed after this one. Although both of their centers are out and they had to rely on the powerful new acquisition, Trey Lyles."
"bc we got fucking mauled, Frank Jackson got hit multiple times. Poole fouled Cunningham after getting stripped.  Wiggins get every fucking call, was absolutely awful, watching fucking Trey Lyles doing the same thing Wiggins did in the next possession and don't get the call was infuriating.  Box score without watching the game ain't"
Trey Lyles is a bum
"Wish the refs would start respecting OG, dude gets hacked every game. Like seriously, he has less attempts per game than Trey Lyles."
"More impressive considering at one point in this game, he was out there with Luka Garza, Frank Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Josh Jackson. None of those guys should be in a 9 man NBA rotation."
"For a backup, Trey Lyles has been solid. Don't know what you're getting at with that. Cory Joseph on the other hand..."
"No, it's because his rotations are God awful. He also has a habit of having players stand in the corner. Imagine giving Trey Lyles any kind of meaningful minutes when he has been worse than dog shit. He leans way too much on veterans to the point that he doesn't hold them accountable for their garbage play."
"For real tho. Weaver’s acquired Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Trey Lyles, now Bagley - give me ALL the busts"
Nice. Hopefully we get to see him play because Trey Lyles Center minutes would have been dreadful either way.
I don’t need to watch Trey fucking Lyles play to know one of the most physical players on the Raptors who is playing DOUBLE Lyles’ minutes should probably be shooting more free throws than him. PLEASE stop being obtuse
"the way you challenged them was definitely done with the assumption that they were assuming as well. also highlighting me saying ""you can assume"" without context proves you arent worth discussing this with. you can notice patterns in how a person plays, especially after years of watching them, and assume they havent changed from that style; especially someone like trey fucking lyles LOL"
Amazing this guy spent the last hour or two formulating an argument around how trey lyles is somehow elite at drawing fouls and OG must not be good At drawing contact even though he shoots and handles the ball way more than lyles. Hilarious
"&gt; lyles has a different play style than Og as half the time hes shooting threes and OG attacks the rim every game.   And yet Lyles shoots a higher% of his FGA from 0-3 feet. I agree though, that just because he shoots a higher% of his shots from that distance doesn't mean he's getting fouled more.  &gt; you can absolutely claim Og undoubtably gets more contact than lyles bc its a consistent truth.  If you watch them both, then sure you can say that. The fact that you watched Trey Lyles in past seasons doesn't matter when splitting hairs over a 10 game sample. Gotta at least watch stuff within the sample you're talking about.  &gt; trying to assume he doesnt watch him this season proves nothing  I didn't assume that, I asked an honest question. I don't fucking know who watches what.  &gt; yes you can assume  I know we men, but no, you can't just assume."
"trey lyles is taking half his shots from 3 point range this season as well.   he's also averaging 3 times as many free throws per game as he did last season while playing the same amount of minutes.  In fact he has more FTA than he did all last season already after only 10 games, compared to the 23 he played last year  I have no doubt it's mostly statistical noise with small sample sizes but it does help illustrate the greater point that OG anunoby is not getting a very friendly whistle considering his usage rate, shot profile, shot attempts and time on the court.  OG anunoby takes almost 4 times as many shots as trey lyles, the fact that he has fewer FTA on the season encapsulates the issue perfectly"
right you're being pedantic for no reason and missing the point on purpose  someone with OG's shot profile and usage rate and time on the court should be going to the line more often than guys like obi toppin or trey lyles who play very low minutes
"I don't doubt that you do. But someone else made a claim specifically *in comparison to other players*, including Trey Lyles, so I asked them whether they actually watch Trey Lyles.  It's one thing to say ""OG should get more calls"" and another to say ""OG should get more calls than [insert player here]"""
well trey lyles is getting 15 minutes per game and OG anunoby is getting 36 minutes per game  seems like a pretty good bet
do you watch enough trey lyles this season to claim that he isn’t?
"I watch Trey Lyles play for team Canada internationally, and that's more than enough for me tbh."
"Honest question: do you watch enough Trey Lyles this season to claim that OG is ""undoubtedly"" getting more contact than him?"
"Obi Toppin, Tim Hardaway JR, Trey Lyles, Terrance Ross have shot more free throws than OG so far this season lol. OG is undoubtedly getting more contact than those guys…"
Oh boy Trey Lyles backup center minutes here we come.
"How dare they trade **THE TRUE GOAT OF CANADIAN NATIONAL BASKETBALL.**  Fuck you, Trey Lyles."
Honestly Im just here because Curtis Joseph/Trey Lyles lineups are my favorite
They didn’t even play for us and fuck them and rich Paul. We traded Bertans AND a second to the wiz to get Marcus and then he bitches out. Bullshit. Then rich Paul gives us a trey lyles like he’s helping us out. Fuck them both.
"A rookie coming off one of the longest basketball-less stretches of his life starts off cold playing with Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Frank the Tank 3.0? BUST, I TELL YOU, BUST!"
"It was fun to say ""no expectations"" and ""let the young guys play"" but the results for the Pistons so far have been not great. Saddiq and Beef Stew have been solid, Trey Lyles has been a pleasant surprise, and Kelly Olynyk has been quite good, but the starters have been getting run off the floor and the offense is not good. Hopefully Cade playing will spice things up and at least make the team more interesting to watch"
"He’s the exact kind of reclamation project the Grizzlies would take on (Jarrett Culver, Justice Winslow). The warriors and Spurs could be dark horses too. Spurs took a chance on Trey lyles and warriors revitalized Javalle McGee."
lmao in my MyCareer him and Isiah Stewart are both out long-term so we're starting Trey fucking Lyles at C. our defense is awful but Cade and i are a MEAN backcourt duo
"Do any Pistons fans hate the way Dwayne Casey deals with rotations in these less than competitive games? I would rather see the actual important potential franchise cornerstone players get 30+ minutes, even in blowouts, and have a shot at building more chemistry than muck about with minutes for guys like Rodney McGruder, Trey Lyles, and Frank Jackson."
"Trey ""Kyle Anderson"" Lyles"
