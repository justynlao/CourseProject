"&gt; he is a negative asset.  Wiggins has been a top 5 two-way wing this season.  &gt; just wayyyy too expensive for his production.  He makes 8m more than Buddy Hield and 4m more than Harrison Barnes, neither of whom can hold down a starting role on a team 7 games under .500  Can we stop with this 'negative asset' garbage?"
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
Kenneth Faried has officially replaced Buddy Hield as r/NBA’s favorite player to randomly bring up
that's what i'm saying. last year it was players like buddy hield and joe harris. everyone knows how good they are at shooting. but i personally had no idea that mike conley was like that.
Why didn’t buddy hield get invited to the 3 point contest?
"You aren’t factoring in him sitting out games against all the best defensive teams.  Or his defensive rating.   He might be the worst degender in the league.   Him, coby white, or buddy hield."
Buddy Hield
I fucking wish. They gave Harrell a tech for yelling “AND 1” last night and literally gave a free point to Buddy Hield

"The Buddy Hield ""3"" that was actually a long 2 with his foot on the line as too."
6/10 on 3s from Buddy Hield***
Buddy fucking Hield. He deserves to get out of this shitty team.
"I, for one, enjoyed it; Buddy Hield is quite good"
Was that buddy hield 3 actually not reviewed?
Buddy Hield wow
1 shooter like Buddy Hield on the Lakers please. That's literally all I ask for.
Buddy Hield playing like an All-Star today
On this list the only guys he might be better than are Buddy Hield and Trae Young
Buddy hield
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"It is his 9th season in the NBA though. Came in at 22, sure, but he's been around for a minute   Buddy hield is the one that always shocks me (he's 28)"
"Buddy Hield is in a year long slump, you watch basketball?"
"Buddy Hield. I rarely watch King's games but when I do, he torches the other team including my team :("
What the fuck are you talking about haha  Buddy Hield has a reddit burner
"Yeah bro no way an old superstar and 20 ppg scorer definitely didn’t add to the star power of that one.   Buddy Hield had objectively better numbers than Middleton that year, and had he been in the east would’ve been an all star. But that’s the one you decide to have a problem with??"
Yeah 70 year old Dirk and Buddy Hield were definitely stars lmao
"That is clearly way weaker. Average fans don’t give a shit about Danny green, Seth curry, buddy hield and Joe Harris"
Tbh someone like Kyrie or Buddy Hield.
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
Buddy hield was like nope after seeing that on trying to shake the other players hand. Lol
"You guys got 2 young players with a lot of promise and Fox who’s an allstar caliber playe, buddy Hield is probably gonna be traded and y’all can focus on building around that. Your offense is fine it’s just defense that needs work"
Can someone tell me why Buddy Hield has 1 fantasy point. Boutta drop his ass
Buddy Hield is the oldest young player in NBA history
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
"Get Buddy Hield off my team immediately. This clown had the nerve to whine and bitch about wanting to get traded, not starting and closing games. He gets his opportunity and completely fumbles, now his trade value has plummeted even further.   Get rid of buddy and start Tyrese immediately, I’ll take a bag of chips for him at this point. I just want him off the team."
"honestly i thought giannis was like 28 cause he has been in the nba since 2013 which was about the time i started being a fan so maybe thats why.  Buddy Hield is much older than he should be considering he was in the 2016 nba draft, i can't believe he's nearly 30!"
Think Buddy Hield also count in here
"&gt; is luke walton a fucking idiot?   yes  &gt;Tyrese is probably already better than Buddy  I said on draft night that Buddy Hield was not good enough to hold Tyrese Haliburton back, and got told off for it."
Ok got it wrong   It was 17 in the last 2:49 against Minnesota which is still crazy  But they were down at 25 at one point so I remembered it wrong  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28580267/comeback-kings-cap-historical-rally-vs-timberwolves-buddy-hield-career-night
Who wants a slightly used Buddy Hield
Doesn’t matter. Buddy Hield.  Also B
Another one. Kristaps for Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield
Trade them both the Kings for Buddy Hield
"He also drafted Kris Dunn over Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Jakob Poeltl and Sabonis (though he was taken 11th so he would've been a bit of a reach)"
"1. Clashed with ownership in Memphis while trying to get out of his contract.   2. Clashed with Kings front office over Luka blunder and Bagley minutes.   3. Clashed with his Buddy Hield publicly during a game   When you piss of Owners, GMs and players...it’s not easy to get another gig"
Buddy Hield isn't really star level player but I feel like he severely lacks this
He’s good he just doesn’t let players do what they want and he’s kind of a dick theirs video of him scolding buddy hield for shooting a deep three when he was hit in a game and the very next possesion buddy passes up the same shot for a even worse one
Second to buddy hield. Steph has been injured
"Zach LaVine: 4 years, $78,000,000   Buddy Hield: 4 years, $94,000,000"
"This was a weirdly decent game to watch as both teams are on a similar level, even if not a particularly high one. Fox vs. Lavine, Bagley vs. Williams, etc.. Buddy Hield is really overweight, right?"
Dieng + Brooks + 2022 Utah 1st for Buddy Hield.   Shores up the Grizzlies biggest weakness
Every couple of months there's a post about how Buddy Hield is older than people think.
"It was crazy how a three years ago he aged [two years](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/sports/buddy-hield-age-sacramento-kings.html#:~:text=Before%20the%20game%2C%20Hield%20told,would%20have%20made%20him%2025.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThat's%20their%20fault%2C%20not%20my,that%20had%20his%20age%20wrong.). His age was listed incorrectly online and it just spread as truth.  He said it wasn't intentional, but there is a bias against older players in the draft. I wonder where he goes if teams knew he was already 23 coming out.  EDIT: Re-reading it looks like it was disclosed to the Kings"
Kings gonna move buddy hield?
"I am happy sixers didnt trade for buddy hield, sacramento should traded him in offseason"
"buddy ""buddy hield"" hield"
Buddy Hield and Joe Harris? That wing defence is absolute trash.

Is player one Blake griffin and player two buddy hield?
2nd one is buddy hield which i literally only know cuz i randomly saw that he was averaging 37% from the field and from 3 today and i thought it was neat
Inconsistency is just part of the Buddy Hield experience
Buddy Hield is an excellent 3 point shooter.
"NBA teams don't scout based on sports-reference.com. He can shoot. Its not uncommon for rookies to take time to settle in.   Buddy Hield shot about 25% on his first 100 attempts. Grant Williams missed his first 28 threes or something. Some guys rush their shot until they get comfortable.   Nesmith sat out injured for most of last year, then didn't get a proper training camp, and he hardly gets minutes and hes 10/33.    I wouldn't be running victory laps on the idea that he can't shoot."
Buddy hield
"He is getting minutes for a good team which hasn't happened for him since his early days as a Bull. Imagine if a contender trades for, I dunno, Buddy Hield. Buddy Buckets would fall in love with the city and be an instant fan favorite! Buddy has really improved his decision-making his year and while his 3 pointer doesn't look good I think mot of it stems from issues like not playing for a playoff team which can easily be solved if he got traded to a playoff team."
Haha. I thought Trae’s gonna be Buddy hield or Jimmer more so than Luka’s rival.
That game was amazing. Buddy Hield and Justin Jackson team up to take on Steph Curry in a 3 point shootout.

Buddy hield was the original
I was just fucking around but thanks for the actual answer. I thought it was Buddy Hield tbh
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."

"Hield and Haliburton is a great match together. Last year we couldn’t play Bogi and Hield at the 2/3 together because of defensive reasons. This year we have Buddy for stronger 3’s and Hali for longer 3’s and it has unlocked out smaller lineup with Barnes at the 4. I’m all for keeping it together if we are a few games above .500. If a deal that was to good to refuse I would do it.  Something like this I think we’d do as it ticks a lot of boxes for us.  Sac receive - Green + Thybulle + Monk + 21 1st (Phi top 20 protected)  Phi receive - Hield + Bjelica + Robinson III + 21 2nd (best of Sac, Mem &amp; Lal)  Cha rec Bradley + James or Guy + 21 2nds (2nd best of Sac, Mem &amp; Lal)  Getting a lockdown defender in Thybulle and a microwave Buddy-lite in Monk, together would be a good young offence/defence pick up. Green would bring some depth and championship experience in. These 3 would be able to fill more minutes at the 3 to allow Barnes to play more at the 4 for the playoff push. Free up cap to resign Holmes and give flexibility in resigning Monk if at the right price."
Exactly. So with Pat Bev and Lou together they could bring back around $26m in salary. How do you do that in a way that improves the team?  Victor Oladipo? Buddy Hield? Harrison Barnes? Malcolm Borgden? Zach Lavine?  It seems like only if Houston's cash-squeezed is there any reason to think a deal of one of those guys for Bev/Lou makes any sense for the other team.
"I'm discussing the trade you suggested.  Sure, in theory, if they could trade Buddy Hield for assets without disrupting their chemistry too much, while replacing his skillset with someone equal or better, that would be incredible!  So the question is, how do they bring back that value? Brooks/Dieng/1st sure as hell ain't it. So how?"
Buddy Hield did something very weird. With 30 secs to go and widen open he held onto the ball instead of hitting the 3. I keep hearing how he is one of the best 3pt shooters in the league so can someone explain that phase of play? Him hitting the 3 would have meant it would be game over. Killing time surely isn’t a better strategy.
"&gt; Their best lineup atm uses Fox/Tyrese/Buddy, so it's not an either-or.  How many minutes?  &gt; They're playing very well with all 3 plus Barnes and Holmes.  I agree, I just thought it was an opportunity to deal from a position of strength to shore up a position of weakness.  &gt; It would completely throw off their chemistry and they'd go back to waiting for Bagley to become a big-time contributor  I don’t think so, my point is that I think Hali in a bigger role could fill in a lot of the gaps, but ultimately this is sacrificing some of the short  term for the long-term game.  They aren’t a team 1 Hield away from a championship, they are a team still looking on the outside in and need to foster their best young players. Not sure how a 28 year old sniper adding 2-4 wins to the column changes anything in the long run margin, but that’s me"
"Pacers with Justin holiday and levert, magic with bacon and carter jr, kings with buddy hield and Harrison Barnes"
“b-but he made Buddy Hield angwy!!!”  Funny how Buddy actually played his best offensive ball with Joerger too
Buddy Hield+
"Yeah then LeBron/Dennis is top 3, Luka/Brunson is top 5. I don’t think backcourt players have to have playmaking responsibilities. What is JJ Redick? What’s Bryan Forbes? Is Buddy Hield not a backcourt player?"
Buddy Hield
"But don't you think that has to do with personnel? It's easier to process the game when you have more capable guys like De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes playing alongside of you."
&gt;Boi-yoi-yoing Buddy Hield!!  Uh what the fuck was that
I agree w/ you but a lot of this is due to random variation. The Kings would be in the playoffs if Buddy Hield didn't fall off a cliff.
as a kings fan.... nobody was sleeping on bmac. dude is buddy hield that can’t shoot
"Why use EFG% when it just doesn't account for Trae's ability to get to the free throw line and knock them down at a higher rate. I understand the game is played on both ends, but Fox is not some kind of lockdown defender. He's guarding the opposing teams best guard because he's starting next to Buddy Hield, not because he's super great on that end.   In my view, Fox is a solid defender and very good offensive player. I think the difference in Trae's playmaking and scoring efficiency accounts for the gap defensively, considering they both are point guards.  EDIT: Kings are also the worst defensive team in the NBA right now by defensive rating with Fox being slightly below team average for the Kings. He doesn't move the needle on that end enough to account for offensive difference."
"DUDE IS STOOOOOPID. Can't  catch, pass, or dribble. He was Buddy Hield b4 Buddy Hield  and just as bad"
"Buddy Hield will have the dumbest turnovers in the most crucial parts of the game, he’s a momentum killer."
"For a supposedly elite 3 point specialist, it sure does seem like Buddy Hield can only ever miss when the team actually needs an open 3 point shot."
Joe Harris  Duncan Robinson   Joe Ingles   Buddy Hield
Idk how you put a guy who got finals mvp votes and was a significant contributor to a championship team under buddy hield lol.
1. Duncan 2. Joe ingles 3. Joe Harris 4. Buddy Hield
"&gt; 4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all.  If Nash tried to double the number of 3s he takes, then defenses would play him differently and prevent him from taking that many 3s. Nash has to focus on running on offense more than trying to take 9.4 3s a game. He'd shoot more 3s, like 7-8, but not 9.4 lol. And even shooting that many more 3s he wouldn't be averaging some of the ridiculous points I see on this thread.  &gt; single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now  Van vleet has a faster shot release and doesn't have playmaking responsibilities like Nash would have.  &gt; Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier  All of those guys, aside from Lonzo, aren't the playmaking point guards of their team who have to run the offense like Nash has to.   &gt; If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game   He wouldn't, because the only guys taking them are Steph, Dame, and Buddy Hield."
"&gt; I don’t think they are. Nash never averaged more than 4.7 3 point attempts a game, he would double that easily today   Are you crazy? doubt 4.7 is 9.4, and the only guys shooting more than 9.4 3s a game are Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, and Buddy Hield. Steph and Dame are among the very greatest 3 point shot creators of all time (vast majority of Nash's 3s are assisted catch and shoot), and Buddy Hield is a 3pt specialist whose only role on the court is to run around and shoot 3s."

You think everything will magically change if they get a new GM?  Its not just specific to the Timberwolves. That's what the Kings have been for quite some time where they just perform poorly because they are still 'rebuilding' which gives them the excuse to not push themselves to win which in turn results in poor culture.  That's why you have players like Buddy Hield who get frustrated with the team and players like Bagley who are not developed well at all.
But Buddy Hield is?
It’s not none of these older players are game changers besides MAYBE Buddy Hield
I still can't believe Buddy Hield will be 30 next year.
"Julius Randle too!  Rondo, David West, Baron Davis, Eric Gordon, J.R. Smith, Austin Rivers, Buddy Hield, David Wesley. (I guess you can throw in J.J. Redick now too.)"
RIP Buddy Hield
I know right?! Buddy Hield will be 30 next year... Time sure goes by.
"yo shoutout buddy hield, finally looked like his old self."
"The year before he had all those guys plus Tyreke Evans, Motiejunas and Buddy Hield as well.   The reality is his NO teams were severe under performers  You don’t have to take this personally."
Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal. Take that for data.
"Minnesota Timberwolves at Sacramento Kings December 26, 2019  Final Score: MIN 105 SAC 104 after 2OT  Some of the worst shooting performances I have ever seen. All of these players had more shot attempts than points.  Andrew Wiggins: 4/19 (2/9 from 3)  Jeff Teague: 5/17 (1/6 from 3)  Harrison Barnes 2/12 (2/4 from 3)  Buddy Hield 6/20 (3/11 from 3)  Bogdan Bogdanovic 8/28 (3/16 from 3)"
Buddy Hield being older than Andre Drummond will always be weird to me
It is crazy when he is only 25 and guys like Malcolm Brogdon and Buddy Hield are both 28
"*kings fan so I am a little biased* Fox has had an incredible stretch now that tyrese Halliburton is starting at the two. But the comparison between booker and fox doesn’t seem to apply. Fox is a better pg and booker is a better sg. If we are comparing the teams, I’d say that fox &gt; paul(just this year) and booker &gt; buddy hield(pretty obvious lol)"
I considered both the Tyreke scorers table and the Buddy Hield running before posting that comment lol I just think the ass slap and composure after such a hype game winner is next level. He just pulled off the most insane shit and just walks away while spanking the defender...legendary
"I had him on my fantasy team for months and watched most of his games,  I feel like the issue with his play style is that he exclusively is a 3pt shooter at the moment, he’s style reminds me of Buddy Hield because they lack the ability to finish and get to the FT line.   As for his ceiling? Sky’s the limit because he’s only recently 22"
"Oh yeah buddy “fuck it, chuck it” hield"
"""This is my YMCA"" - Buddy Hield probably"
"The Bahamas per capita has to be one of the better represented foreign countries. For a nation of 400,000 people we have 2 active NBA players in Buddy Hield and DeAndre Ayton. Three if you want to count Mychal Thompson."
"Buddy Hield. Ik that Barnes has been involved in trade discussions, but I feel like Buddy is another name to watch out for"
"Oh Buddy, what a classic Buddy Hield move."
BUDDY HIELD IS A DECISIVE DECISION MAKER  BUT  HE MAKES HORRIBLE DECISIONS
"Fire Walton at the end of the season, Trade Buddy Hield, Barnes and Get a top 5 pick in a loaded draft."
"Tank commander Buddy Hield, what an awful fuckin shot."
"thoughts:  for his contract, Buddy Hield has to be one of the dumbest players in the league  Kings fans might be the ones with the most urge to tank  Probably unpopular, but the Hornets announcers overhype waaaay too many things. My head starts to hurt after the 5th yelling from a layup  Unrelated: anyone know who Malik Monk's college roommate was? I forgot"
Buddy Hield and Luke Walton are top-tier tank commanders and NO SLANDER WILL BE TOLERATED.
This was unfortunate.   Luke Walton drawing up a contested  fadeaway three for Buddy Hield with 50 seconds left was borderline malpractice. What in the fuck was that?
Hield of Buddy still in the nba?
"Buddy Hield, what the heck was that."
Buddy hield  Saddiq bey had career games every single time against us  Duncan Robinson  Kris Middleton not a role player but man hates us
Buddy Hield
"Hawks were in control after a very good 1st quarter from the kings. The kings had a good 4th to bring it close, but in the end it just wasnt enough.   Fan take for 1st game all year of kings I've seen  I hate to say it but I really think the kings may have to tank a few more years to get Fox help. Buddy Hield is stealing a living, he looked washed last night. Fox had an Incredible game, but he just has to get his buckets through 3 guys every possession, it's hard to do that consistently, he needs help. Call me a hater but bagley didnt look good either. Lots of jumps on fakes, fouls, and missed shots. Richaun holmes is a tank of a player and hilarious to watch - I'd hate to play against him. Now that LP has been fired, walton is the worst coach in the nba.   Hawks side - Trae looked fucking great last night. 28 points on 5/10 from three 🤩. Snell is looking like a legit starting option IMO. Hes not a box score champ but he defends well and moves the ball. Kevin Huerter is very hit or miss for me, I like the reads he makes but he has to be more aggressive in the midrange, hes got a great feel around the high post. Capela could've been an all star, and he is still manhandling grown men. He had a great game, the hackapella was lame as fuck from L alton. JC looks like hes let the contract situation get to him - hes not playing calm and collected and seems to be forcing the action quite a bit, disrupting the flow of things. Gallinari has been an integral piece of the hawks current 4 game streak, and is starting to look like the guy who got paid to be the vet. Amazing assists, slo mo drives to the rim, mid range turnarounds, and of course his 3 ball. Still a traffic cone but hes looking more comfortable on a game by game basis and we are reaping the benefits of this. Bogi has been anemic but he will come thru, hes very out of rhythm right now and will get back into the swing of things come playin tournament time.  Skwah on 4 game win streak, first since 2018 and it's a gr8 day to be a hox fan."
"Uhhh...I mean who even has more trade value between those two? Buddy on his contract or Bagley, I’m assuming Buddy probably?  Kind of like the Knicks for Hield but I’m not sure how the salaries can match. Knicks would have to send 5 players but maybe Obi Toppin Ntilkina and 3 expiring for those 2? Ntilikina gives the kings a backup defensive PG also basically what Cory Joseph was supposed to be  Gauging Bagley’s trade value in general is hard. Didn’t know whether to include Knox or not also"
"I get what you’re saying here, and shooting ability has gone up, but it’s partly about focus.  When the league was more heavy on big man scoring, post footwork was better.  Now it’s less emphasized.  Ray Allen could have been bombing 12 3’s a game and shooting at a higher rate, but it was literally discouraged.  He had to constantly work on other skills because teams wanted him penetrating, hitting mid range and playing elite defense, so he did.  If he could phone it in on defense, let his other skills drop a bit, and focus completely on shooting, you bet your ass he’d be just behind Steph and Klay.  But if he did what Dame does he’d have gotten subbed out.  Dame isn’t an all time great pure shooter, he’s a more complete package.  And I was *slightly* unfair to Trae, and he had improved shot selection (mainly just shooting 3 fewer 3’s a game).  This is largely a function of having more help so he doesn’t need to jack up bad shots in a vain attempt to keep the game within 20.  But he is still not top 10.  The other shooters you listed are better than him and so are:  Jared Harris, JJ Redick, Bradley Beal, Buddy Hield, Bogdanovic, Lavine just to name a few."
"If Buddy Hield played for Rome, it would have been built in a day. Brickcity"
"Thats not true.  Its just that what they do is often stupid.  Passing on Lamelo, trading up and drafting Jarrett Culver when at least the next 7 guys taken after him are much better, taking Kris Dunn with Buddy Hield and Jamal Murray on the board.  Just a few examples  These are things are not bad luck, they're just decisions made by people who are not smart"
I didn't watch the game but it sure looked like Buddy Hield lead the tanking.
"Buddy Hield. But to be fair, it usually is his fault."
Can I interest you in one Buddy Hield?
"Buddy Hield at the Age of 28 has 1,018 3PM and the fastest player in NBA history to hit 1000 3 pointers"
Buddy Hield is 28. Steph made 400 3s in his age 28 season
I could see buddy hield coming close
Buddy hield is older than Andre Drummond  Always surprises me
Buddy Hield for a FRP and filler?
Buddy Hield
Buddy hield not getting the respect he deserves
Buddy hield?
"&gt;Like I like PJ Washington but him and the 16th pick is a massive undersell.  Is it though?  Vucevic is good but let's not go crazy   Lets compare him to Boogie Cousins in 2017, who was both younger and better than Vuc.  The Kings got Buddy Hield (who wasn't playing well for NOP) and a pick"
"Being an elite 3 point shooter is a combination of volume and percentage. 42% on 2 attempts is a lot less valuable than 39% on 7 attempts. Buddy Hield has a slightly lower percentage than Lonzo. If Hield isnt an elite 3 shooter, who is? lmao"
"What are the Kings looking for in terms of returns for Buddy? Are they looking to get out from under his contract if they end up trading Barnes to the Celtics for the TE and young players with small contracts?  I might be in the minority, but I'd hope for Orlando to bring Hield in for Fournier."
What’s crazy is that Buddy Hield being 28 actually feels young for him now because half the time people bring him up it’s because of how old he is.
&gt;He's gone from 26 to 27 to 28 in the space of four posts  That's what's known as the Buddy Hield phenomenon.
"Not really, kings fans are really low on him but he’s a world-class 3 point shooter. He’s had some cold stretches this season though, and most casual NBA fans have goldfish memories  He has a lot of flaws of course (namely defense and creating his own shot), and all us kings fans have a huge hard-on for Tyrese right now, so a lot of people want him to go. Plus he has that big contract taking up a lot of our $$$  I love Buddy and I’d love to see him stay, but I think it works best for both parties if he goes. IMO, put Buddy on a contender and he’ll give consistent production and a ton of 3-point gravity. I just don’t know that our current team is the best fit for him  That said, if he can improve his game and settle into the 6th man role for our team, I’m sure he’d be great. I just don’t know that that’s the Buddy Hield path"
With Barnes on a descending contract locked in for two more seasons I'll believe it when I see it. I think a really good offer has to come in or they will hold.  Buddy Hield on the other hand I could see them sell low to get the contract off the books and make way for Haliburton
"I feel like both of them are overrated for what they actually were.   Allan Houston was more like Buddy Hield or ""Kevin Martin 1.0""   Spre was...IDK...post-injury Oladipo? He had one really good year, and was pretty much meh the rest of his career, honestly."
You know who I really like on the Warriors? Buddy Hield.
"Ah yes, because shooters such as Bryn Forbes, Lonnie Smith Jr. and Buddy Hield are known for their defence"
"By next year it'll be passed by Buddy Hield or something, 3pt records are the most vulnerable records in the history of the NBA"

"It's wild, to me, to see how many international players are popping up in the league from countries I didn't really expect to see have NBA players. Rui and Yuta from Japan, Markkanen from Finland, Buddy Hield and DeAndre Ayton from Bahamas. The list goes on."
"2016 class lowkey stacked.  Jamal Murray, buddy hield, and sabonis also in lottery, other role players throughout the draft, and guys like siakam, levert, dejounte murray, Brogdon went super late, not to mention a few good undrafted guys too"
"Yeah, I could see a Buddy Hield type too though, disgruntled player making a ton of money that his team just wants to get off."
"The past two seasons, one of the Kings' strengths was their depth. Not this year. They only have six quality NBA players: Fox, Hield, Haliburton, Barnes, Bagley, and Holmes. The two configurations of this Walton plays are:  Starting lineup of Fox/Hield/Barnes/Bagley/Holmes (no Haliburton) - This lineup only has one ball handler (Fox), which leads to some REALLY one-dimensional offense.  Closing lineup of Fox/Hield/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes (no Bagley) - This lineup gets killed at the rim and on the glass when Holmes gets dragged out to the perimeter.  What I suspect is actually the Kings' best lineup is Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Bagley/Holmes (no Hield), which Walton seems reluctant to play. This is much more balanced with size and playmaking, and I think Hali can single-handedly unlock another level of Bagley's offense. If/when Buddy gets traded this season and this lineup becomes the go-to lineup, I think the team is going to reel off some surprising wins. The complete lack of depth is another issue, though..."
Like Buddy Hield
"Curry is an incredible player, an all-time great, and is very influential, but he’s so much of an outlier than I think his “impact” league-wide can get overstated. Most teams that tried to replicate Golden State’s model were bad at it because you have to have that kind of outlier personnel for it to work properly, you can’t do it with Omari Spellman and Buddy Hield.  A little bit of a hot take, but I think Iverson is one of the most influential/impactful players ever, and I’m not even talking about the culture side of things. He might’ve been the first real scorer/distributor at the PG position who ran the offense and was the primary option, contrasted to what we’d call the traditional or true PG. He was one of those first guys who could put up 30 points and 10 assists in a game consistently. I think this development would’ve happened without him (shout out to Stephon Marbury who was in the same mold) but I think it directly led to the predominant offensive style of today, of elite initiators like Harden/LeBron/Doncic/Dame/ run the offense while being the primary scoring option."
Buddy Hield has taken a step back this year.  Shooting 38% from the field.

"Jamal ""[Buddy Hield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxl8Xi8nh8w)"" Murray"
"So far this year, could be Buddy Hield. Hasn't been awful from three but not his best year shooting the ball and doesn't contribute much else. Team has looked better without him on the court down the stretch"
"I agree that I'd be uneasy about paying that much if he can't defend but I think he might get paid a lot just based on the fact that teams should have money and are willing to take the risk that he'll put it together (and depending on the situation, I think that risk is worth it for teams). Not a good comp in terms of playstyle but Bertans at age 28 just got 5/80 and he can't defend at all and is less versatile on offense (even if a better pure 3pt shooter). That was coming off a career high 15ppg in a similar number of minutes to Lauri. So Lauri is already showing more versatility/overall volume on the offensive end plus he'll only be 24 by free agency so teams are going to hope they can teach him defense and have him add a couple more moves to his scoring arsenal, something not expected from Bertans. Buddy Hield also had inconsistency issues earlier in his career but he had a similar breakout in his contract year and that got him 4/94. While he may not get that much unless he keeps up these numbers all year, Lauri is a true 7 footer and 2 years younger than Buddy was at that point so I think it's reasonable to expect him to get in the 19-20M/yr range."
We're rebuiding around ~~Kevin Martin~~ ~~Tyreke Evans~~ ~~Demarcus Cousins~~ ~~Buddy Hield~~ De'Aaron Fox!
Buddy Hield
"Serious Q - What the fuck is Buddy Hield these days? His shot profile is basically that of a shooter. Doesn't get to the rim, doesn't shoot inside. Horrific FT rate"
At that same age Buddy Hield had 148.
@ Buddy Hield
"I mean even if that was true, you chose Buddy freakin Hield over him"
"And this is probably our biggest improvement over last season.   Brown used to need other guys on the floor to at least create some space. Tatum was our only guy who could carry the bench. Otherwise, he'd get trapped and turn the ball over.  Now he's scoring +25 a night while sharing the court with Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and two centers on the floor.  I didn't really agree with Boston focusing purely on shooters in the draft, but watching what the Jays are doing without any spacing makes it clear.   These two with a Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, etc would be absolutely unreal."
Any chance he gets the Buddy Hield contract
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
"Dame hit it at 247, klay at 248 and Steph at 249. Buddy hield did it in 244."
"Donovan Mitchell made his 600th career 3-pointer last night.  He reached that mark in 240 games, the fastest player in NBA history to do so:  240 - Mitchell  244 - Buddy Hield  247 - Damian Lillard  248 - Klay Thompson  249 - Stephen Curry"
"players from the 2016 draft I would definitely take over Simmons:  Ingram, Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray.  Brogdon &amp; Siakam are in the same tier as Simmons right now (I would put Simmons ahead of them in that tier), and below that is the Caris Levert, Buddy Hield, Dejounte Murray tier.  Simmons is closer to these guys than he is to the top of this class, and if he doesn't figure out a way to impact the game in the half-court I could see more players leap-frogging him."
"Also it's not like his college career was shabby by any means. That U of O Ducks team that made it to the Final Four and lost to eventual champs North Carolina by a point had a helluva squad. If Boucher wasn't injured I'm pretty confident they would've made it to the championship game at least. That team also had Jordan Bell (who sadly flamed out after that 1st chip got to his head), Dillon Brooks, and the Celtic's favorite rookie Payton Pritchard.  They weren't bad the previous year either, losing to Oklahoma in the Elite Eight when Buddy Hield looked like the second coming of Steph Curry.  Those were the best Ducks basketball squads in recent history."
"Kyrie for Buddy Hield, Richuan Holmes, and 1-2 firsts, who says no?"
"How? Brandon Ingram is a border line all-star. I have no issue with his contract. A 25% max for a ~23 year old borderline all star is much much much better than ~$20M per year for a 25 year old RFA who is never going to be more than a 5th starter.  Look at the recent ones. Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, BI. All looking pretty good. Compare that to Buddy Hield."
He doesn’t even have a bad contract - $22m per year increasing to a $28m PO is insanely reasonable in today’s NBA.   He basically makes what guys like Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield make.   It’s not like he’s making $40m or something crazy.
Kinda off topic but Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal. Idk why but thats just so shocking to me.
"No one hates the Kings, it's just y'all are a small market team in the western conference that hasn't made the playoffs in a really long time. The NBA wants to flaunt and advertise its best players and best teams since this is what people crave.   A lot of people know about Devin Booker or Luka Doncic, not so many know about Buddy Hield or Marvin Bagley, and so it's in the NBA's best interest to advertise those teams"
Buddy hield . Denver nuggets. Collision course
Sounds like Buddy Hield as well.
"Oh ok so it's the same. I swear there are a contingent of Sixers fans who don't post anything until we lose. Then Ben is trash, Tobias is overpaid, we draft like shit, Ben is trash some more, the coaching is terrible and Ben is trash.   Then they say we should trade Ben for any guard who can shoot. I read someone suggest after this last loss that we trade Ben for Buddy Hield. The Kings would trade Buddy Hield and his contract for a Ben Simmons jersey so long as they don't have to pay it."
"Buddy Hield came off the bench for half the season last year on the fucking Kings. Trae is one of the only guys on his team capable of making his own shot. Even if you take away the laughably bad shots Trae takes at times, the shots those guys are taking can't be compared at all.  Your 50/40/90 on high volume shit is also ridiculous. I don't even think Dame meets that yet you name him as elite. You don't have to be a top 5 shooter all time to be considered elite."
"It's good, but it isn't elite. It isn't Steph, Dame, even Buddy Hield. Elite is 50/40/90 kind of level on high volume. Trae isn't close to that at this point."
"He’s still an athletic freak and a 6’10 PG with great passing, court vision, ball handling, defense, and rebounding. The other guys at the top of his draft class were Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Dragan Bender, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Kris Dunn, etc.     Even now how many of those guys would you take over Simmons? And keep in mind Simmons went straight to averaging 16-8-8 in his rookie year."
Buddy Hield
"Honestly I'm still taking Buddy Hield, KD, Joe Harris, Seth Curry and a bunch of other guys over him. Just because he shoots really deep attempts doesn't make him a better shooter."
This guy gets it.   You interested in one lightly used Buddy Hield?
We play a switch everything defense and doing have the personnel to do it. It’s a fucking disaster. Watching Buddy Hield ending up on Jokic in the post is tough to watch.
Bol Bol is definitely not a better shooter than Buddy Hield (career 41% shooter on high volume) yet Buddy Hield couldn't even beat Kosta Koufos in 1v1.   https://youtu.be/TIBpqR-UF3M
"Wasn’t he the guy that called Buddy Hield “the next steph curry” or something along those lines when they traded for him?  No disrespect to BH, but come on....."
"Walton, your defensive “system” of SWITCHING EVERY PICK AND ROLL AGAINST ALL LOGIC disrespects the game.   Seriously- this is why the Kings have the worst defense in recorded history. They have clearly been instructed to switch EVERY big/guard PNR and it ends up with Buddy Hield guarding Zubac, Jokic, Nurkic, etc. while Bagley or Holmes are stuck out on an island against the PGs, Jamal Murray’s, and Mccollums of the world with NO help at the rim for when they get blown by - so they sag off and give up open 3s.   Any moron who knows anything about basketball can look at the switching system Walton has them playing and recognize that it’ll never work in the modern NBA, let alone with a roster that is NOT built for it due to our very slight guard rotation having NO CHANCE against bigs in the paint."

I watched that mf game. Fml and fuck buddy hield
"Every time Buddy Hield puts the ball on the floor, an angel drops his harp."
In my heart he's a superstar. In today's game... May he we're talking about a 27ppg player on his sleep.  If Buddy Hield shoots 10 threes a game... I would give Peja 12
"KAT (rank 15), DLo (22), DRose (27), Wiggins (40), Buddy Hield (61) all happened in Target Center. KAT/DRose/Wiggins and Zach before he broke his own career high isn't too surprising since our offense has been ""feed the hot hand"" for like 5 years, but kinda funny that at least two away team players had their career high there as well"
"League average shooters but they take much higher volumes of shots than normal. And league average doesn't account for all the players that don't shoot 3pters.  Alsonignoring the original question which was how many legitimate 40% 3pt shooters there are in the league. My guess would be 15. 5 of which are stars (Middleton, Curry, Klay, PG13, then for one of the all-star pgs they seem to hover around 38-40% each year, and Kat), then you have guys like redick, Bjelica and Seth Currywho are great shooters but their defensive deficiencies may not be worth it on a team without great individual defenders. Then there are guys Buddy Hield not as bad defensively but not fantastic and are being payed like stars. So both Bogdanovics and ingles. Then you have players that some years do but some years don't like Danny Green.  My point is those guys you were talking about don't exist."
"I really like Shamet, I still think he can have a Buddy Hield type career."
Harden for buddy hield straight up
"F5 means refresh, we’re spam refreshing r/NBA for when Woj announces Harden’s going to the Kings for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley"
"Get Simmons, trade for Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, Korvers bones, and just jack up 3s"
Shabazz Muhammed  Ersan Ilyasova I'm like 99% sure  Buddy Hield didn't lie about his age but he certainly wasn't jumping to correct people who got it wrong
"It's hard to determine how prevalent 3 is. Just by how rare the condition is ever met.  A tanking team needs to be up 1 to 3 points in the last min. That's rare. For example, Hawks didn't not need to do anything fancy last season. They were getting blown out by Q4 in most of their games.  But yes, I agree the logistics of pulling it off is a lot more difficult/risky than 1 and 2.  The only team I can confidently accuse of doing this, is the Kings. Maybe Luke gives the ""wink"" to Buddy Hield. Or it could be something as simple as Buddy Hield knowing it's a tank season and just trying to help his team."
"Idk how sustainable it is but Buddy Hield showed a lot of effort on offense and most importantly defense. Looked good out there, hopefully he keeps it up."
Dude Dort shooting threes makes him legit one of the best 3 and d guys.  Horrors is still great defensively.  Halliburton is awesome but stop George Hill is one of the best 3 and d point guards.  He’s been underrated for years.  He shoots high from 3 and can run an offense solidly.  His passing isn’t great but it never was.  Your underselling you’re team to prop up SGA cause he’s the best player but often times it’s a team effort early success. Also Buddy Hield has been average this year Dort is way better.  You would not trade Dort for Buddy even for 1 year because you know Dort is better.  Same with Hill for Halliburton.  For one year you’d rather have those guys if your trying to win a game.  You also conveniently omit defense which all those guys are good to elite at.
Yes right now George Hill and Horford and Dort are better than anybody else on Sacramento.  Seriously look who the Kings start.  Holmes has been solid but ideally he's a backup center.  Barnes is good but he's better as a 4 than a 3.  Buddy Hield is as up and down as you can get.  I love me some Haliburton but he's still a rookie and we all know about Bagley.  Like look on paper and SGA has 3 dudes starting with him who are better than anybody that Fox has ever played with.
They also have the best 3pt shooter and last year's 3 point contest champion in Buddy Hield. And an exciting prospect in Haliburton.   Kings are legit.
"Duncan, since you’re perusing this sub, should I hang on to you for fantasy or pick up Buddy Hield, thanks!"

"Totally, they should do him like Buddy Hield and bench his ass for even taking the shot."
"Most Surprising: Tyrese Haliburton. I knew he was good, I didn't know he was ""carrying this team on his back"" good.   Most disappointing: Buddy Hield. He's been in a very long shooting slump, only cracked the 20+ pts once this season so far. Hoping he turns it around soon."
"dude if he can figure his shit out, this team can maintain consistency  otherwise trade his ass and figure out a way to get fucking Buddy hield"
Haliburton after he replaces Buddy Hield in the starting line up
Can Warriors somehow trade oubre and somebody else in a package to acquire buddy hield from the kings? I know its short sighted with Klay being back next season but man would it be a blood bath with the spacing curry would get.
Haliburton is who Hield thinks he is. I wonder when the time is gonna come where Buddy start bitching about being benched for Haliburton.  E: BTW Hield is averaging 15 points on 15 shots and 34% from the field.
#TYRESE HALIBURTON IS WHO buddy hield THINKS HE IS
I see Buddy Hield is not used to the Bloc Quebecois
Have to keep that value up for a Graham or Rozier trade. See Hield Buddy in Sac.
Buddy Hield ofc
Jamal murray and buddy Hield would have way better trade value than kris Dunn. Changes the dynamics of the Jimmy trade.
"This is bogi.      He'll show up and single handedly win games. Then quietly takes up space for a few games.      The upside is, he rarely makes bone head plays because he has a fairly high BBIQ. A player like Buddy Hield is a better shooter, but you also contend with poor ball handling and unforced TO's."
Praise the lord dont have to see cojo or buddy hield handle the ball
Redd - Buddy Hield  Martin - Mccollum
His contract is 29m this year with a 8% increments every year. Just providing the info here. It's a 28% of the cap max. For reference Buddy Hield signed a 4 year 94m contract
Buddy Hield is the same size as Steph what are you talking about
Isnt Buddy Hield budget Klay?
Buddy hield
"Kings Reset Moves.   Buddy Hield to the Knicks for Knox, Ntilikina and Dallas's 2021 1st Round Pick.  Harrison Barnes &amp; Whiteside  to the Celtics for 20211st Round Pick (Use Trade Exception)  Nemaja Bjelica &amp; Two 2021 2nd Rounders to Philedelphia for Matisse Thybulle  Marvin Bagley to Charlotte for Malik Monk and a Future First"
Jayson Tatum is already a top 5 player in the east but still younger than Buddy Hield at his rookie season.
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
Buddy Hield can't even statpad in garbage time smh
Buddy Hield looks thicker
Andre Drummond is 5 months younger than Buddy Hield.
"I'm interpreting the title the way it's written.   Jamal Murray is now the same age as Buddy Hield's rookie season, which doesn't make sense. How can someone me the same age as a rookie season?  Are you saying Murray is now the same age as Buddy Hield was during his rookie season?"
"Buddy Hield, the 2k GOD.  He's a Steph Curry level shooter on that motherfucker"
FACT: Buddy Hield is 3 months older than Chris Paul
"Buddy Hield is the guy we thought who Malcolm Brogdon was.  Scratch that, Hield was born 6 days later than Brogdon."
Saying “make this pick worse” doesn’t mean “buddy is a bust” or “this was a bad pick”. Notice how you had to add something in that wasn’t said to try and prove a point.  At the time it was questionable decision to choose Hield over Murray. The vast majority of draft boards had Murray as the higher pick.  Again you are reading too far into something that wasn’t said.
Not sure why we are talking about buddy hield when  we have dragan bender picked before them both and is now so bad that he’s currently playing for the same team he was on before being drafted (Maccabi Tel Aviv).
"During Buddy Hield’s sophomore season in college, TikTok didn’t even exist yet.  Buddy Hield is so old he was born with a mustache and listening to country music."
"Makes you feel bad for Buddy Hield. And 2006 wasn't that long ago. I even remember the epic duels between the Kings and the Lakers in 2001, and 2002..."

Buddy Hield.   Overrated chucker with no basketball IQ.
"Kerr deserves some blame. In 2 late game situations he didn’t call time out when the Warriors got trapped and instead just sat and watched them turn it over (they were ahead both times and then ended up losing). That’s 2 extremely preventable Ls. He even did it a 3rd time vs Sacramento but Buddy Hield came through with some anti clutch play for the Kings lol and the Warriors hung on.  He also was obsessed with playing Nico Mannion in the 2nd unit for a string of 10ish games and would not let Poole run point. Mannion at this stage sucks ass, it’s not his fault, but he’s on a 2 way and should’ve never been playing. That probably cost a few wins too. One game in particular vs the Heat, the game was basically tied, he put Mannion in during the 4th and he was -8 in 1 minute....and then he didn’t sub Steph in til 6 minutes left with the Dubs down 10.   Once Wiseman went down, he’s been coaching like someone who actually wants to wins games again and it’s been mostly fine. No coincidence they’re 12-5 in this span. But he let them trick off a bunch of wins early in the season due to lack of urgency &amp; terrible rotations."

i will trade buddy hield for a hot and ready little caesars pizza
"I think every fan of a team thinks that window is larger than it actually is, with the bottom end being very team friendly. I agree that in practice it's a much smaller window, because agents know that there's always going to be a team with cap space that will overpay, even if they're just doing it to be an asshole.  I want to cite the LaVine situation where the Kings came in and offered a bunch (I remember Bulls fans being mad about that), but that rings hollow now because he's since proven that even the Kings offer underpaid him. The Kings did manage to keep Buddy Hield before he hit RFA, but his inconsistent play since then makes it seem like an overpay, but I swear someone would've thrown more money at him than the Kings gave him. For Bogdanovic this pass summer, the offer was high enough that the Kings couldn't stomach matching it, and I'm afraid the same is going to happen with Richaun Holmes. I think Otto Porter might be an example where signing with the team for a couple million a year less would've actually mattered for the team since the Wizards already had a couple massive contracts, but that doesn't really apply to the Cavs' situation."

Buddy Hield is one of the lowest bbiq players in the league. If you let him play the way he wants you get seasons like he's had this year. There's a reason his best season was under Joerger.
"I didn't really consider the Cousins trade a win either. But there are those who did, and it was just enough competence to argue for continuing along with Vlade, as though he had gotten past his mistakes out of inexperience.  In hindsight, they did avoid the Boogie supermax (not sure if he gets injured, but league moves away from his style anyway).  But did end up falling into the Buddy Hield extension.  Tough life as a Kings fan"
Thing is you don't make franchise altering personel decisions based on the whim of Joe Harris or Buddy Hield
"That's Buddy ""Big like Klay. Shots like Steph"" Hield to you, sir."
"I agree with that. Scoring records =/= championships and Wilt only has 2 of them. I don't think saying that is as nonsensical as you're implying.  &amp;#x200B;  I will admit the generational difference and change in play style, but I will also bring up the fact that the reason for this change in play style is because of Steph Curry himself. Now, its value in this argument relies heavily upon whether you find that important or not, but regardless it is still a factor that needs to be brought up. Additionally, I would argue that this change in play style wouldn't matter at all. Players these days are becoming better and better shooters, and sports technology has also made huge leaps. Honestly I would genuinely argue that he has no ""true competition"" at all. Even his own teammate Klay Thompson who benefits from Steph's gravity ""only"" has 5 such games with 10 or more threes, good for second all time. Steph Curry has 21. Basically what I'm trying to say is: regardless of how good a shooter you were even in the 2000s, even with all the advancements in technology we have now and the shift in emphasis to shooting nowadays, you would still shoot relatively similar to a Joe Harris, Klay Thompson, or Buddy Hield. Nothing to scoff at, for sure: those guys are incredible 3 point shooters. But the bottomline is still there: you will never be Steph Curry."
"There was nothing right about what he did going at Buddy Hield for drilling shots on the KD Warriors in crunch time because he didn't follow the play.  There's a reason they call it ""no no no YES"" shots."
"&gt; but there are players who shoot a higher percentage on 3 pointers   I think for this to be even remotely fair you have to look at the quality of the shots attempted by those players. Majority of those players shoot exclusively catch and shoot (or catch, pump fake, side dribble, shoot) 3s whereas Curry shoots ridiculous off the dribble 3s that have no business going in the basket. Even the best 3 point shooter this season percentage wise (who I assume is Joe Harris but correct me if I'm wrong) is most likely exclusively a catch and shooter.   But you know, I kind of do see your point. No team is building around Joe Harris or Buddy Hield just because they're good 3 point shooters. Regardless though, I would definitely argue that no one could replicate what Steph is doing even if they're given the amount of shots he takes on a nightly basis. Joe Harris shooting 10+ 3s a night would not be able to hit as many 3s as Steph over the course of a full season. Granted, we wouldn't ever be able to know that for sure, but I would rather take the guy who's proven that he's capable of doing it year after year over the guy who maybe might be able to do it if he takes enough 3s for a full season."
"&gt; If you think Buddy Hield is a key part of your franchise's future, it makes sense to pick him over the coach who did that.  It also makes sense to fire your GM if you think that."
"Whatever you can say about how Buddy's career has gone since, personally I don't think there's any recovering from that time Joerger tore into Buddy for his shot selection when he almost singlehandedly beat the KD Warriors only to have his confidence dead on the last shot.  If you think Buddy Hield is a key part of your franchise's future, it makes sense to pick him over the coach who did that.  Plus Bagley didn't particularly like him.  Another person who regardless of what you think of his career now, if you think he's a key part of your franchise you'd pick him over the coach.  The mistake is which players they chose to listen to, but the rationale of listening to those players over the coach makes sense."

Julius Randle is Buddy Hield confirmed
This sub doesnt know that.   If this was Buddy Hield or some shit they wouldnt care.
"Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, and Richaun Holmes are all better than whoever OKC is rolling out unless Dort plays."
"Worse, we kept  buddy Hield"
"two very different players imo, but thybulle at this second in time is better due to his defensive value  i'm a believer that nesmith's ceiling is, like, buddy hield on offense with marcus smart/patbev defensive effort. he's not incredibly quick with his first step or long so he's definitely capable of being driven by, but he recovers well and plays both very intelligently and hard. never going to be a top defender, but his efforts and overall capabilities on defense will be a plus. it's the offense that is his value imo, especially the shooting. also he's a really nice guy"
Buddy Hield 4 years 84  Cristiano Felicio 4 years 32 (though its finally expiring this offseason)
"LeBron has played 10,811 playoff minutes, which is more than the regular season minutes any player from the 2016 draft class except Buddy Hield (10,906). He has more playoff minutes than Cody Zeller's regular season minutes, and he was drafted in 2013. More than Clint Capela, Rodney Hood, Joe Harris, and TJ Warren who have been in the league for seven years. More than Kelly Oubre or D'Angelo Russell. More than anyone from 2017 even if you include their playoff minutes.  Crazy durability."

Oh fuck you buddy hield
This ain't  over! We still got Buddy Hield so we can flush this np
Who in the league shows more teeth than Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield
"Bogi has had a good stretch of games lately but he's just as inconsistent as Hield, without the off-ball movement and constant respect teams give his shot. Go look at Bogi's game log from last season and sort by FG% in ascending order, he had some absolute stinkers where he would completely shoot the Kings out of games. With hindsight, I wish the Kings hadn't paid Buddy if they were going to hire Luke to use him the way he has, but Bogi would not be any better for this team."
"you don’t know me, i fuck would have destroyed that fan   yes i’m Buddy Hield"
Buddy Hield wasn't lol
"fools, buddy hield would never get praise like that. that quote is about Nik Stauskas"
Buddy consistently carries himself in a terrible way. I would want no part of Hield on the Raptors. Guy def sniffs his own farts.
Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield are trying their hardest to get yall a good lotto pick
Buddy Hield is an NBA 2K franchise GOD and you can trade pennies for him then average 10 3’s made a game. I build every expansion team around him.
"I mean withholding judgement for someone who’s genuinely struggling financially and trying to feed their family is one thing, Buddy Hield making public comments like this when he’s recently signed a $94 million dollar contract is another thing lol."
As a laker fan I'm asking any kings fans out there if anyone feels that maybe Walton isn't utilizing hield very well at all? I've seen several kings games this season and every time I'm watching it seems like Luke purposely draws up plays that just don't include buddy hield at all? It's proven that this man CAN make shots but I never ever see him given fair opportunity . It seems like he gets most of his points off fast breaks or last second shot clock heaves but I could be wrong
Vivek has a crush on Buddy Hield tho right. Then it makes sense . Vivek is the galaxy-brained dbag from the Malcom Gladwell book who thought he was a great basketball genius because he made his daughters elementary school team play a press D. It was successful so he thought he could hack the NBA the same way
"It's been a pretty astounding experience watching ""OU Buddy Hield"" transform into Sacramento Buddy Hield.  Fair to say I didn't see this coming!"
"Buddy Hield anyone? Think about it, with him on the team we finally have somebody to make open 3 pointers in the clutch!"
"I love the Lakers and I usually defend them from these losers but this was a very disappointing game. how did the kings drop 32 points on the best defense in the fourth quarter? Drummond is legitimately terrible. The Kings should've been an easy win to build confidence. instead, you have everyone bricking three's, allowing layups, and just throwing the ball away. Gasol was fantastic and Vogel just decided he wasn't worth going back to in the second half. More egregiously, Anthony Davis refuses to back down smaller guys in the post. He had Buddy Hield on him and just decided ""nah i'm good. I COULD get fouled but nah"". C'mon guys. There's no fight. No tenacity. How tf did a TERRIBLE Kings team fight harder than the DEFENDING champs. We have to do better. Also, I""m so tired of lakers fans looking down on everyone else. Idc if we won last year. stop bringing up the clippers, blazers, suns, and jazz. we have to work on ourselves before we can mock anyone. the season is passing us by."
And a Buddy Hield that went 1-11 lmaooo
Buddy Hield tried his hardest to preserve the tank
BACK DOWN BUDDY HIELD DAWG OMFG
Halliburton a damn stud.  Buddy Hield should start learning mandarin
Hali is amazing fam. Buddy Hield out here clowning.
AD had buddy hield on him in the post and what we got was a Drummond 15 foot brick.  This team deserves to lose.
Led by Buddy Hield  tank commander
Buddy Hield sucks but I assume you know that already
 BUDDY. FUCKING. HIELD. Trash.
Buddy Hield himself is a problem lol.
Joerger had problems with the players iirc. Specifically Buddy Hield
"The problem is he allowed his GM to suddenly hire Luke without interviewing anyone else. Basically after the Lakers fired Luke, it was all but a formality for Vlade to sign him, and Vivek allowed that to happen despite coaches such as Messina (who wanted the job btw), Monty Williams, and others being available.  Open his checkbook you say? It's in his regime that we (1) traded IT for cash considerations and Alex Oriakhi instead of resigning him after a 20ppg season (2) traded Boogie instead of giving him the supermax (which in hindsight worked out well but for unfortunate reasons), (3) lost Bogdan for nothing after promising him that the team would ""run it back"" and give him an extension. And when he did open his checkbook, it's to give vets overpriced contracts (Hill, Joseph, Dedmon, etc), to pay for coaches that have been fired, and to overpay Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes (to some extent).  I can't fault him for wanting to bring out a winning team, but the problem is he ""believes"" that this team is capable of making the playoffs in each of his years here, hence the making of short-sighted moves to ""win now"". The only year I had hope we'd make it was Joerger's final year, and he managed to fuck that up by thinking a coach that was giving tough love to his players wasn't worth a pay raise. I'm hoping he gives Monte the chance to tear it all down and start fresh, but if he doesn't, then we're stuck in this ""mid-lottery team that thinks the playoffs is close"" level of play."
Going to be a lot harder to get rid of Buddy Hield.
"imagine picking Lonzo Ball, Harrison Barnes, or Buddy Hield when anyone else is available.  this is worse than Kings picking Bagley"
"Right? Even if we're playing like ""fit"" is something you apply to superstars instead of role players....why not just upgrade our number 2? Oh, right. Because Buddy Hield shoots 3's"
Buddy Hield is not a top 20 all time player Bro
I think you can argue Steph Curry wants it more than a Buddy Hield.  Some Players do want it more than other players but idk if that makes you a ¨Killer¨
"Westbrook is 29th for guards in contested rebound percentage, worse than Buddy Hield who only takes 3s. If his bigs arnt clearing out hes a pretty mediocre rebounder."
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
"are you trying to argue this wasn't a blunder? I don't understand. If the ball goes to KAT at the three point line with a defender already on him then you just have to play defense well and you'd rather someone else take the shot. If the ball goes to dlo under the basket you lose the game, which they did. There's no deeper level here, it's an open and shut mistake.  He wasn't even in range to get to KAT anyway, he was like five feet away when the inbound pass was made. How can it be a good play if it was physically impossible for him to even achieve his goal of getting to KAT?  This is like saying ""players like steph don't just turn the ball over to buddy hield under the basket for no reason. Steph intended to give it to buddy"". The greatest players of all time still make mistakes"
"Klay, and Kyle Korver are great Buddy Hield as well"

"Shame on Oubre and JTA. What the fuck are they doing? I can't believe nobody goes to help the guy who just got trapped underneath his own basket with 15 seconds left. Oubre even looks back and sees Steph fucked and just keeps trotting over half court, and JTA is eyes-on the entire play. Stupid, but thankfully Buddy Hield sweats vaseline from his hands...jeez."

yes but this may be the most Buddy Hield of all Buddy Hield fumbles.
That shit by Buddy Hield right there. That's what pressure does to a player.
ESPN tomorrow: Reports are that Tyrese Haliburton has locked Buddy Hield in a bathroom screaming what can you improve on.

Fuck you buddy hield
I hate buddy hield so much
HERE COMES BUDDY HIELD!
Buddy “the black Omri Casspi” Hield
"Yeah I knew that, I thought it was funny  And 1 thing I’ve found out about Buddy Hield since seeing him play in March Madness and now the league is that he’s a good dude 👍🏽"
"Buddy ""Next Steph ""Bully"" Curry"" Hield"
Buddy Hield has no right to bully rookies.  Never played on a team with a winning record. Guy is a loser.
"Buddy Hield, who has never thrown a pass in his career, talking about passing."
If this video made you hate Buddy Hield you must hate a lot of people.
"Buddy ""next steph curry"" Hield"
"Not sure if you’re listing him as 29 because he will be later this year, but he’s currently 28. Same age as Brogdon and Buddy Hield. Not a huge deal, but is not like he’ll be 30 next season."
Maybe Buddy Hield level if he was at the same level as a couple years ago
"If buddy hield didn’t hit that buzzer beater, I think catching the TWolves would actually be viable. Now I’m not so sure."
Off balance? That's no problem that's Buddy Hield
"""Buddy Hield better"""
Buddy Hield
"Kawhi is falling apart. Beginning to be glad we didn't get Kawhi (won the chip anyway), even though AD is also made of glass, he's following Bron's workouts to a T and supposed to use those pillow bag exercises to strengthen his chicken legs.     Next year with Myles Turner rumors and sign-and-trade Shroeder, Kuzma, THT, and (sadly) Caruso all sought after targets (Thunder/Kings really want Kuz for some reason), Buddy Hield would have open shots all day."
Buddy Hield. I maintain that would be very productive on a playoff team. He just needs to get traded already.
"Yeah Oklahoma's supporting cast tends to be ass but at least Buddy Hield carried them to the final 4 when he was there  Maybe it's because I watch a lot of baseball where hot starts and flame outs are pretty common but I like seeing sustained success for a few years before confirming that he is actually good.  Definitely not laughing as hard at the hawks for trading Luka now though, even if he is still the better player."
Trade for Buddy Hield and move on from Tingus Pingus.
Buddy Hield ?
We have a need but not from Buddy fucking Hield lol that contract is garbage  Also Hield is absolutely a defensive liability
"My gf once asked me if the Kings would be good now that they had Bobby Dill. I later figured out she meant Buddy Hield, but I still call him Bobby Dill.  And for the UFC she called Yoel Romero, Jose Alvarez so Jose Alvarez he is."
"&gt;Why do a trade that doesn’t actually improve your roster?   I've already explained to you how it does improve the roster, on the margin they are better with Harrell and Kuzma than just Hield. It just doesn't fix all of their problems with the team which seems to be your argument. It solves their issue of a really shallow frontcourt. Harrell and Kuzma are fine 6th and 7th men at their price point.  Buddy Hield is a negative contract. You aren't going to get much better than that with it. No one is giving you a FRP with it."
"Front court depth is not nothing especially when the Kings had a historically terrible bench.  Harrell is a great regular season 6th man and the Kings are concerned with getting to the playoffs.  That might not be much, but Buddy Hield is literally solving nothing for the Kings right now as is"
"Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, and a 1st"
"I'll go with Sacramento.  Kings draft Cade and ship DeAaron Fox and Buddy Hield to Clippers for Paul George + Pick.  Bagley + Clippers Pick to Pacers for Myles Turner.     **Starting lineup:** Cade, Halliburton, Paul George, Barnes, Myles Turner"
Why would he though? We already had Buddy Hield for shooting so it really wouldn't make sense to pick Trae Young and it's not like SGA was getting hype pre draft.
"I know there's a lot that went wrong with the Kings but I still can't believe how little they got back in that Boogie trade.   He was averaging 27 ppg and 11 rebs at 26 years old in the peak of his prime and was traded for Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, 1 first-round pick, 1 second-round pick."
"Honestly, we would take any shooter on the Knicks. Give us Buddy Hield!"
"in before ""bu-bu-but, we have young asserts in Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox""   no, you don't... gtfo"
The buddy hield trade is the only one that is kind of realistic here lol. Actually the kings already have Fox and Haliburton. Why would they trade for Kemba?
To think the kings could have had him luka and fox and instead they end up with fox bagley and buddy hield 🤨
Awwww sorry your max player sucks and you may have to trade him for buddy hield... if you’re lucky
"I don’t think you would have to attach assets to move him but I could be wrong. I don’t think KP is ina similar category as Love,Horford, or Wall. You won’t get full value in any trade but I think a trade where you can get something back that fits better around Luka and free up some cap like maybe with the kings for Buddy Hield. Kings don’t attract talent and KP would be a good fit with Fox. I’d be worried about relying on KP to stay healthy through a season enough to trade him"
"I'd maybe consider it for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley.  We turn two cancers into just one, and since we're losing Holmes probably with no way to replace his production, I'd still have more faith in Zinger to be an important piece than I would Bagley."
"This happens even with players that put up good stats in one category but are awful in a team offense since they struggle to contribute without the ball in their hands. See Buddy Hield or Andre Drummond, two offensively limited and defensively terrible players that got overpaid by bad franchises."
I think  a KP for Buddy Hield  framework would benefit both sides.
"Buddy Hield actually isn’t a bad call at all. Plus, it’s the Kings, so they might be drawn to KP’s potential upside, if only for the fact that he’s still a fairly well-known name."
I could see the Kings possibly with Buddy Hield or maybe the hornets
KP for Buddy Hield
Yes better if they wait for the next inevitable injury and sell when his value is even lower.  Hes a sunk cost. He doesnt mesh with their star.  Sell him for Buddy Hield and move the fuck on.
"Get Holmes, maybe trade for someone like Buddy Hield? Maybe someone else? Trade KP if we can"
Portland and Sacramento will be suitors to look at for Porzingis. Porzingis for Buddy Hield + whatever to make contracts match. Hield probably doesn't want to be there. Porzingis for CJ McCullom. Looks like the Blazers want to move McCullom. There's probably others out there but those are the ones that come to mind from the get go. Minny perhaps. Malik Beasley and other junk for Porzingis. Pelicans maybe.

"Nate Archibald and Buddy Hield. Nate was young, short, and had a habit to penetrate into the paint welcoming contact from guys a foot taller and 50+ pounds heavier than him playing Wilt level minutes. Thats gonna end badly, and it did. From what ive heard those minutes were a main part in his injury plauged and early peak career"
Kings need a guy like that for Buddy Hield too cuz they both kill us
Let’s ask Buddy Hield
Even if the Boogie trade had Buddy Hield.
"Fine, I’ll take a used buddy hield"
Shout out to Buddy Hield.
I wonder if there’s a pathway to trading them buddy Hield. It seems like both parties are ready to move on but that contract from Porzingis is horrendous.
"I agree but not like a 'rebuild.' Like, let's reboot the series with a reimagined cast and a gritty tone, I want a Christopher Nolan Batman-verse/CW Powerpuff Girls-style Kings franchise.  Buddy Hield kills a guy in this one and the rest of the team has to make it to the playoffs to win money for his legal team."
I think some team would take him if you're willing to take someone like Buddy Hield or Oladipo in return.
I’d prefer Marcus Smart over buddy Hield. It’s not really close neither
What happened to buddy hield? I thought he was highly thought of 1 year ago
THJ is playing out of his mind right now and did so in the second half of the season too.  I love Buddy hield as well.
"There are very few contracts in the NBA I wouldn't trade for Buddy Hield, but Kristaps is one of them."
We already have a Buddy Hield at home!
Buddy Hield has a big ass contract for being a basically Duncan Robinson.
Can you get Buddy Hield for KP?
* Buddy Hield * Kelly Oubre Jr * LaMelo Ball
"Sure thing. I’ll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
Buddy Hield is a great answer tho
So far we've had everything from Ricky Rubio to Buddy Hield. Guess I'll chip in with Javale McGee.
Buddy Hield
Yeah the one time I did a deep dive it was either 2017 or 2018 and your banner said “The Buddy Hield Factory” or something and I made a post saying I liked the Hawks (as a Celtics fan) in the off season and everyone told me to fuck off and I got downvoted a lot  I didn’t like my experience but I respected you guys for it
Ayo kings fans what would you guys want for buddy hield
Is buddy hield that bad? How’s his defense?
"Luke Kennard is only guaranteed  40 mil over then next 3 years. Buddy Hield at 24 mil, Oladipo at 21 mil, and Gary Harris at 19 mil are guys with larger contracts. Give me Gary Harris on this one."
"PG: John Wall SG: Buddy Hield SF: Andrew Wiggins PF: Kevin Love C: Stephen Adams  Wall and Love are self explanatory.   Buddy has a long contract with a big dollar amount and so far has come up short of earning it. Sacramento has guys they will need to pay and will want to have space to add pieces as their young guys grow. With Hield underperforming, that will be tough.  Wiggins isn’t terrible and gives GS a lot on D. Still, he’s not a star and he uses a lot of cap space on a team trying to contend. Based on situation, he’s the worst. There’s an argument for Hayward based on his health track record over the past several seasons.   Adams is kind of similar. He’s a good, overpaid player whose long term contract with a lot owed will make it tough for the Pelicans to build around their young guys and win in the West. Horford is also a candidate, but his contract isn’t hurting the Thunder much."
I mean Buddy Hield exists so…
"Him, Oubre, Buddy Hield, etc are up there for sure."
"As much as we’d like to move Hield, any trades centered around buddy would be to free cap space so we can resign Holmes and possibly Davis rather than take on an injury prone front court player to pair with Bagley."
For Buddy Hield. He still wants out right?
KP and a pick for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley
"Yeah I remember listening to Boston sports radio the night of the draft and everyone was pissed. I was one of them ngl, I thought we should have taken Buddy Hield"
"Maybe, if Buddy Hield didn't exist"
The Buddy Hield (x3) is probably the most surprising to me
"Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, Marvin Bagley"
"IMHO Kawhi should opt out and sign with Sacramento. Kings have not one but two fantastic point guards that will help him get easier shots.  Better yet Kawhi should try to swing a sign and trade and that sends Buddy Hield, Bagley plus draft pick in return for Kawhi."
Buddy Hield said the same thing before disappearing in the bubble last year.
*cries in Buddy Hield*
Bertans makes me think we got Buddy Hield on team friendly deal
Bogdan is a better player than Buddy Hield. The Kings fucked up once more.
"You could probably get Wiseman, Wiggins and a first out of him  maybe Ben Simmons   D Lo and two firsts   Buddy Hield and a few firsts   CJ McCollum and a few firsts"
The disrespect to Buddy Hield is unheard of 😤
"Very few casual fans could tell you Buddy Hield won the 3-point contest last year, and even fewer could tell you Joe Harris won the year before."
"Maybe somewhere inbetween Buddy Hield and Mike Conley. Not an all-star but a bonafide starter whose skillset was considered very valuable. He was a top 10 pick out of UNC, won a 3-point contest, and was a big part of a decently popular team in the 90's.  It's difficult to compare popularity since there are so many more NBA fans nowadays, but Kenny was probably top 50-100 most well known players in the 90's."
1. Buddy Hield dribbling  2. Justin James trying to do anything  3. Remembering that Luke Walton is our coach
I had a buddy who went to OU and he said people didn’t care / respect Trae Young. I found it hard to believe but he said it’s just a football school and explained how Baker got sooooo much more love and attention.  Seems like people knew Trae was a stud but also he’d only be there for one year. I’m pretty sure he’s a Norman kid so it feel like he would get more respect. I did feel like Buddy Hield got more love from OU but that’s probably Bc they were really good his Junior/Senior seasons.
Now I see why Boston didn't want to give him up in a trade for Buddy Hield / Harrison Barnes lol
Buddy Hield for Dame Lillard trade incoming??? /s
We won’t see LeBron and Steph every single year in a play-in. People wanna look forward to watching Buddy Hield and Ja next year?
He’s younger than Buddy Hield as well
"Yeah lol they’ve been phenomenal. I only made the comment cause everytime a player comes out and says something about how their team should be taken seriously or how their team is great, they tend to go on bad runs, and then someone makes a post on Reddit like: “the kings are 0-8 since buddy Hield said that the kings should not be seen as an easy matchup” or something like that"
"that shit was so funny. Dream scenario for a team desperate for shooters (and any passable wing talent) like every year, jamal murray and buddy hield both drop to 5, but no... not on our watch."
There was only one good play-in game and it was because it featured a contender that was dealing with injuries all season  Most years you're gonna get Buddy Hield vs DeMar DeRozan or Sexton vs Rozier
Buddy Hield is 28 and makes 24 mil a year to score 16 ppg and not play defense. Come on bruh
"I've shit on the kings for passing on Luka just as much as the next redditor, and rightly so. But keep in mind I made my point with that mindset as well. Luke Walton is really bad. But I like Fox better than Murray or anyone the Spurs have. Buddy Hield is a solid piece too."
Luke Walton really messed up the development of Buddy Hield imo. Buddy had pretty good potential
"Yeah, if they were to hypothetically do it this offseason, I'm pretty sure the Kings wouldn't protect Buddy Hield. I wonder if someone like John Wall would be protected. Even though the contracts aren't great, the longest contracts are 5 years now, so if they manage to get someone 3 years in, maybe the expiring contract can be a tradeable asset to make it worthwhile.  The only worry would be new owners maybe not wanting to pay that much for those guys without competing and right after paying massive expansion fees."
"TIL: Curry, Klay, Lillard, LaVine, Tatum, Buddy Hield, and Luka, aren't good players"
"Walton's like the optical illusion of the old maid and the young woman. Depending on how you look at his track record, it could be good or bad.  * Led the Warriors to a record start and won coach of the month/ Had a stacked roster and didn't need to do much * Led the Lakers to three consecutive improved seasons with a young, inexperienced roster / Should have done better with the talent at his disposal * Started off with a winning record before LeBron got injured / didn't make the playoffs with a LeBron James team * Has the 2nd-best win percentage in Kings franchise history, respected by Kings players and front office / still a losing record and no playoffs with Fox, Hield, Barnes, and Holmes * Showed promise and earned his HC gigs / rode the Warriors' coattails to the Lakers job and was hired by his buddy Vlade at the Kings  Essentially, this boils down to Walton never having a full season with a good roster to actually prove whether or not he's a good coach. Until then, you have to decide whether winning 35 games with mediocre players is evidence of success or failure."
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
They passed on:  Jamal Murray  Buddy Hield  Pascal Siakam  Dejounte Murray  Sabonis
"The problem is that in his time with Sacramento, Walton has shown ZERO improvements in his ability to coach.     He constantly makes poor line-up decisions and the team regressed from a passable defensive team under Joerger to an abomination with Walton. The truly sad part about that is that Walton had pretty much the same roster.     He inherited an easy blueprint from Joerger: push the pace and destroy teams in transition. The Kings were number one in pace under Joerger (a coach who came from grit N grind Memphis and saw that he had to adapt) and were bottom 10 with Walton, who tried to institute a complex Warriors scheme and slowed things down.     He has no authority and doesn't hold players accountable at all. Buddy Hield should have been benched this year in favor of Haliburton but somehow Walton was the only one who didn't see that this was a correct move.     Speaking of Buddy, Walton tried to turn him into something he is not: A pick and roll creator. The amount of games the Kings have lost over the last 2 seasons because Walton forced plays to Buddy as a creator are definitely in the 20s. Large stretches of games where the other team would rattle off an 11-0 run while Buddy coughed up the ball for several turnovers.     The Kings have had MULTIPLE 7+ game losing streaks under Walton (I think the official tally is 5)     While I do agree to some extent that coaches should be given time to improve and develop, this should only be the case if the team is trending in the right direction. Brad Stevens (just as one example) and his Celtics teams showed clear signs of a team on the rise: players knowing their roles, players working hard on D etc. which is why Boston allowed him the time to stay. Same with Stotts in Portland, Casey in Toronto, Malone in Denver, and so on. Under Luke Walton the Kings have regressed and at this point I don't think its likely he figures it out at all. Could he? Maybe, but I think its more likely he continues to be a trainwreck"
“I’d bet my house on us making the playoffs this year”   Buddy Hield prior to not even being close to making the playoffs
That Joerger team was playoff bound that season until he got sabotaged midway too. FO meddling to make him play Bagley and Buddy Hield and trading away an important member of that team in Shumpert.
Luka's talent would've forced the team to make drastic changes like we did.  Also maybe Buddy Hield would stop dribbling.
&gt; I think he could easily play up to that contract if he weren't on the kings  Buddy Hield has no idea how to play defense at an NBA level
Yeah he’s bad. Rotations are atrocious.  We had to watch Corey Joseph play waaaay too much this season. Buddy Hield has regressed under Luke and Bogdanovic was not used correctly.
LeBron to Kings for Buddy Hield lol.
"They've been out of the playoffs for a decade and a half and I just don't see their current roster changing that. The West is just too damn competitive. They had a great thing going with Joerger at the helm but they messed that up.   Lakers, Mavs, Warriors, Nuggets, Clippers, Grizzlies, Suns, Blazers, Jazz - there's 9 teams right there and I'd still take the injured Clippers and Nuggets over them.  I'd consider bottoming out - Fox and Hield are the only two pieces that really matter (maybe Bagley if they're still high on him). Barnes has some solid trade value.   Richaun Holmes is a UFA who is probably looking for a bag, but he's not worth overpaying because he's a big reason of why their defense is so miserable. They went through this situation already with Buddy Hield and they shouldn't do it again.   Get what value you can off of your vets and hope you don't mess up this time with your high draft picks because the alternative of doing what you're doing now isn't getting you anywhere."
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
"They'd have to make a lot of moves to get another legit playmaker. Not impossible, but some work needs to be done.  My guess: S&amp;T Schroeder for basically any decent 3 pt shooter, package their 1st round pick and matching salary like they did last year to acquire Schroeder (Buddy Hield?), MLE for someone like Otto Porter maybe (?), and then re-sign Caruso/THT"
None of these players are “trash” but they’re definitely not as good as advertised.   PG: D’Angelo Russell/Russell Westbrook  SG: Buddy Hield/Colin Sexton  SF: R.J Barrett/Andrew Wiggins  PF: Marvin Bagley/Julius Randle  C: Domantas Sabonis/Whiteside
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
"Maybe this is unpopular, idk, but I think Buddy Hield is fairly legit. Overpaid, but I don't think he's straight empty calories"
So Buddy Hield
"The Kings do, send him to Sacremento and the Blazers get: Haliburton, Maxey, Thybulle, plethora of picks, maybe buddy hield to make contracts work."
"I would only take Drummond and his brick hands if we could send him down to the G League for practice.   Sign and trade Schroder for anything.   Retain THT and Alex Caruso, ideally Ben Mclemore on a minimum as well.   TJ McConnell would be a nice pickup on the MLE, but I don’t know if he will come that cheap.   Figure out some sort of way to trade for Myles Turner or Buddy Hield if it’s possible"
buddy hield and (bagley for klove)?
"No joke, Buddy Hield would be great for their team. The problem with Buddy is when he is the number 1 defensive priority, he kinda gets fucked there.  He is a great shooter, and that is what the 76ers need."
It’s like the spirit of Buddy Hield has possessed Chris Paul tonight. This is some SLOPPY ball handling
Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley aren’t worth more than Simmons’ left hand  76ers would be really stupid to trade for them
"Here’s my take on all this:  Despite winning a ring, the lakers have done just about the opposite of what you want to do when building a lebron team. The AD acquisition was obviously great, but the Cleveland formula is the obvious one to follow: lebron, 1 big, and 3 shooters. Putting 2 bigs on the floor with bron in the championship year was interesting and it could work because both Dwight and McGee were lob threats, but even that team wasn’t so great offensively.   Lonzo isn’t a solution to their problems, and I don’t really think it’s worth the assets they’d have to give up for him. Of the players they have, the only ones I’d really want to keep are: bron, AD, Caruso, Wes matthews on a minimum, Marc gasol if he wants to stay, and KCP. Everyone wants them to hit a home run this off-season, but i even think an off-season where rhey could get kemba, mcdermott, maybe buddy hield and a lob threat center would make them significantly better. It’d be tough to pull off all of that obviously, but easier than getting Kyle Lowry I think."
"How is buddy hield, and assets you can flip for another win now player, less appealing than ben simmons. If you want beal or lillard or some other star in the next 2 offseasons, 3 SAC firsts and bagley are worth more than simmons to any potential team. They aren’t saddled with a simmons reclamation project on a bad contract, and have more flexibility with those assets. How is that so hard to understand?"
"yeah that's a good breakdown, well done. I'd add that Thad Young has been incredible for the Bulls since joining the starting lineup. Easily 2nd best player on the team, with great advanced stats to back up his play.  I don't really know why people were that excited for Lauri. He could shoot a bit, and that was pretty much it. If you can't do anything but shoot on offense, you better shoot like JJ Redick, Klay, Duncan Robinson, etc. Lauri's never even been close to that good. Teams don't even want Buddy Hield, an excellent shooter, because of how limited the rest of his game is relative to his contract. That's just the NBA"
&gt; Simmons is the only piece that can potentially net the Sixers another star player.    THEN WHY WOULD WE TRADE HIM FOR BUDDY FUCKING HIELD??? Bruh that shit is just dumb as hell if the goal is a championship lmao
"I made this trade in the trade machine a 3 team trade.  76ers get:  Terry Rozier  Buddy Hield  resign Danny Green  Zeller (s&amp;t 3 years 3 million each year)  2 unprotected picks from Sac. 2023 and 2025.  &amp;#x200B;  Kings get:   Ben Simmons  &amp;#x200B;  Hornets get:  Bagley  Thybulle  First round 2021 kings.  &amp;#x200B;  The Hornets get a young guys and the first, they lose their best SG in the team which it has a ton of value after last season.   76ers get 2 unprotected (that can trade to improve even more) Rozier and Buddy Hield, 2 good shooters that have a lot of value they can still trade them to improve or keep em both or one of them. They get Zeller really as a salary thing and also backup Center.  Kings Ben Simmons."
Yeah I feel like including more than one unprotected first round pick with any player like Buddy Hield or better is over paying.  Edit: I guess I like this trade if two of the picks are lottery protected.
you think Marcus bagley and buddy hield for ben simmons is a good trade?
Any Kings fans have insight as to why Buddy Hield is coming up in trade talks? I thought he was a great player. Does he actually suck?
"I've been preaching this for years now, but Philly should have been taking trade offers for Simmons way before now. Very realistic shots at Kawhi and Harden. And I'm sure other players.  Does Kawhi just stay in Philly for one year? Probably. He stayed only one year in Toronto. And I will let you guess how many titles the Raptors won that year compared to the Sixers. Also, worth mentioning, Philly is now considering trading Simmons for *Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield!* Not like keeping Simmons was some power move.  If Philly does trade Simmons, they just have to accept they will get back another terrible contract and a couple decent role players."
"If Buddy Hield was tall enough, he would be called Buddy Hill"
Could Buddy Hield become Buddy Shield by Buddy Steal?
It's too bad Buddy Hield isn't a bigot because then he could be Buddy Deep Left Field
"The fact that the Kings have now missed the playoffs for 15 straight years makes one feel bad for Buddy Hield, because he deserves to be in the Playoffs!"
"You are correct, but I more meant this dude was almost traded for Harden, now he might net Buddy Hield."
They are giving up Simmons.  Unless you think they are trading Simmons for Buddy Hield 1 for 1
The only way I even consider this trade is if there is an agreed upon plan in place on where to route those 3 Firsts for a high tier ball handler.   Hield would be a nice player to have but this does absolutely nothing to solve our issue of not having a perimeter playmaker. You can’t start a backcourt of Seth Curry and Buddy Hield. That’s just flat out not going to work.
"Exactly. Who scores on that theoretical team? I swear, this sub loves efficiency so much that they sometimes forget that you actually do need to *use* possessions.   Say the Kings were to trade Fox straight-up for Simmons. Who leads that team in scoring? Buddy Hield? Marvin Bagley (can you even play Bagley and Simmons at the same time?)? Is a team whose leading scorer is Hield or Bagley ever, in a million years, making the playoffs in the West?"
Ah yes the finals contender: Philadelphia 76ers sure are licking their lips at the chance to add MARVIN BAGLEY and Buddy Hield.
His trade value currently is someone in the CJ McCollum/Malcolm Brogdon/Buddy Hield/D'Angelo Russell category.  Not sure any of those guys put the Sixers over the top though.
Buddy Hield
"Assuming dame is off the table, who's available? Dlo, Lowry, John Wall maybe, kemba, drose maybe, buddy hield"
CJ is the only one I can think of. Maybe Lowry in a sign and trade or Pascal if the beef they had during the season is still going on. Then you start downgrading to guys who aren’t all stars like Buddy Hield and San Antonio’s guards
"Yep. Philly really needs a ball handler to come back in any Simmons trade, and Buddy Hield sure ain't that."
"Instructions unclear, Buddy Hield is now wearing a Sixers jersey"
Buddy Hield n Marvin Bagley for Ben n Maxie
"Unfortunately for the Bahamanians, Klay played for Team USA in the 2016 Olympics in Rio, which should render him ineligible to represent any other nation. There are some exceptions in the FIBA bylaws that could be pursued, the one that seems most likely to apply would be:  &gt; ...in exceptional circumstances the Secretary General may authorise such a player [who has represented another nation at the senior level after his 17th birthday] to play for the national team of his country of origin if he is ineligible to play for such country according to this article 3-23 and if this is in the interest of the development of basketball in this country.  I could see the argument that adding a player like Klay to their National Team roster could contribute to the development of basketball in The Bahamas. Having said that, it's not actually Klay's ""country of origin."" Mychal Thompson is the one from The Bahamas. Klay was born in LA and grew up back and forth between there and Oregon. So it's kind of a stretch.  But the Bahamas could still field a roster with Buddy Hield, Deandre Ayton, and some of the lesser Thompsons."
He's rock solid for us.  Ideal as a bench player but we're probably gonna be moving Buddy Hield and TD can mitigate the spacing lost from that hypothetical while playing superior defense.

Ask the Kings.. they benched Buddy Hield.. they didn’t even let him take the last 3 point shot for the win when he was the 3 pointer shooting contest champ..
"Lopsided? Doesn’t matter, Buddy Hield"
Trade Buddy Hield for Kuz
Buddy Hield
"De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, and Tyrese Haliburton for Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, and 28 overall."
Bledsloe + pick for buddy hield. Could really help out the spacing for the pelicans
They have buddy hield now but there are talks he might get traded
"I don't get how Buddy is seen as ""not a starter"" by so many people??  If JJ Redick could start on super good Clippers *and* Sixers teams, there is absolutely no reason Hield as an even better shooter and much bigger player shouldn't be seen as the same. He hit 4 threes a game last year on 39%. And nobody can call him a great defender but it's not like Sacramento is in any position to make him look anything but bad with the system and players around him.   Some of these comments are talking about Harrison Barnes being a better option, but how does that make any sense?? I just don't understand and would like someone to explain."
I feel like they were on track to rebound but then they hired Luke Walton because he did soooooo good in LA 🙄.  I like Fox and Halliburton but they need to get Buddy Hield outta there.
"Not happening. Besides Fox and Haliburton, the Kings' player I'd value the most is Harrison Barnes, not Buddy Hield. Adams isn't going anywhere, partly because of what he brings and partly because of contract extension trade rules. The player would have to be Bledsoe."
Buddy Hield and #39 for #10 and Steven Adams?
Buddy Hield
"Buddy Hield, Bagley and a pick sounds more realistic at this point"
"It’d probably be Buddy Hield being the 20ppg scorer still, not Kuzma."
As a lakers fan I think a guy who could score and shoot at an elite level would help us more than anything so maybe buddy hield or Cj McCollum   I don't know though
Buddy Hield at SG
"Fire everyone.. fire the owner, fire the GM, fire the coach. Fire Marvin Bagley dad. Fire Buddy Hield mom.. fire them all."
Porzingis is in the mix  Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley for KP?
Imagine the kings picking Buddy Hield over Bogdan lol
I always felt AD deserved more of the blame for those Pelicans teams underperforming year after year. He wasn't some victim unjustly suffering on a terrible team like he was painted out to be  The Pelicans did as good a job getting guys around him as a team in an undesirable market like NOLA could. The Boogie trade was a huge acquisition and all they really gave up of any real value was Buddy Hield. Giving Tyreke that contract was the only real major misstep they made to me
Buddy Hield for Pope and Kuz

Wasnt Buddy Hield out playing Tennis when he was supposed to be quarantining?
"Completely different.  1. Jaylen got paid less than Buddy Hield. He wasn't given close to a rookie max unless you think 20m and 30m are close.   2. Jaylen only averaged 13ppg because he got stuck on a team with too many mouths. The season before he also was also a leading piece on a historically successful young team.   * The Celtics were tied for 2nd most successful regular-season team with an average age under 25 (tied with OKC's Big 3 and 1 game behind Kareem's Bucks)  * He was the #2 scorer on our team behind Kyrie and then the #1 scorer after Kyrie went down  * He broke the record for youngest Celtic to ever score 30 in the playoffs and then also took 2nd place   * Outside of the games he was hurt / on minute restrictions he was actually our leading scorer on a playoff team that got within 1 game of the finals  3. Jaylen was also getting All-D votes early on.   That being said, Collins deserves to get paid. He's fantastic."
"Most of these are pretty solid. I’d say Suggs is more Holiday, less shooting but more athleticism. Barnes to me is more like a bigger Draymond/rich mans Rondae Hollis Jefferson to me. Not very sold on Moody, he’s probably more like Dorian Finney-Smith. Sengun to me is more like a better passing Kanter or Boban, skilled and big post scorer but lacking in other areas very important to the NBA game. Maybe ceiling Al Jefferson. Davion is most similar to Donovan in play style. Kispert maybe more similar to Buddy Hield but Joe Harris not bad overall as a comp. Bouknight and Ellis is fine. Giddey is more of a budget Kyle Anderson"

If you could sign Dinwiddie on a decent deal and get rid of Buddy Hield it would be an upgrade still.   You guys need help down low and on the wings bad though.
"Jimmer, Kemba, buddy hield"
Yeah not a chance they get Buddy Hield without giving up that first round pick. Taking on Kuz/Harrell only worth it (assuming Harrell opts in) if they get that pick value back. Lakers 2nds are worthless.
"He moved to the US to play high school prep ball. There aren’t enough eyes looking for basketball talent in the Bahamas, and the infrastructure for basketball training is non-existent. All three of the successful Bahamian NBA players played high school basketball in the United States (Buddy Hield, Mychal Thompson aka Klay’s dad, and Ayton)."
It should be if you played more than 50% of your rookie contract for a team you count as homegrown. So if you get drafted to say the Kings and after your first year they feel you’re a miss and include you in a package to San Antonio and they develop you into a star they can keep you. Or like how Buddy Hield got traded from New Orleans to Sacramento after his rookie year.
Is Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield on the list?
I’m guessing they would have kept him if they could find someone to trade Buddy Hield to. But Hield at the 24 million he made this year is practically untradeable unless you’re salary dumping him.   The extension was unfortunate. They expected him to improve more but he is already at his ceiling. Great shooter but he can’t defend or create for others. He’s a Joe Harris type player
Kings made a mistake in giving $20 million to buddy hield so they felt cause of positional need they needed to let Bogdanovic walk
buddy hield
"Yeah knowing what we know now getting that pick is probably better, especially because it might be able to be packaged to get a good shooter like a Buddy Hield. But it’s just the way the league works, gotta work with what you have"
"&gt;Shaq was undeniably a better player.  I'm pretty sure you're judging every after 1992 instead of 92 itself when you say this. That's what the first pick in the draft is doing too. They definitely made the right pick but that's not what I'm talking about.   &gt;Was Trey Burkes the better college player than Victor Oladipo in 2013? Was Buddy Hield a better player in 2016 than Simmons or Ingram?  Haven't followed college basketball in a awhile but I would assume so, yes. If I was picking someone for a 2020 Olympic team I'd take Toppin and not James Wiseman."
Or you’re argument of “well he won college player of the year” is completely ignoring the fact that Shaq was undeniably a better player. Was Trey Burkes the better college player than Victor Oladipo in 2013? Was Buddy Hield a better player in 2016 than Simmons or Ingram?  The dream team was not a college accolades reward. It is meant for the best players. Shaq was a better player in 1992.
"&gt;Buddy Hield won the Naismith in 2016. Would he have deserved a USA roster spot over Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram?  Of course not, he's Bahamanian"
"Lol this sub is incapable of nuance I swear. Buddy Hield won the Naismith in 2016. Would he have deserved a USA roster spot over Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram? Of course not, because he was clearly a worse player despite winning that award."
Buddy Hield peaked in 2017 and we all know the deal with Bagley
"I think they just like garland more and they’d have to pay sexton and Allen while still paying love (he’s stealing money right)  They might like someone more in the draft and sexton has value in the league… like I could see him getting traded to the Knicks, he’s definitely a starter imo. I don’t think there’s a good fit for Drummond, I thought the Lakers were perfect for him but thats not how it turned to be. Buddy hield makes sense for a number of teams, but idk if he’s worth his contract"
"I would be. The Warriors are trying to make a point of holding onto Steph, Klay, and Draymond to try to encourage players in the future to want to stay there. Buddy Hield wants to start, because he is good enough to start, and the Warriors are never going to start him over Klay."
"I mean I guess the difference is Sexton seems to not be valued that highly by the Cavs themselves.   &amp;#x200B;  I can see your point though, I might have misunderstood the point of this thread. By your (and seemingly other's) definition I'd say Buddy Hield. Drummond it a good choice as well. Thanks for the clarification!"
"&gt; Does it?  It does when you combine the fact that they have a 1st round pick to trade alongside them. I'm willing to bet several rebuilding teams would be willing to take on some money over the next few years in exchange for a pick 22 in a deep draft.  &gt; What max/near max player are you getting with Kuzma and Harrell?  Kemba Walker, Buddy Hield, any impending FA on a team who wants a free first round pick for facilitating a S&amp;T."
"Kings were definitely mismanaged for years, but I wouldn't classify Jimmer and Bagley the same as I would Hield and Cousins. Buddy still plays hard and trains hard and Cousins tried to win for a long ass time but we just couldn't figure out the coach and roster around him. Both Jimmer and Bagley wanted everything handed to them and did fuck all since they got drafted."
"Could I interest you in a brand new 9th overall pick, a gently used Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley"
"Bah Gawd, is that Luke Walton’s music? Buddy Hield and 5 second rounders for Ben, and Luke gets a new player to blame for his mistakes"
Hate to tell you this but Ben Simmons is not worth Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield.
"this is awful  &gt; * Lakers get: Ben Simmons &gt; * 76ers get: Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley III &gt; * Kings get: Kyle Kuzma, Talen-Horton Tucker, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, first-round pick"
how about what Buddy Hield makes
But Jimmer is what Buddy Hield is today!  ... In China...
I would throw a Buddy Hield for him and something else
"It's crazy that since then Ray Allen's record has been surpassed by Duncan Robinson, Damian Lillard (2x), Buddy Hield (3x), Klay Thompson and James Harden (2x). And then there's Steph, who's done it 6 times."
The game is just different today than even ten years ago. This past year Buddy Hield made more 3s than Ray Allen ever did in his best year. Tatum is a lock to take the #1 spot from Pierce. Smart may end up #2 and Jaylen Brown will be close behind.
"All this Ben Simmons trade talk is wildly overvaluing him. His stock is probably at around the lowest it has been in a couple years on account of his playoff performance. I’m guessing they trade him for like Buddy Hield and a couple 1st’s or trade him plus all the picks until the end of the universe for Beal or Dame if either of them want out. Either way I think the package is going to reveal that everyone with real NBA jobs, including Morey, doesn’t value him as highly as reporters and fans do."
I've disliked Ben ever since he gave up in the second half of the LSU/Oklahoma game where Buddy Hield was allowed to do whatever he wanted  It seems like Ben doesn't ever put in the effort that he needs to really succeed. Dude is the dictionary definition of talented but coasting
"Yeah, for example, you think Kobe is the 3rd best player of all time!  Ok, sorry, I couldn't resist. But I don't really see why NBA players would automatically be smarter than everyone else when it comes to evaluating talent. They value different things. They have personal relationships with these players. And they generally eschew analytics, which is silly. Of course, they know a lot about basketball. A lot! But they're very protective of their own. They always want to see the positive. You've gotta be ruthless when evaluating talent in a sport like this where the cream of the crop is so much more valuable than everyone else, and overpaying the wrong guy is a death sentence for a franchise. Fuck, LeBron actually thought getting Russell Westbrook would be better than getting Buddy Hield."
This sub has been worthless to read regarding any Simmons stuff for months. There are people here who will legitimately sit there and argue he's negative value on his contract and we should have to give up assets to get rid of him. Then there's people who seem to think he's equivalent value to Buddy Hield which is laughable.
"Brandon Roy is someone I mention because he went 6th, ahead of All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, ahead of multiple high upside busts. But Roy was viewed, at the time anyway, as a can't miss starting quality player. He exceeded that obviously.  Very similar to what people were saying about Buddy Hield coming out of the draft. Who coincidentally also went 6th.  It's worth mentioning that NCAA player of the year winners have often amounted to very little, or sometimes nothing, in the NBA. Winners have included Tyler Hansbrough, Obi Toppin, Frank Mason, Frank Kaminsky, Jalen Brunson, etc. Lots and lots of guys that had zero business going 1st overall or even all that close to it.    Reddish has great shooting form and I always saw it as more of a decision making problem personally. I think he's going to figure it out and shoot a solid at least 34% eventually. He shoots over 80% from the FT line there's no way his 3 point percentage doesn't improve eventually."
"Projection is literally what the draft is.  If day 1 quality was all that mattered, Brandon Roy would have gone 1st. Buddy Hield would have gone 1st. Victor Oladipo goes 1st (good decision in this case). Marcus Smart might have gone 1st. Obi Toppin possibly goes 1st."

"No, not really.    By pick #6 the draft is becoming a lot more of a crapshoot.  Just at #6 the last few years - Okongwu (too early, but not the greatest start), Culver, Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac (good player but injury train wreck thus far), Buddy Hield, Willy Cauley Stein.  Like - that isn't exactly a shining crop of players at #6 last few years.  Even if you go back a few more years it's hit or (more) miss - Smart, Noel, Lillard, Veseley, Udoh, Johnny Flynn.  Long story short - I don't think anyone is even eligible for ""biggest busts in modern NBA history"" if they weren't a Top 3 pick."
Not really. For example like 80% of top ten three point shioters of all time are probably players from the 2010s.   Buddy Hield is a better three point shooter than Larry Burd and on more three point attempts.  You could make the argument that Larry would have taken more threes if he was in this era. But we all know the more shots you take the lower your percentage.   He could have trained and eventually become better than someone like Buddy Hield. But who knows.  In terms of three point shooting. Ray Allens prime is only slightly better than Buddy Hields career average performance in shooting threes.
Buddy Hield
"And buddy hield, those 3 are all top-5 3-pt specialists and Duncan’s getting paid the least"
&gt;SERIOUS: Did the Sixers make a mistake not trading Simmons plus a first plus Thybulle for Buddy Hield? What about their team chemistry?
"A basketball team is there for the basketball, not for the good chemistry.  It would look pretty stupid in 2023, to have traded Simmons for Buddy Hield to improve your chemistry in 2021"
People have memed Simmons to the point that folks are drawing up trade packages with buddy Hield as the centerpiece in the return offer  He’s a young all-nba guy
Did he get guarded like Buddy Hield or Duncan Robinson? Definitely not. Did he get guarded like Brook Lopez or Myles Turner? Definitely not. The truth is that teams were definitely defending him at the 3 pt line last season but not making a huge priority of it.  And posting a stat that most of his 3 pt shots were open is pretty pointless because that's true of every player in the league.
"It was actually 80 million and here’s a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It’s honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing…  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who’s your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
"Thats a huge con. If only he had already traded for Buddy Hield, the season wouldnt be starting tomorrow with Simmons on the team. Because todays date is October 18"
"tbf Valentine didn't win the naismith poy, Buddy Hield won that year.  poy winners always turn out to be serviceable rotation players and I feel like once you're in the second round you'll take that any day of the week."
"Knicks: ""Buddy Hield"" , ""John Wall""  Fuck you"
Duncan &gt; buddy. This coming from a Celtics fan who wanted hield over brown in the draft.

"With the first pick in the free agent draft, the Guangzhou Loong Lions select Buddy Hield!"

"&gt;I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is pretentious.  If you are taking that from a pure text comment on the internet, then that says more about you than me.  But, I already said in my first message that I couldn't think of a comparative trade being close to the same value, so if you just put a response about what you think, without backing it up with anything, yeah, you should expect people to call you on it.  &gt;He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then.  His statline this past year was a rounding error off from the previous year, despite COVID and displacement craziness. The only stat that dropped considerably was his three point percentage, but his other shooting stats all improved, most importantly his midrange stats (he was up about 10% from 10-16 and about the same from 16-3p, on increased volume) and his free throw rate (a classic indicator of shooting ability, which jumped above 80% for the first time in his career).  He also improved his playmaking this past year, up a full assist over the previous year, with turnovers going down.  I used the ""has made an All-NBA team"" thing so I didn't have to deal with the ""but he's not an All-NBA player just because he made one"" argument. I'm sure there are plenty of players who made an All-NBA team that you disagree with, but the fact that none of them got traded for a package the size you are talking about is the point.  &gt;Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing  This is probably the closest comp out there for a deal the level you are talking. It was considered a steal of a deal at the time, but Cousins was a notoriously problematic personality (which had been a concern going right back to College, and the reason why he dropped to the Kings in the draft). He was a dominant player, but he was also suspended several times by both the team and league for unprofessional behaviour. He also was traded with a year and a half left on his deal, and Sacramento was going to lose him in free agency if they didn't deal him.  He never actually even led the Kings to the playoffs, either, but he did make All-NBA, so there is some similarity. Still, it does represent the bottom of the market on that type of player (before even considering the context), and I like to think of Masai as being better than Vlade Divac at his job.  &gt;Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  This one isn't comparable, though. Vucevic was 30 at the time of the trade and had never been anything more than a borderline all star player. He has never gotten a single All-NBA vote, let alone made a team. It's a package comparable to the one you are talking about, but for a much lesser and older player, with less team control."
"I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is incredibly pretentious. You request information as if you’re talking to your secretary or you’re a teacher requesting homework from a student. It’s obnoxious and something you should work on.  For the record, Siakam’s value is not “all nba level player”. I personally don’t give a shit that he’s made a single all nba team. He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then. He’s a fringe all star and not a top 15/20 player in the league. He’s closer to top 30-40. Players as good as Siakam get traded every single year. I’ll give you some examples, but I guarantee you that your response is going to either be “this player isn’t as good as Siakam” or “that package is better than the one we’re discussing now”. There is no example that will cause you to actually change your opinion, but I’ll give it a try.  1. Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing   2. Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  Are two trades off the top of my head that roughly fit what you’re asking for"
"As a kings fan, Holmes isn't a good rim protector (amazing on offense and we got him for pennies) and Buddy Hield should absolutely be moved"
Buddy Hield better
I mean he didn’t play so that was his rookie seasons. Buddy Hield was a 24 year old rookie. He was still a rookie.  Otherwise it’s Yao or Duncan if it’s merit.
Bledsoe + for Buddy Hield future trade
Buddy Hield to reduce the spacing
You leave Buddy Hield out of this
"Pelicans have less than 20 years of drafting, so not all that deep but pretty good:  Starters: Chris Paul, JR Smith, Zion, David West, Anthony Davis  Bench: Darren Collison, Buddy Hield, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Brandon Bass"
His first two years were spent being very middling when you have guys like AD who dominated without needing to score and Zion who was the most efficient college player ever.  Garza gets a lot of comparisons to Hansbrough but Hansbrough was an All-American for all 4 of his years and has a bunch of NCAA/ACC records. Garza is in like the same tier as Buddy Hield as far as college players go.
In no world is Buddy Hield a starting all star
"&gt; “next Steph Curry”  Don't you mean, the first Buddy Hield?"
Buddy Hield
So Buddy Hield basically
"Myles turner suffers from the great role player who got overpaid. His skill set and role can be replicated for a lot cheaper. If you can get 70-80% of turners production on a vet min or mle, why would you give up assets and cap space for him?   Buddy hield is the same way. Elite high volume shooter who adds nothing else. You can find great shooters (on smaller volume) for a fraction of the cost. So why pay 20 mil for hield?"
"I feel like Sabonis has become a bit overrated. I've just never been impressed with his game, and I'm not convinced he plays winning basketball.  I haven't seen a single person say they wouldn't give up Buddy Hield for Siakam. Haliburton, yes, but a lot of our fans would straight up salary dump Buddy."
"I feel like Sabonis is kinda underrated -- dude just put up an efficient 20/12/7 without a true point guard and playing next to another big man. Still only 25 years old too, tons of room for growth left.  My homer take would be Siakam, based on all the trade speculation around him. I saw people suggesting he's not that big of an upgrade over guys like Andrew Wiggins or Buddy Hield, which I found shocking."
Not true. No one gives a shit about Buddy Hield. When was the last time you saw a Buddy Hield highlight.
"Issa reference to Buddy ""big like Klay, shoots like Steph"" Hield  But really tho, Zion is incredibly acrobatic with his finishing at the rim, really reminds me of Kyrie with LeBron's size/athleticism"

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

A stat that rates joe harris as a negative offensive player but gives him the 4th highest defensive ranking is a flawed stat  Any stat that places Zion 6 ranks above AD and 10 ranks above giannis on the defensive PF rank is a flawed stat  Any stat that places buddy hield 1 rank behind AD is a flawed stat  You yourself not placing jokic above any of jimmy dray and AD shows that you consider it a flawed stat
"So being realistic, I’d put Myles Turner next to Zion. At SF I’d still keep Ingram. Shooting guard they could probably use someone like Duncan Robinson, Buddy Hield and at point guard a star guard. Off the bench you need a good scorer or someone who can be a ball handler, at least one more shooter, a gritty player, and a relief big.   I think that gets you into the 9th seed."
THJ and Buddy are pretty fungible. THJ shot better from the field and from 3 last year. Buddy is a better all around player. Point being I don’t think citing Buddy Hield is particularly meaningful here. DFS is also a pretty great role guy.
"lol kings fan was getting praised for not getting him and having cap space. Bulls fans were being too nice imo opinion. one was even hyping up the kings young core.  &gt;""Fox/Mason/Hield/Bogie/Bagley/Skal/Giles/WCS is a great collection of young players, and buddy hield is so fucking wet Jesus you guys are gonna be a fun team.""  damn i guess that did look like a nice core for a split half sec"
You should have said all-star caliber player because now everyone is just going to list players who made all star teams late instead of players like Buddy Hield who cracked 20 ppg at 26 years old
I just think that that level of talent could be reallocated more effectively on the sixers. They already have an all world defender in Thybulle siphoning wings to another all world defender in Embiid. Allocating all your money into another all world wing defender who is a 0 on offense is not an effective use of resources.   I would have loved to see them try to get Lonzo somehow. Maybe a 3 team sign &amp; trade deal to net Lonzo and Buddy Hield somehow for Ben Simmons and Maxey would have been way more beneficial to their current roster construction
Reminds me of buddy hield
But you think they will be excited about replacing Simmons with Buddy Hield?   When Lillard or Beal could be available in the future.  That’s crazy.
Totally irrelevant but its always bothered me that Buddy Hield doesn't go by Chavano. Its way more badass.
"Well the sixers have some good young players that will likely be included with a pick, then probably Sacramento, wolves, my guess is Portland get something like Bagley, Haliburton, Maxey, 2 first from sacremento, a first from Philadelphia and maybe an extra player like Buddy Hield or Shake Milton if they don’t want Simmons."
cap he was a good shooter but that's it he was the buddy hield of the late 2000s
"First of all, LeBron went to the Lakers to play with Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram. There was an assumption but no guarantee that they would be able to find him co-star(s).  Second of all, this sub has shat all over Westbrook for not being a winning player since the year he won NBA. He hasn't posted a TS over 50% since 2017. Before the Lakers completed the trade for him the majority opinion was that they'd be better off with Buddy Hield. Now he's on the Lakers on a horrendous contract and that supposedly makes them a superteam. lol  We can talk about Cleveland too if you want."
One lightly used Buddy Hield is available
"I have no clue how Westbrook will do with the Lakers, but I think it's a risk worth taking, since All-Star Caliber players are hard to come by.  I really don't think adding a player like Buddy Hield would've improved the Lakers much, they were aiming for a higher ceiling."
This guy wanted 100 mil and people thought that they could get Buddy Hield for him in a sign and trade.
Simmons would certainly yield higher packages on the trade market.  But this sub is completely irrational about Simmons’ value and think he’s worth Buddy Hield and a protected second so I expect to collect downvotes
"The title is literally, ""How much better is Buddy Hield compared to Wayne Ellington? Basic breakdown:""   I interpreted that at face value to assume that Hield's the better player.  If you weren't interested in a serious analysis why, why did you click on the thread?"
"Also, you can ask Buddy to run the P&amp;R on a play or two a quarter, and he can create his own shot better off of a bounce and shoot off the dribble. You want Hield shooting off the catch more often than not, but he has those other skills to open his game up and keep the defense honest.   Unfortunately the Kings decided “hey, he can run the P&amp;R sometimes, why don’t we have him do that more than Haliburton” lol"
We would We would make a deal with buddy hield
U got a point but buddy hield is better for the long term
Buddy hield is better then wayne Ellington
"I don't know if this could still surprise someone, but Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal"
"I see Hart as playing a lot of 3 for you, plus I'm still not convinced Buddy Hield is going to be on this team for game 1.  Also Terence Davis is not better. Also a rookie is probably not better right away."
The Pels shot 30 three’s a game at 34% last season  Devonte Graham and Buddy Hield shot 20 three’s a game at 38% last season
"im not sure how official official it is, sometimes trades get ""finalized"" and then altered because its not official official with the league yet. We saw this with um the AD trade when Hawks and Wizards were added after the deal was already ""finalized"" to allow the Lakers to dump off additional salary post-hoc. I feel like there's always some gray area with this shit, maybe they are looking into altering the deal to getting Buddy Hield back instead of the TPE (with Josh Hart equally the equivalent difference in outgoing.)"
Buddy Hield and Bagley + four first round picks and two second round picks for Siakam.
"Looking at all three teams I am unsure of what they would each be willing to offer, that would make it worth it for the Raptor's to even considered a trade.  While the ""Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley III and a few future first-round draft pick"" doesn't make sense on an injured player.    The Raptors, at this time,with this roster, are the Darkhorse to make the playoffs and throw a wrench into the plans of some of the 5-9th placed teams in the East."
Like the Buddy Hield extension where it's decreasing each season but is $19m less over 4 years. Easier to move each season and THJ is probably very worth that deal after the first 2 seasons.
"there's a difference between saying that kyrie, wade, and AD were/are bums and saying that mo williams (who was only an all star because of the cavs' record as he was basically a 2008-09 buddy hield) should not be the 2nd best player on a contending team"
Yeah but the warriors have won multiple championships and the sixers haven’t.   I am eagerly waiting for the moment the sixers trade Ben for buddy and bagley.  Like watching sixers fans cope more than they did with Ben with hield is also still going to make me like buddy hield
CJ McCollum  Ben Simmons  Pascal Siakim  Buddy Hield  Andrew Wiggins  Tingus Pingus
Same way Buddy Hield was a year older than we thought.
"Buddy Hield is a clown. The point of the game is to score,  or get fouled.  If someone fouls you when you’re trying to score it’s a foul, if you attempt to get fouled you should not be rewarded"
"This was more than incidental contact.  This was a pretty solid blow on a vulnerable player still in the air.  If the defender hit IQ this way, insta foul.    They've just called it wrong for so long that a lot of people don't know what it is actually supposed to be anymore.  Apparently this includes Buddy Hield."
In what world do you think Josh Hart is better than buddy hield lmfao
Josh Hart is better than Buddy Hield lol
"Sure. But (and I'm not saying this is a perfect metric) the last number 6 pick to start more than half their teams games as a rookie was 2016's Buddy Hield, with 55."
Why not for Buddy Hield?  It’d destroy King’s shooting but I think that’s a more win now move for 76ers then getting Fox.

1. Ingram 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Jamal Murray 4. Ben Simmons 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Dejounte Murray 7. Sabonis 8. Caris Levert 9. Buddy Hield
"For someone who claims to be a Lakers fan you know very little about them.

Fournier is great value Buddy Hield
"Ehh, they both fit different roles. Westbrook is the superior playmaker while Hield is the better spacer. Ultimately, the Lakers chose to go with playmaking because the offense completely bogged down in non-Lebron minutes, which should be going up as he gets older. This especially helps AD who does far better when paired with a playmaker; just look how well Rondo worked with him compared to last year when barely anyone could even throw proper entry passes to him or even drive and pass to him. AD is great 1v1, but far far better when getting the ball on the move or getting passes quickly when he establishes deep position. Lakers figured that they could get shooting at other positions.  Westbrook certainly has his negatives (and so does Buddy), but the Lakers won with not so great spacing in 2020, banking on players hitting just enough from 3 come playoff time and preferring a more physical attack the rim approach. Looks like they're banking on that once more."
Simmons is going to get traded for Buddy Hield.
"In Robinson's case it doesn't matter much, he's a traffic cone either way. He already has pretty good size for a sg and is still awful. Between a 6'9 Robinson and a Buddy Hield I'd rather have the better offensive player since they're both trash on D"
Straight across for Buddy Hield
"I would prefer DRob, but that’s because he knows his role on a winning team. Buddy Hield is talented, but he doesn’t accept the role that the coach is asking him to play, but I doubt that has anything to do with who is the better player. Hield is the better play, Duncan Robinson proved he can play as needed. A lot of Heat offense run around him."
"I've watched Buddy Hield play many games of basketball.  The talent is there, but he somehow just isn't a winning player.  Give me Robinson"
Well shit Buddy Hield #1 then lol… well minus the recovery
"So did Buddy Hield, how'd that work out?"
pelicans had to do this with buddy hield too  https://twitter.com/SiriusXMNBA/status/781654878775046144
Pretty sure that nickname was for buddy hield
At the all star break when Morey finally accepts he’s not getting his godfather offer and settles for Buddy Hield with Bagley and a pick thrown in so they at least get some shooting to help in a playoff push
"Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley and 2 1sts. Maybe one with top 5 protections next year and 1 with lottery protections down the road."
"My guess is they’re willing to wait til the ASB, which might be smart if they’re holding out to see if Portland falls apart and Dame actually pushes to get out. They can last half a season without Simmons, and if they have to settle for something like a Buddy Hield package to help them in the playoffs, that deal is still gonna be there"
"Not really sure why you wouldn't do Simmons and some picks for Buddy Hield? He's older than the developing players on the Kings and their timelines aren't really the same? And, I guess, if he were going to become the elite player they're hoping for he probably already would've by now?  On the flipside, Simmons wouldn't be a guard on the Kings and they wouldn't have to worry about playoff pressures for quite a while."
"Is he? What offer should he take?  What offer should he have taken 1 month ago?  Like actually give me the specific offer.  Im reading a lot of simultaneous, ""Simmons sucks, you cant get anyone good for him"" and ""Morey played himself, he shouldve taken the deal""  Is everyone just valuing Brogdon that highly?  Related question- what do we think the sixers ceiling with Brogdon is?  All of this is just drama whoring. Morey doesnt ""need"" to trade Simmons because the Sixers dont ""need"" buddy fucking hield"
"Honestly, i'd take Buddy Hield, a role player and some 1st's."
"&gt; Morey is unrealistic with his expectations in a trade.  Look I get that the dude had an awful playoff series but how is it unrealistic to want a good player for a three time all-star and DPOY candidate? Should Morey just accept Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield and call it a day? That would make no sense.  &gt; Dame ain't happening. Neither is Beal.  No team is getting these guys, but there's still plenty of dudes between ""the top guards in the league"" and guys who don't even start. I mean honestly, pull up Ben's resume and say that you shouldn't get an All-Star in return for 4 years of him. Is it really entirely crazy to think that he might be in conversation for a guy like De'Aaron Fox, who has played in exactly 0 meaningful games in his career and has garnered exactly 0 accolades so far?"
"It supports the idea that his value is low, it does not support the idea that his value is so low Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield is even a decent return for him. Whatever your thoughts, most GM's are able to take a step back and realize he's still a very good player who is deeply flawed if you're positioned for a deep playoff run. Morey doesn't have unrealistic expectations, he just doesn't want to give him away for nothing when he doesn't absolutely have to."
"“No, you can't always get what you want  You can't always get what you want  You can't always get what you want  But if you try sometime you find  **You get what you need**”  Apparently the sixers are a buddy hield away from a championship"
"I mean, so have Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley and  neither is refusing to show up."
"Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, and a protected 1st.  Kings fans may be high on Davion Mitchell but  Fox/ Haliburton/ Simmons/ Barnes/ Holmes is a legit starting 5 that can finally get into the playoffs."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Yep. Buddy Hield has a beautiful shot but he is almost like just reaching with one arm out ahead of himself.
Where does Buddy Hield fit into this
Passing on Buddy Hield to go for a 44 million dollar a year old ass Westbrook says otherwise...
SS: Curry and LeBron  AS: Tatum and Klay  Role  Draymond (starting center) Steven Adams Seth Curry TJ McConnell Oubre Buddy Hield Wiggins Porzingis
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
Example answer:  PG: Patrick Beverly (6th on Wolves)  SG: Buddy Hield (4th on Kings)   SF: OG Anunoby (3rd on Raptors)  PF: Jonathan Isaac (2nd for Magic)  C: Nikola Jokic (1st on Nuggets)  6TH: Eric Gordon (5th on Rockets)   Bench: Lauri Markennen (7th on Cavs)   Xth/nd would be there rank on there respective team. The player doesn’t have to be that exact number like Kyrie is the bird best player on the nets but you could take him as your first best.
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"
PG: De'aaron Fox SG: Bradley Beal SF: Lebron PF: Siakam  C: Giannis  Jordan Clarkson Lou Williams Joe Ingles DeAndre Jordan Blake Griffin Buddy Hield Thybulle
Which team wins?  Team A: Sixers minus Simmons  Team B: Sixers minus Simmons plus Buddy Hield
"Yeah, I wish people would remember that. Simmons never showed up in important games for us. I remember in the tournament, I think, when he got absolutely embarrassed by Buddy Hield. And I love Buddy, but still. A player who cared wouldn’t just disappear in such an important game."
Buddy Hield gets the Sixers closer to winning a chip. There are plenty of trades out there. Morey is just obsessed with “winning”
Looks like Buddy Hield straightened his hair
If you put your thumb over the eyes and the nose you get Buddy Hield. If you cover up the eyes and the mouth you get Melo. If you cover the nose and the mouth you get Giannis
"&gt; Ben has four years left on his contract. He can dog it and half-ass things for a whole year, and still have plenty of time to restore his value before his next deal. He's in no rush.  This is assuming Ben has no problem wasting 4 years of his career not playing basketball seriously  &gt; Meanwhile the Sixers have an injury prone MVP candidate center in his prime, and they really need to try to maximize their title shot now. They can't afford to waste a year with Ben fucking around on the bench.  Waste embiid’s prime with ben on the team or and not really helping, or waste embiid’s prime trading ben for buddy hield. It’s lose-lose, might as well try to rehabilitate ben’s value/show you’re willing to hold onto him."
Buddy Hield and Dwight.
That's a lot of Buddy Hield too.
"No offense to kings basketball. I actually enjoyed the season with buddy hield, fox, bogdan bogdan and bjelica. It was fascinating to watch."
What are you even arguing? That Morey should choose John wall and his supermax over buddy hield?  And they say sixers fans are delusional. Lol
The Lakers inquired about Buddy Hield.  Doesn’t mean he’s a good enough asset to flip for a star
List of players that have been offered up for Simmons who I would rather have over John Wall's ridiculous contract:  1. D'Lo 2. Buddy Hield 3. Brogdon  4. Colin Sexton
Buddy Hield
Think before you type.You think trading for malik Beasley or fucking buddy hield makes the team contenders? That’s how you’d really get embiid to request one
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"Yeah, to be clear I do think it *is* an overpay, but the Hawks are probably hoping for it to end up more like the Jaylen Brown extension than the... I dunno, who's a guy who got overpaid in RFA but didn't get maxed? Buddy Hield?"
"Last I heard, Sac wasn't moving De'Aaron Fox. They were trying to move Buddy Hield + assets.  Colin Sexton gets almost as many turnovers as assists (2.8 vs 4.4). He's a maybe, but he's not as good as Fox or CJ.  D'angelo Russell can't stay healthy. Not a good fit with Embiid, who also has iffy health.  I haven't heard Portland offer up CJ. If CJ were on the table today, Morey should (and probably would) take it."
"I bet they could get Brogdon, Myles Turner, and a pick or two. Then Turner could either be backup for Embiid (which will be necessary for a whole season) or traded for another shooter or something (Maybe even Buddy Hield)."
"CJ, .Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, D'Angelo Russell  They could also get Sexton, but that means they will have to take on Love's contract as well."
Buddy Hield
"Cries in Phoenix Suns.  We took Dragan Bender 4th above Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield.  We took Marquese Chriss 8th above Domontas Sabonis, Paskal Siakam and Caris Lavert.  We took Tyler Ulis 34th above Malcolm Brogdon."

"I'm in the process of watching all the Kings games from last season, and Kings fans on their sub gave me loads of detail about aspects of the team I found interesting and confusing (the link is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/pmve6u/ive_begun_watching_the_kings_202021_season_not/) and to emphasise the real value is in the responses).  Optimistic because Haliburton is so, so, undersold and it shouldn't be hard for the team to realise what they have in him. I think people don't notice him as much because the areas where he lacks a little (neither the flashiness of LaMelo or Anthony Edwards, no pull-up midrange or much self-creation) tend to be the areas that get highlights. This is a player who within maybe five, ten games was running a great offense when he had the chance. His passing is spectacular, his ability to guard his man is spectacular, he's 41% from 3 on 5+ attempts per game, he has amazing IQ, and he's come into the league already an established good all-around player. In the games he started the Kings had a .500 record, and I *think* most of the time he was starting was due to injuries to Fox/Hield, so that record was achieved even with a partial roster.  Buddy Hield is still a positive player, and his weaknesses will hopefully be covered a little better by a) eliminating entirely the few instances when he's asked to come up the court with the ball, and b) a smarter team defensive identity (he really is very, very bad on that end). But the defense *and* rebounding are the biggest issues. So much can unlock for the team if they can manage even a 20th ranked defense and/or 20th ranked ability to defensively rebound (instead of dead last in both categories). They run the fast break really well (mostly because Fox thrives with those chances), so anything that gives them more of those opportunities is going to impact the offense in a massive way.  I'm beginning to think Walton isn't actually as bad as people say, but that's different from being good. The roster isn't well constructed so it's a difficult challenge for any coach, *but* the improvements needed are smaller than the benefits they'd bring so I'm still optimistic."
"i have no idea who they’ll trade Buddy Hield to, that man is making bank"
Buddy hield is one
"Buddy hield with 42 this game on 24 shots (first game after Kobe’s passing), while wearing #24 to honor his idol. People may be down on Buddy rn, but he is no question a top 5 high volume shooter in this league"
"It's really incredible. This is all happening because he can't own up to the fact that he was a large reason why the Sixers lost the series. If he had any sense of self-awareness or pride he would realize it himself, but he's just in denial and doesn't want to play anywhere where he's criticized at all.  Buddy Hield + picks might be an overpay for him at this point lol, coming from a 76ers fan and former Ben stan."
"The reality is that Ben Simmons' true value has always been closer to CJ McCollum and Buddy Hield than it has been to Dame. If Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley plus a couple picks are available, they should just do it. Kings picks are only second in value to Timberwolves picks on average. It's very likely that Ben on a Kings roster would be a horrible fit too."
"He needs a sports psychologist and to get some ""Yes"" people away from him.  If we get him gone and someone like Buddy Hield, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, or D'Lo I'll be ecstatic."
So would trading for buddy hield or cj mccolum lmao
Buddy Hield gonna mess around and accidentally finish top 3 in 3PM probably after Curry and Harden 😂
"No. I watched the nets and the lakers last season. Nets are un unstoppable force on offense even with only two stars. With three stars they are able to put up 130+ against any defense (and they showed it against the celtics and bucks). Doenst matter how good. You cant stop 3 guys who can score at any will against any defender. KD gets guarded by Tucker, holiday, Middleton and giannis. Doenst matter he gives you 50 in your face. Kyrie is just unguardable, nobody can keep with him up with his handles and his mid range game is clean and harden is the perfect playmaker and his pick and roll game mixed with his floater is straight money.  Their defense might be not great but in the playoffs they showed they can pull it together if they need to and they added important pieces.   The lakers on the other hand were favourites cause of their tough defense. That was in my eyes the only way they could have beaten the nets. Now they lost every good defender in the off-season especially their guard defenders Schroeder and caruso. They barely added consistent shooter nor great defender. Its not really about their age. Melo and Dwight still good but players like ariza, jordan, bazemore, Matthews, rondo are really washed. No way they will produce. The rest of the players are really one dimensional. Monk nunn and Ellington are great additions but defensive liabilities.  And now the biggest problem. Westbrook. People may think they made a huge addition and talk about the big three but they would be a much better team with buddy hield. Im serious. Westbrook is a terrible decision maker and a even worse shooter. I know exactly how lakers fans will get frustrated with him cause I felt the same when he was with the rockets. Its frustrating when he thinks he can hit a three. And it not like he gets it after he misses three times in a row. He continues to brick shots. Every opponent can easily build a wall around the paint when AD bron and westbrook are on the floor. Nobody can shoot. There will be no spacing at all and russ probably still waiting behind the arc and bricking threes. That will be every teams strategy and russ to stubborn to accept he is the weak spot."
Buddy hield like that 👀
Buddy Hield. If he had any sort of BBIQ he’d be a perennial all star
"Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson  I doubt Glen Rice would shoot 10 3s a game lol only Harden Steph and Dame reach those numbers. Also Buddy Hield  I think 7-8"
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
Buddy Hield with average defense 🥵
"&gt;10 completely guaranteed lottery picks that will only convey once embiid retires or Buddy Hield? If you answer the second, I'd ask you to remember that their is no special rule in the NBA which requires no trading for 3 years after you sell a star.  What are you trying to say?"
"What do you think would help the sixers chances more. 10 completely guaranteed lottery picks that will only convey once embiid retires or Buddy Hield? If you answer the second, I'd ask you to remember that their is no special rule in the NBA which requires no trading for 3 years after you sell a star."
"The Buddy Hield thing is also a bit different. Buddy never lied about his age. University of Oklahoma and the Kings had the correct age the whole time, and Hield corrected his age to the media (unprompted). It's unclear why he was listed at the wrong age by the NBA website or Wikipedia, but it seems to be a data entry error."
"I mean there’s been plenty of black French players who’ve never been accused of this. You don’t here these rumors about Gobert, Frankie, Luwawu Cabarrot, etc.  The only guys I’ve heard these rumors about are Serge and Buddy Hield (which proved to be true - I think). Not saying it doesn’t have a tinge of racism involved but this is pretty rare and it’s not like we hear this shit about other foreign black players very often."
Legit seen people want to trade ben for Buddy Hield and a pick
Buddy Hield
What happened to Sacramento ? I thought you guys were an up and coming team with de aaron fox and buddy hield and bogdan etc
Fox and Luka would be the 3rd best backcourt after healthy Nets and Warriors rosters - and on a good night could beat anyone in the league. Luka's gravity would have Buddy Hield winning 6th man of the year.
Lmao that’s like if Walton threatened to trade buddy Hield to the rockets.
&gt; You passed up a dunk on a point guard  Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley incoming
Yeah Buddy Hield used to live a few doors down from one of my best friends before he moved somewhere last August. It's kinda weird how they just sorta melt into the local community. Their kids played together at the park across the street.
"They could paid bogdanovic instead of buddy hield, bogdanovic is a better basketball player, more versatile better creator, instead off overpaying a mediocre role player like hield"
You think he’d be happier playing with fucking Marvin barley and buddy hield ?lmfao get outta here
I mean I thought they were going for Buddy Hield more than Russ as well lol
"Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley and a 1st future pick"
"Oh yeah of course, when teams are offering players like Buddy Hield and Malik Beasley, it'd be a fucking steal when you come in with the clear best player the Sixers could get + a huge expiring contract who would be a decent 6th man. Y'all need to actually see what his value is around the league with his lack of development + lack of want to get better, that god awful contract and now him actively saying he wants out and won't report."
"buddy hield could always harris his way through the playoffs making him useless so i understand why they went with westbrook, besides the free agents they got wouldn’t have come there without it being a clear favorite to at least win the west"
Don’t speak for all of us. I’d accept Buddy Hield and Haliburton in return
"Welp that’s a completely different thing than it seemed like you were arguing previously so okay let’s see. I mean as someone who’s rooting for this team, when we were originally going for the buddy hield trade instead of Russ and it was rumored the next move was Demar sign and trade to the Lakers,,  I personally would have gone the Derozan/Buddy route all day so I’m not totally against what you’re saying. But let’s be real, neither are really meant for today’s game and both would be way better 20 years ago."
"I hate to be pedantic, but I have to refute a few points.  1. The kings do not actually have the worst defensive rating in team history, that title still belongs to the cavs.  2. Tyrese is 6’5, hardly a point guard in frame and predominantly played SG and was passable in a 3 guard lineup with what appears to be the opposite of a defensive stalwart in buddy hield.  3. I believe the admittedly small sample size of wins without fox is skewed by the kings beating the thunder 3 times, all at the very end of the season  4. To go along with point 1, in a league where defence is less valuable than ever and where offence is valued to degrees never seen before, a 3-guard lineup is one of the best offensive threats a team can put together, to note, even with buddy hield regressing in his shooting and overall percentages, we still put together one of the single best lineups in the league. We lost many early games thanks to the plain awful decision to give CoJo 20+ minutes a game.   5. You did mention this briefly but I think you’re understating just how much of an engine fox was on offence that kept us in games at the end. Being the nbas leading 4th quarter scorer before his unfortunate COVID-19 test  6. Why do you trade a person that has at every opportunity stated they like the place and wants to be part of the team bringing us back to the playoffs."
&gt;And why do you think that team is competitive?   Probably because they have the runner up to MVP and another all star level player while Fox has Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley....
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"Yeah, I’m not sure if it’s enough. I don’t think it’s a terrible offer though.   Trade value can plummet when a player threatens to sit out. For instance, Philadelphia traded Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler when he demanded a trade. This proposed offer from the Timberwolves is certainly better than that trade. Beasley is a 40%, high volume shooter, McDaniels has a lot of potential, Reid is a solid backup center, and Beverley has a ton of playoff experience. The 76ers also have a chance to package the first round picks for a Star later.   Honestly, I’m not really sure if a drastically better offer is out there:  -	The Raptors reportedly don’t want Simmons after drafting Scottie Barnes. Which makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Warriors don’t think that Simmons and Draymond fit. Which also makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Kings are unwilling to offer Fox or Haliburton, and an offer based around Buddy Hield seems similar to the Wolves current offer.  -	The Trailblazers aren’t trading Lillard. Maybe they’re willing to trade CJ? I’m not sure about that though, cause CJ and Lillard are best friends. There are also reports that the Trailblazers think Simmons is too ball dominant for Lillard. Plus, I don’t think Simmons can really coexist with Nurkic and Nance."
"Honestly man. The Simmons fiasco is one that I really don’t have an answer to. And I’m not convinced by any answer I’ve seen, whether from pro analysts or fellow nephews on here.   There’s almost not a single trade that makes sense. The only one I can think of that is somewhat okay is Ben for Dame. Works for both teams. Sixers would have to add more or get a third team in. But it just doesn’t seem doable.   Ben for CJ McCollum doesn’t really help because Dame and Ben as team mates just is no good. Cos Simmons playing off ball….. literally a poor mans Andre Roberson on offense without the ball.   Ben to Wolves. In theory is cool but they wanna keep their current 3 stars together. Which isn’t possible. You’re not getting Ben Simmons for a couple of role players and a pick. Especially for a team in a title window.   Sacramento apparently (I forgot the source so it could be wrong) has a deal for the Sixers possibly round Hield, Halliburton and a role player I’m not sure of. For the Sixers. That’s a “fuck yes” deal you’d jump At. But if Hield is traded and you’ve got Simmons going to Sac town. Who is gonna shoot jumpers on that team. From floor to ceiling, without Buddy there’s no shooting.   Ben to Raps, just seems not doable. They drafted Barnes for a reason and def wouldn’t throw Siakam to Philly even though that’s prob be awesome for Embiid.   Three or four team deal surely has to be done. But with money and draft capital etc. I just don’t see a team bar OKC being able to facilitate something that helps Philly get their guys and the other team get Ben whilst OKC just met all the picks and expiring role players"
"Even if he doesn't report to camp you aren't getting him for Buddy hield on a bad contract, a bust prospect and picks that won't be good. This trade doesn't even remotely solve any of our issues."
Buddy Hield?
Kangs are like you're going to take Buddy Hield and you're going to LIKE IT!
"Hield is trash. There's a reason the Kings of all teams have benched him in the past and it's not because he's a mismanaged superstar. The only positive skill he brings is shooting near 40% from 3. Terrible defender. Bad passer. And despite his great jump shot his overall scoring efficiency is mediocre. If the best player they can get is Buddy Hield they'd be better off holding Simmons hostage out of spite. This deal might actually hurt the Sixers because they'd be tempted to play Hield over Thybulle or Seth Curry in real minutes. And if Hield is bad, Bagley is far worse."
"Delusional takes like this are hilarious tbh. Buddy Hield doesn’t make us better at all. In fact, he makes us considerably worse"
"The thing is, with Simmons sixers are a first seed and a second round exit. Are we really sure that buddy hield would be the piece to make them more than that?"
"LOL no he’s not. That’s a media fantasy meant to get clicks. Neither team makes that trade as Simmons makes ZERO sense on a rebuilding team. Philly doesn’t have the assets to make a trade for Dame work, even if a third team got involved. LMAO, Ben Simmons’ trade value is in the Buddy Hield range, foh thinking they’re getting two of the best players in the league. Stop repeating this media created nonsense. Philly would be lucky to get CJ at this point."
Have they considered 3 point champion Buddy Hield?
we have one buddy hield and marvin bagley on standby! call now and they could be yours!
Yeah it’s the same reason why not getting DLo back doesn’t make sense in a Wolves deal or why the Sixers aren’t interested in getting just Buddy Hield back but want Fox or Halliburton.
Still can't believe they did the Westbrook trade over the buddy Hield trade. Just so obvious which one would work and which one wouldn't
"fuckin Buddy Hield thought he deserved to be an all star one year. more than half of these guys think they'd be all stars if they got the opportunity, were on the right team, etc."
People talk alot about this but LeBron is injured right now... Do you expect Buddy Hield to be the starting PG in this scenario?
It’s worse than that. We could have Buddy Hield and kept Caruso and maybe even KCP.
"From what I understand Pelinka had the buddy Hield trade ready to go, and then LeBron and AD decided they wanted Westbrook and told Pelinka to do thay"
We know. The Westbrook trade was a terrible move. Buddy Hield would have fit like a Glove on our team and then we could have kept KCP and probably the front office would have been willing to keep Caruso too
If only they had gotten Buddy Hield instead.. his off ball movement and 3-point shooting would be the perfect fit next to LeBron and AD
"I bet the regret not making that Buddy Hield trade, and not being hard-capped"
Buddy hield wouldn't have had to come off the bench
how has buddy hield been so far? haven't had a chance to catch kings games

The [Buddy Hield 3 game winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U4tZ_XLmVc) will always stand out to me. He drops the ball off the inbounds and he shoots it jumping sideways off of one foot and its nothing but net.
"That Buddy Hield one was bullshit, they didn't even review it because the kings ran out of the arena so they just ended the game."
I fucking [love that Buddy Hield](https://youtu.be/qbtOk60fxPI) game winner.
Last year Buddy Hield had a game winner against the Nuggets at the very beginning of the season
DeAaron Fox. But I meant Buddy Hield lol
We DoNT NeEd BuDdY HiElD We hAvE mOLiK mOnK
"That's only a bit over half. Buddy Hield has 1000+ threes, 1100+ rebounds and 800+ assists and he isn't close to being an all star"
lakers missing out on buddy hield
Meanwhile Buddy Hield just dropped 7 threes in 27 minutes and looked like the perfect shooter to pair with Lebron
Do they always have a game winner earlier in the season? I remember buddy hield having a game winner last year too.
If we had Buddy Hield those air balls would have never had happened cause we would have already been down 10. With Russ he gets to lead us to a 26 point lead and then help blow it lmao
Could have had Buddy Hield. At least those air balls would not have been air balls at the end.
Buddy Hield would not have airballed that.
Guys just a reminder but the Lakers could have had Buddy Hield instead.
Buddy Hield &gt;
Lmfaooooo this team is dogshit. Literally just had to trade for Buddy Hield and/or Lowry
"I think the Westbrook trade evaluation is further compounded by the alternative universe trades. The Lakers were trying to get Buddy Hield and potentially could've enticed Caruso to stay if they didn't get Westbrook. It's hard to say which path would pay off in the long run. Who knows, maybe LeBron gets injured for the first round and Westbrook carries them through it until LeBron's return (for example) in a way that the hodge podge of Hield/Caruso/KCP can't."
"Yeah, that’s why I never got why people wanted Buddy Hield over Russ. Even ignoring that Buddy is a significantly worse player than Westbrook, you’d basically be using him to play the exact same role as Melo, except he’s getting like $20 million. They don’t need another Melo type guy, they need a LeBron-lite."
"I agree Russ can carry Buddy Hield, but what of it ?  /jk"
"Because even during their best days. Lakers lineup with LeBron and AD needs elite shooters next to them. It's not only because of they are elite shooters. Specially LeBron is underrated shooter. It's mostly because LeBron and AD's two man inside outside game needs multiple floor spacers on the floor. Not another ball handler specially if he is terrible shooter. I'm not even talking about defense. LeBron and AD literally creates elite defense by themselves during playoffs. But they do need someone who can defend opponent ball handlers in halfcourt game and closeouts. Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook means keeping Caruso and KCP as well. Imagine Caruso, Hield, KCP, LeBron, Davis lineup and compare it with Westbrook, Monk, Ariza/THT/Anthony, LeBron Davis lineup. Lakers won championship with elite defense not with greatest offense ever."
"Russ did really well this game, this is what he needs to do night in and night out, especially when LeBron isn't playing well (or playing at all).  Yeah it would have been better if the Lakers had Buddy Hield but Buddy is not gonna carry a Lakers team to wins when LeBron isn't there (although man would have loved him on this team).  AD just needs to be aggressive like he was in OT, just manning the misses and grabbing those boards and putting them up. The dude can do it but he's always so mellow with with his game, always injuring his leg or groin or hip.  This game showcased what the Lakers could do with the right lineups, and especially with LeBron they gotta find out how to compliment each other so that one guy doesn't get left behind."
That was the main point about the Westbrook trade. Get someone to help if ad or lebron are out. Ad and bron wanted that over someone like buddy hield who complemented him.
Has Monk in the short time he's been in the league been put in a position or has been given as big a greenlight as Hield has his entire career? It hard to say what Monk is truly capable of. Buddy came in with expectations of being the next Curry so him shooting a lot of 3s is expected.
The Lakers would also still have KCP if they did the Buddy trade.    Russ/monk &gt;&gt; KCP/Hield but I'm still convinced that russ/monk/AD/LeBron/5th-guy &lt;&lt; rondo/hield/kcp/AD/LeBron because spacing matters.
"Good for him, I didn't liked his trade AT ALL, but the intention is precisely just that... when LeOld can't play, when Davis inevitably breaks, WestBrook is supposed to carry the role players just like he always did before, winning some regular season games and etc The problem is the playoffs, WestBrook becomes a huge liability, who knows if the team will arrive there healthy, etc.. Luckily I am not too attached, if the Lakers fails it will make no difference to me... but again, if they traded right, bringing in Buddy Hield and other solid role players to complement Davis and LeGM, maybe in that scenario I would be more invested because it's a logical approach to roster building, but considering how LeGM owns the team now (this is so humiliating by the way), the Lakers simply chased the allstars available to build the ""super team"" instead"
Or Buddy Hield.
Buddy Hield will also be available any time we want him. The Hield trade was just Kuzma and Harrell. The lakers could definitely cobble together a salary match if they decide they need Buddy.
"With all due respect, Malik Monk does the same thing Buddy Hield does"
We have Malik monk. We don’t need buddy hield making $22mil more than him
"Buddy Hield wouldn’t provide that kind of trust, with all due respect"
Yes and I’m sure there are tons of role players who can fit in nicely with this team. But at the end of the day they’re just role players with a hard cap on their impact. Russ has a higher ceiling than any role player regardless of fit. We lose this game with Buddy Hield leading the charge and I personally don’t want lebron to have to hard carry the teams offense at 37. Even if he can do it I’d rather he didn’t.
Buddy hield&gt;Russ  /s
I wonder if we can trade LeBron for Buddy Hield still?  ^/s
Where all them Buddy Hield bitches at now?
This is why Bron recruited Russ.  So he can take a night off and Russ can go 33/10/8 and help them win a regular season game.  That's not necessarily the case with Buddy Hield.
No don’t you know that Buddy Hield is the savior? Can’t believe you would go against the circlejerk smh
"Yes, Westbrook is the problem tonight clearly. If only we had Buddy Hield instead"
Coulda just gotten Buddy Hield. Coulda gotten Lowry before too
the Lakers are definitely missing their lead guard Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield 12.4 per 100 on 40.5%
They can afford to be cautious with Russ on the team. They probably couldn’t if Buddy Hield was on the team instead.
"No, buddy hield (the guy who can’t even start on the Kings) is our savior. How dare you go against dumbass circlejerks"
"Yeah you're right, Buddy Hield was the either or.  But certainly they could better afford Hield *and* Caruso rather than just Westbrook.  Hield would have been such a better fit....and we already know what Caruso would have brought.  Sickening..."
"This wasn’t an either or, and not really a pelinka decision. This is coming off a season where ad and lebron missed significant time and they wanted someone else to be able to run the offense if that happened again.   We could have kept Caruso if he wanted to pay the tax for him. Spacing would take a serious hit for lebron with non shooters at pg, sg, c Davis who’s been pretty bad from 3. Last year at least had gasol, kcp and schröder coming off a great 3 point shooting season.   The either or was Westbrook or buddy hield. Still think that would have been better as lebron + shooters works."
"Ah, I always love the homer takes. As soon as Simmons wanted out, you guys got stuck in a lose/lose situation. Do you really think waiting a year and then selling Simmons for Buddy Hield plus a FRP is really going to move the needle? Or what is your dream situation where Simmons' value skyrockets? Even if he plays, and plays as well as last year, his value ain't going to net the Sixers a star."
His 3 points made record will be broken pretty soon after he retires barring any rule changes.   All it would really take is a Buddy Hield type player getting drafted at a young age which seems plausible.
It’s what gets karma.  These people can’t answer how panic selling Simmons right now for Buddy Hield or Malik Beasely puts the franchise in a better position
Philly should jump at Davion Mitchell and Buddy Hield trade and call it a night.
Davion Mitchell playing more minutes than Haliburton and Buddy Hield only getting 25 mins (shooting 2-10!) bodes well for the hypothetical Ben Simmons trade
Um because Westbrook sucks and LBJ has to play 40.  It’s LeBrons fault he let his emotions get in the way by wanting to play with Westbrook over Buddy Hield.
Kings just need one more reliable SG/SF to replace Buddy Hield's minutes and with Haliburton snd Davion Mitchell's development you'd be on the brink of playoffs contention.  Western Conference is just stupid stacked but the tesm outside of Buddy Hield and his contract is really solid.
"Draymond has that tiny bald spot on the side of his head, just sharpie it or something.  Also wish Buddy Hield would lower his upper lip."
"Steph was off and the Warriors still won, good sign for the Warriors, scary sign for the rest of the West  Warriors kind sleptwalked through this game, Kings played with significantly higher intensity  Poole had a nice bounceback game after a rough start to the season  OPJ is such a luxury for the warriors to have, and the MVP of this game imio, dude can play anywhere from the 3-5, and his defense is underrated, if hes healthy warriors will be very tough to beat  Davion needs to be in the Kings closing lineup, his defense is too valuable to sit on the bench  Rishaun Holmes is mad underrated, dude is such a solid C,   WTF happened to Hali?  dude looks lost out there rn  Been said before, but fire Walton ffs, Kings with a real head coach would be a serious play in contender, with upside, as it stands they lack a real offensive system outside of shoot 3's, PnR, and Fox Iso's, same applies to defense  Buddy Hield has no conscience, sometimes thats good, sometimes thats bad, tonight it was bad"
"Melo can also be Buddy Hield, if he wants to"
Buddy hield doesn’t even start for the kings? And he’s supposed to be the lakers savior?
But all that stuff could be done without the 14th pick. The Kings don’t exactly have a death grip on Buddy Hield. He could be gotten tomorrow if so desired. And Trent was moved this past trade deadline. The Sixers could have offered things after this draft to the Blazers if they wanted him so much.
Demarcus Cousins. When a small market team drafts a player of his caliber they need to do everything they can to keep him. They fired the only coach he ever really got along with (Malone) for no reason then traded him for Buddy Hield (???) days after publicly declaring they were committed to him. Oh and they did it during the All Star game and he found out about it during an interview.
"Trade Russ for KCP, Alex Caruso, and Buddy Hield.  2 good defensive guards and a shooter seems like a decent team."
"Harris once Simmons is traded: fuck that guy. Buddy Hield is a great guy, good values, and a straight professional, he shows up every games and play hard even in practice."
"This current construction of the Laker squad just looks like the 2004 version with Malone and Payton. Big names that don’t fit well together that are well-past their primes. Caruso had a ton of chemistry with the team and was willing to do the dirty work in a random #35/82 game season that not many players would.  Westbrook is a stat generating machine but clearly does so at the expense of efficiency and winning. ANYONE can see that he has zero place in the Laker lineup when LeBron is on the floor.   The chase for star power really hurt them. Should of just went with the Kuzma for Buddy Hield trade, resign Caruso, and kept KCP.  At this point I think Kendrick Nunn is a better starter than Westbrook would be."
Buddy hield
Westbrook because of the potential to win ring which i think we would lack with first option. I'd take buddy hield over both
"Lakers should’ve definitely followed through with that buddy Hield trade. Westbrook literally gives up mid game, saw it last year when they tried for the play in games. Starts shooting 3s with 20 seconds on the shot clock. I predict he will be traded before the trade deadline"
Isn't he the one that vetod the Buddy Hield trade and said to go get Russ?
"While this is a fair assessment of LeBron as a leader, i don't think this team and the 2018 Cavs are a fair comparison. LeBron did not want Kyrie traded in 2018, he did not want to remake the team the way Dan Gilbert did, he believed that they could've worked out with Kyrie if they had him back for the season (to be fair with Gilbert, considering how Kyrie has acted since, LeBron probably was wrong).  This team though LeBron DID want, him and AD did want Westbrook over Buddy Hield and he did want the more experienced guys like Melo, Rondo and Dwight, so because of that i believe that he will have a level of patience way higher than he did in 2018.  To sum it up i don't believe that they will blow it up midseason, Russ generally starts the season slow and then slowly progresses into an All-NBA candidate and LeBron probably knows that and will have an elevated level of patience with the squad."
"Of course every superstar has a say in trades, but you're specifically putting sole blame on Pelinka and deflecting any fault from Lebron here with the moves they made in the off-season. Journalists following the team have reported that a Buddy Hield deal was in the works, but it was Lebron (and AD) who vetoed it, opting for Russ instead."
Imagine having a trade lined up for Buddy Hield and then throwing it out the window for Westbrook lol
"I'd trade westbrick for buddy hield and Harrison Barnes in a heartbeat if I could, also a terrible fit on the lakers with their lack of spacing, we all know russ is only usable if there's 4 shooters around him not on a team with non shooters like rondo, dwight, or DJ. Also one of the worst off ball players in the league so a huge negative with guys like LBJ and AD being so ball dominant. Still have no idea why Pelinka traded for him to this day when there were many better options available in terms of fit but I guess lakers higher ups only care about big names and former players."
Lakers legend Buddy Hield
You acting like Hield is our goddamn savior. What's Buddy gonna provide when his shot goes cold?
"""Turn the sprinkler system on, Buddy Hield is on fire!""  Grant is a giant asshole, but man was such a good play by play commentator."
"If Westbrook just comes on as a B-team with people like Carmelo and Dwight to give the A-team when LeBron, AD, Rondo, and Buddy Hield a rest; they'll be fine.  Oh wait. They didn't trade for Hield?  F."
"KCP, Caruso and Buddy Hield are 3 guards"
Buddy Hield 😭😭😭
That's pretty much a very typical Buddy Hield type game unfortunately.
"I just don’t know what the Lakers were thinking with this roster. They could’ve had Buddy Hield. I also would have much rather had Caruso and KCP than all the role players they added. Nobody on this team plays defense except for AD, Dwight, and Lebron when he tries. It is still the Lakers and they’ll probably be somewhat alright, but I do wonder how this defense improved."
"They need shooting and perimeter defense. 3 players that instantly come to mind are Buddy Hield, Alex Caruso, and KCP"
Kuzma and Harrell for Buddy Hield
Their chance was during the offseason and LeBron and AD blew it for Rob who was THIS close to getting Buddy Hield which also would've meant keeping KCP and Caruso
They need a knockdown shooter. A Buddy Hield type player.
Evil Buddy Hield
He's the buddy hield they need
"Oh Buddy Hield, what could have been?"
Not getting Buddy Hield and getting Russ instead isn’t a hot one either
"Not that hot, it was a bad fit from the get go. Could have had Buddy Hield"
Didn’t they have a chance at Buddy Hield and chose Westbrook instead for some reason?
If LeBron really said no to Buddy Hield in favor of Westbrook then if the Lakers underperform this season it's entirely on him
Also buddy hield is one of the best volume 3 point shooters on earth
"Embiid missed the second game of last year too.  Save me the concern trolling.  People acting like they need to sell Simmons now at any cost have no understanding of this situation.  If Embiid gets hurt, what exactly are guys like Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield going to do?"
Huh? I thought they were washed up team with a poorly constructed roster and that Westbrook sucks and we should have for Buddy Hield?
He took the Buddy Hield comparisons personally
"Ja Morant  Lou Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby  Myles Turner  Bench - Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Lonzo, LaMelo, Ayton.  Starting lineup emphasizes defense.  Dort, Bridges and OG are all elite defender and can guard 1-4.  Turner is an elite rim protector and capable 3 point shooter.   Offense emphasizes a spread 3 point attack, led by Ja attacking the paint/mismatches and either scoring or passing out.  LaMelo is the secondary play maker off the bench while everyone else are catch and shoot or catch and drive players."
"Steph is 21 on 42.3%. He's taken 248 3PA, the only other guy who's taken more than 200 is Buddy Hield who's shot 37.8% on 225. He's taken almost 8 more 3PA than the next 40%+ shooter in attempts which is CJ McCollum who's exactly 40% on 170 3PA.  Absolutely unreal. He'd hit JV's season total for attempts in 4 and a half games."
"I’ve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He’s totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn’t enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It’s harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he’s just not really quick. He’ll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he’s not automatic like Durant so he’s inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he’s on, sometimes he’s off.  So I think it’s a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it’s easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there’s no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It’s when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he’s good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
"Buddy Hield. His jump shot looks amazing. I give him a 99 three with all the pink diamond badges in myleague, with that fast release. Boom. Very fun to use."

You don’t have buddy   Hield
"Dwayne Wade said it somewhere but I think he's right. LeBron is now feeling the injuries that most other players normally feel much earlier in their careers as vets. LeBron can't do it all.   Also, personally, this Lakers team is constructed pretty horribly. Russ is a turnover/bad decision machine, AD is fantastic but can't be relied on for heavy minutes the whole season. Relying on Carmelo as a top scoring option is straight up a bad choice now. I just don't think the pieces fit well. In hindsight a trade for Buddy Hield would have been much better than Russ over the summer."
"Seth Curry and another comparable shooter. Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, Buddy Hield, Bertans, etc."
"Lakers made the wrong trade there is no doubt about that.    Lakers traded a 1st rounder which was beyond stupid.   But let’s not sit here and pretend that Trez and Kuzma were absolute garbage for the Lakers.   ESP Kuzma, even during the championship run, was ass especially on defense.   Trez was a shell of his former Clipper self while on the lakers. Whether that’s on Vogel we won’t know very well could be. But he just wasn’t the same player.   I still think they should have gone for Buddy Hield and Bagley which was on the table and almost a done deal."
"Buddy Hield would look nice in a Lakers uniform but LeBron got RussWestbrook, Carmelo, and friends."
I think we need buddy hield and Caruso back instead mate.
Pelinka trading KCP and Caruso is hurting a lot more than he anticipated. Trading for Westbrook instead of the rumored Buddy Hield trade is pretty foolish too.
"Every time I point this out in the Lakers sub a bunch of blind idiots tell me I don't understand basketball.  Forget Fox, AD let Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy fucking Hield beat him off the dribble last night. That's on him."
"It's not AD's fault, he was posting up known defensive juggernauts Terence Davis, Tristan Thompson, and Buddy Hield. Occasionally even Lebron's own Kryptonite, Marvin Bagley."
Buddy Hield said nah
Don’t think Buddy Hield would’ve required as many assets to secure as WB? We gave away a lot of defensive assets lmao.
"sign derozan with what money this past summer? and tell me exactly how buddy hield solves our issues lol  like i get it we down bad rn and y’all love it but at least TRY to make sense in your criticisms lol  we werent getting DD for no MLE, and our defense is fucking terrible and buddy hield is a terrible defender he solves none of our issues."
"""Buddy Hield refuses to yield."""
"Because if you tell people your season is horrible because of buddy hield, it isn't enough of an excuse. You need someone like Westbrook to throw the blame on"
"Off Balance, doesn’t matter. Buddy Hield."
"Buddy Hield, Caruso, KCP, and Kuzma together over Westbrook would absolutely fix this team."
Now I just imagine AD claiming Buddy Hield is using an aimbot and telling Alex Len he fucked his mom.
Watching the box score...  Lets se.... Damn Buddy Hield 3-13 from deep. ... scrolling down.... Okey Lebrum... I see you.
buddy hield over westbrook won’t fix this team. Its not that one trade thats the reason why lakers suck. Its the defense. Buddy doesnt play it either
"I think its a bit of both AD/Lebron and front office if the rumors are Lebron/AD killed the Buddy Hield trade over summer to force WB on the team. Like I understand GMs make the final call, but when your generational star and all star center both say go with this guy, you are pressured to somewhat right?"
"I'm just glad Buddy Hield had a relatively inefficient game.  If he caught fire, I'm pretty sure r/Lakers would be getting the vats full of Kool Aid ready."
Why did he take as many three pointers as Buddy Hield?
"Buddy ""Never Yield"" Hield!"
"ever since the ""sure thing"" buddy hield trade turned into a westbrook trade weve been drowning"
Getting to see the Lebron worshippers have mental breakdowns all year as Lebron finally goes downhill is what I’m here for. This will be so much fun.   I still can’t believe Lebron chose Westbrook over Buddy Hield. Haha wtf
"Seeing Buddy Hield play like that makes me so happy the trade fell through, just cause he’d be such a better fit than RWB"
Buddy “Fuck you” Hield
Buddy “Fuck you” Hield
"Buddy ""The Next Steph Curry"" Hield &gt; Westbrook confirmed."
"I watched Buddy Hield shoot some free throws, how'd the rest of the game go?"
then trade them for buddy hield. lol
"What the fuck makes BUDDY HIELD think ""yea, I can block AD from behind"""
How are we going to waste such a great game from Westbrook and fuel the soup brain Buddy Hield takes

Can I interest you in a lightly used Buddy Hield?
You said we could trade Simmons for some role players like Buddy Hield.  Why would I take Hield over WB?
Again with the Buddy Hield from someone.  If we'd traded for Buddy we'd be in even worse shape as Buddy doesn't have anywhere near the gravity that WB does.  WB and AD as a tandem is already figuring it out and we're getting some guys finally off/back off the injured list.
"wtf? you would rather pay Westbrook 91 million over the next two years than having Simmons? Westbrooks contract is a negative, you could get some decent roleplayers for Simmons, Buddy Hield for example."
Oh yeah like that time they wiped off two point and we lost a possession. Or the time last season we lost to the kings and they never changed the score for buddy Hield had his foot on the line. That one game difference but us in the play in.  Yeah we get every call though
"If the Sixers are a top 2-3 team in the East at the trade deadline, do they just settle for Barnes, Buddy Hield, and some picks? The Sixers looked really good when everyone was available, and at that point I’d rather add some solid playoff contributors and make a run this year when there’s no clear favorite"
"I really think the Sixers should strongly consider a deal centered around Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield for Danny Green and Simmons. Both great shooters and Barnes seems to be solid defensively (correct me if I'm wrong). Imagine a being able to roll out a lineup of Seth Curry, Hield, Niang, and Barnes with Embiid at center. Absolutely insane spacing.  In fact, the Kings should be the ones to reject this trade with how low Simmon's trade value is getting. But if the offer is on the table, Sixers have to take it imo. I think with the emergence of Maxey they would be fine not getting Fox."
"They also have Buddy Hield who has raised his trade value more this season. If Kings want to blow it up, they have the talent to get decent assets"
"If he could, wouldn’t he have produced at that level before? Or shown that he can? I feel like if he was that good at the NBA level we would know it. Maybe you’re right idk, but in today’s game Patty at his peak should definitely get that many looks from three, Buddy Hield takes a fuck ton and Patty is a more complete player."
"Damn, guess that means he's a worse player than Seth Curry and Buddy Hield since they can shoot threes"
Plus they got Buddy Hield from the bench to provide some defensive spark..
"Three point shooting for us, guys like Buddy Hield or Patty Mills would be a good fit."

Buddy Hield and Bagley for Simmons

Buddy Hield and Bagley for Simmons
Buddy Hield and Bagley for Simmons
"Thanks for the ^disappointing insight! I remember hearing about Lou King when he was at Oregon, then noticed he was on a two-way with the Pistons, but even they let him go, so I figured he wasn't ready at all. Glad to hear he might eventually become something.  I kind of wish the Kings just played these guys more. Screw trying to win, go full 2020-2021 Thunder with their Maledon, Bazley, Poku, Roby, Moses Brown lineups. Stop playing Harkless 20 minutes, keep Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield fresh in case they might get traded, trade or cut TT (13 MPG), maybe ship out Len (16 MPG), and give big minutes to Metu, Ramsey, Woodard, Queta, and King along with Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, and Holmes. Go for some big picks in future drafts because this ain't it. Heck, even play Bagley big minutes if he doesn't sit out like Ben Simmons.  They need to find out who might work well with their main young core pieces and if they don't, then they either need to spend some time in the G-league or off the team. Rotate in other G-league guys on temp contracts to see if anyone sticks and flip guys between the NBA and G-league (the Jazz did a few times to get our guys reps). Go full process except without the blatant tanking. It's probably better than what y'all have had to endure these last 15 years."
Former 3pt champion and one of the best shooters alive buddy hield?
something something Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook
"&gt;Halibuton/Hield/Barnes/picks  I'd do that trade for Ben Simmons. Hell, I don't need Barnes. Tobias and him fill the same space.   Ben Simmons for Haliburton and Buddy, plus picks."
"Reasons for optimism:  * Lebron missed a ton of games * Ariza, Nunn and whomever else are still out injured * Lebron/veteran teams usually start slow, pick it up over the seazon. Lebron has been pacing himself for years now * They might pick up some help later via buy outs/waivers  Reasons for pessimism:  * Time seems to have started catching up with Lebron, he's less durable * AD turned into a pumpkin after winning the title. He still has great bursts but zero consistency, can't lead the team when Lebron is out. You have to start questioning his motivation * WB is the worst 3rd option ever in this space and pace era. Can't shoot for 3 for shit, is a ball stopper, fits into their offense like a crowbar in a gear based mechanism * Not a lot of trade assets left to swing one last big trade at the deadline, unless they shop WB, which I doubt they would. * Warriors are ~~clicking~~ not making any noise cause they're a well oiled machine that crushes anything in their sight * Lakers could have had Lowry and Buddy Hield instead of WB * Lakers could have kept Caruso, even with WB, but got cheap * Lebron pays attention to these kind of things (owners getting cheap). When he left the Heat in 2014, it seems that the Heat not keeping Mike Miller played a role in his decision. He's not 2013-2018 Lebron, but he's clearly still the best player on the Lakers, and if he decides to leave, Lakers will be a (late) lottery team. Basically Pelicans when they had AD.  * Lebron never asked for a trade before, but who knows ? If he does, I really hope he demands to be traded to the Warriors."
Wait but r/nba told me Buddy Hield was better?
But we could have had Buddy hield!  /s
I'll take Buddy Hield for a bag of chips.
"I'm not saying it's impossible, but 41+% on 8.5 shots a game is like Duncan Robinson/Buddy Hield/Davis Bertans level shooting. It would be one of the most impressive shooting leaps ever (Terry wasn't considered a shooter coming out of college) and Rozier isn't exactly that young (he's almost 27).    Again I wouldn't rule it out, but I would reasonably expect some level of shooting regression. I still think he's going to be a high level NBA 3 point shooter. The difference between 39% and 41% is going to be like 6 makes so it's probably not worth splitting that many hairs about it."
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield are the same age
"Well Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Bradley Beal etc.."
Yeah the pick got ripped by smarter people at the time it's just been 5 years can be hard to remember. [The consensus take was Jamal Murray&gt;Buddy Hield](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2016/6/23/12016970/nba-draft-2016-mock-draft-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-kris-dunn-jamal-murray-dragan-bender). Multiple [sources had ths same conclusion](https://www.tothemean.com/tools/draft-models/#/2016/dv2/all).   It's kind of a microcosm of how NOP was run in the AD era always looking for the short term fix. They didnt want to wait and try to develop a player like Murray. Especially after 2016 which was frankly a disaster year for them they were looking to try to turn things around ASAP wherever they could find a quick fix. Hield was a known quantity they wanted to just get a guy whom they thought could help day 1. The irony was Hield wasnt actually good in NOP as a rookie. The DeMarcus Cousins market was alot worse than alot of people anticipated especially on here. Frankly if Hield had actually looked like some high quality prospect as a rookie Im not even sure NOP wouldve been willing to include him.
"I haven’t kept up, is Buddy Hield not good? I remember after being derided while on the Kings he actually grew into his role and had at least one exceptional season."
The Buddy Hield age dispute was such a 3rd World thing for the USA... watching fro Europe it is so strange to heard a thing like that.  I remember couple years before also Shabazz Muhammad had the same issue but at least they recognize the error in college.
"Yeah, both of the knocks on their games was they had to become better playmakers, and refine their scoring ability beyond 3 point shooting.   While Buddy has been the better shooter of the two for their careers, Murray’s playmaking and dribbling ability came along way since he was drafted which has made him edge out Hield last year IMO.   Hield is still a great piece though, and basically a guaranteed high volume 40% 3pt shooter, who will drop 18-20 a night."
"""His name's Buddy? He can't be that scar-""  \*Buddy Hield drains a million 3's on you until you die\*"
Lol isnt Buddy Hield age questionable too
"I didn’t say Buddy was an awful pick. I think he was good pick, the guy is one of the best floor spacers in the NBA.   You’re really trying to fight a point I never made or intended to make. I literally just thought it was crazy that Jamal Murray has played 8800 minutes in the regular season and 1261 minutes in the playoffs and how now reached the age of Buddy as a rookie, when the two were debated against each other a lot when they were prospects.   It’s more of a cool fact, and also your point ignores the concept that if the Pelicans drafted Murray than there is still a chance they could have gotten boogie by swapping Murray and Hield in their trade package for Boogie."
"Buddy Hield is still the better player at the moment, but it wouldn't surprise me if Murray becomes better than him this year"
Pascal Siakam+Norman Powell for Buddy Hield+Marvin Bagley who says no?
"I'm sorry?  The title of the post is  &gt;[Anderson] Buddy Hield says John Wall was coaching him during the game: ""He looks really good. He's talking and being a coach out there for his teammates. He’s very positive. *He’s even telling me stuff I can do to get open.*"""
"On first read, it seemed like I missed a trade somewhere with Buddy Hield to Houston. On second read its even more hilarious like he's giving him the strats."
"So just trade him then.   Was Lonzo a ""wasted pick,"" or an asset that helped get AD?  Was Buddy Hield a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get DMC?  Was Andrew Wiggins a wasted pick, or an asset that got Kevin Love?  Was Eric Gordon a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get CP3?  Was Javaris Crittenton a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get Pau Gasol?"
John Wall is less than 2 years older than Buddy Hield wtf
Barnes best shooter? Buddy hield doesn't exist I guess.
nah buddy hield and thon maker are the same dude
god damn why did you not get traded for buddy hield you piece of shit. Stupid Daryl Morrey had to come in and be smart with their roster and shit and not trade away their promising young players.
"Basically, it's tricky for salary cap reasons. A team looking to make a deep playoff run is better off with 2-3 excellent players than 1 excellent one and 9 good ones, because in the playoffs, your players can play more minutes and you don't need to go 10 players deep. Another salary cap consideration is that ""good"" players often receive market value or more and stars are capped due to contract maximums. So a star might get $35 million and a guy like Buddy Hield makes near that but doesn't bring as much value, particularly on a strong team in the playoffs."
"Eric Gordon, D’Angelo Russell, Buddy Hield, Klay Thompso, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert"
if we're talking purely about 3's Then Buddy Hield is a better 3 point shooter than Damian Lillard. Hield is a career .411 shooter with 2 seasons at .431 and .427 and 2 seasons with more total 3 pointers than Damian's best 3 point season.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_season.html
"You're acting like I didn't already account for the outlier sample size issue by combining Steph's ""very tight"" + ""tight"" outside shooting. You've left that out.  Everyone has a small sample size when looking at ""very tight"" 3-point attempts, which is why I combined those numbers with ""tight"" numbers to produce an adequate sample size.  Steph and Dame have both taken 17 ""very tight"" 3-pointers, with contrasting results, while the most efficient outside shooter in the league (Ingles) has attempted one such shot all season. The only guy who has taken more ""very tight"" 3s than Dame or Steph is Buddy Hield, who is 4-for-23 on those attempts.  Steph has still made 40% of his 170 3-point attempts with a defender within 4 feet. There are only 12 other guys in the league who have attempted even half as many 3s with a defender that close.  And only 6 of them are anywhere close to Steph's 4-feet-or-less sample size, yet it's just Duncan Robinson (who takes a very different style of contested 3s) who is within a couple % points of Steph in this category.  Save the sample size bullshit, it is accounted for."
"Buddy Hield. He just chucks up 3's all game. He thinks because Curry, Dame and Harden can shoot 10+ 3's per game that he should too. Not a winning player."
"Yeah if nothing else, Buddy Hield is a great shooter. Second in 3 pointers made and attempted this season. So far only Steph, Buddy, and Dame have cracked 200."
"Another fun stat, number of games with 20 or more 3PA  &amp;#x200B;  ||| |:-|:-| |James Harden|7| |Stephen Curry|2| |Klay Thompson|1| |Marcus Smart|1| |J.R. Smith|1| |Danny Green|1| |Buddy Hield|1| |Kobe Bryant*|1| |Damon Stoudamire|1| |Damian Lillard|1| |Vince Carter|1| |George McCloud|1| |Michael Adams|1|"
Honorable mention for Buddy Hield w one 11 3pm game and 2 9 3pm games.   Just now looked it up bc I was curious
"I mean, if you'd rather look at it as ""Steph Curry has more 3PM in 49 games this year than IT's career high, JJ Redick's career high, Kyle Lowry's career high, D'Lo's career high, Beal's career high, etc."" we could just paint it that way outright.   If you wanna look at just the last 4 seasons, Steph's 2021 is 11th in 3PM through only 49 games played, outranking the likes of Klay Thompson's best season in that span (78 GP), JJ Redick's best (76 GP), Dame's 2018 all-NBA first team season (73 GP), Dame's 2019 all-NBA season (80 GP), etc .  If you wanna look at just this season, Steph now leads all players by a whopping 28 3PM. Buddy Hield, in 2nd, has played 6 games more than him, as has Damian Lillard, bringing up third.  I'm fine if you want to compare what he's doing to other current stars and modern players, it's still insane just in relation to the modern game."
"sounds a lot like luke walton, i’m sorry you guys had to endure that. i think walton has the worst lineups in the whole league, he literally benched halliburton for harkless when anyone with eyeballs would have took buddy hield out of the starting lineup. he absolutely refuses to play any of our young players besides hali and does things like playing fox and barnes 40 minutes on the first night of a back to back"
Buddy Hield is not an NBA player. Hed get destroyed and Europe and is barely bench in CBA.
"Well tonight there was multiple bad missed fouls the other way as well, and it seems like the refs just didn't give a fuck and were ""letting them play"" almost all game.  That said, even if you're letting them play you should at least call the extra blatant ones like this one by Crowder, and the one where Ayton got pushed in the back by Buddy Hield."
"also Buddy Hield kinda sucks now. idk how that happened, but it did and he’s only getting older."
Buddy Hield is drawz and his game is constipation.
"Buddy Hield: shoots like Steph, big like Klay"
Buddy Hield and Deaaron Fox are the only ballers on that team. Whiteside is trash. There's a reason Miami trade his ass.
"Michael Porter Jr., Buddy Hield, and Norman Powell."
I feel like that quote is just not-so-subtly calling out Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield and Brandon Ingram is an interesting one. Their difference in age Hield 28 vs Ingram 23 is greater then the difference between them taken in the lottery of the same draft at 2 and 6.
"I don't concede that Simmons is worse and I'd bet I've seen a lot more De'Aaron Fox than you. Fox has the higher PPG, but that's about it. Fox does more perimeter shooting to boost his PPG, but it isn't really efficient enough to help the team win. Simmons has fewer points, but better TS% even with his poor FT and perimeter shooting. Simmons is also better as a rebounder, defender, and in basically all advanced stats.   Simmons also fits our roster better. Our scoring is above average, but our defense is literally one of the worst of all time. Buddy, Haliburton, and Barnes are all strong 3pt shooters who would space the floor for Ben and benefit a ton from his drive-and-kick ability. It'd allow us to play a 3-guard offense the way the 76ers do with Simmons/Curry/Green, but we wouldn't lose size on defense, since Ben can guard SF/PF. We're getting wrecked on defense because our tallest starter is 6'9"" and our second best forward is Moe Harkless.  Long story short, I don't think Fox or Simmons is capable of being the #1 scoring option on a contender, so I'd rather have the guy who's a more versatile two-way player, since it allows a higher likelihood of complementing an MVP-caliber guy.  As for the money, Fox gets 96% as much, so not a super impactful difference when we don't even have one other max-level player yet. 1 less year team control is a little scary, but I'm okay with that tradeoff, since Simmons is a year older with a grown man body and more seasoned with playoff experience. He's more of a win-now move anyway, so the acquisition would be based on the idea we believe Simmons / Hali / Bagley / 2021 1st is a legit future core with quality support players in Hield, Barnes, and Holmes."
Isn't Buddy Hield in the #2 spot for 3 pointers made this season?
Buddy Hield. He has nights where he is just absolutely terrible
"Drummond, Oladipo, Wall, Young (still great, but his stats are superstar level which he is not), Buddy Hield."
"Buddy Hield is like if an F5 tornado hit a trailer park and carried it all the way to a trash dump inferno, and then the devil pissed on it but the meth lab was left intact."
Buddy Hield
"I am one of those spamming Serbians.  Bogdan is waaay better than he has shows to be in NBA so far.  Kings used him as a spot up shooter and let the likes of clumsy Buddy Hield handle the ball. Luke Walton is a shit coach. So was this previous Atlanta coach.  In Atanta he was hurt at he beggining, and I am glad to see he is showing his true colors now. What you are seeing now is what Bogdanović is and was his entire career."
"I'm not your Guy, Buddy (Hield)"
"Over the course of the entire season, it makes a significant difference. Randle has played 234 more min this season than buddy hield. If we say the average mpg for an NBA player is, idk, 30? Than he pretty much has played ~8 more games than Hield.   3 minutes doesn't seem like a lot but it accumulates, ESPECIALLY over a long 82 game season."
"As a basketball sub, we should talk about how the knicks play at the slowest pace in the league.    Is 37.6 mpg played at the slowest pace in the league really worse for you than playing 34.3 mpg at the new nba standard pace of really fucking fast?    (37.6 is randles mpg and 34.3 makes you 20th in mpg (buddy hield if that matters))"

"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
beat a near-full strength #1 seed with buddy hield and our third stringers?
Buddy Hield and 4 back ups doing it to them.
Think I saw this about buddy hield not too long ago. Someone made a post saying he was steph curry level
"&gt;Harden, Harden, Curry, Curry, Lillard, Lillard, and **Hield**.  Dang, I didn't know Buddy was in such awesome company. That's pretty neat!"

I thought Ben McLemore would be a star with the Kings and Jimmer Freddete would be what Buddy Hield is today.
Give up 2 firsts for Buddy Hield... No Thanks.
David Griffin should be fired if he accepts this trade. Two firsts (and one being #10) for Buddy Hield??
"Hayes  Cade  Bey  Grant  Stewart  That's a fun ass lineup with Grant giving the young guys a player to rely on. He's also only 27. There's no reason for the Pistons to do this. Also, is Buddy Hield worth the 10th pick and another pick?"
I mean if I were a bottom tier team I’d take the contract in exchange the 10th overall pick pretty easily. Presti wishes he could get that deal.  I’m more surprised why people think the Pelicans would trade 2 1sts for Buddy Hield as that’s what’s really wrong with this scenario
"Am I the only sixers fan who doesn’t want to trade him? Like that was bad, but shit I forgive him. If this isn’t a wake up for him call idk what is and I expect him to improve. Set him a very strict shooting schedule for improvement, but tell him he’s still our boy and we believe in him. Don’t trade him for fucking Buddy Hield or some shit. We were so close this season and this playoffs!"
"I mean Damian Lillard, Danilo Gallinari, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, there are some decent players on here."
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
"I didn't watch Trae in college so just heard the next-Steph hype.  And after Buddy Hield, I was just rolling my eyes and ready to laugh.  Well turns out the people who compare the two are overly simple and Hawks fans are laughing at us all."
Yeah if the kings wanted more my guess is Toronto would be willing to deal some kind of pick compensation but I honestly think Buddy Hield may be close to a negative asset at this stage.
Buddy Hield and Bagley. Actually.
Yeah I don't know why Philly would want Bagley though Buddy Hield makes sense. That's a interesting/weird trade package though (Bagley/Hield/9th pick).
"Don’t worry dude, I wasn’t brigading it. They were the buddy hield factory and I put on the Celtics flair. Tell me, why would they have a Celtics flair if not for Celtics fans to use?"
it would probably be fox + buddy hield sign and trade
As good as he is buddy hield
Buddy Hield
They can get the best tandem in the NBA in Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley III. They'd wreck the Eastern Conference for years to come!
"The Nuggets and Bucks’ success required a lot of luck. A few teams were very high on Giannis. I’ve got a great anecdote in the book about Danny Ferry trying to trade up past Milwaukee to get him. Denver, they didn’t know Jokic was going to be the MVP when they drafted him at 41, and they also got lucky the Pelicans took Buddy Hield over Jamal Murray. Nailing the draft has a lot of layers"
Bye bye buddy hield trade him for bench depth
"He got Buddy Hield though, that was a good trade"
"[Ah, you're right.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/buddy-hield-warned-nba-hilarious-flop-has-perfect-reaction)  &gt; The first violation of the policy by a player results in a warning, while the second garners a $5,000 fine.  He got a warning for his first offense. If only one player actually got the fine I'd be curious to see how many got warnings."
"Head to head match ups is one of the worst arguments for who's a better player. By that note ""there's no scenario where Luka has a case over Buddy Hield because Kings were 3-0 against Dallas"""
Pretty sure Buddy Hield got fined this season. It wasn't a major flop but I remember the Kings announcers mentioning it in the next game because he got some kind of punishment for it
"[This is the box score from the final game of his college career.](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2016-03-12-texas-am.html)      That LSU team was a preseason top 25 team that lost a couple games early then rebounded somewhat, blew out a decent Kentucky team, nearly upset #1 Oklahoma with Buddy Hield, and then completely collapsed. Turns out Cal and K are the only coaches who are actually good at coaching young teams with lots of freshmen."
"For me personally, Buddy Hield is the most goated player in 2k. Dude cant miss if he wanted to, he regularly dops 40+ on me"
"KCP is ok but we need one who moves off the ball constantly. Maybe Buddy Hield since most Kings fans hate him, he has had some problems with the FO and coaching staff. Stealing him from Kings would be perfect for Lakers. I don't know the price though. Kuzma+filler+maybe this year's pick"
"The two packages our beat writers have floated are Buddy and Bagley plus picks, or Barnes and Delon Wright plus picks. I think the Hield package would me more interesting to get you more spacing, plus you gamble on Bagley turning into something solid with a change of scenery."
"Yeah, he gave the Kings his passport which has the correct date on it, but he thinks Kings just had his age listed from what they saw on Wikipedia, which was incorrect.   https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/buddy-hield-26-not-25-kings-guard-reveals-age-incorrectly-listed  “That’s their fault, not my fault,” Hield said when asked why everywhere, including the NBA’s website, has him listed as 25. “The first time I saw it on Wikipedia, my mom said, ‘Why do they have your age wrong?’ I said, ‘I have no idea.’ ”"
I'd be trying to add Buddy Hield
"Twolves fans say this because we believe Beasley is a slightly worse player on a much better contract than Dlo. In this scenario we’d send Rubio, Beasley, and some sort of combo of McDaniels/Naz/picks (take Culver if they so please).   76ers then can straight up use Rubio’s expiring contract to bring in another floor spacer or pg (let’s say Buddy Hield or Lowry) or package Rubio with these new young assets + Maxey for a star guard. Starting five could be Lowry/Beasley/Thybulle/Harris/Embiid with a new collection of assets to use in a future trade"
Neither did Buddy Hield. Records from 1990s and 2000s aren't always guaranteed to be complete.
"I think the kings make the most sense. Buddy Hield would make a great piece to send. I would give up Hield, Metu, and a 2025 1st and 2023 2nd."
"It absolutely makes more sense. With Ben gone, the 76ers will need a new primary playmaker. Despite Simmons' limitations in that department, he's still their best playmaker. CJ McCollum may offer valuable off-the-dribble scoring, but he certainly isn't plugging the playmaking hole. Buddy Hield offers nothing over Simmons besides a willingness to shoot it and the ability to hit free throws. Hayward would be a decent fit on the 76ers, but he's not a primary playmaker in the way Lowry is, and I don't see the Hornets giving up Hayward for a player who is far, far more limited when Hayward's do-everything ability is one of the keys to our system. Lowry is already on his way out the door; this gives the 76ers an opportunity to get a playmaker they can't afford in their current cap predicament, Lowry a chance to get a final payday and help his hometown get a ring, and the rebuilding Raptors a chance to Sam Presti a player whose stock is currently at its lowest while giving up a guy they were going to lose for nothing."
Buddy Hield.  Shoots the three.
"Hield and McCollum are very similar players. Buddy is probably a better shooter and not quite as good off the dribble, but ultimately those two are probably the closest comparisons to each other. The one advantage McCollum certainly has is experience in meaningful games, and he might be slightly better overall, but I think anywhere he's a fit Buddy would also fit just about the same."
His weaknesses only matter in the playoffs. So probably to a team that has no aspirations for a playoff run. Buddy Hield.
Kings ownership is expecting to miraculously fluke into a play-in spot and somehow consider that alone as a win for the franchise.  Nobody else in their right mind is expecting that though. Luke Walton is still their coach. Much more likely they go 5 more years without an appearance.  I could see the Kings trying to make a move for Simmons. They have two players with possible upside that are bad fits in Sac and they want to ditch - Buddy Hield and Bagley. They also need defense. Their FO is also mediocre-to-awful so Morey could probably rip them off for multiple picks in addition to players
Portland will trade CJ for Ben. We're not trading Nurk and Roco for Buddy Hield.
"How in the world is Buddy Hield worth Nurkic, Covington, and a 1st"
"I think there's about 10 or so teams that would be interested, I may be considering Simmons' value a little high here but he's still a top 5 defender, phenomenal playmaker so it is what it is/ I could see the Sixers being interested in the following:  Simmons for Hayward  Simmons, Shake and Isaiah Joe for Kevin Love and Darius Garland  Simmons, George Hill for Westbrook  Simmons for Porzingis  Simmons, George Hill for John Wall   Simmons for Dlo  Simmons for Ingram  Simmons for Kemba (but you know OKC will want a pick lol)  Simmons for CJ  Simmons for either Buddy Hield or Fox (unsure who they'd want more, so unsure how to make cap work  Simmons for (somebody on the Spurs - Derozen maybe? If ANYONE can figure out how to ""fix"" Simmons, it's Pop)"
"It's a reasonable trade just not sure why either team is jumping for this.  For Sac, why take the ball out of Fox's hands?  Simmons is useless off ball.  For Philly, you really going to have Buddy Hield run your offense full time?"
"The ""Fuck It, Let's All Just Trade Our Problems"" Trade. Add picks as necessary:  Sixers Get: Kevin Love, Buddy Hield, Delon Wright  Mavs Get: Tobias Harris  Cavs Get: Kristaps Porzingis  Kings Get: Ben Simmons"
So Buddy Hield is running the offense?  That's... not gonna go so well.
Yes there is. Philly cudda got harden in trade centered around ben simmons early this season. Now ben simmons value is buddy hield and bagley in the best case scenario.
"Andre Drummond, al horford, Steven adams, buddy hield"
Simmons for Buddy Hield and Bagley?
"I think if you are trying to win games you could trade him to say Sacramento for Buddy Hield and a couple picks   That would make your lineup imo:   Ben Simmons  Buddy Hield   Deni  Rui  Bryant  With Bertans, Gafford, etc on the bench   And I would build the team with Ben Simmons at the 5 being my goal."
"Lol even Sac wouldnt do that trade. Buddy Hield has a pretty shit contract too, taking that and a Simmons max would be too much. I think centering a trade around just Hield makes more sense. Tyrese Haliburton can grow too with Hield gone."
"It wasn’t a great draft but even still in a redraft he isn’t top 5   Ingram, Brown, Sabonis, Levert, Murray, fuck it Buddy Hield  So yeah he’s a bust"
Buddy Hield is Trae Young without the playmaking abilities
"Yeah, they had picks 6-3-3-1-1, if you just take those draft slots from the last 5 drafts, here is your team:   Buddy hield  Tatum  Luka  Zion  Edwards"
"trade for buddy hield  he will fix all their problems, trust me..."
Simmons and a first to SAC for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley
"Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield and Hassan Whiteside straight up, who says no 😂"
Until reality sets in. Buddy hield/kp/kemba  starting lineup. Yes kemba after giving a pick
"You'll take Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, and a 2022 FRP and you'll like it!"
5 minutes after the game ends he's getting traded to Sactown for Buddy Hield and a meatball sub.
"&gt; This isn't true. Every star traded from 2016-2018 were sent out for trade packages that were worse, when the warriors were on top you could get a star for cheap  &gt; The Kawhi trade was worse  I disagree, Kawhi was worse than Harden and desperately wanted out, lowering his value in the first place (and Kawhi only had one year), and then they still got an all-star, a young role player, who's now one of their better players, and a pick  &gt; Demarcus Cousins was traded for Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield and a first  Factoring in the value difference between Boogie and Harden makes it not that bad, but fine, this one was pretty bad at the time  &gt;Butler was traded for a first and Zach Lavine who was a bench player at the time  SEVERELY disagree with this. Firstly, they also got Dunn who was seen as a productive high potential guy, but Lavine definitely had a lot of value. No one thought he'd be THIS good, but he had value, especially before the injury. And it wasn't just any first, it was the #7 pick in a pretty decent draft year. Obviously in hindsight you could even say the Bulls won, but even at the time, it doesn't come close to as bad as the Harden return.   &gt;Besides, the Rockets objective is clearly to tank, Simmons gets you more wins while still leaving you well outside the playoffs. But the time they are good again, Simmons will be at the end of his contract  Simmons wouldn't get them more than 25 wins. You cant raise a floor that much without offense. So yeah they wanted to tank, but Simmons wouldn't have ruined that. Just would've brought them from best odds at the #1 pick to maybe 6th or 7th, which is still over 30% chance at a top 4 pick"
A Laker fan was in our sub like a week ago proposing Kuzma for Hield lol. I thought after these playoffs the days of lopsided Kuz trade proposals were over but I guess not (and I’m not even that high on Buddy)
"&gt;But that rockets trade was one of the worst returns in recent history  This isn't true. Every star traded from 2016-2018 were sent out for trade packages that were worse, when the warriors were on top you could get a star for cheap  -The Kawhi trade was worse  -Demarcus Cousins was traded for Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield and a first  -Butler was traded for a first and Zach Lavine who was a bench player at the time    &gt;They could've got Simmons and firsts (and at a point when Simmons was seen as a budding star, not an unplayable max player)  He was seen by some as that, but there were plenty who understood his limitations. Maybe the Rockets were some of those people  Besides, the Rockets objective is clearly to tank, Simmons gets you more wins while still leaving you well outside the playoffs. But the time they are good again, Simmons will be at the end of his contract"
Well this decides it. Buddy Hield is the greatest shooting guard of all time. Hes never lost in the playoffs
"&gt; Do players sign that to insure themselves, if they're traded to a shit team at least they get more money?  Yes.  The other common situation where players get trade kickers is restricted free agency (RFA). In RFA, the player's current team can match any offer you give, so you put trade kickers in the contract to make them less likely to match.  For example, Atlanta offered Bogdan Bogdanovic 4/72 with a 15% trade kicker. They don't really care about the trade kicker because they want him to be their starting shooting guard for the next 4 years. Sacramento has Buddy Hield making a bunch of money for the next 3 years, though, so they probably _would_ want to trade Bogdanovic. So they wound up not matching the offer and Bogdanovic became a Hawk."
Buddy Hield the Sooner legend
Buddy Hield has a very smooth jumpshot too thats true
"Beautiful (Pure shooters form) - Klay, Joe Harris, Buddy Hield  Unconventional but Hella Smooth - Melo, KD, Zach  Fugly - Draymond(form looks like your shooting with a backpack on), Al Horford. Is MKG still considered as active since he was just waived last December?"
"But make the package bad enough for the kings to still suck  Zion, Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for DeAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy Hield  Also like 3 picks to ruin any chance of building a team around him"
We don’t need another Buddy Hield (even if Joe actually plays defense)
"I mean, this decision making process &amp; thinking brought to you by the organization that thought it was a good idea to take Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic, Trae Young or JJJ and the organization that thought it was best to lose Bogdanovic for nothing because they needed more minutes for Buddy Hield &amp; Cory Joseph.  If they made good decisions they wouldn't be the Kings"
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It’s one of the better drafts we’ve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"KCP was a starter, and a crucial part of their championship season. Sure, he’s a frustratingly streaky shooter, but when his shots are falling, he’s a fantastic fit on any contending team. Harrell was 6th man of the year w/ the clippers, and really helped carry the Lakers offensively during their regular-season injury struggles. Calling them “two bench players” is underselling their trade value, especially on their reasonable contracts.   Buddy is a fantastic shooter and it makes sense to target him, but there’s also risk in the trade. He hasn’t proven he can step-up his defense or perform under intense pressure and playoff defenses.   He also doesn’t offer much playmaking or ball-handling skills, something Lakers are looking for, since Schroder is unlikely to be on their team next year.   Hield is literally just a very good catch-and-shoot guy, which is valuable, but not worth multiple good players + a 1st round pick in a remarkably deep draft. Lakers gotta leave some assets for other trades."
Buddy Hield is not a ball handler I hate to break it to you bud. Think Kuzma but 10x worse with the ball.
KCP is better than Buddy Hield
How the fuck is Buddy Hield the oldest player in this trade rumor?
Just popping in to let everyone know Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis. Alright carry on with your day.
That is not Buddy Hield
"i'm picking a shit ton of guys over buddy hield to take a 3 lol   the dude is streaky as fuck, his lows are low and his highs are high but there's a lot more context in 3point shooting than just the percentage"
"Buddy Hield is one of the greatest shooters ever but contenders would rather have Eric Gordon. His defence is so much better it's not even funny, he's a good enough high volume shooter that he has to be respected, and is also a more dynamic offensive player."
"Buddy Hield is one of the greatest shooters ever but contenders would rather have Eric Gordon. His defence is so much better it's not even funny, he's a good enough high volume shooter that he has to be respected, and is also a more dynamic offensive player."
"Here is an even wilder one  Buddy Hield (born December 1992) is older than Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (born September 1993) who was the 2nd overall pick in 2012  As Hield was having his breakout season in the 18/19 season, MKG was on the verge of being washed out of the league"
"Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal  Hield was in the 2016 draft, Beal was drafted in 2012"
"This is strange as Tynan is a good enough guy who I don’t think would purposely troll the Spurs fan base.  But a lot of things about this don’t add up.   1) Why is he the only one who saw it? There are bots that post to Reddit anything Woj or Shams tweets. Tynan said in another tweet it had to have been one of those two.  2) Lakers don’t exactly have a ton of picks to be trading around.   3) A trade involving DeMar can’t even get done until Aug 2 when free agency begins. Doubt teams want to get fined for tampering.  4) KOC just came out with his Buddy Hield trade article, so many the notification cut off after Sac…  In any case, not sure what to think. Again, Matt Tynan is a legit writer (not exactly a news breaking source), so I doubt he’d purposely play games on Twitter. But wouldn’t this mysterious supposed tweet notification be seen by other people? Or archived somewhere on the internet?"
"KCP is a better player than Buddy Hield this would be an absolute disaster for the Lakers throwing in pick 22 on top of that lol. Complete overpay for a guy who is not a net positive asset at all in Hield. No idea what makes people look at Buddy Hield and say ""Yeah that's a guy you really need and should be targeting for the toughest series in the playoffs!""."
"Buddy Hield, Westbrook, and DeMar DeRozan"
Does this mean buddy hield will be a laker?
"Yeah but we have nothing okc wants, even testicles. Lotsa sixers fans setting themselves up for disappointment. I'm mentally preparing myself for buddy hield and a protected first."
"But is DeMar and Kyle the move even in the short term? Lillard available, there's plenty of younger talent on midtier teams that are looking for to dump contracts. Those bottom feeder are teams are willing to overpay for a star like Simmons.   I could see Buddy hield being a better bet"
Buddy Hield LETS GOOOOOOOO
"Same here, someone wanted to trade me Buddy Hield for Giannis. So I picked up Tacko Fall and sent him Tacko for Fox."
"It’s really hard to have bad defenders on the floor in the playoffs in crunch time, especially when they are small.  Seth played great in the Hawks series, but the lasting memory is him getting cooked by Huerter like 5 times to seal game 7.  I don’t even like Seth starting yet alone Seth and Hield. I’d like Hield starting and Seth off the bench though. Buddy at least has the size to not be abused and allow someone to shoot comfortably over him.  He’s only ~2 inches taller, but that plus an extra 5 inches on his wingspan make him play like a much larger player than Seth."
Probably. Moving up the draft is always good though. Idk.   I like this more value-wise than the people who say Kuzma is worth Hield. At least Ingles is short on time but Buddy will be good for many years.
Im gonna be punching so much air if Buddy Hield is the best player we get for Simmons.
Me too. VERY much hope that's still in play cause it makes the deal a lot better. Although I do wonder what we'd be shipping out other than Hield which hasn't been mentioned either. I doubt it'd be Buddy alone but possibly? Here's hoping to all of it
Not as good as if they added Buddy Hield
And having way more young players besides Zion. The only pick the Pelicans kept in the AD era was Buddy Hield and then he was traded 6 months later for Boogie.
"Jesus Christ you’re delusional. The only people that come close to his 3 point shooting are superstars. He shoots the same % and attempts per game as Dame. Shooting is the most valuable NBA skill. There’s a reason why Duncan Robinson is asking for $20m and why Joe Harris got $19m.  &gt;he had to be hid  Just say you don’t watch our games. Buddy stays with guys and gives them issues on ball. His issues are fouling 3 point shooters and getting lost off ball. Like Jesus Christ even if what you were saying *was* true stfu, you shouldn’t be convincing other teams fans that they don’t want buddy Hield."
"Thank you for fact checking me. And I think hield is much better suited as a starter than he is a 6th man, I don’t think it makes much sense to bring him off the bench. Adding him to a lineup with LeBron and Anthony Davis is going to make the Lakers much more dangerous. We already know what LeBron can do passing the ball. Buddy is going to get much better looks than he would in Sacramento, which should in theory result in more efficient scoring (he’s already an elite 3 point shooter but his numbers could definitely see a jump). An AD/Buddy PnR should scare teams. If teams go over, it gives AD an easy shot at the rim. Under, and Buddy gets a wide open shot. Meanwhile LeBron is still on the court and can get involved at any time. Buddy is the perfect #3 for this Lakers team"
"Buddy Hield’s skills make him valuable to many teams, but somehow the Kings can’t use him in a way that is valuable to their team. So they will probably have to accept some players that aren’t valuable to them at all while the team that gets Hield will get a useful players.   I don’t think Kuzma and Harrell fit that well in Sacramento—but I’m not sure which players really would"
Buddy is only known for his scoring yet barely averaged 16 in 35 mpg. He is severely lacking in all other areas of his game.  Please stop overrating Buddy Hield
Buddy/Ingram units off ball defense will be true must watch television(I would like Hield a lot more if he was making half of what he is)
"Imagine Simmons getting traded for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley and picks"
just give us buddy hield.
"[Not according to Shams' reporting:](https://hoopshype.com/rumor/lakers-kings-have-discussed-buddy-hield-kyle-kuzma-trade/)  &gt; The Lakers have received interest from several teams regarding Kuzma, sources said."
"&gt;So whatever source said that   It's the same one the OP listed above:  https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-draft-trade-talks-kyle-kuzma-montrezl-harrell-gary-trent-jr-tyus-jones/  Here's exactly what was said:  &gt; Montrezl Harrell’s decision on his $9.7 million player option is considered a genuine “50-50” either way at this stage, multiple league sources told HoopsHype.  &gt; Harrell could exercise his player option and be traded. The Lakers and Kings have discussed a deal centered on Kyle Kuzma and Buddy Hield, as The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported. Multiple league sources told HoopsHype that Harrell and the Lakers’ 22nd overall pick were also discussed in variations of the trade talks centered around Kuzma and Hield."
"Man people in this thread are insane. Buddy Hield is absolutely worth the 22nd pick, Kuz and Harrell. Buddy is a sharpshooter and a volume sharpshooter at that. Yes, he's not good defensively, but you will always need shooters more in this league.   This is a good trade for the Lakers, and a decent trade for the Kings who are likely not getting more than that for Hield."
"KCP got injured in Game 3 of the playoffs, had to skip Game 4 and was very limited in Games 5 &amp; 6. I wouldn't place too much stock in a 5 game sample size where half of those games were when he was injury riddled. KCP was great in the NBA Finals back in October and KCP is younger than Buddy Hield is."
"&gt;Are we going to assume that Kuzma’s first two years before LeBron came to LA are null and void now? Because he put up pretty good offensive numbers while playing for a shit team.  No I take those into account..I said he can be a volume scorer, but his efficiency was still doodoo and he can't really do anything else (i.e defend, rebound, pass).  &gt;Hield’s on an absolutely bloated contract and everyone knows it.  I mean, idk if a contract for an elite shooter who scorers near 20 ppg at 20 mil is any worse than a tweener who really isn't great at anything for 13 mil.  &gt;The ONLY reason Hield is even being talked about right now is because his main skill set is what the Lakers desperately need. It’s not like he’s some valuable commodity franchises are banging down the doors to get.  Well no, he is being talked about because there clearly has been an internal falling out between Hield and the Kings brass/coaching staff and its obvious a divorce makes the most sense. His value is a bit down because he hasn't been playing as much or made as big of a role in the offense as he used to, but that doesn't mean he isn't still a better player than Kuzma. You're right, the Lakers (like almost every team) need more shooting...what about Kuzma do the Kings need? Mediocre defense and shooting, inefficient scoring?   &gt;He’s a chucker (albeit a good one) and that’s pretty much all he does  So is Kuzma, Hield is better at it at least.   &gt;He’s a negative on defense  So is Kuzma  &gt;struggles to create high percentage shots in isolation  So does Kuzma  &gt;and can’t create offense for others.  So does Kuzma  Are you seeing a theme here? You want to take shots at Buddy, which fine go for it...but its just so ironic when you're own player is all around worse."
"What else are they supposed to do? They can't tank and they just signed their franchise player to an extension. I don't think trading away the #9 pick, Buddy Hield, and Marvin Bagley would hurt the team.  It's not like they're going to trade multiple 1sts and Haliburton for Russell Westbrook."
"&gt;I think you’re overrating how much professional athletes have invested into being the GOATS. Most of them just try the best they can to improve and stay healthy while cashing checks. Just because you don’t thrive under the spotlight of MSG and would rather play somewhere with less media scrutiny doesn’t make you mentally weak or some lesser player. Not everyone wants to be Michael Jordan and destroy every personal relationship at all costs to win championships.  What are we even talking about at this point? I don't really care about some pointless back and forth about trying to psycho analyze players we have never once talked to. I'm just saying, it is a negative thing, in a vacuum, if you cave under any sort of expectations...that shouldn't be a hot take.  &gt;And we are talking like Buddy Hield is mana from heaven. This is a player that literally does NOTHING else besides jack up threes  Uhhh Buddy Hield has multiple seasons scoring 19+ points, shooting very high volume of 3's at a very high rate. If you do the math, he only scores about half his points off 3's though, so he obviously is doing more than just that. He is a better player than Kuzma by a decent bit...thats also not a hot take."

Not everyone wants to be Michael Jordan and destroy every personal relationship at all costs to win championships. Some guys just like their jobs, their cities, and their teams.   And guess what? If someone like Ben Simmons fizzles out and plays well in some small market does that make him “less” of a player? Is he someone that’s going to lead you to a championship? Maybe not. But he’s still going to be plenty valuable to the organization.  Here’s a news flash too: most NBA teams aren’t even really trying to compete for a championship. They know their financial ceiling and are just fine either saving money or being just good enough to sell tickets and merchandise. Guess what? The Kings are just that team. So no you don’t need Mamba Mentality players all throughout your lineup.  And we are talking like Buddy Hield is mana from heaven. This is a player that literally does NOTHING else besides jack up threes. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the Lakers need."
The difference is Kuz doesn't get you a superstar. He does however get you a Buddy Hield
"Westbrook is on a monumentally worse contract, can't shoot, and also can only ""playmake"" in so far as driving and kicking it out and looking for easy assists. Buddy Hield and other shooters should be the focus."
"Ngl I want to keep the pick and see who we go with—struck gold last year, maybe it could happen again. Hield for Kuzma I’m down for, though. Buddy would be ideal on a contender where he can just be a 3pt specialist and call it good. Kuzma plays defense which would be really great for us by itself lmao"
"as long as they keep THT we gucci.   Schroder, THT, AD and LeBron would have made the finals if AD didn't get hurt.   And that was after Schroder had covid and THT was still developing.   This season sky is the limit.   We do need to add Buddy Hield for Kuzma + Trez + 22nd pick.   And sign Patty Mills for the bench.  Schroder, Hield, KCP, LeBron, AD \[starters\]  Patty, Caruso, THT, Morris, Gasol \[bench\]"
"So part of the reason is that generating cap space would require renouncing Lonzo. But you can keep Lonzo’s bird rights and his cap hold on the books and still generate the TPE. That also makes you an over the cap team so you get the full MLE.  With the TPE itself you could look at maybe someone is looking to get off a decent player like if the Kings want to just give you Buddy Hield. Or you could work a sign and trade, like Duncan Robinson and give the Heat a couple 2nds for their troubles."
damn 2k was right all along. Any franchise I start the Kings always try to shop Buddy Hield to me
why are we getting buddy hield
Just trade him for Buddy Hield and be done with it
"This is a weird time. Harrison Barnes is overvalued by fans, and Buddy Hield is undervalued by fans in an analytics driven league. I'm looking at Barnes and Powell,  scoring and 3 pt effectiveness being tilted towards Powell, Powell is statistically a superior defender... Barnes is steady. He's a really solid piece, especially on a veteran team with established stars around him. I think Powell fits the Kings roster requirements better, and ultimately makes them better."
this is absolutely insane.   Kuzma would be money on Indiana and they turn it down?   Wow bad move Pacers  I'm guessing this was to sweeten the package for Buddy Hield. FUCK I want Buddy so bad he is perfect for Lakers
"Yes, he is better than Bryn Forbes by a pretty good margin at this point in their careers , that isnt worth energy. Joe Harris is a good comp, Buddy is marginally better (Buddy is asked to do more than he should be doing and is taking 4 more 3PA a game than Joe), and he is marginally payed more than Joe is. A lot of these guys take hometown discounts to win a title. A guy like Joe Ingles could get paid 3-4 more a year if he wanted to play on a less loaded team. JJ Reddick made 23 million in 2017 for putting up Hield like numbers. When that immediately fell off he regressed to a lower tiered mean (to be fair he was nearing the end of his prime that season alone)."
"Totally disagree. Prior to last season I would have agreed, but seeing the salaries going around to players in his tier, and below his tier. overpaid. Where I don't agree is that he is as valuable a contract as Hield because Hield does one thing consistently. Shoots the hell out of the ball. They're also not the same kind of ""mold"". Wiggins is a slasher/scorer player with a heavily criticized low motor. Buddy is an EXTREMELY high motor player who does ONE THING. He shoots the ball from 3. If Wiggins had Hields motor and desire to be better he could be amazing.   In this current NBA, the midrange is barely alive. You surround your stars/shot creators with people you wish were as good as Buddy Hield is, because there are only about 5 or 6 of them around for 30 franchises to fight over."
Best I can do is Buddy Hield for J-Rich and an unprotected 1st
"nah instead they want buddy and russ and the players they trying to trade are kuzma, trezz, dennis, tht so it would probably be something like scroder to bulls coby to wizards and tht to wiz and then kuzma, trezz to kings plus the 22nd pick and with that they keep kcp so a lineup of russ, heild, lebron, ad, marc for reg season isn't bad and then for playoffs russ, hield, kcp, lebron, ad is not bad spacing at all"
"Am I the only one that thinks that re-signing Holmes probably wouldn't be the best move?  I like Holmes a lot, but the Kings defense last year was abysmal and Holmes being an undersized guy didn't help. They'd be running into the same situation they had with Buddy Hield where he gets overpaid and doesn't contribute to winning."
Yeah Kuzma (as inconsistent as he is) gives us a lot of what we need. We need a 3/4 wing that can create his own shot. Buddy doesn’t fit since we want to start Fox/Haliburton. Hield gives the Lakers what they’re looking for. A rare win/win. Need salary to match though.
The problem is what are they going to build around him right now. He’s ready to get paid and start making the playoffs and OKC wants to cash in on their picks over the next 2-3 years. What’s the point of paying Shai now if the only benefit is to be leading a full rebuild. Shai is ready to do what Trae Young did and attempt to lead a squad into the playoffs. I wonder if Sacramento is about to make a move to swap out Marvin Bagley or Buddy Hield. Bagley could be a real smart move because of how low his stock is. Presti did say OKC will take a low stock player and flip them for something greater. Bagley could be that project. But you have to wonder for the OKC fans at what point do they grow sick of a rebuilding team after being blessed to last decade.
"Yeah, I don't think he's gonna keep making upwards of $25 million per year, but he's not suddenly going to sign for $5.9 million either. It's totally possible the Lakers are OK with the hard cap again, after all they were last year (as were about 8 other teams). But my suspicion is that if they are willing to get hard capped for DeRozan then they will also try to make a run at Lowry via sign and trade. After all, they can only hard cap you once.   If the Lakers do that though, their roster really is gonna be LeBron, AD Lowry, DeRozan and like 8 minimum players. That's cause the hard cap will be $143 million, and LeBron, AD and Deng's dead cap will be $82 million of it. That leaves about $60 million for the rest of the roster, and Lowry reportedly wants close to $30 million by himself. You can see why the Lakers instead may be looking to trade for guys under contract like Buddy Hield."
"The real delusion is thinking we would take broken Bagley, consistent locker room problem Buddy Hield and some crappy pick that doesn't help us right now for him. We would rather run it back than take a deal like that."
"Not bad.  Quality over quantity.  Trae Young, Blake Griffin, and Buddy Hield."
Dont forget chris paul and buddy hield bro
"Buddy Hield can do one of those! And, theoretically, Bagley *could* be taught to play defense!"
YUP. And everyone keeps acting like they need everything in ONE player.   Its completely possible to get a good player who is great and running an offense who can't shoot very well  AND  A couple players that don't run an offense but can shoot very well.  Like buddy hield and DeRozan to the Lakers would be 2 of the exact type of players they need.
"Exactly. Ideally it's LeBron+AD+three 3-and-D guys  With our cap situation it's hard to get three 3-and-D guys so I'd be ok going after dudes who only fit half the job description like Buddy Hield or TJ McConnell, but a guy who can't shoot or defend makes no sense"
and yet he’s still 100x more valuable than buddy fucking hield.
No way! Apparently we can get Buddy Hield for Kuz + Trez. And then we can use KCP + THT + 1st round pick for prime Michael Jordan!
Are Malcolm Brogdon and buddy hield even in the same tier
"There’s a middle ground lol  brogdon and a first? Decent value, not sure if I’d do it though  A buddy hield centered package? The sixers want quality starters who fit the sixers needs, not an overpaid roleplayer. Hield is just a better seth curry."
The Lakers actually have the 22nd pick in the draft they can trade or their 2027 1st round pick. What exactly do you think the market for Buddy Hield is? Do you think it would take Ben Simmons to get him?
Yea this is the most disingenuous comparison imaginable. Dell Demps traded away literally EVERY first round pick NOLA owned EVERY year aside from 2016 when he drafted Buddy Hield... who he still traded away ~7 months later anyway. Now NOLA owns the most amount of draft capital in the entire league aside from OKC; they can literally offer up to 9 consecutive first rounders in a potential blockbuster because they own so many picks including all of their own.   You're either an idiot if you think trading down a few spaces to clear space for an actual great player like Lowry that fills a need for them... or you don't actually watch the team and know their draft obligations and assets and are just throwing shit at the wall to try and paint Zion's team as incompetent and continue the forced media push to get him in a bigger market. Typical.
"[Charania] The Lakers and Sacramento Kings have discussed a deal centered around guard Buddy Hield, sources tell The Athletic. Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma would be involved in a potential package, per sources.   https://np.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/orfp21/charania_the_lakers_and_sacramento_kings_have/"
Did someone mention Buddy Hield
**Bahamas Starting 5**:  C-Deandre Ayton  PF- Kai Jones  SF-Mychel Thompson  SG-Klay Thompson  PG-Buddy Hield   Would this lineup win a medal?
lol Buddy Hield is freaking Pau Gasol??
"Lol no he isn’t, they’re literally offering him for Buddy Hield"
"I didnt think it through any more than ""teams that I think would be scary to have buddy on""    Joker having the ball with murry MPJ and hield running around is a scary offense, but you're right that defense is probably a bigger focus of theirs right now."
"You’re acting like it’s impossible to trade for Buddy Hield, a man who has already demanded out of Sac and is on an enormous contract"
They both get paid $13M a year. So they can take on approx $26M. Buddy Hield makes $22.4M so those rumors make sense. You'd think they want to trade for some depth instead of a name though.
"Im a knicks fan who loves big markets. I love the lakers waaaay more than the average nba fan. I also love lebron.    Its just that you lakers fans think kuz is an asset for some reason that I dont get. I think the idea of kuzma as a stretch 4 is way better than the reality which is that there isn't 1 thing that he does particularly and consistently well, and players like that don't tend to make $13M a year. If im being nice, sure kuz could start and play like an average starter maybe... buddy hield would make some offenses (like the lakers or 76ers) scary af. There isn't any team that could say that about kuz.    I personally would not trade hield for kuz and the 21st, and I would hold out for a better deal. A deal that I think is likely to come"
Call me crazy but Buddy Hield is better than Kyle Kuzma no?
"Imo buddy hield is easily one of the best shooters in the league, and when you got a point forward like bron or simmons there's nothing better than a guy like buddy who will shoot every time you get him a look. Normally, it would make sense to say ""yeah well on this roster it makes sense to have 1 shooting guard and 1 shooting forward instead of 2 shooting guards"" but neither buddy nor kuz are giving you anything on defense anyway so might as well keep the guy who's a much better shooter."
Buddy Hield and Anthony Davis reunion lol
lebron would make buddy hield look like klay thompson sheesh
damn and I thought buddy hield was delusional
"So your belief is that if we dump him for CJ or Buddy Hield, or Kevin Love our title odds over the next five years will go up?   I really can’t say I agree."
Buddy Hield is a weird one with how it came out he's actually a year older than everyone thought.
The opposite for me is Buddy Hield. He turns 29 later this year.
Tobias Harris is 6 months older than Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield
"What the fuck was Steven Adams and his 25 million to lakers!!! This is the worst deal lakers would ever make and palinka would be fired the day after...   Lakers will lose a pg who is decent in shooting and without him, lakers will only have lebron for handling the ball...    Also, lakers are desperate for a good shooter and they get fucking Steven Adams for 25 mill and he won't be on the floor during playoffs.   And lakers get buddy hield for kuzma? Kings  would like to say hi to your noggin with their fist... And how would that even work? Kuzma makes 13 mill and buddy makes 23 mill...   You gotta admit... This was a pretty shitty post and you have the gall to fucking argue."
"If they could get Buddy Hield, Halliburton and Bagley for him that would be a great haul and could answer a lot of questions for them"
"Morey came in and shipped Horford and Richardson as soon as he could, and we're already looking to move Ben less than a year after he got here. He seems pretty unattached to everyone on the roster not named Joel Embiid so...  And I'd hope he stays greedy if what he's ""missing out"" on is Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley or a Malcom Brogdon deal lol"
Anything other than an elite all star isn’t worth trading Ben. If we don’t get at least that then we’re just in the same position just with a different dude. I would rather keep Ben then trade him for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley
Lakers fans: Maybe we can get Buddy Hield or DeRozan          Other fans: DaE lAkErS fAnS tHinK tHeY cAn TrAdE kUzMa fOr gIaNnIs
Well that should hopefully end that nonsense. The Kings should focus on a Bagley and Buddy Hield for Kristaps Porzingis trade or that same package for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams.
"It's not.  Both Ben and CJ don't have the highest trade value for different reasons. For all of Ben's offensive faults though I see him as a much more integral part of the team than CJ is to Portland.  If you trade Ben, who's guarding the opponent's best player? You'll have a giant hole in the frontcourt that's just not easily replaced unless you all get another wing (and I haven't heard any of them being available).  If you're able to get like Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield then that's a bit easier to stomach, but yeah I just don't see either Ben or CJ getting an All-Star back."
"The question is, how is Buddy Hield a decent trade package?"
"He had his head up his ass and played horrible offensively in the final games of the series, but swapping him for Buddy Hield is horrible. Who plays defense? Who runs the offense? Who is the playmaker? How is it better than holding out and not trading him at his lowest possible value?"
You honestly think Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley give us a better chance at a title than Ben Simmons? Wild
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
&gt;What would we get in this scenario?   You'd get out of having to pay Buddy Hield $60 million and instead would have all that as cap space to use.
"Wonderful. Give Dennis a starting salary of 19.2Million. S&amp;T to Boston. Since it’s 20% increase, it doesn’t trigger the Base year comp rules.   19.2 million x 1.25 = 24 Million, which is more than enough to absorb Buddy Hield from the Kings. Have the Celtics send extra stuff to the Kings. Perfecto!"
bro we're not fucking getting Buddy Hield.    god you people are embarrassing
"You guys almost unloaded one to get buddy Hield, it’d make sense to be able to sign and trade dump Shroeder and get smart back. Would probably take two first rounds picks to get that done"
"Same as last off season for Paul George with all the ""If Im Sacramento there's no way I would trade Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley for Playoff P even if they offered it to me"" type posts."
"Sneaky GSW pick by the Warrios. As KOC said for The Ringer the Warriors has a really balanced team this year. I think they still lack a sharp shooter other than Steph and Klay, which is ok considering they win it all without one of those. But still feel like they better trade for Buddy Hield."
If I were the Kings GM I'd offer Buddy Hield + Marvin Bagley + Davion Mitchell + 2 FRP for him.  Kings need defense bad.
"Mitchell. I'm not seeing how he becomes even average on offense and he is really old for a rookie. He'll turn 23 before he plays a minute in NBA. This is a list of guys being 23+ on the opening day picked in the top 10 since 2000. - Buddy Hield, Wesley Johnson, Ekpe Udoh, Shelden Williams, Randy Foye, Rafael Araujo and Shane Battier. Not exactly a great list of players."
Says the guy with this as his profile header  &gt;Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and Dirk Werner Nowitzki are the best basketball players of all-time. MICKAEL PIETRUS. Temp banned for spreading the word of BUDDY HIELD
Lakers fans about to ask how this gets them Buddy Hield
He's a superstar he could surprise you.   Maybe Buddy Hield was the better option though but Russ being a superstar and former league MVP is reason enough to take him.
"He openly hated LSU and the college ball system in general and still managed to be consensus 1st team all American, freshman of the year, and was in the running for POY, which was won by none other than Buddy Hield lol"
"I want the Lakers to sign him to a one year deal for $19 million and then trade him to Sacramento for Buddy Hield in January. Sacramento gets an expiring contract to get off of Buddy's deal, and the Lakers get Buddy. Everybody wins. Maybe the Lakers throw in some second round picks or something."
"Are you serious? Just tell James Harden that scoring points isn’t the single most important element of being a star in this league. Nobody ever said he’d be a top 5 guy, same way they never said it about Ben Simmons.  Fox’s elite first step combined with our theoretical step in 3 point efficiency more than makes Dame’s range a wash, since it forces people to sag off of him, allowing him to shoot.   Plus minus has a negative average on a losing team... and ultimately isn’t an individual statistic. Fox has shown signs of lockdown man to man defense, and is generally passable. Anyone who thinks otherwise simply doesn’t watch him play, which is probably most people. It’s not tbd whether the defense is an individual or team issue. We know it’s a team issue.   And sure, my theoretical jump would require 1-2 more shots per game, which if we use the league wide approximate average of 75 shots per game means he’d get an increase of 1.33% to 32.33%. Not a huge jump for the number one option on a team, especially if the ~8 threes per game previously shot by Buddy Hield leave the roster.   And again, you’re still not standing anything up to argue it’s more likely for Ben Simmons to become a star than Fox."
"Ah. Well fuck, I didn’t realize he was a socialite all this time, that explains why he looks like he’s all talk every single time I see his disinterested mug play basketball. Jeez, maybe if the league start evaluating him as a socialite he could be worth trading for.  But seriously, who in their right mind is indulging him in his fantasy!? This is ridiculous, a guy who just shat the bed in the playoffs and actively hurt his team while making zero effort to improve can’t really be talking rn. Just banish him to Sacramento for Buddy Hield, Bagley, and a first or two just so this walking thumb head can fade into obscurity."
"Am a wiggins stan, but the warriors offense didn't do shit to get wiggins going, wiggins should average 22 in the warriors offence not 17-18 like he did. With klay coming back Wiggins will get even less looks. Im up for simmons because i want the warriors to sign and trade oubre for buddy hield to surround us with a couple of more shooters, i think it could work out."
"Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield…IDK fuck it, why not."
"I agree it’s not the greatest option, but I’m not sure many teams would field a better option for Simmons. He’s just too difficult of a player to build around.   The only other option I’ve thought about was Simmons + a pick or two for De’Aaron Fox + Harrison Barnes. The Kings just drafted another small guard and Simmons would fit well with Haliburton and Buddy Hield."
Sixers will not just take Buddy Hield and picks
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"I think the Buddy Hield trade would've been leagues better for what the Lakers actually need, but maybe LeGM disagrees?"
"The person most commonly thought to be linked in some theoretical trade would be Buddy Hield, who is making $23 million, and whom the Kings are supposedly eager to get rid of, although it would have to be a 3-team trade because there's no way Sacramento wants Schroder.   With your theoretical Hayward trade, the Lakers would only need to send out about $24 million in matching salary, and about $3 million of that could come from Marc Gasol, so theoretically Schroder could get signed for $21 million and get traded for Hayward, but I don't know if Charlotte is even looking to move Hayward.  Honestly I don't know what's going to happen with Schroder. The Lakers may be looking for another piece like Buddy Hield or they may feel like their luxury tax bill is high enough already. We'll have to wait and see."
"Simmons and Fox is not good spacing offensively, though of course it is a great defensive duo.     Sixers asking price for Simmons is way more then Hield and Bagley, so no chance that happens.  Rich Paul knows that seeing Ben Simmons traded for Buddy Hield is not good for his image and brand value, so there is no way that will happen."
"What do you think is a realistic package for Buddy Hield? Oubre is *not* a significant downgrade. He plays a different role. He can create his own shot better than Buddy, and he is a very good defensive player.  But answer me what you think Buddy's value is. Atlanta has plenty of offence and needs more D. You're not getting Tobi unless you give up Fox or unless Philly decides to blow it up again (not happening). Buddy doesn't fit the young time-line of NOLA either, and I'm not sure what they could even give you for him.  Write out a specific trade from any team of your choice that you think would be a realistic return for Hield."
3 second rounders for buddy hield? jk….unless?
I mean if you think he’s overpaid then they might have to attach assets to dump him in January.  Buddy Hield has 3/60 left on his deal and the kings are struggling to get rid of him
Can he s and t for buddy hield?
I'm surprised that nobody involved tried to trade Kuzma and Trez to the Kings for Buddy Hield. Wouldn't he have been helpful to either the Nets or Wizards?
Bruh Buddy Hield in exchange for Oubre would be sick.
"Is Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield and Marvin Bailey enough to get Siakam?"
"yeah he made the nba finals! (with kevin durant)  he made the conference finals four times! (with kevin durant)  the mot damning statement bout russ is that by himself in his mvp year he got 47 wins, the next year with pg and melo? 48 wins. got rid of melo? 49 wins the next year. you get the point.  he didnt even get out of the first round until he was a true second option with harden  the lakers have too much talent to not go far, but i wouldnt be surprised if westbrooks unwillingness to adjust his game gets him traded midseason or potentially costs them big time.   it aloo possible that as a third option he can play decent but idk man, i still think theyd be better off with buddy hield."
Get Buddy Hield in there. We can offer Bazemore.
trash....  Where is Buddy Hield?
Buddy Hield come on down.👀
I meant buddy hield. Sorry
"If it really ends up being 6-8 teams then I wouldn't be surprised if Schroder is in there going somewhere with Buddy Hield to the Lakers, and probably Oubre in there as well. Tie up all the remaining loose ends in one shot 😂"
"Time to add OKC getting picks, and Sacramento getting rid of Buddy Hield in this."
"If buddy hield ends up a laker, rob pelinka needs a raise and his own super yacht."
The “He shoots like Steph and he’s big like Klay” quote was about Nik ‘Sauce Castillo’ Stauskas not Buddy Hield. See that quote come up in almost thread about Buddy and it makes me wanna pull my hair out
Having Buddy Hield would obviously help the Warriors..?
it probably includes the buddy hield trade
What?  How is he younger than Buddy Hield?
So basically you're saying.. Buddy Hield?
The contrast between Sacramento fans vs the rest of r/nba when it comes to discussing Buddy Hield is hilarious to me. If Buddy ends up going to a playoff team this off-season I'd bet big money he ends up being the new r/nba punching bag this time next year.
Buddy Hield in GSW? Jesus they’re really gonna make it rain.
Kelly Oubre for Buddy Hield? Battle of the 0 iq players
"I mean yes, but also, what a smug ass comment. “Oh, are ALL OF YALL SO AGGRESSIVE, uh, seriously like I’m wondering”   Some valley girl, basic bitch response.   Text does not translate well, yet no one seems to keep that in mind, and at the same time, read responses with the worst possible inferred “tone”.  Kinda like what I did just now, except I bet I’m right, and you meant to be smug.  I wasnt being hot-headed, it was more “dude, really? Or are you fucking with me?” Cause to say “the Knicks are dumb for signing derrick rose, they shouldve gotten Buddy Hield” is so absurd.  I said thrice, thibs made him and MVP and they went far together. Wouldve may be won it all if Rose didnt die for a bit. Notice Rose followed thibs everywhere. His relationship to him is insanely important, especially for youngsters. He also balled the fk out. And his price is not high.  Otherwise, there’s not even another PG, because saying “rose signing dumb” is insane on its own. Considering what I said AND MORE (not yelling, imagine its in bold, emphasis) how valuable he is, but also WE NEED ANOTHER PG. If we didnt, still such an important signing, but we need a starting PG. clearly there isnt a market this off-season.   But why youre trolling and why my coffee fueled, poop-break rants are done, is because for your answer you said Buddy Hield.  Not a PG, not even a ball handler, and a terrible value and fit. Like…what?"
"Buddy Hield, the man is a walking bucket and would make a living killing bench units"
"I read that Graham's defensive metrics are surprisingly decent for his size. Obviously worse than Lonzo. But he's also making half of Lonzo's salary and this gives the Pelicans flexibility to make another trade or sign someone (I don't know who that would be) else. I think if there is one more big move that fills the cap space and brings in someone who is even a Buddy Hield type of player, the offseason will have been a success. Otherwise, it's clearly not been a success.   And of the other things I don't get, is that as it stands, the S&amp;T to get Graham is separate from the S&amp;T to get rid of Lonzo. This means the Pelicans feasibly could have gotten both which would have been seen by most as an all-around win for this offseason. And for the people saying that Lonzo didn't want to be in New Orleans, that may or may not be true. We don't know what his private conversations have been like, but after last years trade deadline and this offseason's constant reports of Pelicans looking for a PG, it really seems like Griffin is the one who wanted to get rid of Lonzo. And Lonzo seems like he got along with teammates in NO and would not try to force his way out.  **Edit:** Lonzo, Graham, Zion, BI, Valanciunas would be a solid starting 5 to start the year off with. Especially compared to Graham, Satoransky??, Zion, BI, and Valanciunas."
It's gonna be Buddy Hield/Marvin Bagley/1st lol
So getting traded to teams with generational superstars has nothing to do with it? Why didn’t Buddy Hield win a ring after we traded him?
"He doesn’t have to space the floor by just 3pt shooting. Just standing a few out for a middy or floater would be good enough. And he wouldn’t even be the only upgrade.  Last year, opposing teams could hide their bad defenders on 3/5 players we had on the floor. With JV, NAW, and Graham (Unless we get someone else like Buddy Hield to take that spot), there isn’t anyone you can hide a bad defender on."
"Idk why people are freaking about his salary, this is clearly to set up a sign and trade possibly for buddy hield. Tht is getting traded"
At minimum you need to give up Mitchell to get Siakam and you likely have to give up Hali  You aren't getting a borderline all star for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley
They need to just trade Buddy Hield to us
"I can assure you as a Kings fan, I’d much rather have Monk than buddy Hield. Monk is better at everything outside of maybe set shooting."
Monk to me seems like a much cheaper Buddy Hield. In a good way too.
"I explained this elsewhere, but they could still be targeting trying to get Buddy Hield, only doing it mid-season instead of now. Now the Kings wouldn't want a signed and traded Schroder because you have to give a player a 3 or 4 year deal to sign and trade them, and the Kings don't want Schroder. But what the Kings *do* want is to get off of Buddy's contract, so if the Lakers instead presented them with something like Schroder on an expiring contract along with either Monk or Nunn and/or maybe a 1st round pick, they might go for that. They don't want Schroder, but his value could be as cap relief instead. They'd also then have his Bird rights, meaning they could then try to sign and trade him the following summer if they wanted."
"Alright, now we have to include Marc Gasol in mock trades to see who the hell takes Schroder in a S&amp;T for Buddy Hield"
I feel like if the Lakers can't get Buddy Hield in a sign and trade this off-season then they could re-sign Schroder and try again in January. It sounds like the Kings mainly just want to get rid of Buddy.
imagine espn when legm completes a 30 team trade to get buddy hield for a 2nd round pick and dennis scrotum
"Says the guy who thinks Buddy and Bagley gets Siakam lol. A realistic deal is Haliburton, Mitchell, Bagley, Hield and a pick for Siakam."
"The Lakers are going to be the classic team that slacks off in the regular season, it's an old team and that's Lebron now, he looks great in November-January, then he's on autopilot until March, picks it up a bit in April, then it's playoff time and he's in the mode to be GOAT. I don't think they need to finish as a top 2 seed, I really don't see that. Btw, Westbrook too always looks bad at the beginning of the season now. If anything the Nuggets, Suns and Jazz are again going to race for the one seed, those teams all seem like that'd prove something to someone more than it would for the Lakers.   As for the Grizzlies, yeah Adams and Bledsoe are on the team but consider 1) Adams is the specialist center, meant to play D against Jokic and Embiid, Clarke and JJJ are probably going to end up switching as the 4 and 5 a lot of nights, and that seems like it could be pretty good, they're both willing defenders and 2) their backup PG spot is decently stacked, Brooks, Frazier and Allen are at least average, even if Bledsoe isn't.  Grizzlies are a consistent wing scorer away from being a 5 seed, those young guys are only going to get better and Morant, he's that dude. I think he'll look as good as Donovan Mitchell this season. To me they're a stealth candidate to get Buddy Hield."
"&gt; Pelinka would be jobless if he had to rebuild a team like Minnesota  A successful GM that is a lawyer / former agent who was representing players like Harden, KD,  Kobe, Iggy, Boozer, Kman, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield, Drummond, Ariza, etc., and successfully negotiated their contracts. Someone who is very knowledgeable about the CBA would be... jobless if he were the GM rebuilding in Minnesota.    LOL  I doubt that given his track record at everything he's been doing since playing for Michigan."
"if they aren't giving us Haliburton, they can move their interest somewhere else lmao.  we're not taking Buddy Hield ."
In the middle of the season the Lakers could use Schroder on an expiring contract along with like THT or Nunn or their 2027 1st round pick to trade for some overpaid player a team just wants to clear off their books (Buddy Hield?). Just for asset management purposes I do not want the Lakers to simply lose Schroder to free agency. He still has *some* value.
Hard cap and we ain’t helping the Lakers get Hield. If Oubre were going to sac we’d just take Buddy outright.
Ohyieee. Buddy hield is still in play lezgo
"Very solid deal, was worried they were going to do an overpay similar to Buddy Hield.  Not to be a downer though but Holmes isn't helping their defense any."
"Bball-index has him in 99th percentile in getting to the rim and playmaking. Also has him as a top-10 point of attack defender among guards.   He’s not as good at finishing at the rim as he used to be, but he’s still among the very best at getting there. And his high risk passing style leads to a lot of turnovers but it’s still good offense because a lot of his risky passes lead to very high quality looks.  Is he a poor screen defender ? Yes. That’s not what point of attack defense is usually understood as tho. Maybe “on ball perimeter isolation defense” is more clear.   He’s a poor off-ball defender, horrendous floor spacer for his position, lacks the off-ball activity to mitigate his poor shooting, and is prone to awful shot selection and defensive gambles.  Trust me, I’d rather still have KCP, Caruso and the 22nd pick and done a deal for Buddy Hield.  But Westbrook isn’t a complete disaster who’s bad at everything either. He’s a poor fit and drastically overpaid and not worth everything we gave up for him (I’m including Caruso because I think we give him that deal if we don’t have Westbrook’s contract on the books). But he’s not a bad player or a negative impact one."
Buddy hield obviously
He's not taking about Buddy Hield lol
"And their 1 young guy can’t shoot. Everyone loves THT but unless he’s just Russ’ backup, him playing  with Russ will be a disaster. That Russ trade really elongated Schroeder, Kuzma, #22, KCP, THT, and probably Caruso…and buddy Hield"
"Every minute that goes by with zero news on THT or Schroder, I'm more convinced the Lakers are going to S/T both in order to pull off a Buddy Hield addition to the Westbrook deal."
"Why do people insist on proclaiming the Lakers a finished product when most of their big free agency moves still have yet to be decided on? Maybe this is the finished roster or maybe by this time tomorrow they have Buddy Hield, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills and THT added to the team, or maybe DeRozan signs for the MLE. It's literally a huge incomplete for much of their roster right now.   We should at the very least wait until 24 hours into free agency have passed before making judgements about teams. Things are going to change wildly for a lot of teams tomorrow and over the next week. Free agency didn't end when everyone went to bed on the first day.  This would be like saying the Clippers look awful because right now Kawhi and Reggie Jackson are gone. Let's wait and see what happens before passing judgment on anyone."
Didn't the people here want to include him in a sign and trade for Buddy Hield?
Has Buddy Hield been signed?
"i dunno this seems like fair market value for a guy with his numbers  17/3/4 on 45/41/75 shooting  that's around where THJ was and he got 18m/yr without the team option.    thats around what bojan bogdanovic scored and he is on 18m/yr.  and fournier is 4 years younger than bojan.  its better numbers than kelly oubre and dennis schroeder who each want over 20m  and amusingly that's close to what buddy hield had last year and he is on a max deal, albeit a really dumb contract to give out by the kings"
I like Dennis/Curaso/KCP and Buddy Hield a lot more than the team the Lakers have built.
you could always trade for buddy hield and marvin bagley
"He very well be replaced by Danny Green and Buddy Hield. That’s the thing with the Lakers you have 0 job security day to day, much less year to year."
"Awful coaching and two negative contracts aren’t on the team any longer. BI Zion Lonzo continue to get better, and you use your ten million picks to get a contributing starter like a Buddy hield or maybe let hart go and clear up cap space and outbid Portland for Norman. Keeping Lonzo isn’t “running it back” you can still do a million other things around keeping him."
If pelinka can somehow finesse Buddy Hield he should be early favorite GM of the year
Buddy Hield
"He's trying to speak it into existence but he gets basic information about the Pelicans wrong. For instance, he brought up the DeMarcus Cousins trade. Said New Orleans gave up two firsts and Buddy Hield, for example."
"Meh I wouldn't worry too much. We still have to finish building out the team. Seems really insane to predict what the team will look like when free agency literally started just today. What happens if we add 3-4 shooters? What happens if we manage to get Buddy Hield in a trade expanding the Westbrook trade? There's so many things left to happen that I can't feel any concern just yet.   I'll also add, Russ loves playing hero ball. but he doesn't need to do that with us because we literally have guys who've made it there, some multiple times. I'm not expecting Russ to completely change his game overnight, but I think having the type of guys that Bron and Davis are will help a lot in how Russ will play. Maybe I'm wrong and I'll look back and feel like an idiot, but I'm happy we have someone better than Schroder at that position."
"The Lakers must have something else brewing to where they feel like that's too much money for a backup guard. If they are able to get Buddy Hield then letting Caruso go will make more sense, but right now it looks bad."
"Man the only people more efficient on catch and shoot threes since he came in the league are Klay, Steph and Buddy Hield. He is in all time elite company at the one and only thing he does well and that was always going to be worth money."
"If they somehow land buddy hield, they’re hacking. Sry saw it with my own eyes"
Buddy Hield for Ben Simmons y’all need another point guard
What about Kuzma and Harrell for Buddy Hield? He got ahead of Shams on that one.
Y'all will trade for Buddy Hield and you'll like it
&gt;Have not ended their search for ways to land Buddy Hield.  Just renege on the worse Westbrook trade and do the Hield deal instead. Do it for the content.
"They chose the option that most often wins in playoff basketball — experience, athleticism, and physical dominance.   Buddy Hield made all the sense in the world. But give me the roster that can dad-dick players just like Buddy Hield every damn time in a 7 game series.   The Lakers are going to sign Dwight and a couple of other long, powerful players. They’re going to be old. They’re going to shoot like absolute dog shit. All season. And given health, they’re going to dominate every tiny 3 point shooting team they come across in a playoff series. With guys like Hield shooting 10% below their season average against the Lakers.   It’ll be funny when the Lakers shoot 28% from 3 against the Suns, Blazers, or Mavs…and win each series 4-1. The only thing stopping this team is health.   Only two teams in the west are built to fuck with the Lakers right now. A healthy Clippers and healthy Warriors team."
"To be fair, Duncan Robinson is a better defender and has shown he can be a contributing player on a team that’s actually good. Also, fair or not, shooting 39% in the playoffs for a team that goes to the finals has a way of raising a player’s profile.   Context and leverage matter in terms of contracts. It can make more sense for a good team to use their bird rights on a useful player and go into the tax than it does for, say, the Kings.   For the record, I don’t think Buddy Hield actually is overpaid, especially since his contract goes down 8% per year."
"I think a lot of the “Buddy Hield is overpaid” vibes come from people who  just saw the headline numbers (86+ incentives over 4 years) that he got for his extension when he was a little more under the radar.   Hield has a weird contract though — it goes down 8% per year. I’m thinking it will probably look pretty reasonable in a couple years when he’s making 18.5m  Still a pretty bad defender though. Like, “a lot worse than Duncan Robinson” bad."
I got a slightly used Buddy Hield.  Still got the 3pt champ sticker on it.
Can I interest you in a buddy hield?
I got a buddy hield you can have for Tim.
"I really don’t know if we would want Buddy hield. Fellow mavs fans, thoughts?"
Could have had Butler and maybe Harden. Imagine that team. Instead could be buddy hield or pascal haha
"I like Seth Curry, and I root for him to do well in any uniform he’s in. Buddy Hield is light years ahead of him, though. Seth will always be Seth, but I believe Buddy, given the right team and fit, can be a monster shooter in this league."
I honestly think that his best fit would be in Sacramento. Send Buddy Hield and someone like HB or Richaun Holmes and *maybe* involve a third team to throw some picks in there. No point in adding anyone under 23 to Embiids team in Philadelphia so I get the sense that reliable role players on decent contracts would do a lot for the Sixers too
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
Embiid is the only player Philly has that could get Dame out of Portland. Simmons for Dame is a sports media fabrication. Might as well try to trade CJ for Durant. Same level of ridiculousness. Dame would command a massive bounty that Philadelphia doesn’t have. The offers for Simmons have been Buddy Hield or DLo. Get some perspective.
"CJ is by far the best player they can get, and the only one that would make them better. Philly is losing so much leverage as this goes on that they’re going to be very lucky if they end up getting CJ. The names teams have offered are in the DLo and Buddy Hield range of talent, which is a massive step down from CJ, and nowhere near the #1b/#2 that Philly needs to get past the second round and live up to their contender label."
That’s on dell demps being a bad gm. I think he traded away every first round pick every year AD was there besides the one that netted them Buddy Hield. The only W those trades nabbed was Jrue Holiday
"It isn't if you're not getting an impact player otherwise. More young players and picks doesn't always equate to winning.   Would you rather have the Bulls tie up a lot of their cap on 2 guys or have Lavine and Vuc and spread the rest around on average players, depth and young guys? Obvs you would rather get Derozan and Ball instead. That's the win now move.   For the Kings' young players to develop to their full capability, they have to win now. They have their impact young players, they don't need more.- If the cost of acquiring an extremely scalable impact player to their roster is Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley, you make that trade 10/10 times.   But the trade won't happen because despite his contract, Harris is worth more and 76ers know that. He just turned 29, so that lines up for a 3 year window for the Kings."
Buddy Hield says hello
I mean no offense hes not the first player to be discussed in trade talks.  Like I am pretty sure buddy hield is not throwing a fit just because everyone and their mama knows the Kings are trying to get rid of him.
"They really fucked up scapegoating Ben publicly. if they would've kept quiet, defended him and played the diplomatic game they wouldve gotten an all star a month ago. I feel bad for Morey, Doc and Joel made this ten times harder than it needed to be. Theyre probably gonna trade him for peanuts, maybe a direct trade for buddy hield, Cj, maybe a 3-4 team trade to minnesota. Either way theyre not gonna get a second option better than toby"
"Trade Suggestion: Ben Simmons   Sixers get: Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, future first rd pick  Kings get: Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, 2nd rd pick  What do you think?"
"Ok, but it's not everyday a allstar becomes available to Sacramento. The last time was Webber. If you need to shuffle the roster around to find more shooting, you do. Or, keep Buddy Hield."
davion mitchell + Buddy hield
I just think it would be really fun to watch Seth Curry and Buddy Hield shooting a bunch of threes together.
how about a 4th team? i want buddy hield
"Yeah he said he prefers a California team but I believe he has 5 years left and it’s Daryl Morey. If you think he would trade with Sac for anything other than Fox or Halliburton before forcing Ben back to camp through fines you’re highly mistaken. &amp; while his value has plunged, there are a lot of GMs who would jump on that if Daryl lowered the price to Buddy Hield/Marvin Bagley levels who would be a way better fit than the only draft bust of the 2018 class who is a bad 4 and a bad 5."
You will take Buddy Hield and like it.
"Yea, I’m sure he’s just dying to play with Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley lol"
They can trade multiple FRP's and I'm not completely opposed to trading Haliburton (or Buddy obviously). But they absolutely can't lose Hield *and* Haliburton in this deal.
"Yup, Morey is such an idiot for not trading Simmons for a Buddy Hield package"
"Yeah not to mention Joel's defense.   I love Mitchell. Mitchell's gonna be great. I just hate Bagley as a player so much. They're trying to contend, so do they really want a trade centered around a rookie PG and a bust PF, with the one dependable offensive player in the trade being Buddy Hield?"
I hope sixers fans like buddy hield
I'm not sure if I should be telling you this but as a sixers fan if we get buddy hield after this whole debacle I'll s*** myself.
so the kings should trade their 23 year old franchise pg for a disgruntled ben simmons to further develop a 28 year old buddy hield? lmao.
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"Crazy how in less than a year we went from ""Ben Simmons for James Harden"" to ""Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield"""
"The most realistic one that will benefit both teams will be Buddy, Haliburton and future pick/s. I know we're all attached to Haliburton, but I can't see Philly agreeing to just Hield, Bagley without getting a PG in return, unless we see a 3 team deal with them getting Dragic."
"Honestly not really. Sure the Kings are in California but they don't have a lot that Philly would be interested in aside from Harrison Barnes.  For all of Ben's faults, the two things he's able to provide are wing defense and ball-handling (the fact that he's a single player that can do *both* of those things makes him special). In most scenarios, Philly would need to get two players back to fill that void. It's why I think the best theoretical return for Philly would be OG and FVV from Toronto.  Sacramento can provide that on a much weaker scale. It'd be Barnes and one of either Haliburton or Mitchell. I don't see Philly being 100% interested in either of those guards since they're so young.   Buddy Hield only makes sense if the 76ers were actually keeping Simmons. Can you imagine how awful a Seth Curry and Buddy Hield backcourt would be? Sure they can shoot great, but neither of those guys are actual playmakers."
"Hear me out .. Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and Terrance Mann for Simmons?   How could you say no to that?   We can even throw in Eric Bledsoe    You don't like that ..  hear me out   Buddy hield, Marvin bagely, and a bag of chips    You don't like that hear me out .... draymond green straight up   Lol"
Buddy Hield. He can be an excellent contributor on a contender. He just can't get out of Sacremento no matter how hard they try to trade him.
"It was never much about his stats, he a starter in the NBA for sure.   It is always about the money. He won't live up to the max deal he got. On his next contract his perception will change even more. Moving from $33M to around $20M or so. Around guys like Buddy Hield, Tim Hardaway Jr, Harrison Barnes, etc."
"LeBron, Buddy Hield, Zion, &amp; LaVine all feel weird to me as being the teams longest tenured players."
Buddy Hield?
Portland will get Buddy Hield and Bagley and multiple frp to send Dame to Philly and Ben Simmons to Sac
Philly just needs to realize the best offer for Simmons they'll get is Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley.
"Blazers aren’t going to trade for a 24 year old with Dame being almost 32 wanting to win now. They’re going to look for something that has a faster turnout (like a Beal or Towns)  Why would Sixers trade for Ingram? They have Tobias Harris who is practically the same player as Ingram, the two would just be butting heads on offense and be redundant. Sixers want and need a point guard, preferably a scoring one, and that’s why they’re pursuing Dame. They’re not going after a wing. They’ll get DLo out of Minnesota before they go for Ingram.  Warriors maybe, but I can see them being in a similar situation as Portland and going after Siakam since he’s more of a win-now wing that can fit with Steph, Klay and Draymond. One can argue that it would probably be the same situation as they have with Wiggins if they got Ingram.  Sacramento could offer a Buddy Hield + Harrison Barnes type package but i don’t think that is better than a Dillion Brooks and Kyle Anderson package. Dillion Brooks as a player &gt; Buddy + Kyle Anderson at this point is a better player than Barnes is. Also, Anderson and Brooks’s contracts are a lot more team friendly and they’re both younger."
Honestly I just wanted to say that because I can imagine Luka getting some sadistic pleasure from trading KP away.. but trading him literally back to the Knicks 😂  &amp;#x200B;  A more realistic third trade would probably involve CJ or Buddy Hield
Even buddy Hield.  Also Michael Adams was shooting like 8 3s a game in the same era as Larry bird.
"I mean becuase we thinking trading Simmons for buddy hield and some bull shit filler is not worth trading a 25 year old 3 time all star, all nba, second place dpoy?  I would say we are pretty aware but most of these trades do not make the sixers and better.  We need to win now when Embiid is playing at an elite level. M"
"No, their only superteam quality players are AD and LeBron. This isn't 2017 anymore, we don't have to pretend Russ is elite.  Buddy Hield would have made this team better."
"i wouldn’t hate it, the sixers badly need good passers. he also works out with maxey so could be a cool mentor for hi (both UK guys)   (assuming he’s gone regardless) if simmons isn’t traded for an above average playmaker they literally will have 0 plus passers on the entire team lmao. this is why anyone saying morey will trade simmons for buddy hield and marvin bagley is str8 up stupid.   no chance he comes here tho."
"&gt; The contract is a null point, it’ll be up before Mobley’s extension would theoretically kick in. That also lines up to when Garland and Sexton theoretically will start reaching their potential and we will actually be trying to compete and sign legit FAs to go deep in the playoffs.  Ok so technically if the cavs give hefty contracts to garland, sexton, and no one else, they will have a lot of capspace in summer 2024 right before mobley signs his theoretical max extension. In this case the cavs can waive lauri and pay him 6m to fuck off if he doesn’t work out. The problem here is that this is a very oversimplified scenario. The cavs can always use cap space to sign better young players, or take on bad contracts for draft picks. In reality cap space always matters.  &gt; We can definitely use the floor-spacing.  The sixers signed georges niang for a bit over the min, something like 3m. He’s probably in the same neighborhood as markannen defensively, and he just shot in the same neighborhood as Mccollum and Buddy Hield in terms of 3PT volume and 3PT percentage on a per minute basis (8-10 3PA per 36 @ ~40%). It’s not like stretch 4s are these rare beasts.  &gt; Because they’re going for the ceiling play— Lauri is younger, and could end up being much better than he’s currently projected.  As I said, I believe the cavs should have been able to get a solid draft pick out of nance if they played their hand right. Why would you want to pay 67m for a guy who hasn’t particularly shown it in 4 years when you could take a risk on a good draft pick for way less money."
I've been saying all along that the best they're gonna do is a CJ or buddy hield type return and some pick swaps. Hilarious to see all the sixers fans work through their denial that nobody is going to back the truck up for a broken headcase.
"&gt;From an outside perspective, Schroder seemed somewhat justified at the time to turn down the 4/84. The Lakers simply could not replace him if he left  No.  I followed the situation closely, will explain.  He had leverage on the Lakers for only TWO years, as that would coincide with when the contract of LeBron and many superstar players are currently scheduled to run up (this is a bit less true now).  4Y/84M already would've been an overpay, even factoring in his leverage.  To suggest otherwise is to suggest that the team would've had a difficult-to-impossible task getting at or near his production at point guard if he walked off the team, and there's no metric that suggests he's that good.  That said, I'm curious why the Lakers seemingly had little interest in him from the start of the off-season, to the point that they abandoned Buddy Hield talks without, ""we have this offer for Westbrook, take what I'm offering you or we're going with that."" And then, why was there so little interest from other teams that no one even wanted to offer full MLE money for him."
I’m taking Hield and Barnes for the mavs but I’m a bit higher on Buddy than your average Joe
"As a sixers fan, I’m not opposed to taking a package of high quality young role players plus draft picks if that’s what’s available. That being said, buddy hield really ain’t it at all."
"Buddy Hield , Dame, Curry"
"&gt; You’re right in saying that his value is higher than most people think but it’s also far lower than what Sixers fans believe it is.  “Sixers fans” aren’t some hive mind where everyone has the exact same opinion. I’m capable of having a productive conversation about Simmons’ value. I’ve actually specifically said he’s not a player you want to build around, but I’m not going to say that’s “definitely true” because I don’t know if it’s “definitely true” or not — we’ve never seen what a team built around Ben could do so any opinion we have on the matter is just that: an opinion. You’re right in saying that some Sixers fans have his value is higher than most people think but it’s also far higher than people on this sub give him credit for. Acting like swapping out Simmons for CJ McCollum or Buddy Hield makes the Sixers better is just laughable."
"Well then lucky for you we have the better buddy hield. Beasley is a conscious of his role but wants to keep getting better, he’s younger, and he’s much cheaper."
Most of us + our front office want to package him with other stuff for a star. If that’s not on the table then I’d rather just run it back. Even with his issues Ben contributes more to winning basketball than Buddy Hield.   Also Ben covers up for the fact that nobody else on our team can pass for shit.
"if they're getting offered Buddy Hield as the best player back, then Morey is right not to trade Simmons for that."
"The kings are the odds on favorite to land him. Probably for some sort of combination of Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Bagley and a bunch of picks."
What if it was Buddy Hield instead of De’Aaron Fox in the trade?
"Robinson and Harris are too similar, for middle evolution I would say Buddy Hield."
- Joe Harris  - Buddy Hield  - Klay Thompson
"Pels  PG: CP3, Lonzo  SG: Jrue, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield  SF: Trevor Ariza,  Solo Hill....  PF: Anthony Davis, Aminu  C: Demarcus Cousins, Christian Wood  &amp;#x200B;  So probably Thunder."
"along with the Lakers, surprised the Pelicans didn't go for Duncan Robinson.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly I'm surprised the Heat were able to keep him for so cheap.   &amp;#x200B;  You got these teams that have elite playmaking just crying out for a dedicated shooter, but they won't get the ones that are available.  &amp;#x200B;  Another year will come and go and Buddy Hield is still with the Kings. Eh?"
Buddy Hield has an effortless stroke. Pure beauty
"&gt; The Kings have a logjam at guard with Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Davion Mitchell and Buddy Hield  if only they weren't forced at gunpoint to keep drafting guards even though there were good non-guard prospects on the board and they already had good guards"
"&gt;the moves they made this summer were much better then getting Lowry  Disagree here. They would have had Lowry's bird rights to re-sign him + they could have made the Kuzma and Harrell for Buddy Hield trade that Woj reported was close on draft day. And they still could have signed all the vets like Ariza, Melo, Nunn, Howard, etc.  So it's basically be their current roster with Lowry instead of Westbrook and Hield instead of THT. Depends how you feel about Westbrook but Lowry, Hield&gt;&gt;Westbrook, THT imo"
"I disagree with him not being quick enough to guard guards, especially off of the bench. I think he does a good enough job keeping his man in front and doesn’t die on ball screens. Tbh him having to get skinny and fight through a bunch of screens is my biggest concern with him and I think our bench will be long enough as a unit to switch 2-5. I also don’t think that it’s always going to be a 1 to 1 matchup positionally when he’s on offence. Depending on who he’s on the court with, he can play the Buddy Hield, Danny Green role and just be a floor spacer like he was last year. He has enough of a handle to attack close outs and that’s honestly enough for me. Being a 3 n D doesn’t say much about your position, there are players at every position that can be considered 3 n D guys."
The Kings probably have De’Aaron Fox &amp; Buddy Hield as the their starting backcourt with Haliburton being the 1st guard off the bench.
Trying to get him for a deal centred around Buddy Hield is trying to fleece us just as much as Morey is trying to fleece everyone else
"question to philly and Sacramento fans  would a trade centers around halliburton interest both sides?  maybe somethingh like halliburton, buddy hield × simmons + korkmas, add picks as sweeteners if needed"
"We aren't trading Fox. Our current Team Operations is actually competent. We are trying to trade Buddy Hield which probably won't happen until the All-Star Break. Fox is cheaper, younger, faster, a better shooter, close in passing ability, for now at least wants to play for us, and a team leader in culture here.     Yes we have too many guards and yes we need defense, but unless they want Buddy Hield/ Bagley for his shooting and maybe a protected pick. It's not happening. I'm NOT saying that's  fair trade for Simmons. But that's what we have to trade. We'll likely trade a package like that for wing at somepoint."
"True, but that logic is also what led to them paying Buddy Hield so much cause he had them over a barrel on ""who actually COMES to Sacramento"".  It can be a double edged sword trying to pay people to stay in your small market."
Sixers would want Fox kings ultimately wouldn’t give him up hence no deal will happen  Thankfully for sixers fans Morey isn’t stupid enough to give up Simmons for Buddy hield and Harrison Barnes or something
Still waiting for the Sixers to trade Ben Simmons to the Kings. Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield &amp; Harrison Barnes.
"Facts👆 I remember the outrage when him and Buddy Hield got significant contracts, no one would’ve gave him a max"
he still wouldn’t trade him for buddy fucking hield lol  he has 4 years on his deal
"Never happening but replacing Divac, Ranadive &amp; his daughters half-time bollywood recitals would be a great start.    Poor decision making like Missed out on Luka for personal reasons, messed around with Cousins development, now you hear Buddy Hield has the same coach problem Cousins had with Karl but with Luke Walton.  No playoff appearance since 06. TBH not relevant since Kobe &amp; Shaq called them Queens.   This is poor management written all over it."
"Buddy hield had another down year, tyrese was a rookie, Barnes was good, and Holmes was good. Jonas and Dillon Brooks were better than all those guys last year. Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen are solid role players, and all those grizzlies players didn’t have the burden of getting to be coached by the worst coach in the entire league. So no they are not on par with each other."
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"
"kings were a 9th seed and would of made the play-in game that year. Who was Fox’s best teammate? Buddy fuckin hield?? The grizzlies are deep all around, doesn’t matter if JJJ missed time."
"Yeah. Like acquiring Kawhi for DeRozan, Harden ror Levert or Cousins for Buddy Hield. Or Shaq for Caron Butler and Lamar Odom"
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter
"Reports are saying Josh Green is looking awesome. I haven't heard as much about him, but I'm still hoping Tyrell Terry can develop into a Buddy Hield/JJ Redick type as our Seth Curry replacement. That trade still hurts so much."
You gettin Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes and that's it.
Terrence Davis is going to surpass Buddy Hield in playing time at some point this season.
"Add Buddy Hield to your list. Also, Collin Sexton"
"I mean this is just not what I see a when I watch the two of them at all.   Duncan is great at moving off of the ball, I would say even better than Hield, although a lot of that might be him just playing in a better system. He also has a quicker release.  Buddy just has a way more complete game. He can handle the ball well, and shoot off the dribble, he's a passing threat. But when I watch the Kings his off ball movement doesn't seem to be as note worthy as Robinson's does."
"Buddy ""Josh Smith"" Hield"
"So he's pressing F5 and all he is seeing is Buddy Hield + Bagley for Simmons or Beasley,Bev,picks for Simmons?"
"I would rather he attempted 13 threes than 4 threes and 9 drives. I mean, he’s Buddy Hield for fucks sake"
"Is Dillion Brooks, Jonas Valanciunas, and Kyle Anderson really much better than Richaun Holmes, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy Hield?"
"Damn, Buddy Hield out here catchin' strays"
"It’s Buddy Hield, the SHOOTING guard"
"Well I put this one in real quick but   To Pacers: danny green, simmons, buddy hield, possible picks   To blazers: Tobias Harris   To 6rs: bagley, levert, CJ , Brogdon possible pick   Kings: sabonis some sort of pick movement"
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
"What team is dumb enough to trade for Kyrie? The Kings? Kyrie for Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson? Kyrie to the Magic for Gary Harris, Mo Bamba, and Robin Lopez? Lol"
"Not only this, but I think there's another thing people aren't considering which is time.    A trade now gives Morey time to make other trades.  Just because they lose Simmons for pennies on the dollar doesn't mean they're stuck that way.  Given that we *know* what we're getting in Simmons, a change of scenery for different guys, letting Maxey show if he can grow, and doing other trades to get better fitting role players around Embiid is not giving up on their championship aspirations.  Morey wants to hit an easy home run for the score of course, but you can also score if you hit 4 singles.    Ideally, since we know they have to get rid of Ben, I think the best thing is to get rid of him early for whatever they can get, then use those pieces in the next year to trade for slightly higher ones, or better fitting ones, and retool that way.  Time is the only thing Morey can't trade for and he's wasting it by taking his chances at a trade deadline desperation move by Portland, Washington, or Minnesota.  I think its better to get the Sacramento deal done now, accept that they may not compete this year, but by next year Morey can work his magic and upgrade what he has.  And who knows?  Maybe Maxey will turn into a great guard, certainly Cameron Payne wasn't well-known until the Suns made it to the playoffs and he elevated his game, Buddy Hield might be an even better shooter with Embiid taking the attention off of him, and I'm sure Thybulle would work on his shooting more than Simmons would.    Of course we could all be praising Morey as a genius if they do somehow land Dame/Beal, but its not likely."
"You have leverage over Ben, but not over other teams. Dude is a diva, hasn’t improved since his rookie year, and is making max money. He gets played off the court in the playoffs because he can’t make a free throw.  He has talent don’t get me wrong, but he has major flaws as well. There’s a reason the players being floated in trade offers are Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield/Marvin Bagley, and Caris LeVert. Teams just aren’t going to give up a 85 cents on the dollar offer for Simmons even if he is All NBA. Sixers are more likely looking at a 50-60 cents on the dollar type offer if you want to be realistic"
Buddy Hield is not going to make the difference between a championship or not
Will the Sixers forfeit a year of having Buddy Hield finally push them over the time into championship territory
Tobias Harris is 5 months older than Buddy Hield and was drafted 5 years before Buddy Hield.
"Sixers get: Buddy Hield, Malcom Brogdon, and 2022 frp   Pacers get: Ben Simmons and Seth Curry  Kings get: Sabonis"

Buddy Hield is older than Giannis but got drafted 3 years after
Buddy Hield is the same age as Kyrie
Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis. AD will be playing his 10th year of basketball while Buddy is only playing his 6th season.
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield were both born in 1992. Hield is also older than AD and Beal   Also Brandon Clarke is older than Jaylen Brown
I don’t know if it’s just me but I was shocked when I realized Buddy Hield is 2 months older than KCP (both 28)
"There's 4 years, 11 months, and 1 day difference in age between Dragan Bender (#4 Pick in the 2016 NBA Draft) and Buddy Hield (#6 Pick in the 2016 NBA Draft).  Bender only reached Buddy's age on draft day (23 years, 6 months, 7 days) earlier this year (23rd May 2021), and played his last NBA game over a year earlier (10th March 2020)."
michael kidd gilchrist is older than buddy hield by about 2 1/2 months  andre drummond and malcom brogdon are also the same   dylan windler and sekou doumboya despite being i the same draft class are about 5 years apart
"A weird one that sticks out to me is that (from oldest to youngest) Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, and Bradley Beal are all 28 years old. Beal is the youngest of the four? And even moreso, Michael Kidd Gilchrist is younger than ALL OF THEM 😂"
Buddy Hield is older than KCP and Beal
Malcolm Brogdon and Buddy Hield are only a couple months younger than Bismack Biyombo
"Idk why you’re getting downvotes for this (other than maybe blaming Sixers *fans* rather than the org), but anyone trying to spin Ben into the villain is on one. Morey came out basically the second the Sixers got eliminated and announced to the whole world they were done with him and shipping him out, then spent the entire summer making absurd demands to other teams that *everyone* should have seen as reckless. Many people including me said this was gonna end badly and Sixers (and fans I guess) were delusional in talking about what they’re getting back.   Now predictably Ben hasn’t been traded because Morey is being stubborn, and somehow it’s his fault for not wanting to go back to play for a team that clearly doesn’t want him?   I’ve said before they should take Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley and be happy with it, and their likely gonna get a package like that anyways. But Morey is very clearly stubborn and gonna try to wait to swing a package for Dame if he wants out or something like that  Which is all fine and good but if you aren’t willing to trade a guy right away and want to sit on him and wait for the right offer, maybe don’t spend months telling the entire world how badly you want to get rid of him? You can disagree with Ben’s decision to not report but at this point that’s between him and his accountant. Sixers can’t spend months telling a guy they don’t want him around then get mad he doesn’t show up when their shitbrain plans fall flat"
"My worry now is that no other team is really going to want Ben Simmons at all anymore. Sure there may be ""interest,"" but the way he has made himself look during this whole process is egotistical, selfish, delusional, unable to accept criticism, obsessed with California, and frankly just a bitch. Some of this may be completely purposeful and spiteful by Ben and Rich Paul, which just further drives how selfish and how much of a bitch he is.  We all know Ben Simmons to be utilized correctly needs 4 other shooters on the court, including the primary big man. So you're basically asking a team to entirely reshape their roster for a player making a max contract and is all of the things I listed above, who doesn't even get along with teammates. Not to mention if you're not the Lakers, Clippers or Warriors there's a pretty solid chance he's asking for a trade quickly. Let alone other players around the league are probably laughing about him. Who would want to play with this egotistical, mentally weak guy who makes everything about himself? I would not want to play with him lmao.  I'm a Sixers fan who wants the best possible outcome for the team, and I'm curious what kind of offers are still on the table around the league, and my fear is they have now gotten so low that we may just need to move on with sitting him and let the young core of Maxey, Thybulle, Springer, Korkmaz, etc develop and let Embiid be the best player in the world. I fear we can't even get Buddy Hield plus a 1st round pick anymore. Brogdon plus a 1st is so far gone now. Maybe at some point down the road we flip either (A) Tobias or (B) Danny, Seth, the young guys plus (C) all of the draft capital we have for the star that Ben was supposed to be.  This is all so sad. I honestly don't think Ben Simmons' career will ever be the same."
"I think Daryl Morey knows how to maximize his assets, he did it for years in Houston and has been a GM of 15+ years. The deal just wasn't out there, nobody wanted to give up much for a guy who shot 33% in the playoffs. The wrong move, is to trade him for a role player and a few picks just because you don't want him on the team anymore. Trust me, trading him for peanuts sets us back much farther than any other scenario. It wasn't that we were passing up trades, it's that the trades just weren't there. We haven't heard all summer of a worthwhile move outside maybe Brogdon.   Really not sure why people paint Ben as having leverage and the sixers being the ones to panic. We'll be fine, Ben is an unwanted asset with 4 years left on his deal, sitting out is pretty much the only thing he can do besides pulling a Jimmy Butler. Only way Ben's value increases is through time passing and another team becoming desperate to upgrade (specifically on defense). Really don't think there's a clean break timeline anywhere after we lost so badly to the Hawks.  I can understand thinking we won't get a better deal, but I don't understand our players getting upset or going to management and forcing them to make a move. We're doing what is in our best interest with long term planning in mind. Riding out half a season isn't nothing, but it also isn't throwing away a good Joel Embiid year. Running it back with this team and Buddy Hield, now THAT is how you piss off Joel and make the team worse."
"$5 - Luka - The player we build around. He's the  youngest out of everyone in the superstar tier and will only be hitting his prime in the next 2-3 years. Potentially has a higher ceiling than Giannis/Jokic while  the KD, LBJ and Steph should be on the downswing in the next couple years.  $5 - Giannis - The other player we build around. Amazing 2 way player. The 2-man game with Luka will basically be unstoppable.   $2 - Myles Turner - Good defensive center that can stretch the floor on offense.  $2 - Buddy Hield - Great 3pt shooter to space the floor.  $1 - Lonzo Ball - 3 and D guy that can also be a secondary playmaker."
"Show me where I'm wrong lol. Simmons has the leverage here even if sixers fans don't want to admit it. So if yall keep waiting, ur gonna go from maybe cj mccollum to like, buddy hield"
People want to see a trade so bad that they think Morey is a complete idiot for not accepting a Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield trade like that moves the needle at all for the Sixers’ playoff chances
I’m not taking buddy hield and bagley get absolutely fucked would rather hold onto him for four years
I don't think his window is closed I just think he needs another star on his team to win in this current nba landscape. I don't think Tobias Harris or Beasley or Buddy Hield or anyone that is currently available is that star that will elevate the team. Maybe I'm wrong. But it's a star league. I've watched embiid try to close out teams every year in the playoffs by himself and I genuinely just think the guy needs another star who isn't afraid to take over a game
"They should hold at least until the end of the season if the best offers are trash like Buddy Hield or Malik Beasley.  For all the whining about holding Simmons is wasting Embiid’s prime, all of the current offers don’t make this team a contender or anywhere close, so it doesn’t hurt at all to wait"
Possibly Buddy Hield + filler.  Trade THT and picks.
"Morey has no control in Ben holding out. Not sure what you want him to do, trade Ben for Buddy Hield and shit? Theres an argument he should can Doc, but other than that hes done his job well so far."
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
"I’m not here to say we aren’t the worst, but I would like to throw in consideration for the 2016 and 2017 drafts for the Phoenix Suns. With two top 10 picks in 2016, they drafted Dragan Bender at 4 (in front of Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield) and Marquese Chriss at 8 (in front of Sabonis). In 2017, with the 4th pick, they selected Josh Jackson in front of DeAaron Fox,  Bam Adebayo and many other players that have been more notable. Those Kings picks in 2011 and 2012 are still worse IMO because the talent in each drafted was better than 2016, though blowing two top 10 picks in one draft and then missing on Jackson in 2017 is a very rough go."
"TIL Buddy Hield's real name is Chavano Rainer Hield.  Chavano is cooler NGL.  Also, he's nicknamed Buddy after .... Bud Bundy from Married ... with Children. That's awesome."
"And Brogdon, LeVert, and Dejounte Murray. Buddy Hield isn’t even in the discussion for the 5th best player from that draft"
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"“They couldn't find any good trades for me, that’s why I’m still here,” - Buddy Hield speaking now at Kings media day."
"I mean he's right. Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley have also been actively shopped for like 2 years now and were almost traded this offseason, yet neither is refusing to show up."
"They argue the upside of Westbrook in the playoffs outweighed the fit of a sharpshooter like Buddy Hield, but it shouldn’t be understated that the team would have had *so much more* flexibility to fill out the rest of the roster had they went with Hield’s contract instead.   We know the formula is LeBron + shooting + defense = rings, but Westbrook offers *neither* of those. It comes off like they just went with the bigger name because Lakers.  But then again, they don’t pay me the big bucks, so what do I know?"
Brandon Ingram over Buddy Hield in the best 5 from 2016
"He gives you over 15 PPG per night and is a good defender. He isn’t a liability for a team in any way. Now his contract is overpaid so yeah, he’s glorified salary filler, but he isn’t a terrible asset like Kevin Love or even Buddy Hield."
The second best player one the King's has been Buddy Hield and the King's have only had one wing player in Barnes since 2018 and their best center since 2016 has been Richaun Holmes.
Depends if the only other offers center around Patrick Beverley and Buddy Hield
Fair enough 😂  Still disagree though. Having Nikola Jokic at your side is substantially more helpful than having Buddy hield
"Lmao the Raptors prob have the worst team.  PG: Tony Parker, Patty Mills  SG: Buddy Hield,   SF: Gerale Wallace, Luc Mbah a Moute  PF: Draymond Green  C: Kevon Looney, Jerome Williams"
Fred-&gt;none  Gary-&gt;Buddy Hield  OG-&gt;Kevon Looney  Pascal-&gt;Jordan Mickey/Luc Mbah A Moute  Khem-&gt;Jerome Williams  fucking garbage lmao
"FVV -&gt; Decent backup ceiling, no comp given  GTJ -&gt; Buddy Hield  OG -&gt; Kevon Looney  Siakam -&gt; Mbah a Moute  Khem -&gt; Jerome Williams  Lmao"
After a year holdout he won't be worth anything. Not sure he is worth anything now besides buddy hield.
"I don't blame Ben. The coach and Joel Embiid dumped on him, then the whole media world and 76ers fanbase dumped on him, no one defended him. If he was my star player, I would not do that. 76ers organization have no one to blame but themselves for this unfortunate situation. Just salvage what trade value he has left, get CJ McCollum or Ty Haliburton and Buddy Hield for him."
"This is the weakest argument, I don't even get why it's being brought up.   Kings have also been shopping Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley, yet neither one of them refuses to show up. Players get discussed in trades all the time. Imagine what the NBA would look like if every time that happened the player just refused to show up and demanded a trade"
I think they’re understandably annoyed with the story and don’t care if they trade Simmons for a bag of beans because they don’t want the Sixers to be good in the first place.   They’ll tell you in one breath the Sixers are wasting Embiid’s prime by not trading Simmons and tell you in the next to just take Buddy Hield and try to beat the Nets/Bucks with that addition lol.
"Where did this narrative come from. Apparently cuz we don’t want Marvin Bagley and buddy hield or Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels, that we will only settle for dame and beal. You know there is a massive number of players between those players skill levels. Players like Colin sexton for example"
Thank you for being logical and not just looking at it from the “we hate Philly lense” that everyone in this subreddit loves using. They think we should trade Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden Mcdaniels or Marvin Bagley and buddy Hield. Both trades which add almost nothing to our team. Curry is basically a cheaper hield and they probably can’t co exist. We don’t need role players. We have a good bench filled with good role players and good role players surrounding Embiid and Harris. All we are doing in those trades is very slightly upgrading those young role players and pushing them out. People think we would be better off trading him for peanuts than keeping him
I would eat the contract before I traded for buddy hield.
"LeGM overruled Pelinka when trying to get Buddy Hield. Insistes on Westbrook. Now he must live with his decision. This is why u give players some influence but not veto power. Ultimately, they are players, not executives."
If buddy hield is the focal point of a trade I'd rather watch Ben cry in the corner and be miserable.   Like I'd sell low to get rid of Ben but not if all we get back is buddy.
He could help bring floor spacing for LBJ and AD.. who needs Buddy Hield anyways
they already have a bunch of rotation guys.... what they need is a ballhandler and preferably a ballhandler that can shoot and play defense.. trading ben for like buddy hield or patrick beverley is just a total waste... ben in sweats is worth more than that...
"Buddy Hield, but they liked Wesbrook more apparently"
"""They must trade Simmons for Buddy Hield straight up as soon as possible. Anything else is delusional"""
I’m talking more about fit. This Lakers team is still a championship contender. But in terms of how efficient they will be in the Playoffs is another thing. Hield is a way better fit for the Lebron-AD duo.   Think of it from the defense perspective. Would u be more willing to help off your man when Bron and AD run a pick and roll if your man was Westbrook or Hield? Buddy wouldve kept his defender at bay so Lebron and AD can work LA’s most efficient play.
"&gt;CJ and Buddy Hield are really the most realistic option for them but I guess they don't want to believe it?   Who doesn't want to believe it? As far as I've seen reported, CJ has never been offered. Buddy isn't even as valuable as CJ, though, and I don't think Buddy is worth it. But I think if CJ was made available a deal could eventually be worked out. I'm guessing what Morey is banking on, though, is that deals of that caliber aren't going anywhere, so he may as well wait for someone to potentially overpay."
Buddy Hield
"Buddy is legit a 1:1 value trade for SImmons hahahah wht are you talking about? if HIELD is in play, you better fucking take it"
"So does trading him for fucking Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley. There is zero downside to waiting a few more months to see how rival teams start the season and who has injuries or underachieves. The worst outcome is making a terrible trade that wastes Embiid's prime, it's worth letting the discomfort hang around a little bit longer."
lol yea no I'm not like those delusional guys. I don't think they get back anyone of equal or more value than Simmons. That's impossible at this point. They had that chance in the offseason of 2020 and wasted it.   But I do think a Buddy Hield could be a good benchmark. Not necessarily him but in that class. It's tough to say because we don't know who is going to become available over the course of the season but no I don't think they should be asking for a Dame level player. Someone who can consistently bring in a line around 12/6/3 would be ideal.
"So you've got nothing. You wanted him traded for some mythical package that no one got wind of and that would have saved the Sixers season. Thank God you aren't the GM, you'd have traded him for Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley or some garbage package based around De'Angelo Russel that REALLY wastes Embiid's prime."
"Maybe. Not many teams offer potential/made stars in this league. As low as Ben’s value feels now, it won’t feel bad all if (and it’s not guarantee we ever get here) the Kings are offering Buddy Hield on the side.    Ben’s a difference maker in the league and a GM/coach in this league will certainly take him on. Everybody wanted to do it for role players and got told no. When a star acts up, we will see. Idk what will happen but I’d be shocked if our name wasn’t mentioned"
"Lmfao. Except you are completely ignoring Embiid exists. You don't have the option of waiting forever to improve the team. You only get so many cracks at this and Embiid is a good enough player that he can win a title if things break his way come playoff time. Say the nets get upset and Giannis gets hurt, that's wide open. You need to be ready to capitalize on that shit. If that unfolds and you have Ben sitting on the sidelines Buddy Hield or whoever starts sounding pretty fucking good. A year later Embiid is dinged up or something, now you've blown his best chance at a title to be petty.   Your window is always shorter than you think it is. When you are where the 6ers are you need to be throwing all your resources towards winning a chip and you aren't doing that with Bens value dwindling as an asset."
"CJ and Buddy Hield are really the most realistic option for them but I guess they don't want to believe it? Even if Ben Plays, his stock's not gonna be much higher, his impact is going to be the same thing its been the last 3/4 years. Dame and Beal (to an extent) are pretty much out of his value range."
"Buddy Hield is definitely on the table, but I think the Sixers are looking for a much larger return than just him. Hield isn't making the Sixers a contender just by swapping him for Simmons. That's a team that is a second round exit at best."
Buddy Hield does not get us past Milwaukee or Brooklyn.
If you get buddy hield you at least add a shooter and someone who can and will play and you remove a negative distraction   You aren’t getting an all star for Simmons. Literally not happening
"If we trade him for Malik Beasley or Buddy Hield… that also wastes his prime. What’s so hard to understand here? There are two paths to the Sixers winning a championship: have Simmons play at 100%, or trade him for an All-Star. So that’s what the team is pursuing."
I honestly think Buddy Hield makes a difference for the 6ers… if he’s on the table.
"Where do you draw the line at ""role player""? Does CJ or Buddy Hield count? If it's Dame/Beal or bust, then this might be a long season for you guys."
Buddy Hield could make some nice threes for them. And MB3 could play 12 games before his foot falls off
“Buddy hield and marvin bagley have removed the kings in their social media”
We want Buddy Hield  We have Buddy Hield at home  [Hield at home](https://www.basketball-reference.com/req/202106291/images/players/bertada01.jpg):
"Bro theres no way you actually think Buddy Hield, KCP, and AC puts us over the Nets lmfao"
"I think the Kings will not make the playoffs. Midseason or before the trade deadline, Ben Simmons will be traded for either Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield + draft pick. You heard it first."
"It's not about the scoring load though, it's about ball handling and playmaking issues. Bron can't be a playmaker for 40 mins a night anymore tf are these guys talking about? Does Buddy Hield create his own shots or playmake for others? What if Bron and Rondo are both injured what happens then?"
Not many players in the league with more chaotic energy than Buddy Hield.
And to think they could've had Buddy Hield instead
"The Kings have beaten the Nuggets pretty often the last couple years. We went 3-0 against them last season, including a ridiculous Buddy Hield tip in as time expired. We’re like Nugget kryptonite."
I didn't understand why the Hield deal fell through. Buddy would be dropping 30 a game on open threes.
The Buddy Hield trade was a done deal for sure.
Ask the Bulls how that worked out in 1999 with  Jerry Krause over Jordan. Sometimes you have to listen to the superstar to keep the peace. I don't think Buddy Hield over Westbook was the time that you listen to Pelinka over Lebron.
Trade for Buddy Hield and not Westbrook
"Should have gotten Buddy Hield instead, makes 5000% more sense than Wesbrooke"
"Shannon is usually a LeBron apologist, right? He always creates a narrative surrounding LeBron, lol which is smart, it draws attention. In the end, this is a obvious take, WestBrook is a mess of a player, it's extremely hard to build around him. Buddy Hield would be a much better fit, obviously"
Can't believe they had Buddy Hield in the bag and then traded for Russ😭
"A - Shannon doesn't know much about basketball, B - it's one fucking game, and C - Buddy Hield is awful."
"&gt;As a Warriors fan I'm thankful for Le-Gm's intervention. Buddy Hield would've been scary as hell on this Lakers team.  It does make you think, doesn't it? Lebron has literally one of the greatest basketball minds of all time and yet he wanted Russ over a player that would've absolutely been a better idea/option in Buddy?   Something doesn't add up. Lebron isn't stupid. There's gotta be something else other than ""Lebron wanted another big name/star/friend on his team."" ...Right?"
"Buddy Hield has basically avg 4 made threes on 10 attempts a game for the past two season.  The only players in the history of the NBA that has shot the 3 pointer with that efficiency and volume is name Steph Curry and Dame Lillard.  Hield was 2nd in the league behind Curry in made 3 pointers with 282.  Dame was 3rd (275), Robinson 4th (250), Rozier 5th (222).  If Monk was 90% of Hield he would get well above 10 million a year and not the league minimum.  As for Westbrook.  I don't think he is a below average player, but I do think he is an aging star who has lost a step and is a very difficult fit due to his ball-dominance and lack of shooting.  Westbrook could still help some teams raise their floor, but the consistent decline of his playoff #'s since 2016 is concerning."
"For what? Buddy Hield and let the window with Embiid close? Everyone on the team is against Simmons, I think they’re bonding fine without him."
"The Lakers already had the Hield deal ready to sign. The Kings were reportedly ""shocked"" they pulled out, they thought it was a done deal.  This isn't some hypothetical ""If maybe they would have gotten Buddy."" The deal was there. They chose Westbrook over it, and it cost them Buddy AND some of their core role players because of Russ' cap hit.   It was a terrible decision from day 1."
"people talk about buddy hield, but i’m still thinking of how they could’ve had kyle lowry. he’d be damn near a perfect fit with the lakers"
"As a Warriors fan I'm thankful for Le-Gm's intervention.  Buddy Hield would've been scary as hell on this Lakers team.  A healthy AD and Lebron is going to be scary regardless, but give them one of the best 3 point shooters in the game today instead of Westbrook and the difference would've been night and day.  The question of talent vs fit isn't always a clear one.  But in some cases the answer seems obvious after the fact.  The Heatles were successful even with questionable FIT and overwhelming talent, but they also underachieved relative to the expectations. Many including JVG thought Wade, Lebron and Bosh would win 70+ games and be unstoppable offensively.  Instead they struggled to start the season and lost in the finals.  The 15-16 Warriors were definitely not the best regular season squad ever assembled in terms of talent, yet they were able to win more games than any other in the league's history, surpassing even the Wilt, West Lakers and Jordan, Pippen Bulls.  They were able to achieve this due primarily to how well the team fitted around its lone superstar.  It's only been 1 game and I wouldn't be too surprise if the Lakers make the finals or even win the finals this year.  That's how impactful a healthy AD and Lebron  could be.  I also wouldn't be surprise however if they fall in the early rounds due to terrible spacing, shooting and execution, due to an ill fitting lineup/roster.  It seems obvious to most that Hield wouldve been a much better complement to AD/Lebron, but I wonder, how much better is the current version of WB if at all."
"can you imagine this lakers team with buddy hield, they'd be champion favorites for sure"
Unironically they should have traded for Buddy Hield. There is not a single thing Russ does that Lebron cant do better  There have been colossal wastes of money and talent but using the 3rd highest paid player in the league as regular season injury insurance is something else
"It's Buddy Hield, not Steph Curry.    No bench player is going to make any team walk to a title."
"The fit with Buddy Hield would have been much better, but either way, there are two better teams out East and a couple of contenders out West.  The Lakers just got way overrated this offseason."
"If keeping Buddy Hield, means the Lakers don't win a championship. It will be worth it."
GM Lebron chose a ball-dominant Russ over Buddy Hield who would have also drastically improved their sub-par 3pt shooting
"Damn i really wanted buddy hield, great 3 pt shooter."
"There is no championship window with Embiid + Buddy Hield. All of this hooting and hollering is baked in, its expected, and it's more tame than I feared. If all Simmons is gonna do is say wah screw you guys im going home, then good, bye."
That was barely over a year ago which is crazy to think about. But Two post seasons ago with the bubble. And yes you’re so right idk what LeBron and the lakers were thinking anyone with eyes can see buddy hield was a better fit than Westbrook
That Buddy Hield trade not going through might be huge
"The offers he was getting this summer are still on the table, and will still be on the table in two months barring, like, Buddy Hield turning into an MVP candidate or Minnesota being 15-2 in mid-December. I don't doubt Mannix's source saying this, but I don't think for a second that Ben Simmons loafing around in practice when everyone already knows he's done with the Sixers will affect how other teams value him.   Once the draft and first week or so of free agency passed, the most logical timeline was always going to be Morey waiting until the 12/15 eligibility date to see if that opens up anything better than the offers already there. Whether Ben tries to make that interim period more annoying won't change a thing."
Buddy Hield fits better than Westbrook. Idk why Lebron swing for the fences for Westbrook.
"2nd attempt.  I fired up the trade machine and tried to find a third team that could get involved.  three way between Lakers, OKC, Kings  * Lakers give Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st, 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd * Lakers get Buddy Hield, Derrick Favors, Kenrich Williams  Why Lakers would do this - they dump Russ's contract, get a shooter in Hield, a wing in Williams, and an extra big body in Favors  * OKC gives Derrick Favors,, Kenrich Williams * OKC gets Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st  Why OKC would do this - they're going to be too good to tank, Russ can help them on the court, he brings culture, and they get picks out of it.  * Kings give Hield * Kings get 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd  Why Kings would do this - they get out of Hield's contract and get a swap and 2nd out of it."
"I don’t wanna hear any Lakers fans complaining about Russ. All off-season it was the Laker “Big 3” Russ has always been an inefficient scorer idk why people thought things were gonna be different. He’s perfected being Han Solo racking up numbers but he hasn’t played a winning brand of Basketball since KD left. He needs the ball in his hands to be effective because that’s all he’s done the past 5 years. AD needs touches, Lebron needs to be the PG as always leaving Russ out of Rhythm trying to attack out of control. They should’ve traded for Buddy Hield because that’s what they needed. Instead they were looking around the other teams trying to win with star power and now their defense, chemistry, and shooting have plummeted. Gonna be an interesting season."
I respect that you are defending Westbrook on one of his bad nights.  I'm a Westbrook hater and I think the Lakers would have been better off trading for Buddy Hield; but there are going to be mid-season games that the Lakers win because the other team stayed out too late enjoying the LA night life and Westbrook runs their hungover asses off court.  Westbrook is the type to bring that energy on a random Wednesday and sometimes that's enough to go on a 16-4 run that is the difference between a W and an L.  But a 40% three point shooter would still be better.
Give me Dennis “$84 Million Man” Schroder and Buddy Hield over the community builder known as Russell Westbrick everyday and twice on Sunday smh.
"Bjelica signed with the Warriors for the minimum - I can't remember if it was him or OPJ who had MLE offers, but it was one of them.   The real question is why didn't the Lakers trade for Buddy Hield. That trade was tee'd up and then they audibled and got Westbrook instead."
Lakers should have traded for Buddy Hield instead. Fit is really important in basketball. Westbrook will play better in other regular season games but will have an overall negative impact in the playoffs.
So trade for Buddy Hield?
Guys could have had buddy hield 🤣
"Westbrook is gonna be the downfall of that team, they should have just got buddy hield"
Lakers could have had buddy hield 😅  Straight goofys
"That's the thing....watching this game, I'm like why is he on the floor?  The Lakers were trying to win *despite* Westbrook.  I still think the Lakers can do something special this year but it won't be easy.  They should have went with Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook..."
They should've gotten Buddy Hield
"get ready for this all year with the acception of a few dominant stretches, lakers need shooters not stat stuffers, still in shock they didn’t grab buddy hield, LeGm likes to win w his friends and that’s not always ideal for the team."
Buddy Hield would have been a better fit unironically
picking westbrook over buddy hield will go down like bagley over luka
"I don't wanna be that guy, but i really miss the 1 day that Buddy Hield was a Laker"
"If you have no shooters, you have no spacing, with no spacing comes no ball movement. The Lakers are abysmal and this is why making this dumb FUCKING trade for another ISO ball player was a stupid idea when Buddy Hield was sitting there for less."
"Mmm interesting. Does this sound familiar at all?  Anyway, Sixers gonna have to trade Simmons for Buddy Hield amirite fellas?"
Kings fans is buddy hield still available?
Buddy Hield is career 40.6% from 3
By who? Buddy Hield? Tyrese Haliburton? Harrison Barnes?
I would rather have buddy hield shooting exclusively left handed
"We won’t have to be subject to this shit much longer, that Buddy Hield trade we all wanted should be going through any day now"
Poole is stupid asf. He thinks he’s Curry but he’s really Buddy Hield without the elite shooting
"The Lakers are good and all but what’s the point of Westbrook? Can’t help but think Buddy Hield would have make them better, Westbrook just seems redundant."
Buddy Hield or Westbrook ?
"We’re likely gonna have Barnes and Harkless playing the 4, with Tristin getting some minutes at the 4 when we play the more traditional power forwards. Luke said the rotation is currently 8-9 guys, so I expect to see staggered rotations like that. So in that sense, I do think that we will be better on the second unit, mainly because those are better defensive lineups. Which is really what we need more of, considering we won’t be lacking in points with Davion, Buddy Hield and Terrance Davis running the perimeter in those lineups.   I do think Bagley should be good enough to be a positive in some teams’ rotations, but he still needs to develop in order to be a consistent positive. I think he can do it, too. I hope he gets to a team with more opportunity, because he’s still a really talented player with a really hard work ethic. I just don’t think he’s a good role player, I think he needs to be given a chance to develop with more of an emphasis on allowing him to score the ball."
Eh buddy hield isn’t great but he’s still an unbelievable shooter who’d look great with Lebron
Not as good as u guys think.  This is season opener and their defensive effort is still ass except for AD.  LeBron is still a risk to getting injured and I doubt buddy hield can handle the ball alot
I think people need to stop overrating Buddy Hield
How does anyone know if buddy Hield wouldn’t just be joe harris in the playoffs
They definitely should’ve taken Buddy Hield lmao
Man they should’ve traded for buddy hield instead of Westbrook.
Buddy Hield + KCP &gt; Westbrook
Next stop: Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes.
MVP: Paul George  DPoY: Rudy Gobert  6MoY: Buddy Hield  MIP: MPJ  RoY: Jalen Green  CotY: Monty Williams
"So that they could accept a trade involving Buddy Hield, the corpse of Marvin Bagley, and picks."
Buddy hield doesn’t make the team better
That final ben Simmons for buddy hield and bagley post is gonna be the most upvoted thing on this sub
Buddy hield isn’t equal value
De’aaron Fox  Marvin Bagley 3  Harrison Barnes  Tyrese Halliburton  Buddy Hield
You can add Buddy Hield to that. From a [nut- grabbing](https://youtu.be/Uxl8Xi8nh8w) rookie to one of the league's deadliest shooters in Sacramento.
Third in the league behind Buddy and Steph for three pointers per game.      He's also shooting 41.5% from his 9 long range attempts per game. Curry (38.8) and Hield (40.3) are trailing him in accuracy.      I thought he'd lose his spot when Donte returns but at this stage the Bucks might just opt to keep running with his remarkable shooting.
"The best decision is going after Derozan and not buddy hield, dude is willing to take a paycheck for the lakers and help keep a few roleplayers but instead they go for the highest paid player in the league."
That turnover for the buddy hield half court shot was just the prime example of Wanamaker
If the lakers got buddy hield you’d say he only got shooters who can’t create for themselves and that’s why they are bad without lebron  You’d complain either way
I got that feeling too watching the latest Summer League.  Walked into the gym and looked up to some tall dude. It was Buddy Hield.  Went up to my seat on the third row. Some guy casually walking up the stairs a few feet away from me. It's Mike D'antoni.  😱 - me inside
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
Melo has been what we would’ve wanted Buddy Hield to be
That name actually sounds better than Buddy Hield Imo Especially considering his playstyle as a knockdown shooter
ehh buddy hield is more durable than giannis
We need to trade him for Buddy Hield.
That's slightly more than what Buddy Hield got 2 years ago and Sexton is younger
Exactly this. There are still scenarios we haven’t yet seen yet that would possibly allow them to play better. No reason to keep spamming Buddy Hield posts on this subreddit.
"my point is ben is a downgrade. Philly adding pieces puts celtics back to where they started lol.   Philly looks really good without ben. So any player that is a net positive they get in return only makes them better. Whether that be schroder + pieces and picks, it could only make philly better.      Imo philly shoud go after CJ or Dangelo Russell. OR go the shooting route and get buddy hield and other pieces from Kings."
I think it’s a stretch but if Boston had someone like Buddy Hield or even a Seth Curry to a lesser degree would make a world of difference.
"We would also deny to comment it if we were trading Tatum for Buddy Hield, but that doesn't make that trade any more possible.  If we were really up for trading Brown for Simmons, there would be no talks. It'd be done in a second."
Pelinka had a trade agreed upon for Buddy Hield but LeGM wanted Westbrook
Mr. Wilson to Buddy Hield:  *you are not Tom Hanks*
"Imma steal your shit ""Lakers Legend Buddy Hield"" lmaoooooo"
Buddy hield still trying to get out of sac town
"Whenever Buddy Hield has a highlight, there is always a jab on the Lakers."
I really wish Lakers traded for rubio and buddy hield instead of westbrook.
Sexton for Buddy Hield
"&gt;  buddy hield   Also Kuz, KCP, Caruso, Trez and Lowry"
That kid grew up to be Buddy Hield. True story.
Its nice to see Buddy Hield getting his respect but its insanely hilarious that he's always linked to the Lakers.
funniest NBA storyline this season is any time buddy hield does something good or has a good game everything suddenly becomes all about the lakers
Buddy Hield and Caruso.
They were also going to get Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield could never carry the team while Lebron is resting!
Meanwhile Buddy Hield only trailing Steph in 3PM this season
"Even if that person is Buddy Hield, I'd still have them as a top 3 team."
It’s 10 games and buddy hield doesn’t move the needle for them.
coulda just had the real buddy hield instead of westbrook  then you’d have two buddy hields!
Based on how well Embiid and this team seem to play with shooters surrounding him I feel like this makes trading Ben much easier even you aren’t getting exactly “equal” value. For example if they got a shooter like Buddy Hield from Sacramento and a few picks I think that could maybe help the team more than even a healthy simmons.
Buddy Hield.
"Buddy Hield would have produced at least 13 points out of those 13 shots Russ have taken (considering his 48% FG% at the moment and considering only 2 points). Plus 7 points from free throws and you have a rounded 20 points performance, just 12 more than Russ and the Lakers lost by 15 means that at least the game would have been closer (not considering the shitty defense of Russ and how many points he left on the table over there).  So yes with Buddy at least the Lakers would have a chance."
Traded Buddy for should've Hield
"I mean, he played bad for sure. But do we win this game without AD and Lebron, but with Buddy Hield?"
"Lakers could have Buddy Hield, KCP and Caruso if done correctly   But LeGM wanted the 2017 League MVP!"
"Can tell youre a huge Caruso fan  But at the same time I have Lakers fans tell me ""people be acting like KCP and Caruso are lockdown defenders""  ""Team defensive scheme is more important than personnels, Vogel is a good defensive coach so we will be fine""  ""People really be acting Buddy Hield will shoot like Klay in the playoffs""  ""Westbrook will help to carry the load while Lebron and AD rests"""
Should have traded for Buddy Hield + whatever.
"Higher risk, higher reward. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he understood the risk but was willing to take it for a higher ceiling potential. Maybe he thought the previous squad or the potential Buddy Hield squad at full strength wouldn't be enough to beat the Nets at full strength. Some Golden State Avengers PTSD."
And he was killing the Lakers momentum every single time by blowing a defensive rotation and turning over the ball.....all this shit is on LeBron and AD they wanted this dude instead of Buddy Hield.....
Buddy Hield is better than Westbrook. He also isn't paid 40M
Uh Pelinka wanted Buddy Hield not Russ. And Bron got all of his buddies in on vet mins. This is 100% on LeGM and AD. They hand picked who they wanted
yeah if they got Buddy hield they would’ve def won this game
I think we even could have had derozen. And with his lower salary also keep KCP and Caruso. That would have been the better option because he can least take ball handling responsibilities whereas buddy hield could not
"if a 37 year old melo didn’t turn into buddy hield so far, i don’t even know how they’d be right now"
"I watched Kansas games night in night out at the time because I like college basketball and because I am a phoenix suns fan and my team was awful at the time so I watched all the ""top"" prospects a lot. I understand it might feel like hindsight but like I said on draft night I knew we waisted the pick when we took him. I remember swearing up a storm with my friends I was watch the draft with that year. I wanted fox, Lonzo or OG Anunoby that year, Particularly OG. As I said at the time OG is what people think josh Jackson is. Before he was injured his sophomore year OG moved up as high as 7th on draft boards and if he hadn't tore his ACL he would have went top 5 instead of falling to 23rd or whatever it was.  and I knew OG was likely not gonna play most if not all his rookie year so we would have gotten a quality player and been able to tank again for luka. Sadly enough we got the 2018 #1 pick and didn't take luka. I'm not some amazing draft expert who is right all the time. Like everyone I get some things right and somethings wrong. But I was 100% right on pretty much everything in that 2017 draft class. It was probably my best draft year and thats unlikely to change anytime soon. I wasn't a believer in Markell though I thought he would be better than he is. I did believe in Tatum though I didn't think he was gonna be quite as good as he is. The only real thing in that class I didn't have the right read on was that I wasn't a Donovan Mitchell believer. Thought he would be a ok rotation guy.   And now that I basically put out all of my best draft takes ever here are some of my wrong takes so you know I am not just doing hindsight stuff. I believed Dragan bender was gonna be a star. I thought Jalen Brown was an awful pick at 3. I thought buddy hield was too old (that one taught me a good lesson). I thought Bamba was better than ayton. That one might still end up being true long term with how bamba has looked to start the year but its extremely unlikely if we are being honest about it. I fell too in love with sexton after the 3 on 5 game and had him over Trae. I wasn't a lemelo ball believer.   As for your point on the break. I believe Jackson is a better athlete then MacLemore and was in college. I am not arguing that he wasn't a monster on the break. He was at his best when he was borderline playing out of control. Which is how the fast break is played. its fast and there is space to make plays because there aren't 10 players at 1 end of the floor. The issue isn't nba schemes its that he can't be out of control and be successful in the nba because guys will take a charge or in the half court he will turn it over. I unfortunately have watch Jackson play in too many nba games than I wish to have seen him play in and his problem (at least when he was with the suns) isn't that he's overthinking. its that he isn't thinking at all. He is always trying to be that borderline out of control guy when the ball is in his hands. he almost wants to create controlled chaos. But he can't do that in the half court because teams are too smart, too athletic, and too disciplined for him to really let him create that kind of problem for them. And while he isn't the worst defender or even really a bad defender at all he can't consistently create enough turnovers to make his fast break skills a consistent asset for him. not to mention as the clip shows, he is a sub par finisher around the rim for nba standards"
Dont you think filling that 35 million of cap space with (just throwing out names here that were rumored to be on the table) CJ Mccollum or Brogdon + Caris or Buddy Hield + would boost the sixers championship odds?

What if y’all trade buddy hield for Westbrook. That’s a high point right?
Did we? Who’s gonna run the offense when Lebron needs time off due to injury? I’ll take russ &gt; hield anyday and let Lebron take all the time off he needs  Plus Melo is playing better than buddy and we got him for free. What we needed to do was keep Caruso and that’s literally it
They can all enjoy the view behind Buddy Hield.
Buddy Hield. To think Kings fans wanted him gone (including me) just a month ago.
Buddy Hield
"Jesus why the fuck happened this game lmao When did Sac become such a sharpshooting team? Oh wait, Buddy Hield.  Laughs in Lakers"
"Doesn’t matter, Buddy Hield"
"Buddy “I’m not your buddy, pal” hield going off.   Lakers fucked up picking Westbrook."
Buddy Hield.
"Pushing the line further out could very well give an even bigger advantage to good three point shooting teams.  While it would likely lower 3p% and attempts, it places even more importance on having good shooters to space the floor. It also creates much more space in the paint foe those good three point shooting teams. Players like Steph, Duncan Robinson, Klay, Buddy Hield, etc; become even more valuable.   Just pointing out there are some unintended consequences there."
Buddy Hield FMVP
Buddy Hield would have been absolute money
It has to be Buddy hield? That’s the only reason his name gets brought up every 5 hours
And got Buddy Hield.
"There’s no point explaining this. People are enamored with the dream of Buddy Hield standing on the 3pt line while LeBron did everything, again, at 36. Russ gives them a chance because his ceiling is extremely high. The Thunder were contenders every year despite being built with nothing but defensive players who couldn’t score.   He’s going to cost you some games. But he’ll also be the reason you’re in a handful of them. It’s going to be LeBrons job to mitigate his role on offense down the stretch."
"Yeah you’re totally right I’m sure *Buddy Hield* would have carried us to victory in this one lmfao y’all are such clowns.  An early season game missing our best player and several other key roster players? No, it absolutely does not matter lmfao"
Which kills me. Dude is looked at like a basketball savant yet can’t see that the potential Buddy Hield trade would have been more beneficial to this Laker team.
Buddy Hield would've been perfect. Should've kept Caruso and Kuzma too
"The lakers have had one consistent problem since trading for LeBron. Poor shooting. They got lucky in the bubble with KCP being unsustainably hot at the right time, and other than that have struggled to shoot well.   Regardless of whether or not Buddy Hield shoots his usual percent with the Lakers, he is a massive upgrade over who they have now.   Also let me remind you, the lakers passed on Bojan to try and make a run for Kawhi even though he obviously didn't want to go, and instead overpaid for a year of Danny green. They also let Brook Lopez walk for nothing, and he just played a big role on a championship team.They are not making good moves in the slightest, and I dont get how Pelinka still has a job."
"Lakers should sign James Ennis  Try to trade for Buddy Hield or Terrence Ross  Start AD at the 5, LBJ at the 4, Ennis at the 3, Ross/Hield at the 2, RW at the 1"
"What the Lakers needed was Buddy Hield, and apparently they had a deal lined up to get him. Hes one of the best shooters in the league and can get his own bucket.  Instead they have this, another failed attempt at finding someone to replace lebron while he rests. Instead of saying """"hey we have 2 superstars and we can stagger their minutes however we need to, let's get guys who fit around them."""" They decide to go after the big name, who is the worst fit possible."
Buddy hield would never
Do you really think Buddy Hield would have led the Lakers to wins against OKC?
"Hate to kick a man when he’s down, but the Lakers fucked up massively by trading for Westbrook instead of Buddy Hield"
At least you could trade Buddy Hield to any team in the league
no I'm saying the kings won't offer either of them alone. Like they can't even just get haliburton and buddy hield. At least according to reports.
"The mid-2010s Iowa state teams were loaded in retrospect. Niang, Monte Morris, Abdul Nader, Naz Long, Matt Thomas, Deonte Burton have all been in the league. Niang and Buddy Hield were the main big 12 guys of that period who actually scared me bc of how good they were.   Interesting how the narrative at the time was my Kansas teams had the big players and ISU was the scrappy underdog when really Niang and Morris have had far better careers than Perry Ellis and Frank Mason have had. Fuckin Steve prohm"
"Lakers have a chance to win and westbrook has been decent. However, he is not what the lakers needed. If they had caruoso and buddy hield and kcp they would have been better. Even demar derozan would be better than Westbrook for lakers because westbrooks lows are really low. Westbrook is too volatile. They also don't play defense and Westbrook is not a good defender."
Buddy Hield is basketball chaos
"Goddamn that memes been around for so long, that was originally used when someone described Buddy Hield right? I forget the context it was originally used for."
"So Lebron pulled the trigger on Westbrook because clearly if it came down to it and Dame became available, Portland would want him clearly over Buddy Hield.  Good thinking, LeGM."
Kings trade away Buddy Hield
"Collin Sexton, Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, and Malcom Brogdon. I'm sure other discussions have occurred. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean no discussions have been taking place."
"Obviously they would be the faves to win, but would Dame be at his best with Lebron? He just sit in the corner and wait for Lebron to pass to him for the open 3?  If they want this strategy, they should've gotten Buddy Hield."
Buddy hield is just a very good Wayne Ellington. I don’t think he changes the team much. Obviously better shooting helps but he costs them a good defender.
LeBron + space is still all you need. LA shoulda just gotten Buddy Hield and they would've been able to run this and kept their defense elite
Lol buddy hield
"&gt; If this happened in the middle of February, it would be just as weird.  Coincidentally, last February MPJ had a 6-game stretch where he averaged 9 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assist, on 35%/24%/62% shooting splits. Buddy Hield had a 6-game stretch in March where he shot 32%/28% from 3. Even Steph Curry had one where he shot 38%/31%. Should I go on?     Anything can happen in 6 games, especially when you’re a high-volume 3-point shooter. You’re being fooled by randomness."
"Last February he had a 6-game stretch where he averaged 9 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assist, on 35%/24%/62% shooting splits. Similarly, Buddy Hield had a 6-game stretch where he shot 32%/28% from 3. Even Steph Curry had one where he shot 38%/31%.    Seems like a lot of over-reacting just because it happened to come in the first six games of the season, and not some random 6-game stretch in the middle of winter.    3-point shooters will have stretches of games where they miss a lot of shots, and they're not gonna look very good during them!"
Always been a slow starter and also...  Last year they added Halliburton as a back court team mate and then this year added Davion Mitchell.   All while buddy hield should prolly be the starting 2 guard next to fox.  (I like Halliburton tho)
"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
I knew Buddy was older but this is wild.   Barnes seems like an old vet in this league while Hield still seems like a “young guy”.
Buddy hield will always have a job
Buddy Hield: Won in 2020 with the disastrous kings  Fixed it
"&gt; Devin Booker: Won in 2018 during the Disastrous Suns Era.  The real question here is did you not say that Buddy Hield (whose name you spelt incorrectly) won during the Disastrous Kings Era because you've got a Kings flair or because the Disastrous Kings Era is so long that ""Era"" really sells it short?"
"Shooting from the hip, but does a Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield based package make sense for the Sixers?"
"Which is why this Lakers team is so frustrating. Anyone and their mother can tell you how to build a LeBron team now, get shooters and role players that play defense and can knock down a 3 or occasionally create for themselves or others. That 2017 Cavs team was something else, I remember them dropping 80 points in a half when everything was clicking.    They had Buddy Hield, a shining example of the player LeBron needs, and instead went for Westbrook who basically shares all the same skills and has worse defense."
Buddy hield for westbrook and deandre jordan
Buddy Hield makes more than all of them combined
"Yet and to think those 2nd rounders blossomed late.  The 1st rounder can blossom anytime then right if i'm not mistaken?  it's 20 games, they had a terrible coach. didn't watch any kings games, but i'm sure as hell luke walton sucks.  Ain't saying he is the pure reason as Davion is struggling, because Davion is clearly having the jitters. but we ain't 1/4 into the season, if he still gonna suck in the end of the year then fight me. give me another year or two, or just one, then you can give up on him  Buddy Hield was the 5th overall pick, was somewhat underwhelming in his rookie year then picked it up a ton when he came to the Kings (ironic isn't it)  Just literally give him a tad bit of time. 20 games is a small sample size  Oh yes props to Duarte  Add on to my og reply, college is really different than the nba. the nba is the biggest bball pro league in the world probably, really hard to just transfer your game straight up even if you played a lot in college. davion will have an impact, just wait.  coming from a hawks fan"
"Siakam… buddy hield… kuzma… remember last season people were shitting on edwards for like half the season? give the kid a chance, not everyone comes in and be fucking LeBron James or Luka."

"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
"&gt; or when they draft players at the same position pretty much every year (first it was centers, now its pgs),   Look I get that clowning the Kings bad decisions is easy karma, but Haliburton can play 1-3 and Mitchell was the best perimeter defender in the draft to a team that needed perimeter defense. And they thought they were trying to trade Buddy Hield.  So it’s easy to say “they only drafted PGs” when that’s just twisting the facts just to say “lol Kangz” for easy karma"
Lol I’m a Pistons and Lakers fan  I bought the championship official T shirt and hat and the parade shirt with all the players faces drawn as cartoon  Even bought the Mickey championship shirt.   Die hard lakers fans and sports analysts that live and breathe Laker nation like Shannon Sharp and even all other basketball analysts many who are former players like shaq and chuck all agree that since the championship AD has done Jack shit just like he was doing for the Pelicans.   Like I said LeBron put up better numbers than him in the season after their title run. That’s embarrassing considering LeBron has played the 3rd most mi hers in NBA history.   I call it how it is. LeBron made a huge error trading for Westbrook and stopping the Buddy Hield deal.   If he has that kind of pull he could have and should have pushed to resign Caruso but bungled that as well   Westbrook has been utter ass and along with ADs poor effort is the reason why the Lakers are barely a .500 team  It’s an insult that AD made the top 75 list and players like Dwight didn’t.
The Buddy Hield trade was pretty much exactly what they needed and I am SO happy they outsmarted themselves and went with Westbrook instead.
Didnt he want buddy hield instead of russ?
"Reverse the trade that gave us westbrook, sign buddy hield"
Don't forget trading for Westbrook instead of Buddy Hield.
Three way trade:  Lakers get Jerami Grant and Buddy Hield  Kings get Russell Westbrook and Trey Lyles  Pistons get THT and Marvin Bagley  Who says no? All three teams?
Buddy Hield who is literally on the Kings came into the league at 24 and was pretty bad the first half of his rookie season. Turned out just fine. Why overreact to 15 games
If we’re basing value on PPG then I guess Buddy Hield should be enough to get a deal done
Buddy Hield is an old geezer getting paid 24 mil a year and is worse than Curry Hard pass. Bagley is a bonafide scrub. He cant play. Haliburton is a role player.
"nah Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton and Marvin Bagley for Ben is an actual deal Philly can work with    u/dmorey plz respond"
I think Dejounte is worlds better than Buddy Hield
To be fair firing Luke Walton was the right thing to do regardless.    Somewhere Buddy Hield just jizzed so hard it hit his ceiling.
"Kings have a decent roster.  Like D'Aaron Fox is a rising star, Buddy hield is one of the best shooters rn and the rest of the roster is solid.  They should be a 6-8th seed in the west.  The problem with the Kings rn is Luke and now that hes gone I expect everything to improve."
Finally!! This guy needs to go. He didn’t play Buddy Hield for some reason and now he doesn’t want to play Bagley when he is healthy..
"Cause you were ignoring context about buddy hield fitting on the team and thinking he was just solely a catch and shoot guy and can't shoot anything besides that or ignoring what made the 2020 Lakers a championship team but I'll wait until Christmas and hopefully things get better. I just hope we win convincingly against Detroit and beat NY coming as well  If we're still struggling going into asb please don't change goalpost and say shit like ""wait until post asb"" and I will gladly come back and be happy if we're in the WCF"
"Trade Dennis, KCP, and THT for Lowry at the deadline last year, extend.  Kuzma, Harrell for Buddy Hield if they both preform badly, I actually thought Harrell was nice for the regular season and Kuzma is an underrated defender, maybe Lowry would’ve helped out his offensive woes in the playoffs.  Get Rudy Gay/Otto Porter Jr instead of Nunn.  Bing back the 🐐 Alex Caruso."
"&gt; He wouldn’t help your offense while LeBron was out. He doesn’t help others. He’s not even the fourth best players on his own squad and they’re shit? The past three weeks minus Bron he’d be the second best player on your team.  He's a role player for the king's that's shooting damn near 40% from three on 10 attempts per game. You're acting like our offense is doing great with Russ currently we're barely getting wins against teams like the grizzlies and rockets  &gt; And Caruso isn’t playing that well actually. The Bulls are. But Caruso is actually having a normal, not not worse season that average for him minus free throws.  He'd still instantly be our 3rd best defender on our team that struggles hard defensively atm, he'd still do wonders for our teams defense along with kcp or kuzma (leaning more towards kcp has he's pretty serviceable defensively)  &gt; Look dude. Washington fans were bitching just like you this time last year, then Westy made them all stfu and take their medicine when it suddenly clicked past Christmas. Have some fucking patience dude. It’s November. Reacting now would be like saying “well; we’re down 6 and it’s 3 minutes into the 1st quarter. Better turn it off. Because this team is going to lose.”  Damn he turned up during the later half of the seasons against teams that were either already done competing or comfortably in a playoff seeding and then what happened when it actually happened? It's so weird when people bring this up about Russ and then leave out what happened when the playoffs started. Russ also delt with injuries/covid iirc during the beginning half of last season and he doesn't have that excuse anymore and he's been mostly either just there or terrible for us rarely ""good""   &gt; They’re going to bounce back. They’re going to need Westbrook. Westbrook has been decried by people like you every single season, and then in March where are you? Why don’t we agree to disagree until March and if your team is still flirting with a 7-8 seed you can come and give me a nice glass of “I told you so”. I doubt you’re going to be doing that though because I expect the Lakers to climb to 1-4; because no one in the west right now outside of the Warriors looks elite. And Buddy Hield wasn’t making you favorites against a fully healthy Warriors team.   They'll eventually bounce back but if the ""Russ Cycle"" happens again then it waste of a trade so idk why you're bringing this up like it's a good thing. Anytime we play top seeded teams in the west we get embarrassed cause we can't defend for shit and our offense is relying on Melo to drop 25+. I don't see this team magically turning into the defensive team like we were the two years prior and if we kept kcp and Caruso along with buddy being the sniper he is we'd at least be good defensively and the other two knows the system well and aren't new  Last thing and I hate when people use this comparison  &gt; The heatles started 9-13.  This is a terrible comparison considering one, the NBA was much different **11 years ago** compared to entirely new league and two those guys were in their 20s and Wade didn't have injury issues yet. You can't compare an older LeBron, AD with injury issues and a past his prime Russ to that squad, the more accurate comparison is 2012-2013 Lakers if anything  I'll be patient but my biggest issue with this team is we lost our defensive identity that carried us for the past two years and if we were going to tank that why do we not trade for a player that would gel better with LeBron and keep the players that helped us create what made us great?"
"He wouldn’t help your offense while LeBron was out. He doesn’t help others. He’s not even the fourth best players on his own squad and they’re shit? The past three weeks minus Bron he’d be the second best player on your team.  And Caruso isn’t playing that well actually. The Bulls are.

But you’re not even Monday morning QBing. You’re Monday Morning QB in the 1st Quarter. You want to talk about context? The context is that teams that add a superstar need time to learn how to fit together. The heatles started 9-13.   Have some patience."
"&gt; Future HOF Buddy Hield has helped lead the Kings to a…checks notes 6-10 record.   He doesnt lead lol hes a role player and one of the best in the league at what he does. If lakers did this trade, they dont get westbrick, which means they also keep their depth  &gt; Lakers are a top 4 seed in the west and cruise to a WCF.  🤣🤣🤣 only thing they are cruising to is a 1st round exit"
"Man, every time I watch Russ I think about how they could have gave up less to get Buddy Hield. Keep Caruso and Kcp and get a guard that can actually shoot."
Best shooters in the NBA:  1) Bobby Portis  2) curry or buddy hield maybe idk
"Trade Russell Westbrook for kcp, Montrez Harrell and Buddy Hield."
Dude didn’t you know? Future HOF Buddy Hield has helped lead the Kings to a…*checks notes* 6-10 record.   But seriously this roster will take time to gel. I mean the Rockets we’re like what? 13th in the league around this time 2 years ago? We aren’t at Thanksgiving yet. Haven’t sniffed December. People just hate the Lakers so much that they can’t wait to be right about the Lakers sucking.  Too bad these clowns won’t show Up to eat their crow when the Lakers are a top 4 seed in the west and cruise to a WCF.
We'll still take Buddy Hield
"Hahaha Let’s just give it some time guys, pls. The lakers when all 3 stars are healthy are 4-3. Admittedly a few of those wins  have come against some pretty easy teams and weren’t by big margins, but also 2 of the games the Lakers lost, they were leading. They were leading against Warriors going into the last and were leading against Boston at half time. So really only 1 of the games when the new look Lakers have played, they have been totally non competitive and didn’t look like winning.  Today’s game was also after Lebron had 2 weeks off, so a bit of rust. If the Lakers win one of those games they are 5-2 with the new look roster, which is quite good. Considering everyone and their mammas knew it would take time for this team to gel.  So let’s all just take a step back, wait until about half way through the season and then say that Lebron was in over his head.  At the end of the day, Lakers did the right thing trading KCP and Kuzma who constantly got clowned and abused last year, for some guy who is a future HoF and just came off averaging another triple double. The Lakers tried for another ring, that’s the best thing you can ask for. Never will hate on them getting Westbrook for what were their bench players. Couldn’t of got a better player or even someone close to Westbrook. Buddy Hield?? Please."
"I absolutely hate this kind of take.  You people sometimes make these presumptions that a player can in no way adapt and play a role that is within their skill set and  fits the team better.  Russell Westbrook can in no way play a spot up shooter or any shooter for that matter, that's not within his skill set, his shot was always bad and no one trusts that he's going to improve it at this age. However Derozan can shoot and players don't lose their ability to shoot once their role changes in a certain lineup. Players don't lose their ability to shoot the ball if they don't dribble it beforehand. The ones that do lose it, lose it because of their ego or laziness. Case in point - Carmelo Anthony.  As the matter of fact I don't understand how can people still have this take after witnessing the past 5 years of Melo's career. Dude never lost the ability to shoot the ball, the only thing that needed adjusting was his own ego.  So no, Buddy Hield is not a better fit than Derozan because they are both human basketball players, not some one dimensional video game characters, and one is just simply better than the other at almost everything."
They could’ve done that Buddy Hield trade like they were supposed to while still staying great on defense. LeGM really fumbled this one.
"I don't think you'd be this bad if you had dealt for Hield because you'd have Buddy and KCP. Just keeping that extra perimeter defender would do so much for the team. But agreed on the main point that it's still nuts the team decided to reboot a team that was beating the eventual representative from the West in the Finals before AD got hurt. Literally, what was the rationale for not running it back?"
Thats probably a statline for Lakers Buddy Hield
I don’t remember anyone thinking it was a good trade at all. I remember people thinking buddy hield was the better trade.
"You think it's bad now? Wait till Vogel gets fired and we promote literally one of the worst coaches in NBA history Fizdale to head coach. If we're not looking better by Christmas, this season is finished and at that point who knows what will happen because we have one more year of $45M Westbrook (he ain't turning down that player option), LeBron is a year older and Anthony Davis is locked in 3 more years. No cap space, no draft picks for a long while. This isn't even about Buddy Hield or Caruso or DeRozan. It's about turning over 12 of your 15 man roster and expecting them to just fit seamlessly. We'd still be this bad even if we had traded for Hield instead (especially given his own defensive stats). Our third best player right now is 37 year old Melo who just physically can't play more than 20 minutes a night every game. What was signing Malik Monk for if he is just going to air ball good looks for 3? We have 4 players on the roster that we simply cannot play whatsoever because they're an utter liability.  All we needed was a good point guard and a good center after last season. Instead they TNT the entire roster and think we're in the driver's seat again DESPITE LITERALLY GETTING NONE OF THE THINGS WE NEEDED."
"it would have to be sign and trade, he would have to agree to a lower salary, etc etc, it was nearly impossible   buddy hield scenario is a different case"
If the Lakers had my friend Buddy Hield instead of Russell Westbrook they'd be 10-6!
I would say Harrison Barnes + buddy hield are a good haul no?
absolutely need a consistent 3 point shooter  sacramento give us buddy hield for evan fournier and kevin knox challenge
"I mean, he's first in RAPTOR! You know, the stat that rates Jalen Brunson higher than Kevin Durant offensively, and Buddy Hield higher than Draymond Green defensively.  Advanced stats are great, but are only as good as the formulas behind them. Jokic is a great player, Top 5 right now with room to keep getting better, but the advanced stats  thing MIGHT be overplayed a bit right now."
"2 words, Buddy Hield"
"We are better than losing games to the Thunder, Spurs, and Timberwolves. No offense to those teams, but we really do have better personnel. I think you are underrating what we've got on our team: several great supporting pieces with no real star. Fox has been in a slump lately, but I've been very happy with the play of Hield, Holmes, Barnes, Haliburton, and Mitchell, and we've gotten more out of guys like Metu, Len, and Harkless than I've expected. Really the only rotation guys I'm disappointed in are Bagley, Davis, and Thompson (and TT is supposed to be the vet on the team and in the locker room, which he seems to be doing well).  Luke has had some atrocious rotations in the past, like pitifully bad. He's doing marginally better this year but I think he's still making poor decisions with our guards -- while Buddy off the bench is a good start, he needs to stagger Fox and Haliburton more. His big usage is okay but not ideal at times -- there are quite a few times when we are facing a big center and he chooses not to switch Len in when our smaller bigs are getting bullied, and I know Alex Len is not great but he has proven he can defend bigger centers for some time. (Also this may just be a me thing, but I have no idea why Damian Jones gets minutes. Every other big on our roster has a more defined role than him.) The offense has slowed down significantly under Walton, and under Joerger we were the fastest offense in the league, which also helped our defense out by tiring out opposing offenses. Joerger's defensive schemes also did a way better job than Walton's at masking our weaknesses on defense. I don't expect us to be great, but we certainly should've been better than last (or near last, I can't remember) last year with the personnel on hand. There's not one specific thing he does that I don't like, and I'm not a coach myself, but it was clear that Joerger's defensive schemes just worked better overall. The ideal position for us would be keeping up a similar level of offense (5thish in the league) while going to about league average in defense, with better defensive schemes and rotations being the solution to that. I'm not one to hate on every coach we've had, but I knew this one was a bad signing from the start.  And for the record, a lot of fans were still upset with Vlade over the Bagley pick. Any excitement was due to the fact that Bagley actually looked decent after year one, and that there was room to grow further. I know there are also some ride-or-dies that I won't make fun of for supporting a good season (by our standards) and having hope for the future is not a bad thing. I'm already much happier with McNair, even if the bar was near the floor. He's picked BPA in drafts and it's paid off, and has made a few shrewd trades and signings for our bench. I'd love to give him a few more years at the least to tinker with the roster a bit more heavily, but even with the roster we have I expect more out of it.  TL;DR I really dislike Luke Walton in particular for specific reasons and want him gone."
"I absolutely disagree. If anything r/NBA still highly overvalues Ben Simmons. Morey explored the Kings as a third team already when they were trying to get Harden. The Kings didn't want to give up Fox for Ben then either. Buddy Hield and Malik Beasley are the 4th best players on their teams. That's where I would put Ben on a ""good"" starting lineup. Even when Ben was the 3rd best player behind two MVP caliber players in Embiid and Butler, the 76ers weren't good enough."
"The only way that would happen would be a 3-team trade landing Philly Dame and Ben to a 3rd party.  Admittedly, if it were to that point (trade demanded and Philly is top of the list), it is a relatively possible scenario.  However, the logic is circular to where Simmons trade value is low.  We would have e no use for Simmons, hence it requiring a 3rd team.  But the 'scraps' available for Simmons are as unappealing.  If we rebuild, we have no use for Buddy Hield or Patrick Beverly and the the rest coming with them.   So yes it would require a 3 team trade, but a 3 team trade would equally require Simmons value to be higher than it is right now.  So it just wouldn't happen."
"Doesn’t matter, Buddy Hield"
Buddy Hield is my pick for 6MOTY
"I highly doubt the list would include any centers, or any ""back to the basket"" type bigs. It is most likely a list of certain trades they'd send Simmons and assets for, some 1 to 1 trades, and packages they'd take back for Simmons. So it might have 30 players on it, but there might only be 10-15 trades on there. Just as an example - they aren't going to take Buddy Hield straight up, but him and Fox and whatever else makes the trade work is on there. Or for the Wolves fans, Pat Bev, Beasley, and some 2nds."
"I could see that working the other way and inhibiting a deal.  Players that have been rumored to be offered for Simmons include CJ McCollum, Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield... those guys are good shooters and could help the 6ers in certain ways, but they aren't the type who can take over a game and relieve Embiid's playmaking/facilitating burden. Plus, unlike in previous years the 6ers seem fine with their outside shooting capabilities.  So far, teams don't seem to be interested in giving up true playmakers like Lillard, Fox, Beal, etc. Makes sense, as that's exactly the kind of player you need to pair with Simmons to make him most effective."
"Fox: elite speed and inside game, streaky shooter at best, okay game manager, good at getting steals but always been a negative defensively.  Simmons: elite game manager, elite defensively, cannot shoot, passes up on open dunks, excellent in transition.   It would basically be saying “hey we need a starting point guard and better defense”. I’m not all in on it but I think immediately it’s better for the tram than getting rid of say Hield for Simmons. If you HAVE Simmons you need shooters. Buddy, Hali, Simmons, Barnes, Holmes is a nice starting lineup. Paint is a bit more clogged than with Fox but you’ve got 3 guys with green light to shoot it.  It covers up size deficiencies we have on defense."
"I didn't even know what his voice sounded like until he was on the Kings, where his commentary on the mic has won over more Kings fans than his actual play. How he defended Buddy Hield before the season started was awesome."
just get all the draft picks and then cut buddy hield lmfao
"Zion his first full year as a player: 27/7/3 on 60% shooting. Thats fucking nuts, def not a bad draft its just they have to get his weight under control (which is doable). Everything else has been a shit show.  Pelinka was bad because he had opportunities for both Derozan and Buddy hield."
I'm also not sure if we could blame the Westbrook trade on him. Seems like LeBron and AD pressured him into doing the Westbrook trade over the buddy Hield trade
Yes really. Any Laker team without LeBron is going to struggle and Buddy Hield has literally never even came close to making the _playoffs_
"I feel the same. It's easy to say ""well Steph changed the game so now some kid is going to grow up practicing 3s"". But that was literally *Steph* as a kid, practicing 3s on literal NBA courts at 7 years old. He's literally 20 years ahead, and he has the elite shooter genetics.   We've already seen phenomenal shooters come up post Steph. Trae Young and Buddy Hield are great great shooters, but neither are even close to Steph's volume."
"Well it's a crazy amount of 3s to take so by that standard we literally have no idea whether it's remarkable or not, nobody's ever done that.  Very few in NBA history seems like a stretch, though.  Harden at that volume was a very good shooter, but not elite.  For example (and tossing out Steph as a crazy outlier) other guys who get somewhere close to that volume and are elite like Duncan Robinson, Hield, Lillard are like 39-41% at the low end and for spot up three point shooter like Joe Harris or Kyle Korver they can push almost 50%.   Dame is a pretty unique player and a half of fame lock but I don't think Duncan Robinson and. Buddy Hield are going down as all timers or anything."
we traded for Westbrook over DeRozan and buddy hield leave us alone we had enough lol!
Buddy Hield steals Steph Curry’s abilities when they hold the court together
Or someone who shoots just as well as klay and even has some off the dribble game to him someone like buddy Hield
"&gt;I assume it would’ve been some combination of Schroeder, THT, and/or Caruso,   You assume the Spurs and Lakers would structure a sign and trade deal (while knowing both would be hard capped) around all players who would be free agents and not players on the Lakers roster who are already on contracts? Make that make sense. He would’ve gotten traded for the same package or similar package to the one Westbrook did.   &gt;which is why I didn’t include them in the calculation.   A calculation that doesn’t make sense.   &gt;Did you ever stop and think why they weren’t there?  Did you ever stop and think you don’t have to be a dick and that you can debate like a normal person?   &gt;AFAIK the lakers had already committed Kuzma and Trezz for Hield in this scenario  Expect we’re not talking about THAT scenario, we are talking about a DeMar DeRozan sign and trade to the Lakers, not a demar DeRozan sign and trade coupled with a buddy hield trade which literally no one brought up.   &gt;so they’d 100% definitely still be on the team   They would 100% be on the team in this completely random scenario you brought up for no reason other than the purpose of creating a counter argument?  &gt;Perhaps KCP goes for Demar, so the lakers have $16 mil in cap space to sign what, 6-7 fucking players   If we go off of this scenario where demar is S&amp;T for just KCP then the Lakers would have 16mill in cap to sign players, and Would still have Trezz, Kuzma, and Gasol available to either keep or trade for multiple players on smaller deals. The only downsides would be not being able to retain Caruso (who they didn’t anyway) and likely losing  THT (who they could’ve made a S&amp;T deal for if they wanted).   &gt;Either way Demar is not on the lakers because he wouldn’t take a pay cut.   Again I disagree, DeMar isn’t on the Lakers because the Lakers didn’t want DeMar."
"Buddy Hield for Bazemore, McClung, and DJ. Rob’s gonna get another blockbuster /s"
Buddy Hield
"&gt; If they got DeMar and Buddy Hield  I don't believe that would have been possible.  DeMar would have hard-capped them because it was sign+trade, so they would have had a total of like $18m to put together the entire rest of the roster outside of the ""big 3""."
Buddy hield maybe?
"&gt;westbrick being here has LeGM writing all over it  \#1 AD also asked for the trade; #2 Pelinka could've refused it, or at least demanded the Wizards accept Schroder over KCP, or otherwise go with the Buddy Hield trade."
"PG's playing an extra two minutes a game, it ain't that much difference. The boxscore is just fluff, honestly but a) USG% isn't a good stat and even for what it is good for 7% difference is huge, b) the TS% is comfortably explained by what we see on the court - Butler gets to catch full court passes, has a high level passing point guard next to him, and is the beneficiary of a roster that draws far more attention and allows the team to generate far cleaner looks for him.  Ultimately I think it's unfair to suggest that a better efficiency on less points is enough to say Butler is better when he's asked to do *far* less than what PG is, and PG is creating a leading team out of (no offense Clippers fans) very little meaningful help in comparison. It's the same instinct to say Buddy Hield is a better 3-point shooter than Curry because the % is higher."
"Buddy Hield , Russel Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle. And that's just on the Lakers. LeGM is LeBrons worst enemy."
"Starters: Rondo, Buddy Hield, DeRozan, LeBron, AD  Bench: Caruso, Melo, Dwight, Reaves, Ariza, Monk, Ellington, DJ  That's a front-runner. What they got is hopeless."
"that's Buddy ""has made more 3s on the Kings than Peja"" Hield"
They should have done the Buddy Hield trade over both
bro Buddy Hield isn't winning us shit with LeBron injured lol
Imagine if they had a high scoring guard that was really good from 3 like buddy Hield. Or some really good defensive guards that fit well offensively with LeBron and AD like KCP or Caruso.   If only guys like those were options.
"Real talk I don't think there were a lot of secondary ball-handler options that the Lakers could've pursued outside of vet min guys like Ish Smith.  I still think that a Buddy Hield trade was the way to go, but other than that if they wanted another point guard they would've had to flip KCP for Ricky Rubio or something along those lines."
If they got DeMar and Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook the Laker memes wouldn't be as good tho
So Buddy Hield thought the deal with the Lakers was done. And so did DeRozan. Meaning there’s a timeline where the Lakers land DeMar and Hield. Instead they end up with Westbrook. That’s some Vlade level incompetence right there.
Buddy Hield: “join the club fam”
Calling out Buddy Hield
"Ok but also imagine Caruso, Buddy Hield, KCP, LeBron, and Davis on the floor. That's actually a disgustingly good fit, but I agree it's more embarassing that they didn't make 1 out of the 3 good choices they had."
"Bro I’m not gonna go back during the whole summer saga and find the tweets/rumors, but this whole board was there for it. Go do the research yourself, this is common knowledge at this point. He had a heavy hand with the Westbrook over buddy Hield last second thing &amp; then lakers went with the klutch guy over Caruso.... idk what to tell you."
"Even if it isn't Rondo, THT or Nunn can start at PG with Buddy.  Putting either one at PG is definitely not as dumb as putting Westbrook there. Anyway, if they manage to get Hield, I'm sure they will find a vet min PG so you don't have to worry about that"
*Stares at a photo of Buddy Hield*
Buddy Hield sucks though. I'm sure there was a better trade somewhere in the middle

"This is a homer take. Dude, look at your record. Playing guys like Bazemore is part of why y'all suck. Your FO chose to spend the money on Westbrook and use the rest on end of the bench guys, except now they have to play actual minutes. Bazemore ain't good and he shouldn't really be playing minutes against DeRozan, but yeah, who else are you gonna have out there, Buddy Hield and Alex Caruso?"
"In all honesty, what's expected of Luke Walton?  What's expected of this roster?  Make the playoff with that?  Not wanting to extend buddy hield on max?   Not trading Bagley?  Actually, getting fired could just be the best thing to happen to Luke Walton cause he won't have to deal with this management mess"
The Westbrook trade is the real debacle. The Caruso-THT mistake would have been minor if the Westbrook-for-everyone-and-no-Buddy-Hield trade hadn't happened.
"You guys shot 18% from 3 this game and are shooting 35% from 3 this season while being the bottom 7 in 3PA per game. This is despite Melo shooting on insane efficiency and attempting like 7-8 3s per game, and it seems like he's regressing back to his mean.  Adding another 40% 3 point shooter in Buddy Hield would definitely change something lol. Both Buddy and Westbrook are cones on defence but Westbrook is a smaller cone."
Now we don’t use TS why? He shot 19 times and had 25 points.   I don’t know how anyone could’ve watched tonight’s game and thought “man with Buddy hield Lakers would’ve won for sure!”
They passed on Demar and Buddy Hield for Westbrook lol
Bruh. One shot attempt and +28 rating though.  The Lakers did NOT make the right decision because they've decided to pay 44m/year to Russ while they could have kept both Caruso and THT while adding someone like Buddy Hield too.
"Let's be real.. the Westbrook move was horrible and now they're stuck with him. Even if he has had a nice stretch of games, he's not what the Lakers needed. They should have just traded for Buddy Hield and not sacrificed so much of their depth."
"Pelicans could have AD, CP3, Jrue, Lonzo, Randle, and Buddy Hield"
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
"New Orleans would have CP3, Zion, AD, and Buddy Hield"
I would trade Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley for Love straight up.
"Or go on YouTube and watch Buddy Hield… BIG LIKE KLAY, SHOOT LIKE STEPH"
"Who buddy hield? I want that dude gone more than anything, he’s not apart of the core and who gives a fuck about a Buddy Hield anyways. Fox/Hali is the core and buddy is getting shipped. Who gives a fuck lol, deuces."
"we could do a three way trade, may I interest you in Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield 😂"
"Talk about completely delusional, my god. The Kings roster isn't completely flawed? You'd rather have Tyrese Haliburton than Sexton or Garland?  Last time we heard anything from Sacramento, Buddy Hield was going to be the next Steph Curry. Fuck outta here."
"76ers - Dame, Buddy Hield  Kings - Ben Simmons, Robert Covington, Isiah Joe  Blazers - Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2021 #9 pick (Kings), 2021 #28 Pick (76ers), 2022 Pick Swap, 2023 Top 5 Protected Pick (Kings), 2024 Unprotected Pick (76ers)."
"&gt; Guess the Lakers would have to mortgage their future draft picks even further to get Hield from Sacramento?  Probably not, as the trade that was being discussed was just Trez and Kuz for Buddy. Maybe those 2nd round picks from Washington could go to the Kings as well?"
"Would I trade Buddy for Kuzma, Harrell, and a draft pick? Hell yes. I’d drive Hield to Staples myself.   Buddy is someone who would thrive as a 3rd or 4th scorer instead of a 2nd option or shot creator but the hang up with his value is his contract, which is a lofty barrier for teams that can utilize him best. McNair has been fairly tight lipped with trades so I don’t really know what offers are out there other than some interest from Philly."
"Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jaylen Brown... Whata Chriss and Bender up to?"
"report/s suggest that the Wizards pivoted because of Westbrook being involved  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront. But even as the possibility of a deal built around Kyle Kuzma and Harrell began to form, the Lakers kept the door open to a Westbrook deal.  &gt; Westbrook asserted his voice into the conversation, and per an NBA source, the Wizards pivoted. Just like that, the pieces the Kings liked for Hield were no longer available.  [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2946554-biggest-questions-and-answers-from-blockbuster-lakers-russell-westbrook-trade), [via](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/29/22601297/russell-westbrook-plan-b-lakers-trade-rumors-offseason-free-agency-buddy-hield-chris-paul)"
"They had something going with the Kuzma deal that got pulled. It's not that they are refusing, but shit doesn't always happen. My guess is they made way more progress with Westbrook and abandoned the deal. They also abandoned the Buddy Hield one because they saw that they could make the Wiz deal happen.   Spurs seem like they want their cap space so they can perhaps chase Collins and need the max money."
Hot take: would rather get DeMar on a good deal and buddy hield instead of Westbrook.
And who in god’s name is taking Schröder in this deal? Lol  No way in hell the Kings take back Dennis and the reason the Hield trade fell through is the Lakers had 1 real set of tradeable assets they just sent out for Russ  Kings aren’t gonna just throw in Buddy and split the assets down the middle
"I think the bigger picture is about facing the nets. Do you think Buddy would do that much for the lakers in the finals (has yet to play a single playoff game) to be able to beat the nets?   I think you gotta match star power and fill out the roster with whatever vet/ring chasing shooters you can find. In a scenario that lakers and nets make the finals, LeBron wouldn’t be able to rest a single minute without costing the game. As great if a sniper Hield is, he can’t handle the ball and create his own shots against playoff defense.   Russ has playoff experience and his resume speaks for itself, be that it comes with flaws, but still can be the difference in helping lakers win games with LeBron getting some mins to rest."
did some googling and apparently others are speculating the same:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/7/30/22602295/lakers-rumors-russell-westbrook-buddy-hield-trade-kyle-kuzma-montrezl-harrell-blindsided
That’s not buddy hield
"Even if the Wizards are interested in Dinwiddie, if the Nets preferred Schroder to Kuzma and Trez then it could still go ahead with Schroder going to Brooklyn, Dinwiddie and KCP to Washington, Trez and Kuzma to Sacramento, and Buddy Hield to the Lakers."
True but as just players I would take Russ  Buddy Hield might have been a better trade for the Lakers due to fit but obviously he isn't better
"Don't compare Buddy Hield on a team where he's not-motivated and the primary target, and on a team where he'll be the 3rd scorer (i still have hope for Russ not shooting that much)"
"Bro, in a Draft with DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young and Luka motherfucking Doncic, they took Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick.   And there's a possibility they give us Buddy Hield for scraps, who statistically, is the 3rd best shooter in the league the last 3 years.  Get outta here with the fucking Kings."
"You don't understand how the salary cap works. All the Lakers have to do is match salary in a trade, which the Lakers could easily do by signing and trading Schroder, Caruso or THT. It's very possible that Hield is added to the Westbrook trade and it is expanded to a multi team trade which involves Sacramento. The fact that the Lakers have a lot of money tied up in LeBron, AD and Westbrook doesn't impact their ability to trade for Buddy Hield, nor does it impact their ability to pursue free agents as they were going to be over the cap either way even before getting Westbrook. All it does is cost the owners more money."
It’s risky seeing that this trade used up pretty much all LA’s trade assets. Probably would’ve been better off getting Buddy Hield but we’ll see how this pans out
If the Nets are getting Kuz + Harrell for Dinwiddie why not flip them for Hield? Kuz is redundant with Jeff Green and Buddy would be a perfect 6th man/Joe Harris replacement if he struggles in the playoffs again
"Sorry my mistake, I confused two different articles, I was thinking of the [Sportsline projection model](https://www.sportsline.com/nba/news/lakers-2022-nba-title-odds-much-better-with-buddy-hield-instead-of-russell-westbrook-via-sportsline-projection-model/) which had their odds improving with Hield but dropping with Westbrook"
"Yes, but the kings were dumb enough to take them for buddy hield. The question isn’t would you rather have russ or harrel/kuz/KCP. The question is would you rather have russ or  KCP + hield."
"But the thing is the 2 guards on the Kings are also small.   They have Delon Wright, Buddy Hield, Terrance Davis who are all too small to play as a 3 full-time.   With their current roster, the kings are very guard heavy and will likely play some undersized lineups."
"I gotta a feeling this may bite the franchise in the ass unless there is already a plan in place to get a player like Hield.   Russ is great, but Buddy provides spacing and 3 point shooting.  I don’t see a use for Dennis now with Russ, but it’s hard to imagine another scenario where he can be traded for a return  Edit: To clarify, this isn’t an either or situation, I’m just expecting more moves to follow after this. I’d be surprised if they just stopped after obtaining Russell."
"That’s 26 minutes for the 2 and 1 slot though.   Kings have Buddy Hield (34 minutes a night), Delon Wright (25.8 minutes a night), Ramsey (7 minutes a night), and might re-sign Terrance Davis (21.5 minutes a night).   So if there is 26 more minutes to fill for the guard slot, that’s at least 3 guys that are all the size of a 1/2 fighting for those minutes (assuming they don’t trade)."
"Yes, Buddy Hield + retaining KCP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Westbrook when LeBron and AD are already on your team."
What other options do they have? Buddy Hield? Hard to say if the Kings would’ve even wanted the Lakers offer for Buddy considering their situation and the lack of impressive players the Lakers had to offer.  The Lakers aren’t just able to bring in a perfect 3&amp;D wing like Klay. Their options are severely limited.
Buddy Hield 2016
"I mean they could've gotten Buddy Hield and either kept one of the three players, or gotten picks back that can add more shooters"
"Buddy Hield is great, but he isn't really even close to Russell Westbrook."
I feel like neither of these players fit well with lebron and AD. If im a laker fan buddy hield wouldve made more sense in terms of fit.
Show us where Buddy Hield has won the MVP?       People call the 2017 Warriors a super team and not the 2016 Warriors a super team for a reason
Westbrook is a better basketball player than Buddy Hield hope that helps
"Ah yes Russ the perennial playoff choker, as opposed to Buddy Hield and all his postseason success"
"Depending on how the Ben Simmons and Kyle Lowry situations go in Philly, I think a Buddy Hield and Delon Wright for Tobias Harris structure might make some sense."
" We're not that bad Mad That we're not the Cavs or Mavs shit, even the Jazz I just really love the Drafts But then we draft shooters who could really really shoot But couldn't even guard my Dad Vlade en Peja please take us back to 2002 So I can go beat Robert Horry's ass Everything ever since it's been so sad I'm just so tired of telling my friends ""we're not that bad!"" Yo mad that we're not the Cavs or Mavs Shit, even the Jazz yo At least we're not the Suns Fuck the Pelicans yo They gave us Buddy Hield and took away The best damn player that we have ever had yo We're not that bad at making trades Really young players might be great some day And I just really hope that we get better soon Getting blown out by the Hawks Makes me really wanna move We're not that bad Yo, we're just different Cuz we like to pass on Klay for Jimmer Damn Yo, we're not that bad We're just different We took Robinson instead of Lillard Fuck"
Buddy Hield
"Because the 22nd pick and Schroeder are more valuable to the rebuilding point guard needing Wizards than Buddy Hield is. Schroeder, KCP and 22 is a better haul for Washington than KCP Kuzma and Harrell."
"It will be really interesting to see how the Lakers fill out the team. They already have above average 3-point players in Wes Matthews, Alex Caruso, and Marc Gasol, all of whom could potentially start depending on who else they pick up. Here are some of the players I'm guessing they try for:  Buddy Hield (3-team deal, sending out Schroder as a sign and trade)  Laurrie Markannen, (sign and trade Schroder)  Danny Green (MMLE or vet min)  Carmelo Anthony (MMLE or vet min)  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, this is a bit of a replication of the LeBron Heat team. You have two athletic wings who thrive on driving to the basket, and a big who can pop and shoot. Of course LeBron is not the same player he was back then, and Westbrook is no Dwyane Wade --- but AD is much better than Bosh on both offense and defense, but the style of play may be similar, with the Lakers having two wings who can relentlessly attack whether they are both on the floor at the same time, or individually.  I was not a fan of bringing Westbrook to the Lakers, but LeBron and AD were obviously in favor of it, and I assume they know what they are doing. If the Lakers can still add a couple of shooters, as I expect they well, this is on paper the best team in the Western Conference (pending further moves by Golden State)."
"I’m starting to believe Hield is the last trick pelinka has up his sleeve. The last few days, buddy to LA had serious traction and seemed like it was a sure fire thing. Then shams comes out of nowhere with the Westbrook news, and everything goes silent on buddy. Here’s my thinking:  The Lakers end up with both buddy and Russ. How? Reports came out that the Wizards like KCP and really value him. They’re going to need some guard depth as well. This is where Dennis comes into play. Because he’s a FA, nothing can be said about him until august 2nd. So my thinking is the lakers, Wizards, and kings have a “wink wink” deal in place. The Lakers send Dennis and KCP to Washington. There were reports saying that Kuz and Trezz could be rereouted to another team. That other team is Sacramento. Because of Kuzs contract, he cannot be traded until August 6th. FA starts august 2nd, more than enough time for the Lakers to negotiate a S&amp;T with Dennis, so they don’t lose him for nothing and so he gets a somewhat decent payday. So the final return would be:  Kings-Harrell+Kuz  Wizards-Schroder+KCP Lakers-Russ+Buddy  There would also most likely be draft compensation involved, to what extent I don’t know. Maybe other players get involved too, or there’s a rare 4 team deal. Anyways, that’s just my dream/guess lol"
"The last tweet Woj made about the Hield deal said nothing about the 22nd pick. ""With Harrell opt-in, Lakers are able to move forward towards completing a deal to acquire Kings Guard Buddy Hield for Kyle Kuzma and Harrell"". I saw the pick mentioned by some people in the past week, but I don't believe any reporter said that it is taken as granted that the Lakers would be sending the pick."
you mean Buddy Hield who can’t defend for shit ? you want him to defend Harden or Kyrie ?
"Yes but buddy hield is a better fit than Russ, to me IT seems like Russ is subtraction by addition"
"Even if they get buddy they won't be better than the nets lol. The nets big 3 all play on the perimeter in 1 on 1 and  they will cook whatever perimeter defenders the lakers have left, especially Hield"
"Possibly, but probably more likely that Schroder goes to Washington, Kuzma and Trez go to Sacramento and Buddy Hield goes to the Lakers."
Prediction: Its a 3 team trade with a Schroedder sign and trade rhey cant announce that gets them Buddy Hield and Westbrook.
"This addition of Westbrook will excite some, as the idea of a Westbrook / LeBron / AD Big Three may rightly sound like a dream.  However, it raises many questions about how Westbrook will adjust to becoming the third option for the first time in his career.  For the Lakers, a good solution would be to be able to get Buddy Hield back by using Schroder to put together a trade.  To be seen."
"If he's to be included in a 3-way that involves Buddy Hield, Schroder's salary basically has to match Hield's which is like $23 mil.  The Lakers can't take back more than 15% of what they send out.  And since they'd be signing and trading Schroder, they can't attach other contracts to their outgoing salaries."
"Haliburton has enough size to move over to shooting guard if needed, not like the Kings have many options at 2-guard anyway especially if they get rid of Buddy Hield  Haliburton played a majority of his minutes at SG anyway"
"Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, 2022 unprotected 1st  Please 😭🙏🏻"
I think Kings are about to clean house though. A lot of teams are interested in Buddy Hield. There’s interest in Bagley too.
"Not to go against your theory but something to add to the conversation,  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront.

Simmons to Sacramento for Buddy Hield.
"Which shows how dumb of a conversation is  The buddy hield trade would've made us way better than this deal did, yet this makes us a superteam while that doesn't? Lmao"
"Did you watch the bubble Lakers? Bron would play in high-post when Rondo took on-ball responsibilities and it was really nasty (good). Bron's mid-range and post-game bent defenses toward him and opened up tons of easy cuts/kicks to role players and lobs for days to AD.  I get why people are clowning the trade, but this seems like the best value the Lakers could get for their pieces. Buddy Hield ain't gonna move the needle for you"
I'd prefer it be Doug McDemott? Wtf are you on about? I'd prefer it be Buddy Hield and Demar Derozan. I'd prefer it if we didn't make the highest paid player on a team including Bron and AD a ball dominant volume shooter with no 3 and no defense.
Lakers had the buddy hield deal on the table as well which pelinka surely used as leverage
Buddy Hield please
I know. But I think it's easier to find a few cheap shooters than it is to find a Westbrook-level playmaker. We sorely needed both.   I was not hearing good things about Buddy Hield this week.
"Yeps, these folks worshipping at the church of spacing would legit rather have buddy hield than Russ."
this is the article i saw about it yesterday.   https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/28/22598429/lakers-rumors-veteran-free-agent-interest-third-star-lebron-james-buddy-hield-russell-westbrook
They tried that and ended up with Buddy Hield running their offense which was depressing to watch so I can't blame the BPA pick. Would have preferred Wagner but he wasn't available so yeab
"We need to keep in mind that because of Kuzma's poison pill status this trade can't be executed until August 6. On top of that, the Lakers and everyone else are prohibited from even talking to Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker until free agency opens (see the Bucks-Kings disaster from last year). Given all that I think it's a good bet that this is not the final form of this trade (we already saw Washington move that pick, that will probably just be included in this trade). We could see Buddy Hield still get traded to the Lakers with any of those free agents the Lakers have being signed and traded elsewhere, or we could see something else. We shouldn't be thinking about it like this deal is done and now what are they going to do. Westbrook is gonna be on the Lakers, but the other stuff could very much still be in flux."
"I don't get this trade tbh, Lakers gave away 2 okay-ish shooters for a downhill Westbrick... I woulda figured they preferred Buddy Hield"
"Yeah, I know. I acknowledge that. Buddy's a better shooter, but Russ still had a 22ppg season (while averaging a triple double). Percentages don't matter in a game, points do. AD, Russ, and Lebron are all going to get better looks if they're on the floor together because literally any of those 3 can easily work around or go through a double team, which also allows better looks for whoever else is out there with them. Even if Vogel just uses them in pairs, they're going to be a hard team team guard. They're still able to keep most of their bench guys, and they just made a very attractive big 3 for free agents to join. Signing Buddy Hield keeps all the pressure on LeBron and AD. Signing Westbrook makes them a legitimate big 3 and a scary contender coming off of a disappointing season that they're definitely going to improve upon."
"Nobody *should* take down a healthy Brooklyn on paper. Getting Russ helps the Lakers chances of getting to that championship series healthy more than Buddy Hield or whatever else was available. Once you're there, who knows?"
"Buddy's shooting stats are better, sure. I never said he wouldn't be a better fit. He's more efficient and he makes outside shots, great. He doesn't rebound or drive or facilitate like Russ though. Nobody hustles like Russ. Russ' TS% was about .05 less than Buddy's last year(.567 vs .509), but Russ scored 22.2pts/game compared to 16.6 from Buddy while only playing about 2 fewer minutes. Russ also averaged 11.5 rebounds and 11.7 assists, where Buddy had 4.7 and 3.6, respectively. I know the Lakers need a role player that can shoot but there's no reason to say that they needed Buddy Hield and only Buddy Hield, especially when getting Russ was feasible. He might not shoot 3s, but he creates and extends possessions with his rebounding and physicality much more so than Buddy. I think AD's going to have a better season with Russ. I think the Lakers found a great opportunity and ran with it, now they just need to fill out their bench."
Buddy Hield is one I'm pretty sure
"My (biased) bet is that this trade expands once free agency starts and we also get buddy hield. Kuz/trez to sac for buddy, kcp/Dennis/22 pick for Russ. Maybe lakers also give those picks from Washington to Sacramento."
"How does this make the lakers better lol, Buddy Hield would’ve been way better and we would still keep KCP smfh"
The last two championships weren't even won by lights out shooting. The 2020 Lakers just were too big and strong underneath and the Bucks had Giannis dominating underneath.   People be wildin when they think the Lakers are toast just because they didn't add Buddy fuckin Hield lol
"My guess is the Wizards mainly made this trade to get off of Westbrook and for the 22nd pick as opposed to because they're in love with Kuzma and Trez. So what could happen is Trez and Kuzma and those 2nds the Wizards sent could go to Sacramento for Buddy, with Schroder being signed and traded to Washington and Hield to the Lakers. After all, if the Wizards are serious about keeping Beal then they're in dire need of a point guard."
So the Buddy Hield to Lakers move is confirmed??
Buddy Hield get in here
He's shook from when he reported the Lakers were going to trade for Buddy Hield and moments later Shams reported that they were in advanced talks to land Russell Westbrook for the same package Woj was saying was going to be used for Hield.
"I’m 40-60 on a like to dislike ratio on this trade, and I just want to see who they put around then. Also I just really wanted Buddy Hield."
With what assets are they going to get buddy hield? They’ve used everything to get russ
"this sub is dumb  lakers would not have traded KCP, one of their only good shooters, for westbrook unless they were confident they could get buddy hield or if they knew of some free agent shooters they could land"
So in a span of a few hours Lakers went from Buddy Hield to Westbrook wtf
Buddy Hield in shambles.
""""" “Wtf, what the hell?” - Charles Barkley "" - Buddy Hield - Michael Scot""  - u/OKCFlight"
"So they’ll S&amp;T Schroeder to make the Hield deal work, and then the opt in of Trez plus KCP, Kuz, and the pick. But what else do they have to give up for Buddy because just Buddy for Schroeder is a weird deal for the kings to just have a really expensive 6th man."
"I know the mavs need good defenders, but wasn’t one of their biggest issues last year their awful spacing from trading away Curry? I’m guessing a mid-level 3&amp;D wing might be better, but Bertans prob wouldn’t be a bad fit if Dallas can also get a good defensive center to plug up some of their defensive holes. Steven Adams is def too expensive, but maybe Nerlins Noel or something?  All i’m saying is Bertans might not be a bad fit, Buddy Hield is prob better but it could def be alright."
People are saying theyd rather have buddy hield LOL
"My thoughts are that obviously the front office knows more than anyone here, they know that Russ isn't a huge 3-point threat, they know KCP is solid in that role. So there have to be either some decent vet mins lined up that they have just about guaranteed, or there's a S&amp;T in the works with Schroeder for someone like Buddy Hield or some kind of 3-D threat.  I don't know dick about the cap either but...I trust Rob to make the right moves."
That’s still a pretty sick squad. Would you rather have what you said as “mini LeBron with bad shooting” or buddy hield and kcp? Come on now.
Maybe the Kings are clearing cap space and that’s why they wanna send Buddy Hield to the Lakers.
"and i was just giving another solution for aquiring buddy hield, asumming westbrook is traded to la. no need to get so mad over it"
Buddy Hield
"buddy hield-rouken, yada yada, nets 106 lakers 86"
You don't have to give up KCP to get Buddy Hield though
""" “Wtf, what the hell?” - Charles Barkley "" - Buddy Hield   - Michael Scott"
"People actin like Buddy Hield doesn’t seem the exact kind of not proven 3 point  playoff guy who would go ice cold on the Lakers and provide nothing else.  Russ over any 3 point role player any day of the week. It’s absurd to think otherwise. His leadership/hustle alone and his ability to assist and rebound at elite levels is worth more, let alone his scoring ability."
"They likely can only fill out the roster with veteran minimum contracts, G leaguers, and the tax payer MLE. That means players have to take a pay cut or get marginal players at best.   Bryn Forbes, Torrey Craig, McDermott, McConell, Bullock, Malik Monk, and Wes Mathews are examples.  It would likely be a thin roster at best when it comes to shooting.  I think the Buddy Hield play makes more sense if the Lakers keep KCP and their pick."
Thee Buddy Hield of Sacramento *
We just flipped him for Buddy Hield then changed our minds
"Sacramento gives Buddy Hield and immediate insight on who the first 50 picks will be, via Woj (he had to throw that in to beat Sams)"
There was a better option on the Wizards in Beal. Lakers need shooters around LeBron. LeBron will never give up being the facilitator. Buddy Hield would’ve been 10x the better option. This is in no way disrespect to Westbrook. He’s a fantastic player. But not all fantastic players work together.
Completely true lol I’m taking Russ over buddy fucking hield any day of the god damn week. Absolutely ridiculous notion.
"Russ   Hield   Lebron  AD  Gasol   Dwight    Melo  Wes  Ariza   Rondo     Old ass team, but it’s not that bad. Now, if we’re only getting Russ but no buddy, oh buddy."
I don’t think you’ve seen Buddy Hield play enough if you’re thinking that
this is a horrible move. Pelinka is fucking up. I want Buddy Hield
"Y'all put way too much stock into this kind of thinking, I'm not even the biggest Russ fan but he's 10x the player hield is. You take the all time great over a catch and shoot 3rd/4th option every time and it's not a question.  Like, the bucks just won a title hitting 6 threes a game. You can still win while being an interior focused team that consistently dominates inside.   That being said, I think both of them are good options. I'd really like to see the Lakers get anyone that makes them competitive with the Nets whether it's Russ, DeMar, or Buddy."
who do you think I'm talking about? Do you think Buddy Hield is a point guard?
Buddy Hield for Myles Turner?
"people better keep this same damn energy when Westbrook starts showing out in LA, he’s gonna be the most locked in he’s ever been alongside LeBron. dude just wants a chip at this point in his career, and people will be even more mad that you only had to give up kcp and kuzma to get him   i’m out here reading people saying that the Lakers got WORSE with him, and Buddy Hield is a better player? absolute ridiculousness."
"If you guys are willing to go years with your space, Buddy Hield is there for the taking, and you'd probably get a pick for your troubles.  I think you guys' role in this off-season is fucking over contenders in or near the Tax by offering huge one-year deals to their FA role players. On that note, stay away from Will Barton"
"At that point, you could probably just get a pick from Sacramento to take Buddy Hield into space"
"The issue with Robinson is the match rights.  Specifically, the Heat can spend the full 3 days before deciding to match, during which time you can't use that cap on a backup plan like Fournier or our own Will Barton.  It's probably still worth doing because I really like Robinson on the Knicks, and I think there are a bunch of trades you could do as backup plans so the match period isn't as big of a deal. Terence Ross as mentioned here, also Buddy Hield."
"I agree if that Hield should be valued slightly more...but we are agreeing though. The rest of the sub was saying Buddy was a terrible contract last week, but now apparently $18m for Duncan is a fair deal, so seems inconsistent to me"
"I mean it was an either or. Their 2 biggest problems were shooting and the fact that outside of Bron, nobody on that team could handle the ball. Hield was better fit wise but beyond shooting he doesn’t offer anything else better than Russ, but he is a much better shooter. Unfortunately that still means once Bron goes to the bench there’s like nobody to handle the ball, which is something Russ is good at which also means Bron does not need to run that offense most of the game every game anymore either and he’s just a superior player overall to Buddy. They’d probs also be in a better position to still make playoffs if one of these guys get hurt with Russ there instead of Hield.  It just seems they chose to fix one issue over the other."
Yet people think Buddy Hield is overpaid
"I love Westbrook but they should’ve got Buddy Hield. The fit is better, but the Westbrook sales are sweeter."
Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield is a better offensive player than Robinson will ever be. He can actually dribble and do stuff
"This sub: Buddy Hield is crazy overpaid (roughly 20m/year, one of top shooters in the league)  Also this sub: 18m would be a fair contract for Duncan Robinson, who is also one of the top shooters in the league.  Feel like I'm taking crazy pills"
"If Fisher is right and the news that Kings want to get rid of Hield for front court help, I wonder if this expands to a 4-team trade where Kings get Kuz and Trez and Wizards get Dinwiddie, and Lakers get Buddy.  Idk how but wonder if that's a possibility."
"As of right now, I still think the Nets are the favorites. Their big 3 fits much better together than the Lakers’ big 3. However, it also depends on how the Lakers fill out the rest of their roster. If they somehow still manage to snag Buddy Hield and add a bunch of quality shooters/veteran players, I could easily call them the favorites. This should be a fun week."
Schroder sign and trade for buddy hield lol
"I can see a team talking themselves into taking his bloated deal because of his professionalism, lack of injury history and age.   Maybe the Pistons. Perhaps the Kings in a Buddy Hield deal.  But you’re not getting much in return and that’s a deal killer for the Sixers who are capped and can’t spend the savings."
Damn and I thought buddy hield was over paid
"He is worth more than Hield, but he’s a bigger negative at $36m increasing than Buddy is on $22m decreasing. Good luck finding a partner for him"
Goran Dragic a filler and picks for Buddy Hield  jk but I can see someone dumping a longer contract on Miami for his expiring
Buddy Hield time
"Buddy Hield would be a good back up shooter, Mavs don’t have a solid big man like Gobert or Embiid"
Need at least 2 knock down shooters for that lineup and there isn’t any knockdown shooters available rn. Shoulda just got Buddy Hield and Derozen
"It’s more about fit. We don’t need post scorers with Ben and Joel. We need perimeter scorers and 3 point shooters. And  Buddy Hield is one of the 10 best shooters on earth and he would both open the floor up immensely, while thriving from Joel being double teamed.   And 3 point scorers will always play better next to Ben Simmons by virtue of his drive and kick play style and passing ability.  I’m also higher on Buddy than most I imagine. Idk how many people actually watch the kings that regularly."
Probably someone like buddy hield
bron went to the team and prioritized a secondary ball-handler/creator as we have 0 creators over a shooter like buddy hield. it allows us to actually flow and get lebron some rest. everyone is overlooking this lol we were last in the league for our bench with caruso outperforming to even keep us relevant.
Stupid trade. Buddy Hield would've been far more fitting and would've given more cap space
"Here'e the list of players who made 22.5-27.5 million this year (25 million give or take 10%)  Al Horford 27 million  Jaylen Brown 26.7 million  Draymond Green 24 million  Nikola Vucecic 24 million  Buddy Hield 22.7 million  Well, he ain't the worst among them if he was paid 25 mill"
"They also had a guy locked named buddy Hield... guy would of been perfect on the Lakers. End of the day, it doesn't really matter. They're still a contender."
Any shooting guard would be a huge addition to the team.  Kevin Huerter would be a massive addition.   But once you sell your assets for an overpaid Buddy Hield you are also locked into a dog shit defender and no means to improve the roster further. These are marginal moves.
"If the deal isn't good enough for sactown you add more assets. They were trying to trade barnes at the deadline, it's not gonna take a kings ransom. How is hield not a win? He's not a star I understand, but a quality roleplayer. If klay's athleticism takes a step back, you can start klay at the 3 and buddy at the 2. And barnes is a good enough approximation of wiggins. You go from 1 quality player to 2 quality players.  It's just one idea. Another one, wiggins + assets for miles bridges + rozier. Maybe go all in on wiseman + wiggins + a boatload of picks for siakam and vanvleet. These are completely random ideas off the top of my head. It all depends on what teams are open to making a deal.  &gt; Lacob point blank said they aren’t making moves of that caliber.   That's literally the problem IMO. I can't guarantee that they would find a deal worth making, but the fact that they're not even looking for non-star deals involving wiggins to make them better is very worrying to me."
Sacramento isn’t trading Barnes for pennies.  And adding Buddy Hield isn’t a win in any way.  That’s just running in place.  Lacob point blank said they aren’t making moves of that caliber.  Either it’s a  blockbuster trade for a star or they will stand pat until Klay comes back.
"Yes I’m sure that buddy hield is the difference between losing in the playoffs and winning a ring, he should be maxed immediately!!!"
"Yes I’m sure winning a ring depends on getting buddy fuckin hield, that’s why the Kings are such a powerhouse and everyone around the league is dying to get him, since the Kings keep trying to trade him....... LOL"
"My point is that if you think that Westbrook isn't good and the team would be better off with Buddy Hield, then you can't simultaneously say he's a superstar and that this is a superteam.   I do consider this a superteam, because I think Westbrook's great, but you have to pick either bashing Westbrook or calling this a superteam, not both."
"When has Buddy Hield shown up on the ""big stage"" lmao, surprised this has been up for 4 hours without getting deleted."
"This is extremely biased and it won’t get seen as such bc Zach is a respected analyst. The Lakers are a 5 man roster. It’s all 100% speculation under the guise that I’m not wrong cause I’m informed. Rehashing past Russ on the team that’s not yet complete without pointing out the overwhelming positives is narrative journalism.  3 all-nba athletes will be a good team. Every team struggles with the pressures and constraints of a 4th quarter offense. News flash, this is how the game works. Elite shooters don’t become more elite in the clutch, it’s a struggle for every 5 man mix to score late. NBA analysis have gone full blown pointy elbows in their criticisms of Russ.   Buddy Hield is an elite role playing shooter, Russ is an all NBA talent. Buddy shooting 30-40% better on 10 possessions a game does not make up the difference in what Russ brings, even including his always mentioned deficiencies."
"If the team would improve by swapping out one of the guys that makes the team ""super"" for Buddy Hield, that isn't a superteam.   To be clear, I don't agree with that, but if your logic is that this team would be better served with Buddy Hield over Russell Westbrook, then you can't call this a superteam."
"I mean, I don't see how the majority of people can say that the Lakers should've gotten Buddy Hield and simultaneously call this a superteam.   Like, I think it's a superteam because I think all 3 of LeBron, Westbrook, and AD are really good. But the number of people that simultaneously shit on Westbrook as being garbage while also flaming LeBron for forming another superteam is way too high."
yeah well Anthony Bennett is younger than Buddy Hield
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
"/u/RickySuela devastated as he's been telling everybody the last few days that the Lakers are still going to get Buddy Hield, as if the Lakers could just force an opposing team to take on Schroder."
"er, buddy hield is 28, he's not exactly some young whippersnapper or whatever...."
Yes. But buddy hield wants out of Sacramento and we want him out too. Good trade idea OP
Buddy Hield would already be a Blazer
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
Isn't Buddy Hield a floor spacer?
Joe Harris is a better player than Buddy Hield and how do we know Buddy Hield is good in the playoffs lol
"buddy hield might be a playoff choker too, we dont know"
Why would the kings trade Buddy Hield for a white choker version of Buddy Hield
"&gt;The Lakers had an alternative close to the finish line, sources said: Kuzma and Harrell to Sacramento for Buddy Hield. In that scenario, they could have kept Caldwell-Pope and re-signed Schroder. The Westbrook deal came together fast. At the beginning of draft day, Tommy Sheppard, the Wizards' GM, was discussing other deals based on the premise that Westbrook and Bradley Beal would be together in Washington, sources said.  &gt;Luxury-tax concerns may have played a part. The Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope pathway might have ended up more expensive than this Westbrook option, depending on Schroder's salary and other factors. Schroder also could have just walked in free agency. This may have been more like an either-or between Westbrook and Hield.  &gt;There is some beautiful-mind framework in which the Lakers might still sign-and-trade Schroder and acquire Hield. It's just hard to find it. The Wizards and Kings don't want Schroder, sources said.  &gt;If Hield is out of the picture, the Lakers can and will try to turn Schroder into one or two other players -- though that requires Schroder's cooperation. It would be nice if one of those players could shoot 3s.  &gt;Look: Spacing isn't everything, and doesn't matter in transition. The Lakers were a dangerous fast-breaking team in their title year, and lost some of that verve last season amid injuries and malaise. Westbrook is verve incarnate. He will rebound and rampage.  &gt;The Lakers' half-court offense is their bellwether. They ranked 23rd in points per possession in the half court last season, and 17th in 2020, per Cleaning The Glass. They won it all in 2020 in large part because their half-court offense performed at league-best levels in the playoffs -- often amid blah spacing. Can they do it again?  &gt;There may be no practical difference between the Westbrook Lakers and the now-theoretical Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope Lakers. They may win about the same number of games, and have about the same postseason chances. James and Davis drive everything.  &gt;The Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope route just feels a little safer. It brings fewer fit questions. James is maybe the greatest problem-solver in NBA history, both on a possession-by-possession basis and on the zoomed-out level of an entire season and roster. Let's see how he approaches this fascinating new puzzle."
"Yes, but the Lakers needed three point shooting so they really shouldn't have gotten him. Buddy Hield was the more sensible move. Maybe it wouldn't have cost them KCP too"
"I really think some people here just do not understand leverage or even just simple addition by subtraction.   No they’re not going to get a package that will make them better than the nets. But even just getting good role players and guys who can contribute will be better than letting a locker room cancer grow causing more issues. So even something like buddy hield, picks and another decent role player will be a vast improvement on their situation."
It’s easy to make salary match in the nba. The Kings for example have buddy hield making 22 mil a year. Ben Simmons is at 33. They can throw in several combinations of players on their roster and get that.   The wolves have some easy moves as well they could use to make it work
"I also remember watching the OU-LSU basketball game where Buddy Hield absolutely erupted toward the end, bringing OU back to win. And Simmons was simply non-existent the latter part of that game."
"buddy hield is the key to your championship, i assure you"
"Pretty much any trade that nets them even marginal immediate value makes them better this year. Not substantially better, maybe, but definitely better.   Simmons isn’t coming back. He’s done with the team and the team is done with him. Even if they only get back Buddy Hield that would technically make the team better. Hell, trading him for a future first would probably make the team better this year by removing the distraction.   And I don’t care what Embiid says, the organization says, or Philly fans say: no one is cool with this dragging deep into the season. It’s a huge distraction. Look at how the Rockets responded last year as soon as Harden got jettisoned. Same thing happened with the Wolves post-Butler.  That’s not to say they should trade him for such limited return. Get what you can. But sitting on him for a whole year is not happening."
This right here. Buddy hield doesn’t do any of that
"Kings would have still bungled their draft.   Sac front office and Sac Homer's response to MPJ?  &gt;We have Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, and Bogi, no on MPJ yes on BAGLEY AND HIS TRASH DAD.  Fuck.  I wish we got to see Fox and Luka run shit in Sac.   But even if Luka had gone to the Sacramento, the Kangz would have fucked it up.  Waste a good chunk of Lukas career.  We wouldn't be seeing those maestro performances."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
If he stays healthy that’s a great deal for Indiana.   That’s Buddy Hield and John Collins money.
Terrence Davis is who Buddy Hield thinks he is. It's just preseason but he led the team in scoring as the Kings' 5th guard while playing *gasp* defense
Yep. People incorrectly attribute it to Buddy Hield all the time but it was Stauskas originally.
So it would be something like:  Steph (GSW) Buddy Hield (Kings) Kawhi (Clippers) Lebron ( Lakers) Ayton ( Suns)
Derozan’s paid $26 mil and Buddy Hield and John Collins are paid $23 mil.   Wiggins is a 26-year-old SF/PF (most important position) averaged 19-5-2 on 47/38/75 and played great d  He’s definitely in the $26-23 mil range
"""GUYS MOREY ISN'T GETTING ENOUGH CRITICISIM FOR NOT TRADING BEN SIMMONS FOR BUDDY HIELD HIS TRADE VALUE IS DROPPING BY THE DAY"""
"I refuse to be so far up Steph's ass, to whereas I cannot be fair to players like Armoni or Davis II or Buddy Hield and their situation, I repeat, their situation which limits them like Steph did NOT have to face in his early years like which these players are in now.  For example, with respect to Armoni, Steph's rookie year saw him play almost 3000 minutes I mean like 2900 minutes or something like that ... that is NOT going to happen for Armoni! lol ... so he will not be blessed with **opportunities for autonomy that Steph enjoyed on the road to perfecting** his shot as a rookie."
"Bias but a few of the Kings players.  Tyrese Haliburton. Able to initiate the offense or be the secondary playmaker. Efficient shooter. Smart player and a cheap contract.  Buddy Hield. Every team could use an elite shooter.  And maybe Harrison Barnes? Had a great year shooting 39% from 3. Good size, solid defense, just a steady player all-around."
"Money was only an issue because the Westbrook contract put them deep in the luxury tax. Paying Caruso, THT, and Buddy Hield all was possible for LAL instead of the Westbrook contract.  Still, LAL could have paid Westbrook, THT, and Caruso also if ownership didn't cheap out."
"Lakers should've kept Caruso and traded for the Buddy Hield package instead. I will not be discussing further, thank you for listening."
"I guess y'all didn't see the report about Embiid being fully on board with how they're handling the situation. Morey and Embiid are tight - you think Morey would risk alienating his MVP level star player? Nah man, they're on the same page which is trying to get a championship. You have a better chance of championship with Ben Simmons than with D'Angelo Russell or Buddy hield or whoever is on the table now. Simmons value isn't going any lower, so they're waiting it out on the chance it goes up"
Yeah Morey should take the advice of all these Raptors fans on how he shouldve traded Simmons for Buddy Hield.  This is all about these Raptors fans investment in maximizing the Sixers future as a franchise and has nothing to do with resolving their own drama boners
"And in retrospect, they all should've pulled the trigger for various reasons and didn't because they were drastically undervaluing Lowry and Masai knew it.   You're telling me the Lakers wouldn't have done that Schroder KCP THT for Lowry deal now in hindsight? They would have gotten a 6-time NBA All-Star PG, one arguably a much better fit than Russ, while still having a few assets left over for a potential Buddy Hield deal. The Sixers, we already know they should have done that deal. They easily would have made the Finals with Lowry."
"What the fuck .. ?   &gt;Buddy Hield absolutely torches  I dont know why this is a thread at all. It's like, there was 70+ players in pre-season with this stat-line or better. 4 Kings players had more noticeable game than Buddy, this game."
I am enjoying this Sacramento Micro Ball experiment lol.  Also Buddy Hield is a GOAT at the 6th man slot. I hope he becomes okay with being a second unit commander and just launching it beyond the arc.
Yeah imagine of you got a 3 point specialist during the off-season. Like Buddy Hield or something lol
Buddy Hield saying yall should've signed me
"Buddy Hield, KCP, LeBron, AD, Dwight"
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
"yeah, but the problem is he doesn't have much leeway to grow. Drafting a 24 year old, he should be nba ready and average buddy hield/Brogan numbers right away. Otherwise it's a waste of a pick it it takes him 2-3 years to learn."
"yeah, but the problem is he doesn't have much leeway to grow. Drafting a 24 year old, he should be nba ready and average buddy hield/Brogan numbers right away. Otherwise it's a waste of a pick it it takes him 2-3 years to learn."
"I think the sixers are showing that they won't give up ben for a package that makes them worse. They've strong armed Ben into coming back to the sixers. If the best offers are buddy hield and picks, or an injury prone brogdon, might as well just stay with Ben until something better comes up."
Their options were to get Buddy Hield and then try and get Lowry. Instead they went all in on Westbrook for some unknown reason.
Lebron James and Anthony Davis having space to operate will win you games. Buddy Hield provides that. What's hard to understand?
My point isn’t that Buddy Hield sucks at 3’s
Buddy hield still available? /s
Buddy Hield + KCP &gt; Westbrook
That buddy hield trade looking better everyday... smh
"I'm glad Lowe realizes that we here in Sacramento play basketball like your buzzed buddy playing 2K. Nothing will be contested on defense, but by God Fox is gonna be driving directly at the basket 4 out of 5 possessions.  The last 20% is kicking it yo Buddy Hield for a ""fuck it"" 3 pointer lol."
"A bunch. Played against KAT a few times back in the day, him and his family were great. He played alongside Wade Baldwin, who actually got ejected when we played him and we thought was pretty overrated but we ended up reconnecting a few years later and laughed about the whole thing.  Worked at a hotel that hosted the NBA Rookie Symposium in 2016. Served Ben Simmons, he very much kept to himself and didn’t socialize like everyone else. Buddy Hield gave me a free speaker, shirt, bags, etc. because “man we got money we don’t need this” was super appreciative. Jamal Murray was my guy too, super nice. Did not like Taurean Prince because he was offended I didn’t know who he was and was kind of a dick (to be fair, I knew most of them, but like dude you’re Taurean Prince).  Went to college with Kevin Huerter, wasn’t super close but he used to hookup with my friend and we talked a few times, he’s pretty quiet and reserved but a good guy. Bruno Fernando was hilarious, we loved him."
man idk i’m taking 41 games of Kyrie before i take 82 games of ben simmons or buddy hield
Ellington's release is pretty fast but a step behind Duncan Robinson and Buddy Hield
"It's because Luke sucks absolute ass. It doesn't matter that Buddy Hield is the 3rd best shooter in the league because Luke has him running sets as the primary ball handler giving up lobs to Damion Jones instead of shooting and having someone distribute to him. He puts Cory Joseph in at an average of 24 minutes a game last season and put him up against Zach Lavine for 36 minutes and literally gives him career highlights.   Like I said ***on paper*** the kings are better outside of their 2 best players 1:1. But in practice they are not.   The options right now on the kings are:  1. Fox 2. Haliburton 3. Hield 4. Barnes  Those are the top scoring/playing options on the Kings at the moment. Luke will find a way to fuck this up.   Basketball is complex in it's simplicity and you are just playing for inches at a time. The fit and playstyle of the kings doesn't fit with the roster. They are one of the slowest in pace with the fastest player in the league. Luke plays free dribble basketball and ONLY plays man to man defense. Literally high school level coaching shit. The team just isn't fit well together and doesn't have the stopping power needed on defense to make any kind of serious run. We'll see how it works this season with the roster change, but I don't have any hopes really. We were 9-10th in scoring last season and dead last in defense. Blazers made it to the playoffs with 12th scoring and 25th defense. So realistically if we just had literally average or even just below average by all metrics we should make the playoffs. But somehow, some way, Luke will try to make this into a Might Ducks feelgood movie moment and play our 15th man at a crucial point in the game to try to create some kind of heartfelt breakout moment or some shit. I just know it. He'll sub Fox out for like Justin James or some shit."
"Having Fox and Ben on the same team isn’t ideal roster construction since Fox isn’t a great shooter, though he’s improving year on year. But it still improves the team imo   Kings get:   * Ben Simmons   Sixers get:   * Buddy Hield   * Davion Mitchell  * Tristan Thompson   *2022 SAC 1st   I think this helps both teams"
And that's why it's crazy. Buddy Hield and Haliburton for Simmons is too much.
That's where Buddy Hield comes in.
"Why the hell would the kings trade Fox for Simmons in the first place? Trading a PG who can't shoot for a PG who can shoot does nothing for either team. Contract wise, the kings would probably have to trade Buddy Hield, play Haliburton at the 2, then convince Simmons to be a 4 or 5."
"Duncan Robinson as mentioned, picture perfect. Buddy Hield, Furkan, Joe Harris"
"Huh? Haliburton and Mitchell are still good shooters. Both shooting 40% on 4 3pa. It's not buddy Hield levels of 10, but it'll space the floor."
"But in order to get Simmons...Kings would have to give good players back in return...A team with Simmons and Buddy Hield or Fox and Simmons doesn't exactly turn a lot of heads especially in the west.  Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Clippers, Portland, GSW, Dallas, Utah. I would say at best they're in the wolves category"
Mavs have shooters who shoot like 2-3 attempts per game. With hardaway the only one who shoots more than that at 6. Kings have the same thing + buddy Hield. The kings roster on paper is better than the Mavs outside of Luka/KP.
Buddy Hield has a crazy fast release
"3/3/1 IMO.   &gt; 1) They don't need Russ to have LeBron and AD rest. They should comfortably make the playoffs with LeBron and AD playing fewer minutes in the alternative universe of having KCP, Buddy Hield, Caruso and Dennis instead of Russ.  Actually I hard disagree on this... because that's a lineup that they couldn't have actually.   First of all KCP and Buddy would not exist together on the team seeing how the originally agreed trade was / salary match considerations. In this alternate universe how does the Lakers keep KCP in the trade and somehow bring in Hield?   Let me know because that means we can also have Buddy on that team right now with WB already there, seeing how KCP + Kuzma + Trez was what it took to get WB.   They don't NEED WB for LeBron to rest. but having WB ALLOWS LeBron to rest.   &gt;2) AD should expand his offensive role if LeBron wants less of one instead of bringing in the highest usage player in the NBA who essentially does nothing when he doesn't have the ball.  I literally mentioned this in my previous comments... but how exactly do you want this to happen? Is bringing in a point guard that can feed you easy looks not exactly how AD will have bigger role?  When LeBron isn't playing, isn't WB bringing up the ball in his hands and feeding AD a bad thing?   Why is having high usage rate a bad thing, if the Lakers want WB to handle the ball then feed AD?  This man somehow leads the league in assist with subpar players on his team, you don't think WB will be able to find one of the best pick and roll man for easy buckets?     &gt;5) If you are a contender you should build your team with an eye to the playoffs, not the regular season.  For most teams, yes. For a team with aging star as the focal point, the #1 point should be 'how do we get him to the playoffs healthy' first.    &amp;nbsp;  Now for the valid concerns -   &gt;3) LeBron and AD far from chilling are going to have to work harder on defence because they got rid of all their 2-way players for Russ.   KCP is really the only true 2-way player. Trez was garbage on defence. Caruso was ass on offence. Kuzma was not good at either. Gasol was garbage on defence.   But your point here is valid. They'll need to play harder defence.  &gt;6) The Laker's half-court offence has been dog shit.   Yeap, their half court is ass.   but ""One of the biggest hurdles to the Lakers winning a title is having a good enough half-court offence"" is an iffy statement. The biggest hurdle is having LeBron and AD healthy. You're looking at a 2 year sample and saying 'outside of bubble' which is funny.    Lakers ran a 2-man game with LeBron and AD in half court sets just fine in 2021 regular season until they both were injured.    &gt;7) Russ/AD and LeBron won't work together IMO which is really the only thing that will matter in June.  yeap, the fit is questionable.   &amp;nbsp;    Now for the subjective one  &gt;4) It's not a given that Russ minutes without LeBron will be any good. I think those minutes will still suck.  They'll suck. But would it be worse than 2021 Lakers for example with Schroder on the floor without LeBron? Just look at the stretches when LeBron wasn't there in 2021, they were worse than the Wizards during that stretch."
"We are going in circles. I said a few basic points. Maybe are you aren't getting it?  1) They don't need Russ to have LeBron and AD rest. They should comfortably make the playoffs with LeBron and AD playing fewer minutes in the alternative universe of having KCP, Buddy Hield, Caruso and Dennis instead of Russ.  2) AD should expand his offensive role if LeBron wants less of one instead of bringing in the highest usage player in the NBA who essentially does nothing when he doesn't have the ball.    3) LeBron and AD far from chilling are going to have to work harder on defence because they got rid of all their 2-way players for Russ. Who is playing defence in Russ/Monk/Melo/LeBron AD lineups?   4) It's not a given that Russ minutes without LeBron will be any good. I think those minutes will still suck.  5) If you are a contender you should build your team with an eye to the playoffs, not the regular season.  6) The Laker's half-court offence has been dog shit. Russ was one of the worst half-court players in the NBA last season and has been for years. The biggest hurdle to the Lakers winning a title and having a good enough half-court offence. Which did in the bubble.  7) Russ/AD and LeBron won't work together IMO which is really the only thing that will matter in June.  If you think I'm wrong that's fine, I think all those points are valid."
"That's exactly what I am saying. I think Russ/LeBron and AD fundamentally don't work as a half-court offence. The Lakers with KCP, Dennis and Buddy Hield are a better team IMO and make more sense as a team.  I didn't say AD has to be a playmaker. He's not. He has a good face up and is a great rim runner. Have him do more of that, not less.   AD shot 26% from 3 last season and is 31% of his career. That's worse than Draymond Green. AD's shot dies once he gets outside 15 feet. Having him hang around the permitter to make space for LeBron and Russ to play in the restricted area isn't getting the best out of him.  AD was 4th in the league in post-ups in the Lakers title year. Just behind Jokic. Design an offence where AD posts and face-ups more and rim runs more. Not one where he is standing at the 3 point line. If AD has to take 4, 3s a game, and LeBron is taking 7 a game you have fundamentally failed at team building.  Adding on. Russ is not a good pick and roll point guard for his flashy highlights. .71 PPP as the pick and roll handler last year. That's like Ben Simmons level bad, and it's also in line with his last few seasons. Having AD helps, but if you are expecting Russ/AD to be a much better pick and roll combo than AD/Dennis you are going to be disappointed.  LeBron missed 26 games last year? He is going to ""rest"" for 1/3rd of the season this year?"
"If Russ/AD and LeBron don't work it doesn't matter. Russ is one of the last guys in the league I would pair with those two. Not to mention they had to give up all their two-way players to get him.   The Lakers made the playoffs with LeBron missing 22 games and AD missing 36 games. LeBron and AD could go on the Kawhi rest program and the Lakers are going to make the playoffs with last year's squad + Buddy Hield.   Are we sure Russ is actually going to even do that? Let LeBron and AD chill? The Wizards were trash when Russ played without Beal. Negative net rating in Russ with no Beal minutes.  This team has a million questions, but primarily what is Russ doing in the 4th quarter of a playoff game when LeBron has the ball. Watching Russ for 10 years tells me he is going to be standing 3 feet behind the 3 point line with his hands on hips while his defender has a foot in the paint."
"Could have had Buddy Hield, a 40%+ 3 point shooter that never stops moving.  He is a bad ball handler but with LeBron he doesn't need to dribble.  He's bad at off ball defense but Westbrook is probably worse.  Westbrook is probably better defending in ball though."
"Regardless whether they go to the playoffs (I think they're lock to be coz duhh AD LeBron), they should've traded for Buddy Hield instead."
"Pelinka wanted Buddy Hield but LeBron wanted Russ. If Pelinka had his way, we'd still have KCP and we'd also have Hield."
"Different question: why would Philly trade Simmons for players that gives them the literal same floor and ceiling than just not playing him? Because yes, playing Beasley or Hield does nothing for the Sixers. Without Ben, they're probably a 1st round loss. With Beasley and McDaniels or Hield and Bagley, they are a 2nd round loss.   Philly is championship or bust. Morey has literally nothing to lose by sitting Simmons for the year, since every package leaked to the media would do shit to help Embiid. I'm sure Embiid doesn't think they are one Buddy Hield away from the ECF."
Trade him for buddy hield and some picks and be done with it.  Dude is so dumb he doesn't deserve to be in the NBA. So what better spot than the Sacramento Kings G League team?
Murray going after Hield was stupid then and it’s even more atrocious now. Buddy is like 5 years older than Jamal.
Need buddy hield for that championship run
Buddy hield and Bagley III
Buddy Hield &gt; Westbrook
"There's a thousand Buddy Hield age threads, but the one that really trips me up is that he's older than Andre Drummond."
"Buddy hield doesn’t win a playoff series of lebron or AD are injured or not 100%.  Again did you not watch last years lakers? Better team than the 2020 lakers but their stars were injured so it didn’t matter. The most important thing for the lakers is making sure 37 year old lebron is fresh for the playoffs or that AD isn’t forced to play on an injured leg all year to try and help drag the team to the playoffs.   Lebron isn’t 33 anymore. He can’t be dragging teams of just shooters and 3 and D players by himself to the finals and 82 games. He’s been saying for years now he needs help. He needs ball handlers, he needs playmakers and he needs guys who can win if he sits out with a tweaked ankle. Him and AD said they don’t want “heild and role players”. They want Westbrook"

Buddy hield would be totally useless when LeBron is resting no?
Right but LeBron couldve had buddy hield but he chose mo williams
Holmes is a great roll man with freaking Buddy Hield
"Yeah I bet if they had Buddy Hield they'd be 5-0, right? 🙄"
"Buddy’s always been one of the best volume 3 point shooters, one of few guys who’s numbers approach Steph’s. Lakers balking on the Hield trade was clearly dumb as hell and I’m go to continue enjoy watching the Lakers fall apart, especially after Buddy just had a nuts game to beat the Suns on their home turf"
"Westbrook will be a fine regular season asset for the Lakers. When he’s in “form” he’s a one man wrecking ball of usage and offense…which the Lakers need when they will inevitably load manage LeBron/AD. Game  #46/82 against POR? You can afford to rest a banged up AD or LeBron and with Westbrook you have a good chance of winning that game. Buddy Hield? Probably not. He needs offense created for him.  The issue is what a 4th quarter lineup and/or playoff lineup looks like with Westbrook. Clearly you still want the ball in LeBron’s hands at all times during crunch time which takes away WB’s biggest strengths. He’s basically relegated to a terrible spot up shooter that runs around trying to grab rebounds. In this situation someone like a Hield would clearly be a better fit. Can you as a coaching staff bench Westbrook in high leverage situations? I don’t think so. You don’t acquire a “superstar” player making $45mil/yr to have them sit out the final 6 minutes of every game.  In an ideal world I’d probably try to stagger WB’s and LeBron’s minutes as much as possible and try and have that conversation with Russ that a “different” closing lineup might be more beneficial for the team. A lineup of Nunn/Monk/X/LeBron/AD is probably the best overall for spacing and offensive efficiency in crunch time which is basically a ton of PnR, isolation post ups, and kick outs to open shooters."
The difference between Rudy and Dwight/DJ is much much much larger than the difference between Buddy and the Lakers’ shooters. Buddy does literally one thing well. Hield isn’t and has never been better than Russ by the way.
&gt;Why go for him when you could've had buddy hield?  &amp;#x200B;  Are you that stupid?
"&gt;He plays the exact same role as like 4 or 5 other guys on this roster, but he costs way more than all of them.  What is this logic? Rudy Gobert plays the exact same role as Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard but costs way more, should you not want Rudy Gobert? Buddy costs way more because Buddy is easily one of the best shooters in the entire league.  Over the last 3 years, Monk, Nunn, and Ellington combined have made 815 threes (on 36%). Buddy on his own has made 831 threes (on 40%). Same role? Yes. Same effectiveness? Not even close.   There are cheap PGs in this league that can play when LeBron is on the bench that would be so much better on the team than 44 million/year Westbrook.  And yes, Hield is better than Westbrook at this point. Any team seriously trying to win a championship should want Hield over Westbrook."
Damn so Vivec Randavive was right huh? Buddy Hield WAS the next Steph Curry and we all doubted.
"I would have been a lot more sold on the deal from the Lakers' perspective if it was the Hield one that was supposedly on the table. If I recall, that would have brought back Buddy and the Lakers wouldn't have had to send KCP. Just like that trade much much better for the Lakers since that would allow them to keep one of their best 3P shooters from recent years and import someone in Buddy who has that skill in droves."
"westbrook high turnover, buddy hield good shooter, things we knew coming into this season, last season, the season before and the season before lmao"
Bro buddy hield can’t even start on one of the worst teams in the league lmao
I have to say I enjoy the idea of this backfiring on the lakers - trying to bring in any old 2k god without real thought to floor spacing.  Buddy Hield was the play.
People absolutely weren't praising the Russ move man. That was a shitty trade and everyone knew it  Why go for him when you could've had buddy hield?
/r/nba is genuinely convinced that Buddy fucking Hield is better than Russell Westbrook. And the people that don’t think that think that the Lakers need to pay a guy to play KCP’s old role for double the price. Make it make sense.
"Man the lakers were not beating the nets trio with buddy hield, this is a non starter."
"Buddy Hield would have been a good fit with Lebron but Lakers need someone to try give Lebron rest during the regular season. It remains to be seen can Westbrook do that , but that’s why they got him.   Sure in a vacuum if the games tied it would be nice to have a line up with Buddy Hield beside Lebron for spacing but there’s nothing to prove Hield would help the Lakers finish a higher seed or if he can do it in the playoffs . Complete different animal playing with the pressure of title of bust."
Fate of the universe on the line who would you rather have? 21-22 Steph Curry in the 4th quarter only… or Buddy Hield with a sinus infection?
"Bro Lebron is about to be 37 years old, they know damn well the championship window is closing fast and with that in mind they took a chance and grabbed basically the only elite player they could before the season started.   Y’all got good assets in return but it’s not like the Lakers didn’t know what they were doing. Can say what you want about Russ but he’s an MVP and was part of some elite OKC teams playing second fiddle to KD. Way too early to tell if the gamble was worth it or not.   I’m a silly bitch but if I’m trying to gamble on a championship in a very short window I’d rather take my chances with Russ than Harrell and Buddy Hield too. It’s like being down to your last $100 in your Robinhood account — you gonna buy a share of IBM or throw down on some AMD options?"
"Not just that, but Buddy Hield is actually pretty good and would thrive in a 3rd option shooting role."
Buddy Hield staying in Sac Town
"EPM has him in the top 79th percentile for defense. LEBRON genuinely puts him on their advanced analytics all-defensive teams. He's much worse off-ball than on-ball but where did this horseshit narrative come from? Please also consider that the dudes you'd rather the lakers get over his supposed poor defense are *buddy fucking hield and dennis schroder*, neither of whom could defend bugs bunny. Just because off-ball value wasn't what won him MVP doesn't mean he isn't still significantly better as an off-ball threat than dennis"
Lolllll    This sub is wild  Buddy fucking Hield?!  Over an MVP?!!?  This can't be real
"He was good, not great. Not a good fit cuz of his lack of shooting. Plus LA taking on his huge contract and they lose more parts compared to the Buddy Hield trade. Not to mention Buddy is an elite shooter"
Buddy Hield of Sacramento
"two of the three things you said are not even close to accurate about buddy hield, and you failed to mention his absolutely horrific defense and his demonstrated inability to be a team player"
You just like to hate on the Lakers dude. We all know you didn’t watch any Kings game last year lmao. Buddy fucken Hield is not a difference maker 🤣
buddy hield is 100x better than kuzma and harrell combined  you heard it here first
Long have we waited  Buddy Hield jebaited   Shams activated   Woj devastated
Buddy Hield is a much better fit and they might not have to give up KCP for him. Lakers are idiots if they take this Russ trade.
The Lakers spacing is going to be atrocious but people seriously overestimated Buddy Yield. This guy has no basketball IQ and is the most one-dimensional player there is. Every shot he takes has to be spoonfed to him by a playmaker.   I really don't think the Lakers would have been able to win with Hield. Westbrook has a higher ceiling but also is a bigger risk due to the spacing challenges.
The fact that they were about to trade for Buddy Hield and then went with Westbrook with the same package looks like they really don't have a clear direction.  Like the two players could not be any more different.
I thought buddy hield was probably going to the Lakers
Woj fucked up today.   He made it sound like the Buddy Hield trade was done and just waiting for it to be announced when Shams came in off of the top rope.
"Yep, Buddy Hield would be much better but so many other Lakers fans just think 3 stars means it’s good."
"The Lakers also need shot creation, as every time Lebron is off the floor they TANK. If you can get Westbrook and then spend the rest of your energy acquiring shooters, that's a huge upgrade. Westbrook is incredibly more impactful than Buddy Hield, regardless of fit."
What happened to Buddy Hield?
Kuzma went from getting them Buddy Hield to getting them fucking Westbrook goddamn
"when in doubt, double down.  Woj forcing the buddy hield trade before backing down."
"Literally just read about how they're trading for buddy hield, now this"
yeah but buddy hield was on the table. you take him over westbrook
"If Shams gets the Buddy Hield deal, he's the goat of insiders. Baiting Woj like this is sociopathic."
"Yeah, I could see that LeBron is ready to take regular season even more lax than before. Westbrook is still good enough to be a primary ball handler, LeBron can do post-ups, shooting 3pts, occasional slashing etc and still be good for 23-25pts a game. With Buddy it would be him who would have to do all the driving and dishing to Hield. Westbrook is a warrior - his mentality definitely fits Ok together with LeBron I think."
This is easily the worst decision they could’ve made. Buddy Hield is way better omfg  Edit: for our team I mean

What ever happened to Buddy Hield from like 10 minutes ago
"&gt;Buddy Hield  Well, you’re safe on that one."
Harrell Kuzma for Buddy Hield :/ how can both teams lose in a trade
woj tweeted out that buddy hield was close to be being traded w the same assets lakers would trade for westbrook trade though. not gonna react until its official
So who's telling d' truth? In Woj post Kuzma is going to Kings for Buddy Hield. Here He's going to Wizard for Westbrook.?
“You couldn’t live with your own failure. Where did that lead you? Back to me.”  -Buddy Hield
Buddy Hield is the biggest loser
That’s… not Buddy Hield
"Shams just dunked on Woj, the kings, and Buddy Hield lmao"
Lakers would be so dumb to take fucking Westbrook over Buddy Hield lmao
buddy hield was a laker for all of about 30 minutes lol
Buddy Hield has never made a team good. I don't think he'll make a team super lol
Calling the Lakers a superteam after being set to acquire Buddy Hield is peak r/nba
Yes they have 3 superstars now like the Nets  Lebron = KD  AD = Harden  Buddy Hield = Kyrie
"What a win for Kings lol  Edit:Imo Buddy Hield dont deserve that kinda players at all. Other than shooting he doesnt do shit, looks to have bad basketball iq and bad team player. We will see how its gonna go ofc but man Kings getting way too much for Buddy imo"
Buddy hield come on down
No this is good lol let’s us trade towards more people. Aka buddy hield
buddy hield
" I pray for the sake of a bad franchise that morey doesn’t ring your GMs phone. The last thing I’d want to see is “Sacramento is finalizing a deal to send Buddy Hield, De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Halliburton, \#9 and 2 first round picks to Philadelphia for G/F Ben Simmons.”"
Where do you think Buddy Hield plays next season?
"The problem is that he's not a good-but-not-great player with four more years of max money.   This rules out the teams at the top competing to win next year. Mayyyybe Golden State would trade Wiggins and 7, but I bet they'd rather run things back with everyone back healthy next year.  For the teams building for the future, they'll take the contract but will want picks coming to them, rather than going the other way. Nobody is going to move out of the top 4 while also giving up an asset.  That kind of leaves the ""usual suspects"" type teams of Sacramento, Orlando, and Minnesota.  Minnesota doesn't have a first rounder but maybe would do D-LO and next year's first. Towns is too good and Edwards has too much potential.  Orlando has 5 and 8 and just got rid of all their big contracts to start a rebuild. Best case for Philly I guess would be Jonathan Isaac and 5 for Simmons and some future firsts or swaps.  Sacramento is at pick 9 and would probably do that and Buddy Hield for Simmons because who knows what the hell they're up to."
The Lakers will have Buddy Hield at the end of the night
"Technically his name is Chavano Rainer ""Buddy"" Hield"
"1. It’s not about skill level, but rather the type of player they are. AD is a two-way player, who does multiple things on both ends of the floor.   On the other hand, Buddy Hield is a role player. That’s NOT an insult, he’s truly elite at his role (catch-and-shoot 3’s) but he offers very few other skills.   He would improve ONE thing the Lakers struggled with last season (shooting/spacing), but the team still has other flaws that wouldn’t be addressed.   The biggest one is their stagnant offense, that lacked movement &amp; playmaking. They need someone who can create their own shot &amp; set-up his teammates.   LeBron can’t just drive &amp; kick every possession like he used to in his athletic prime.   2) If they want to use any of their exceptions or get a free agent via sign-and-trade, they can’t go above the “apron” which is set 6-million dollars above the regular luxury tax level. The cap this year is 109 million and tax like 132.6 million. Just LeBron and AD alone cost the team like 77 million bucks, and they also have KCP and Kuzma (13 mill each) + gasol (2.7 mill) + Deng (5 mill) + Harrel’s player option (9.7 mill) and they need to spend money to bring some of their other players back like THT, Caruso, and importantly Schroder (who they can’t replace if he walks). It all gets complicated, but the TL;DR is their flexibility is going to be super limited.  3) it’s likely some ring-chasers come to the Lakers, but there’s lots of competition from other teams this season too. Nets are gonna steal away a lot of them imo, they’re still the favorites to win."
Did you just say Buddy Hield is big at his position? He’s a 6’4 wing with a 6’8 wingspan. He gets blown by all game and is absolutely horrible off the ball. He’s a truly bad defender.    You’re a kings fan. If Buddy had any resemblance to Klay’s ability to score like that they sure as hell wouldn’t be so interested in moving him.
Buddy has the same heart I promise you that. I’ve never seen a dude fly around the court like buddy hield. He’s got a motor
This is what I’m talking about though. Sports fans act like once a player turns 30 they’re going to start losing all their ability like it’s a video game. This is a new era. Buddy Hield has only spent 5 years in the NBA. He will continue to improve and get better. Turning 30 won’t change that.
Buddy Hield is almost 29 and he was drafted in 2016...
Buddy Hield turns 29 in December. His entire career has been people being surprise about how old he is.
"That’s not really comparable considering AD is a two-way superstar player, while Buddy Hield is a far less complete player.   After the trade, Lakers would still be lacking a secondary ball-handler and playmaker, since Schroder most likely won’t be on the team anymore.   They would also run into the hard-cap, making it difficult or impossible to bring back Caruso and THT.   There’s better options for improving the team than throwing all their assets at a pure sharpshooter w/ bad defense on an expensive 4 year/94mill contract imo."
"Eh Jr actually played defense at least on the cavs, Ross… does not lol I’d rather have him than Buddy Hield at least"
"The Lakers should not have drafted Buddy Hield instead of Brandon Ingram.  Drafting Brandon Ingram is fine, he is 19, he’s a project.  Brandon Ingram is younger than at least one player being drafted this year."
"I'm a Kings fan.  The Kings needed to get rid of Boogie, the guy was a cancer in that locker room, I would have been happy with zero assets in return.  Getting Buddy Hield and a pick, that is just a bonus.  (Weirdly, I don't think Boogie is a bad dude in a good locker room, he but if he's the leader and best player, that team is F***ed."
That’s Buddy Hield
"Barnes easily yes. Hield perhaps but it's closer than you think. Obviously buddy is a better shooter but danny is still really fucking good, he shot 1% better than buddy on 2 less attempts per 36 from 3 last year. And even with his athleticism gone he's still a much better defender by IQ alone."
"I understand buddy is one of the best in the game. Seth is on the same level and niang is a tier below. I'm not even saying hield wouldn't get lots of minutes and that he wouldn't be useful, it's just we already have tons of shooting and too many shooting guards, paying buddy 20m isn't worth it."
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth. Not on the Hawks level yeah but definitely better than the pelicans or the thunder"
What? They literally had a trade for Buddy Hield and LeBron wanted Russ to come instead.
"To extrapolate the comparison.   They could have traded Schroder, KCP + THT last year for Lowry who fits next to AD &amp; LeBron perfectly. Then still traded Kuzma + Harrell for Buddy Hield. Then resigned Caruso.   Lowry, Hield, Caruso &gt;&gt;&gt; Westbrook, THT"
Rubio is the type of point guard the Lakers needed along with Buddy Hield as a shooter. What they got instead is a Russell Westbrook that’s losing them games. I’m not mad though. It’s just bad that redditors can make a better roster than the Lakers GM.
Just hire me as your gm. I got you guys Buddy Hield and Whiteside and at 8-5 in 2k22 in year one.
"Obviously this is disrespectful to Russ, but tell me how its disrespectful to Lebron. He *chose* to play with Russ when they could have got Buddy Hield.   Maybe I'm not looking at it from the right angle but tell me how Lebron wanting to prove people he can win with Russ to make more people think Lebron is the goat is disrespectful to Lebron."
"Those of us with a grip on reality don’t hate him. I got flamed pretty hard in r/Lakers when I said I thought Kuzma + Harrell was an overpay for Hield.  Sidenote: I fucking hate how that sub (and Lakers Twitter) fixates on free agents or trade targets that they often just pull out of their ass. If I never hear the names James Ennis or Buddy Hield ever again, it’ll be too soon."
"I mean if there is a possibility of getting Buddy Hield for Sexton that would be a serious consideration for a trade. But if we can keep Sexton for 10/12 million a year, we should."
Not my fault rnba is incapable of grasping the truth. Legit another player was shooting higher volume on in better percentages in the same era as bird.   Bird was objectively a mediocre 3PT shooter. Buddy Hield literally is better.
"two of these guys are memes: duncan robinson, joe ingles  one of these guys plays on the best team in the league: seth curry  one of these guys plays for a team of mercenaries: joe harris  And then there's Buddy Hield, who is the best player on this list."
Malik and Buddy are different players though. Malik is very athletic and can somewhat attack the rim in addition to his 3 point shooting. Hes also a better defender than Hield.  But he needs to start to produce at his best which is one of the reasons he's been struggling this year.
Regular season is not the post season. Someone like Buddy Hield or CJ does not raise the sixers playoff ceiling at all.
"They are all very different players. Joe Ingles, Buddy Hield and Duncan Robinson are all *very* different players from one another"
A team will take Westbrook if picks are included. The Thunder would probably do it and buy him out. The Lakers aren’t getting anyone good for him so it makes more since to just see if Lebron can get him to change his stripes.   They’re idiots for trading for him when buddy Hield and Lowry were available. Lebron made an emotional decision in getting his buddy on his team rather than getting better role players that fit around him and AD.
"Buddy Hield is the answer to ""what if you took a league average NBA player and gave him a top tier shot?"""
"&gt;LeBron scuttling the Buddy Hield deal   A bunch of people on this sub repeat this claim like it is gospel truth, but  never provide a reliable source when asked.  Care to buck the trend?"
LeBron scuttling the Buddy Hield deal to bring in Westbrook instead (and the Lakers letting him do it) is going to go down as one of the dumbest decisions ever.
"Could have keep KCP, get Buddy Hield and re-sign Caruso, maybe even trade Talen Horton Tucker for something but nah"
"Should've traded for Buddy Hield, sometimes you need a better fit more than just pure talent"
"The problem is NBA trades and money in and money out, so we either get rid of a big salary player, or bundles our rooks and get someone for around 20 million.  In that range your getting Myles Turner or Buddy Hield tops.   I'm honestly not sure if that's worht the price giving up our 3 young players.  If Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman are say 75 ranked players, why give them up for an 85?  Getting a big name we have to dump Wiggins, Klay, or Dray."
"it's also partly because LeBron and AD wanted Westbrook. we needed some ball handling to take the pressure off LeBron as he's shooting more and dribbling less.   I just think we could have gotten away with it in the regular season with mediocre ball handlers and kept the identity of tall players dominating .   could have gotten Buddy Hield for Kuzma &amp; Harrel. but decided to go the other way.  we might figure it out mid-way through the season and become reallly good, so let's see."
Lol a better shooter than Klay ain’t even coming. Hell a better shooter than Buddy Hield is unlikely.
"&gt; superteams  So lot of y'all say that Lakers should've went to Buddy Hield instead. Now they also say Westbrook trade made them worse...yet they're a superteam when they got Westbrook.   You know what I actually get it, the casual's brain cannot comprehend beyond ""lmao 3 allstars superteam"""
"Couldn't agree more. Yeah, the game is changing to favor the three but Ray Allen's almost 3,000 threes is still 10 full seasons of 300 threes, which has still only ever been done by Curry (4 times) and Harden (once). Even 250 has only been done 25 times in NBA history. Steph owns 7 of those and Harden 4. The only other multiples are Buddy Hield (3), Lillard (2), Klay (2), and Duncan Robinson (2). So only 11 people have ever done it.  So unless you get another Steph or Harden caliber three point shooter, we're talking 13+ seasons of a more reasonable, but still difficult, 200-250 threes, which has been done by a lot of guys, but that's still some pretty insane shooting over a very long time.  Going down the list, Curry, Harden will definitely pass him barring (god forbid) injury. Even Lillard isn't a sure thing. He needs to keep his pace up for \~4 more years, and then he'll be 35. I'm pretty sure Lillard will do it since that's his game, but it's not as certain as Steph or Harden just yet.  Lowry, JR Smith, LeBron are too old.  Klay and Paul George \*might\*, but they still need 4-6 seasons of 200-250 threes. That puts them in their mid 30's of awesome shooting. Klay would be looking a lot more solid if he didn't miss 2 years to injury.  KD is probably too old unless he starts shooting more threes.  Going down further, Bradley Beal \*might,\* but he needs 8 seasons of 200+ threes. And all of a sudden we're down to people with half of Ray Allen's total.  You can't just pass Ray Allen with a medium-long career of above average three point shooting. You need to be a superstar three point specialist to the level of Curry, Harden, or Lillard. Even KD probably isn't going to get there. Even with the game changing, we're talking a 12-14 year career with a superstar level 3 point shooting peak or a 15+ year career as a really good 3 point shooter."
"Curry is the face of the three point revolution but a majority of the names on the top 3PM list now played in eras where they would get chewed out for shooting more than 2-3 a game. Miller, Korver, etc. Jason Terry averaged 4 3PA for his career and Curry's career 3pa is over 8 per game.   The top 10 will look a lot different in the next 10 years. Buddy Hield has only played 5 seasons and he's top 100 now and will be top 50 if he stays healthy this season, maybe even top 40."
"Wonder how much Cavs would have to pay for Buddy Hield, Koby please."
"lol, he's actually kind of not.  i guess tonight's games aren't factored in yet, but he's only 7th in 3PA.  1st and 2nd are steph and buddy hield and their 3P% are _ok_ (38.5% which is only bad because it's steph, and 39.1% for buddy) but everyone from 3rd to 7th in attempts is shooting from 23.4% (jordan clarkson) to 34.3% (anthony edwards).  i think duncan will still be above clarkson in 3P% after tonight since he was 2/10 in the pacers game.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FG3A&amp;dir=-1"
Buddy Hield?
"I completely understand westbrook over Buddy and another role player.  With Hield/Role players, they're BANKING on Lebron AND Davis being healthy more often than not.    &amp;nbsp;  The reality is that Lebron is starting to get ""nagging"" injuries and Davis just isn't a sure-fire bet.  Neither (davis because he's davis and Lebron because he's much older) can carry the team anymore if the other is out.  Lebron + Role players like Hield/monk/Melo aren't enough.  Davis + Role player like Hield/monk/Melo isn't enough.     &amp;nbsp;  Lebron/Davis + Hield + Monk/Melo is a better *FIT* but that's assuming health from Lebron/Davis.    &amp;nbsp;  And that's why Westbrook is here instead.  Westbrook is not a better fit while Lebron/Davis are both out on the floor.  BUT Westbrook is great to have more often than not if Lebron or Davis is out with an injury.  Davis out?  Well, there's still Lebron/Westbrook out there leading the team.  Lebron out?  Well, there's Davis/Westbrook out there."
"&gt;the defence could just zero in on him as a shooter leaving AD to have to carry the entire offence on his own  What? Why would AD be carrying the entire offence on his own in this scenario? There are still other players on the team. Buddy Hield at this point in time is a more effective complimentary player than Westbrook is by a decent margin.  I’m also not sure why you’re turning one of Buddy’s positives into a negative. The idea that Hield is drawing that much attention from the defence can only be interpreted as a positive thing. Hield drawing attention means defences will be *less* focused on AD (and the rest of the team), not more. It’s a concept called spacing, something that Hield provides a ton of and Westbrook provides none of.  You’re right in saying Westbrook has put pressure on defences in the past with his driving game. But AD is a player who primarily operates in the paint. As of right now defences are more more than willing to sag off Russ at the 3 point line to double up on AD. Russ is a talented passer. He isn’t effective enough of a scorer to take advantage of that court vision, hence the 5 TO’s per game.  Not to mention the defence would be better as they would still have KCP in this scenario.  Not to mention it isn’t really that difficult to find a decent playmaking point guard. The Cavs got Ricky Rubio for a single second round pick and salary filler. Westbrook’s skill set is a good bit more replaceable and a good bit less effective to winning than Hield’s."
"We know that based on like 6 games together? Idk man, in 2019 Russ averaged 27 7 and 7 playing with James Harden and a small ball lineup, he cut down his threes like halfway through the season and was a maniac at the rim.   Lakers have the flexibility to run that kind of lineup with lebron playing the Harden role and and AD as PJ Tucker.   The appeal of pulling that off is way better than Buddy Hield imo."
Russ just put up a huge triple double in a win against a very good team. He’s going to have bad games but he can also still carry the load and give us a chance when Lebron is out. Replace Russ with buddy hield last night and we don’t have a chance
You guys want buddy hield that bad huh
Trading Pascal for Buddy Hield ain't it
"His contract expires after this season if the kings don’t extend a qualifying offer, doesn’t it? Someone looking to dump salary or as filler in a buddy hield trade most likely."
We need a SG sharpshooter like Buddy Hield/Middleton. Those dont come cheap. Cedi/Okoro will have to fill the role.
"Schroder, Montrez, and THT for Lowry last year at the tradedeadline.   Then Kuzma and KCP for Buddy in the off-season. Buddy - $22,477,272. Kuzma - $13,000,000. KCP - $13,038,862.   Maybe could have even done it without KCP if they resigned Wes Mathews for 4 million and then traded him and Kuzma for Hield a little into the season."
