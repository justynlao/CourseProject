"If you're playing the nuggets, sixers, and Lakers it's going to be pretty important. I think you always need to have weakside rim protection but guys that excel at weakside rim protection aren't guaranteed to be good post defenders, like robert covington is good weakside rim protector but he's a poor post defender, there are tons of skinny long dudes who play really good help weakside defense but they're just too skinny to stop these massive dudes from backing them down, sometimes length and skill can compensate for that lack of strength in the post. A lot that goes into post defense is just raw strength and smarts. Typically though you need to run a drop coverage with really strong post defenders because they're too slow and top heavy to switch out on the perimeter which opens up 3 pt oppurtinies on pick and rolls.   Great teams that win championships typically can play every sort of defense at a high level and make adjustments throughout the game. The only outliers imo are the lebron miami and cleveland teams but some might argue Kevin love and tristan in combination are actually good enough and while the heat did play small they had udonis haslem who plays bigger than his size and they also had joel anthony. Chris Bosh wasn't exactly a pushover either and was kind've impossible to guard from the 5 even though he was kind've an afterthought.   GS best teams excelled at every type of defense for example. They always had the ability to go to draymond at the 5 for their switch heavy schemes and first they had bogut and then they had zaza to deal with good post up guys. Lakers are very similarly built this year. Raptors championship team was also built similarly with gasol and then switchy Ibaka at the 5."
"I don't. We had enough vets already and there was nothing he could give us. Jeremy Lin was much younger and a potentially good point guard who after signing, never managed fit in with the Raptors.  I just hope they don't retire his jersey. I'm not mad anymore because he's retired and we got a championship without him but let's let bygones be bygones and move on. He spent his prime in New Jersey then became a journeyman and gave veteran leadership to many teams after. He wanted out and got what he wanted. He's not our Udonis Haslem"
How can Spoelstra be considered a good coach if he isn't giving Udonis Haslem minutes ü§îüßê
Udonis Haslem would be the Heat's star player finally
"The Heatles is an underrated one.   Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Lebron James, Rashard Lewis, and Chris Bosh with Battier, Mike Miller, Juwan Howard, and Udonis Haslem off the bench is pretty amazing. They already won 66 games and 27 games in a row as is, without Allen, Lewis, or Howard anywhere close to their prime level."
To be fair Udonis Haslem could literally skype in via a tablet on wheels and be just as effective
Udonis Haslem
"&gt; I feel bad about what happened to him, but he's absolutely washed unless proven otherwise.  Bingo. IT being out of the league sucks from a human interest story perspective, especially after 2017, but there's no reason you'd bring him back to sit on your bench if you can get a young guy who may have some upward trajectory for cheaper. And he's not like Udonis Haslem where he's an effectively retired player-coach.   It just unfortunately doesn't make sense from a basketball perspective."
"I think you‚Äôre underestimating the good role players that Heat team had. Mike Miller, Eddie House, Mike Bibby, and Udonis Haslem were good vet players to have coming off the bench."
Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller were solid though . Just missed most of the season
Udonis haslem style
"Yep. Shaq had a game in the 2006 Finals where he only scored 5 points. [Five.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200606110DAL.html) Udonis Haslem outscored him in that game. For that series Shaq only averaged 13 ppg. That most definitely was *not* ""prime Shaq""."
I mean boogie was a locker room cancer most of his career. iDK why everyone seems to think he magically turned into Udonis Haslem.
"As a fellow Heat fan Haslem and Butler can be like this in practice. They may not show it on the floor as much (especially Udonis except when he goes in one of his tirades on the bench), but Dray is cut from the same cloth as these guys."
"Kevin‚Äôs Durant won 2 ships and FMVPs and I doubt the warriors are gonna retire his number, jersey retirements are about wayyyyyyyy more then just being good at basketball, it‚Äôs about what a player did on the court and for the community and how they were perceived by fans, that‚Äôs why a lot of teams have guys who never won rings or even individual awards with retired jerseys. Nick Collison for example, and Udonis Haslem when he finally retires, a guy who got traded to a team he didn‚Äôt want to be on and winning a ring doesn‚Äôt really sound like a jersey retirement situation to me, not even mentioning the fact that if that warriors team was 100% the raptors would‚Äôve gotten stomped"
"The Heatles were without a doubt considered a super team when they formed and still should be now. Check out this article from [2010](https://www.sbnation.com/2010/7/29/1591097/miami-heat-2011-record-projection-lebron-james), which not only labels them as such but also speaks to how good they were expected to be heading into their first season. Here's an exert which speaks to how they not only had their stars but were able to retain talent around them:  &gt; Pat Riley outsmarted us all. By completing sign-and-trade deals for LeBron and Bosh rather than just outright signing them, Riley was able to convince them to take lower first-year salaries because he could tack on a sixth year to the end of their deals. This financial legerdemain engineered enough cap room for the Heat to add two solid rotation players in Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem. Add in decent-ish role players like holdover Mario Chalmers and returnees James Jones and Carlos Arroyo, and suddenly the Heat boast a crop of actual NBA players aside from their Big Three.   They won 27 straight games in 2013, second longest win streak ever. They went to 4 straight finals. What else do they have to do to qualify for ""super team"" status?"
"Udonis Haslem , Rudy gobert, Thad young , Jrue holiday, Rajon rondo , James Johnson"
Udonis Haslem was born in Miami and is 3 time nba champion I think that beats Ariza...
Udonis Haslem over Ariza for Florida
"imo the telltale sign of it being effort is when he passes up easy meals and postups etc that require the bare minimum effort beyond standing still and shooting.  even if his knees were demolished, which i dont think they are at all, he could still move well enough out there to not immediately shoot a jumper or pass. even late stage udonis haslem did more"
This is an extremely obvious one IF you remember that he's still in the league: Udonis Haslem
Draymond should just be the 25 million udonis haslem for the warriors at this point. Great mentor
"Miami made it work because they made clear cut roles for players like: Mike miller, Udonis Haslem, Mario Chalmers, James Jones.   Nets will have to do something about Joe Harris, Jeff Green and whoever, to solidify this teams identity while the big three play at their level (carry) night in night out"
I was about to say that maybe hes entering the Udonis Haslem phase of his career. Then remembered he's younger than Steph and Klay
Udonis Haslem is 40.
"Sure, but by that same token, you could have arguments for guys like Udonis Haslem who have spent their entire career in Miami, been apart of 6 finals teams, solid starter for most of his career and means everything to his home team. Udonis Haslem is one of the most beloved Heat players of all time, probably right behind Dwyane Wade.   Obviously Lowry has had a more successful individual career with his all NBA third team nod, and his HOF status is an actual debate unlike Haslem (who was merely a role player/starter), but I don't think his importance to the city of Toronto should have any weight on his basketball HOF nod. If Toronto or Canada wants to put him in their local HOF for what he means to the city that makes sense, but it seems irrelevant for his Basketball HOF qualifications."
Udonis Haslem
Are you trying to say Udonis Haslem and J.J. Barea aren't stars?
Udonis Haslem
"I don't think you can compare Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, Mike Miller, Chris Andersen, James Jones an aging Rashard Lewis, and Mario Chalmers to Schroder, Wesley Matthews, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and an aging Marc Gasol.  You're looking at 4 possibly 5 hall of famers on that heat team.  Hell, this Lakers team might not even be better than last year's team."
"whoever was the fourth option on that pistons team with chauncey, rip, tayshaun, sheed, and ben wallace deserves a shoutout.  wasnt kwahi also basically fourth option at first?  rajon rondo?   udonis haslem?"
Is Udonis Haslem about to have a 48 minute game?
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
Another locker room guy who comes to mind is Udonis Haslem on the Heat too
"Draymond is personally invested in the development is wiseman.  When draymond starts becoming washed up he will see the fruits of his labor, developing wiseman to the best of his ability could probably end up getting draymond a few more dollars down the line.  Draymond gonna be a nice Udonis Haslem for the warriors in the future."
"While training for the nba, how many shots did you shoot a day? What was your shooting workout to make you one of the best in the league? How much did Udonis Haslem help you adapt to the nba?"
What's your favorite moment with Dwyane Wade/Udonis Haslem?
"Coach Spoelstra, Jimmy Buckets, Udonis Haslem. Fuck one, marry one, kill one, go."
He could be the Warriors version of Udonis Haslem when he's older. Just a professional vet presence and essentially another coach for the young players.
Looking forward to seeing Scalabrine try to guard Udonis Haslem tonight.
I don't know if Rondo would be a good coach. He has great BBIQ but he has attitude issues on court and tends to get pissed a lot.  Draymond has the BBIQ and seems to have a great attitude towards his teammates. The Dubs seem motivated to play defense. I don't doubt that he could be a great coach or even a great veteran locker room presence in some years a l√† Udonis Haslem.
"In terms of actual length on one team, not ""franchise-level"" players, it would be Udonis Haslem &gt; Stephen Curry &gt; Patty Mills"
He's gonna be like a Udonis Haslem. Playing in the league for 5 years after his body is no longer capable of NBA minutes.
"I've got a picture of Alabama vs. Florida basketball hanging up in my room with Udonis Haslem in a Florida jersey. My parents bought me one of the limited prints when I was a kid.  https://www.jemsonline.com/inc/sdetail/1848  Crazy to think Haslem and LeBron are still playing. In that painting you can see Matt Bonner and I think Gerald Wallace was on that Alabama team.   Its crazy to think a whole generation of players is almost extinct from when I first started watching basketball. I'm sure some people are older but this post is the first time I realized that. I still am actually relatively young, so it kind of makes me feel like I'm getting to the point where the years will start going by faster and faster."
"Agreed.. I could have said ‚Äúafter his playing career‚Äù  Late career Dray will be interesting though. Once he drops below starter production, will he be satisfied with a bench role? I can‚Äôt see him, and he has no need to, ring chase somewhere. He‚Äôd be fantastic transitioning into a Udonis Haslem role if he wants to stay in the league until he‚Äôs 40, but he strikes me as a guy with other aspirations.   I‚Äôm a Dray fan for what it‚Äôs worth. But I have no idea what he‚Äôll do after this contract is up."
What end of the bench guy helps his team win a championship on the court?? Maybe he provided the team with an inspiration. When the Heat went to the Finals last year Udonis Haslem rode the bench the whole year but they re-signed him cuz he helps with more than just stats.
It‚Äôs not the end of the world. The Heat have kept Udonis Haslem for years past the point of playability.
Dude...Udonis Haslem is 55 years old and gets paid $3 million to watch Heat games from court side and watch games. Everyone in the NBA is grossly overpaid haha.
That Miami team was complete trash. 2nd best player was washed up Jermaine O'Neal and 3rd best was Udonis Haslem.
I could see him pulling a udonis haslem and joining a team just to be a mentor and locker room presence. Or maybe an Evan turner where he could still play but joined a coaching staff instead.
Will Udonis Haslem get credited for every Miami playoff win until the end of time?
I feel lost.  I was sure Udonis Haslem retired like 2 years ago
Yea but udonis haslem is being paid 2.6 million. LMA has a 30m contract
Non basketball reasons are a thing  Look at udonis haslem
Udonis Haslem embodies Florida Man?
The disrespect to Udonis Haslem
"In all seriousness, udonis haslem. He hasn‚Äôt played in like two years but he still has a great impact in the locker room and mentoring young players"
"Excuse you, Udonis Haslem is right there..."
Karl Malone and Udonis Haslem
Mr. Miami himself Udonis Haslem
yeah been watching the NBA since 2012 and in my mind he's still fairly young to me compared to someone like Udonis Haslem lol
Udonis Haslem
As long as the Heat keep employing Udonis Haslem (the only ‚Äúplayer‚Äù older than me) I still have a shot lol.
"Yeah, JR and Bron both skipped college too. I always felt like LeBron saw JR as the ""enforcer"" on the team. If LeBron's confidence would waver, JR would be a tough guy hype man ‚Äî even though he wasn't good. lol     LeBron had Udonis Haslem in Miami"
Why someone hasn‚Äôt knocked this guy out once idk. If he was pulling this shit 10 years ago a Udonis Haslem type player/enforcer would‚Äôve given him a nice knock down.   Guy deserves it after all the shit he pulls
"You don't need to hand out a max contract just to get a good locker room guy. Those guys are usually on vet minimum contracts (i.e. Udonis Haslem, Jared Dudley, etc)."
"Sure it does.    Teams with shorter histories are obviously not the best to play the ‚Äúmost in franchise history‚Äù card.  It‚Äôs misleading.  Bargnani has the fifth most points in Raptors history, but he wasn‚Äôt a great player by any stretch.  Nick Collison has the second most rebonds in OKC history, but he was no all-star.  Udonis Haslem was a very good role player, but he has the most rebounds in Heat history, despite only averaging 8 a game in his prime.  Saying Curry is the all-time leader in Hornets history makes him sound like some type of all-nba talent, and it‚Äôs fine to acknowledge that he was not without disliking the guy.  I think people here are defensive of Dell Curry for some weird reason, but I‚Äôm old as dirt and actually watched a fair amount of him.  He was a good shooter, but going by his Hornets point total is an awful way to gauge him as a player."
65-year-old LeBron is 2017-19 Udonis Haslem
* 43 year old LeBron is Prime Brandon Bass  * 45 year old LeBron is current Justin Jackson  * 48 year old LeBron is 2013 Udonis Haslem
Udonis haslem is like 20 years older than the Timberwolves coach
"This is not a crazy take though? It's not just redditors who said this, Udonis Haslem [said](https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/1351612397505679361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1351612397505679361%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fheat-news-the-hilarious-reason-udonis-haslem-is-glad-miami-didnt-trade-for-james-harden%2F) they wouldn't be able to to get him to buy into the culture."
Udonis Haslem
Udonis Haslem (40)   Andre Iguodala (37)  Carmelo Anthony (36)  JJ Redick (36)  LeBron James (36)
"Well he‚Äôs not the oldest player in the league. That distinction goes to Udonis Haslem. LeBron‚Äôs the fifth oldest behind Haslem, Iguodala, Melo, and Redick."
"If you listen to what Udonis Haslem had to say, it‚Äôs entirely possible they chose ‚ÄúHeat culture‚Äù over Harden"
"Those are crazy lofty expectations for a literal teenager. Nobody expected that out of Ayton, Zion, Fultz, etc. Sure there's exceptions like Doncic or Ja Morant but there's a reason teams like the spurs and heat keep guys around a long time like Patty Mills and Udonis Haslem."
"Apparently he was over 300 pounds in high school and [when he first signed with a French team after college](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2012/1120/nba_ga_haslempanel_gb1_576.jpg)  Here's a couple really interesting articles about it, where I got the pictures from:  - [Miami Heat‚Äôs Udonis Haslem found his drive as an overweight, lazy star at Miami High](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/article/20120620/SPORTS/812030590)  - [Udonis Haslem: Unlikely Rebounding Story](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/15951/udonis-haslem-a-rebounding-story)  Really interesting reads IMO and pretty inspiring stuff when you consider he went from that to having a 17-year NBA career, with a lot of his longevity being attributed to how well-conditioned he is"
"Not only was Udonis Haslem in high school before they had 247 rankings, he was also in high school [before](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/storyimage/LK/20120620/SPORTS/812030590/EP/1/1/EP-812030590.jpg) they had [proper nutrition](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/storyimage/LK/20120620/SPORTS/812030590/AR/0/AR-812030590.jpg)  (yes he is #50)"
"Well, I used specific 247 composite rankings, and some players like Iggy and Udonis Haslem didn‚Äôt have rankings because 247 didn‚Äôt rank until 2002. If a player had an N/A ranking I looked at their wiki and went on multiple scouting websites to see if I can nail a ranking."
"Maybe he can be useful with The Heat? Veteran championship coach with Jimmy Butler and Udonis Haslem as the captains of the team. They won't allow him to behave like that. Plus, The Heat could use some size and rebounding (Olinyk, Injured Meyers Leonard and rookie Precious Achiuwa is Adebayo's help). Adebayo can move to the 4 which could give him a break fighting the Centers and help with perimeter defense a bit more. He also has a good mid range shot now. The Heat need some size right now."
Udonis Haslem is one of his favorite players.
"this is a good pick too. i went with al horford, but boozer did what he did and went home.   udonis haslem?  good for 8-14 every game off of broken plays...i dont know if they ever ran a play for haslem but he still shows up on the stat sheet."
"Screw it, bring out Udonis Haslem."
"Udonis Haslem at age 40: 40 Years Old (Best), 17 Seasons (Best), 6'8"" (Tied For Best), On Roster (Yes)"
There‚Äôs a new one asking the same question about Udonis Haslem of all people.
Udonis Haslem
Miami Receives   Lebron AD Giannis Jrue Luka Porzingas   Lakers Receives  Udonis Haslem  Milwaukee receives   Tyler Herro  Dallas receives   Cash considerations and a second round pick
Udonis Haslem is collecting checks from when he took a paycut in the Big 3 era. It'd be weird if we were paying an assistant coach what he currently gets paid so he collects the checks as a player under the guise of veteran leadership (which he does provide + the team loves him).
"Udonis Haslem is outplaying Kemba Walker... And he hasn't played a minute all season üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. At this point Kemba is pretty much just a post injury Isaiah Thomas, but even worse."
How hard would it be for Udonis Haslem to play for 25 seasons if he keeps his current role? He‚Äôs on the roster this year even if doesn‚Äôt get minutes
Udonis Haslem
"Draymond is a first-ballot HOFer and imo at least a top-5 defender all time, and the only one under 6‚Äô7.  But he‚Äôs out of the league in 5 years. Or he‚Äôs like a 10th man on his Udonis Haslem shit. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs that far away from this."
He's doing the Udonis Haslem role.
Same with Udonis Haslem. Dude is getting paid deep into his retirement years because he accepted less money so Heat could form a super team.
Udonis Haslem role?
"Idk, hes our defensive leader. Hes a great glue guy and has a huge positive effect on culture. His veteran presence is great for all the younger guys on the team. He may not be a scoring threat but he facilitates the ball so well. I wish he could improve his three point shooting, but honestly even if he was completely unplayable I'd still love to have him on the team with a Udonis Haslem role."
"He's getting paid for his role on the 2016 ring. It's just a legacy 'thank you' contract, like the one Udonis Haslem has."
Udonis Haslem will still be better then her... my point is biology makes the world of a difference. The NBA would take D1 High school boys before they took WNBA woman
ü§£ü§£ü§£  no female will be in the nba unless she playing the role of udonis haslem.
"Perk doesn't belong there. Ron Artest, Bill Laimbeer, Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason, Robert Parrish, Karl Malone, James Johnson, Matt Barnes, Zach Randolph, David West, Robin Lopez, Udonis Haslem, Steven Adams above Kendrick Perkins. Perk is just mean mug dude. Steven Adams is more of an enforcer than Perk will ever be even if he doesn't do the ugly mean mug like Perk did."
Udonis Haslem
PG: Goran Dragic  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: LeBron James  PF: Udonis Haslem  C: Bam Adebayo   We'd do alright
Udonis Haslem on a vet min is fair. Someone who can win you a playoff game on a vet min is not fair.
Horry was vital player in every ring he won.  I feel like some of you think he was Udonis Haslem for his teams or something.  Man was more like MWP on the 2010 Lakers for most of his teams.
Pretty much the only NBA lineup that any college team would have a chance against would be end of bench rookies + Udonis Haslem at the 4.
"Says the guy that needed Jason Terry, Jason Kidd, Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojakovic and Dirk to win against Mike Bibby and Udonis Haslem smh"
I just realized that I don't know if Udonis Haslem is still an active player on the Miami Heat and wouldn't be surprised with either outcome.
"I looked at the roster to refresh my memory, and damn...  In order of total minutes played: Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, (rookie) Michael Beasley, Daequan Cook, (pretty washed) Shawn Marion, Joel Anthony, Chris Quinn, Yakhouba Diawara, (pretty washed) Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Magliore, Jamario Moon, James Jones..."
"2013 NBA Finals Game 7. The Miami HEAT only had five (5) players who scored:     * James - 37 * Wade - 23 * Battier - 18 * Chalmers - 14 * Andersen - 3  Yep. Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Mike Miller, and Udonis Haslem played but did not score a single point.     Of the five scorers, [Shane Battier coming out of a playoff slump and hitting 6-8 from deep was very memorable.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc45Tf6dJF4)"
Udonis Haslem is the only active player older than me.  Your time will come and go.
Can somebody ELI5 what is the deal with Udonis Haslem? I would like to understand this premise.
"Shh that way if Udonis fouls out, Haslem can check in lol"
Ah yes Udonis and Haslem the two heat players
"Ask /r/heat and they'd tell you the opposite a ton of our players are unplayable it feels like. Silva, Udonis, Okpala, Haslem, Harkless, Bradley, Vincent all have been dead roster spots. The game tonight was really encouraging in that light. Thank god Nunn has turned it around and started improving again. His improvement is an underrated story for Miami. He went from being in the starting lineup, to a long period of getting DNPs, to back in the starting lineup looking better than he did last year. He's making better decisions, being a better playmaker, playing better defense, and shooting better from 3. I feel bad for losing my faith in him!"
Lmao Udonis Haslem-berg
"Technically Udonis Haslem has been in the league longer than LeBron, but he went undrafted. And he obviously hasn't gotten meaningful minutes in years."
Good'ole Udonis Haslem always chucking and Jivin. Singing and dancing like a court jester
Given that Udonis Haslem is Black it's definitely being said about at least one Black person
"&gt; Why would Udonis Haslem apologise for SJax?  To some people, one black person represents all of them."
Why would Udonis Haslem apologise for SJax? He's making this statement because he's leader of the Miami locker room and feels a responsibility.
"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/12/05/miami-heat-eastern-conference-contenders  &gt;It‚Äôs not just the starters who have thrived in this environment. Chris Silva, an undrafted backup center on a two-way contract, has become an essential sparkplug off the bench and is already drawing comparisons to local icon Udonis Haslem for his tenacity. (You can tell whenever Silva is in the game because he immediately begins gobbling up offensive rebounds like a Hungry Hungry Hippo.)"
"Also in the bubble, Udonis Haslem could've potentially had 2 points made in zero game time, had he made his free throws."
"I wouldn't be surprised if he was released, he's a bum on and off the court it seems like. Why would a team keep this guy around? For cheerleading? They already have udonis haslem for that."
"I mean bro.... udonis haslem has stuck around on a roster while playing like 300 minutes over the last FOUR YEARS!! ....thats the equivalent of like 6 full games! He's scored 45 points over the last 3 seasons lol  If a guy who is a career 7.6 ppg player can stick around and play single digit games over a 4 year span just becausue of his intangibles, im fairly certain that pretty much every single team in the league would be able to find a spot on the bench for Lebron fucking james for a season or two even if he doesnt play a single minute...  and I'd be willing to bet Lebron at 44 will probably still be quite a bit more productive than haslem was at 40 lol"
future Udonis Haslem for the Warriors I swear
"No way man, he was on the team way back when they had like Udonis Haslem and shit"
"Ahh yes. When I think leadership I think Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Chris Paul, Udonis Haslem. Lol. Whhattbout whattabbout whattabout. Don't turn this about what you think about me, the subject is UD being an unnecessary part of the team and full time hanger on at this point in his career."
So Udonis Haslem as opposed to Lance Stephenson
Dwight‚Äôs technical/per 36 numbers are off the charts this season. Only second behind Udonis Haslem.
"Udonis ""4-D chess"" Haslem"
Udonis ‚ÄúPanda‚Äù Haslem

Haslem has one of those names that you just say in its entirety whenever you can. *Udonis Haslem* just has such a nice ring to it.
Udonis Haslem
"What's the significance of Udonis Haslem to the Miami Heat? I mean, he's one of the only two people with the distinct honor of having 3 championships (as a player) with the Miami Heat -- the other is Dwyane Wade, who has been retired for two years.  Short of Spoelstra and Riley, Udonis Haslem has been the only constant through all of it. When you mention them, you have to mention him and his winning mentality/what he's brought to the table for the Heat organization day-in and day-out for the last 18 years.   He took a paycut so the Big 3 could happen, he's taken paycuts for other players to come to Miami, he's been an effective player coach according to players on the team, and he was a driving motivator in the bubble Finals run. His value to the team even off-the-court cannot be understated.  He's massive to the city of Miami even without the Heat for his work in providing job opportunities for the less fortunate through his franchising of multiple chains in the Miami area (in which he's hands-on with) and taking back the white-washing of Wynwood by creating affordable housing for those pushed out of their home by gentrification.    And he was one of very few Miami celebrities to actually speak out against gatherings, spring breakers and Florida tourism during the Pandemic, even going so far as to write a Players' Tribune article on the matter.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt3ici4acMQ) is a great, short documentary on what his impact is in Miami and why Heat fans hold him in such high regard."
"Trust me, no one outside of Miami is worried about Udonis Haslem, lmao"
"At the end of the world there will still be cockroaches, Cher, and Udonis Haslem on the Miami Heat!"
"at this point in the thread we're here to comment on the article that udonis haslem wrote: it's about his opinion on spring breakers coming to Florida last March.  given dwight's stance on anti-vaxx, it seems germane to the world of possibility that the technical foul could've been in.  did you read the article?"
"When Shaq calls Udonis Haslem a hitman, you know he says it with the utmost respect."
"It's Udonis Haslem, kind of a legend on the Miami Heat because of the sheer length of his career with them."

"&gt; like I had assumed  Have you [heard/read/watched](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/udonis-haslem-nba-covid-the-real-miami) anything about UD? I dont' think he could coast like that even if he wanted to. That aside, i don't think Pat would let him, discounts and all"

Udonis haslem is still in the league?
UD is from a really rough part of Miami and grew up there in the 80s when things were at their worst. He‚Äôs [pretty much the exact opposite](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/udonis-haslem-nba-covid-the-real-miami) of that.
Udonis Haslem is a known ‚Äútough guy?‚Äù This is news to me. I‚Äôve been watching Miami since 03 and he never stuck out to me as a guy who gets into a lot of altercations

"He's essentially a coach *inside* the locker room, instead of outside it. And everyone knows it.  &gt; ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just be honest: my value to this team is not playing,‚Äù Dudley said. ‚ÄúMy playing days of contributing at a high level are done. There are times where I can still help (in short minutes), as you saw a couple of times this year and even last year, but for the most part, my value is the locker room, the bus, the plane, the film room, holding guys accountable in practice, getting on guys. Kind of like a coach.  &gt; ‚ÄúBut the difference for me in not being a coach is I‚Äôm in the locker room day-to-day and there are certain things I can say to certain players that maybe a coach couldn‚Äôt.  ....  &gt;  I‚Äôll tell you right now, J-Kidd‚Äôs relationship is phenomenal with LeBron James. It‚Äôs not like my relationship. It‚Äôs not like (mine with) Anthony Davis. There‚Äôs certain things that I can say to those two that other people can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve been with them. I know good habits, I know bad habits.  &gt; ‚ÄúNow J-Kidd is a hall of famer, he can say pretty much anything, but to me it‚Äôs also your personality. I‚Äôm a very outgoing guy, I think I‚Äôm very honest and blunt with what I say  Udonis Haslem is another of those guys. Except Udonis is more iconic for the Heat."
"Nerlens Noel went from being a potential overpay to one of the more underrated centers in the league. Great for his PR, bad for his wallet.  Also I'm convinced that Thibs will turn Taj Gibson into NYK's version of Udonis Haslem."
My man Udonis Haslem is still in the league ok?
Udonis Haslem is 21-8.
Wheres Udonis Haslem?
Thibs is determined to make Taj into the next Udonis Haslem.
Udonis Haslem thrived solely rebounding and shooting from a particular distance in the short corner
noone can take the crown of udonis haslem when it gets to that smh
"Well, the best example is honestly Udonis Haslem. Doesn't play, but we know the impact."
No please. Unless he's in a Udonis Haslem role no
Udonis Haslem
"It‚Äôs Nick Collison, and a close second will be Udonis Haslem whenever he actually retires. Both franchise legends, but at their peaks they were nothing more than solid players."
"He was with the organization for 15 years (going back to the Sonics) and was basically their Haslem as far as a culture guy.  Not as good as Udonis, obviously, but that's not what it was for."
"Udonis Haslem kind of move is my guess, doubt he plays much other than to be a bench presence for SexLand."
"&gt; In return, the owner offers them a post-career role on the team to pay them back while making it look all legit. See Udonis Haslem   So what's the under the table part? Do you think Haslem took a pay cut? He was always well paid even though he couldn't play anymore after 32. So what's there to pay back? Plus it was already known ages ago that he would remain with the Heat because that's his team.   What's the source on Maverick stocks?"
He‚Äôs not there to play. Its a mentorship role. It‚Äôs not a big of deal if he hasn‚Äôt played in the NBA in 4 years or if he isn‚Äôt in the best shape. They‚Äôre not paying him to do that. He‚Äôs filling a Udonis Haslem role.
"Nah, Miami had a lot of other good role players that the Lakers didn't. Devean George was never the same caliber player as a James Posey or Antoine Walker. Slava was not Udonis Haslem. Brian Cook and Ronny Turiaf were not Alonzo Mourning.   Shaq, Kobe, and nothing else isn't getting past Dallas. Probably not even getting past the Spurs, Clippers or Suns.  Malone would've been retired by 06 even if he hadn't hit on Kobe's wife. No Odom or Kwame, who were results of the Shaq trade (Kwame via Caron Butler). No Bynum either, since they wouldn't have gone 35-47 in 2005.  No Pau in 08 either, since there's no Kwame."
Steph Curry Alex Caruso Klay Thompson Udonis Haslem Tacko Fall
"As someone that was the 7th man for a high school team that lost in the state finals, I wish more people understood this. You know what, I set screens, shut down big men on D, and got rebounds. I knew my role and I did it as well as I could. Not everyone can be Steph or Luka. I love watching role guys and seeing how they impact the game. Birdman and Udonis Haslem are two of my all time favorites because I could see myself in them, obviously they were in a different stratosphere but my game was similar to what they did."
 I know all about the summer of 2010.  It was well documented.  I was asking you to explain the blatantly false claim about the star players agreeing to take less money 'before the season even ended'.  Like what is that even supposed to mean?   All the negotiations happened during free agency since other teams had legitimate chance to land lebron and wade and no team knew what salaries were needed to fill out the rest of the roster until the summer.   The big 3 originally took a pay cut in order to fit mike millers contract in.  So it had nothing to do with fitting all 3 of them together.  The heat had room for all 3 maxs just not enough for the higher salaried role players.  They then went back a few days later and took another pay cut in order to fit udonis haslem on the roster as well.   So 5 players took less money to play with each other.   And udonis took the biggest paycut of them all by far (which the heat are still paying back to this day)
"What's the risk for GMs? It doesn't work out? That's the same risk the players take.  Moreover, superteams can be made with all the stars getting paid market value. Wade/Lebron/Bosh didn't have to take paycuts. They did but it was for the role players especially Udonis Haslem. The Heat had cap space for all three of them. In the case of the Cavs for example all 3 stars were paid the max."
At this point Udonis Haslem
This guy played through a fcking broken collar bone in the playoffs. Which caused nerve damage.  GSW better give him Udonis-Haslem-like-payments years down the line.
"They picked up Broderick Thomas and jerimiah Martin on 2 ways. Kabengele is only a 10 day.   I think Delly is kind of a stand in for what they want out of a third guard. Like a taller version of Delly 5 years ago would be a really good 3rd guard for them. He also has great chemistry with Sexton and was clearly a mentor to both young guards. When he was out, he was talking to them on the bench constantly and they‚Äôve both talked about him a lot in interviews. So a bit of it might be about the intangibles he brings. I think they see him as kind of like a Udonis Haslem.       He can still pass, he‚Äôs in the right spots, he tries, he controls tempo, he always finds Sexton easy shots, he talks and etc   He just physically isn‚Äôt good enough any more and his 3 is horrible. Part of it might be a stealth tank move. I think the Cavs front office didn‚Äôt want to chase the play in, but they wanted to continue to build a winning culture."
"Udonis Haslem, though when I was growing up it was Alonzo Mourning."
$6.8m for Udonis Haslem when you could get Al Harrington (who up to that point was a 14 and 6 who could give you some assists) for $5.7m is extremely steep.
"[Dude was said to have been offered 30mil/4yrs by Dallas and Denver in 2010](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2010/07/12/udonis-haslem-turns-down-bigger-offer-from-mavericks-stays-with-heat/). Passed up and went for 20mil/5yrs with the HEAT Big 3. That's for a championship team starter averaging 10 and 8, with great defense. People forget how good Haslem was before the Big 3 and the injuries."
"I'm not a big Oakley fan but he's essentially the 90's version of guys like Udonis Haslem and Matt Barnes.  Decent at defense and rebounding, good teammate, does the dirty work,  NOT GREAT at any particular thing."
"I mean there are non-NBA players (probably not on Reddit though) who probably could beat the worst NBA player 1 on 1, but those non-NBA players don‚Äôt offer anything a team would want. Of course someone like Michael Beasley could, but I would say as far down as a Walt Lemon Jr. potentially could beat Udonis Haslem or even a lottery pick in Killian Hayes 1 on 1 right now, but he doesn‚Äôt offer the leadership or youth/potential as those 2."
Can he just be like udonis haslem and be another coach on the bench? He would be very good at that.
"Yes. Based on Jimmy's interview w/ JJ Reddick, he seemed to have a problem with the head coach more than anything, followed by the FO. So if he got along w/Doc and felt appreciated by Morey et al, he'd probably do well. Ben Simmons said that Doc has been great about stressing ***accountability***, which seems to be Jimmy's language. Also Dwight Howard is the Udonis Haslem of the team (the vet capable of helping teammates climb another gear) a role Jimmy appreciates. Plus Jimmy and Embiid are tight."
"I mean Udonis Haslem tho  Beal and Dame were both drafted by the wizards and blazers around the same time that Patty Mills signed with the Spurs I think, and of course Lowry was traded to the raptors that same year."
This is why Udonis Haslem &gt; Shaq
I want Patty on a Udonis Haslem role
Bill Clinton was president when Udonis Haslem played for Florida
"Its 2035 the earth is half way under water and Udonis Haslem is still signing his 1 year contracts with the Heat for a ""leadership and team morale role."
Is Udonis Haslem a bum?
Udonis Haslem
"Udonis Haslem was born in Miami, played for the Florida Gators and played his whole career with the heat"
"Based on per 100 possessions or per 36 minutes, Udonis Haslem was the best scorer in the league this year. But you have to actually play in order for your offensive production to really matter. Thybulle‚Äôs lack of playing time is a fair flaw in his overall offensive production. Especially since we don‚Äôt know if he would have been an All-Defense defender in the first place if he had to play 50% more minutes."
Yeah nothing like putting 63 year old Udonis Haslem and MPJ in pick and rolls
Nuggets need to get Udonis Haslem.
Who would've thought Javale McGee was the Nuggets Udonis Haslem
"How is that an insult on kawhi? Look at the players left from lebron‚Äôs draft class.... dwade is long gone, melo was out of the league for a few years, udonis haslem is a relic at this point, korver is a ghost of his former self, even kobe was at the bottom of the west when he was in his 18th season.. you‚Äôre delusional if you think kawhi will still be a MVP candidate and a unanimous FMVP at his 17th-18th season. There‚Äôs a reason lebron is considered a top 3 GOAT and that‚Äôs mainly because of his unmatched longevity. You don‚Äôt become on top of every all time list by accident man"
Udonis Haslem needs some respect.
Udonis Haslem has had an incredible career for an undrafted guy.
"&gt; Udonis Haslem  He's made $23m in the last 8 seasons. And...played, combined, a single season's worth of starter minutes total.  What a pro."
Udonis Haslem. He‚Äôs been part of his hometown team his entire career despite barely playing now. He doesn‚Äôt get paid as much as Clarkson but he‚Äôs probably living a great life.
Its on record that they yool pay cuts for the sake of qlso keeping Udonis Haslem.
Why do you think the Heat still have Udonis Haslem on the bench?
alpha mentality...so Udonis Haslem?
"Not at all. For one thing, ever since Durant left, Westbrook didn't really have solid help in OKC until he had got half a Paul George. He did have to do it all and he raised his level to something I don't think has been done at the poing guard position in decades. But before that, he was playing alpha to the most complete offensive weapon to set foot on a basketball court.  The Udonis Haslem take is extra, and it's not at all what I meant. Russ is an alpha personality, and Durant is not - he's just gonna do it online or on the court. He likely wouldn't be the great player he is if he wasn't that way, but sometimes, that's been part of his downfall too."
Holy shit we are so far removed from 2011 that haters like you are actually arguing the Heat had a good supporting cast outside of the big 3? This is fucking wild. Those shooters you are talking about were so bad that they were out of league immediately after that season. James Jones was an amazing shooter and yet he barely ever saw the floor because he simply wasn't good enough at anything else. Their best role players Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem were injured most of the year.   LeBron's performance has nothing to do with the quality of the roster.
so you're saying Westbrook is basically Udonis Haslem
"He‚Äôs their Udonis Haslem. When your 2 star players want a guy, you go get him."
"He‚Äôs basically their Udonis Haslem+.   Dudes there to tell Kyrie to chill out, wave towels come post season, and in the regular season give rest to their bugs."
The Udonis Haslem of the Nets
A thiccer Udonis Haslem.
And Udonis Haslem who is only 40!
"Kobe, Duncan, Curry, Udonis Haslem"
Honestly hope he gradually takes on a Udonis Haslem role but still manages to win Sixth Man of the Year in the process.
Little too early for him to take a Udonis Haslem role.
"At this point, Melo is nothing more than an end of bench guy that just gives you some minutes to fill in for injuries or as a spark off the bench some games. He shouldn't be a regular rotation player. He cannot play defense and he doesn't provide reliable offense. Yes he hits some shots every few games. So maybe you try him every few games.   He's 37, he got his redemption and comeback story. Any more than that is just absurdly selfish. He can take a Juwon Howard or Udonis Haslem style role for a few years yet, that's fine. Players seem to like him and he can be that type of presence. If he's not willing to do that, then he should retire."
First nba finals since 2010 to not feature Udonis haslem or Andre iguodala
"He had committed to Florida before declaring for the draft. His career would have been different if he had the opportunity to spend a year or two learning from Billy Donovan. Also, Udonis Haslem was a senior on that team and I think that would have been a good relationship for him to have."
You mean Udonis Haslem?
Udonis Haslem circa 2021 - hit a midrange jumper and start a fight with a dude on the other team
"Terrible take lol, you have no idea how these environments work. By your logic no one would give a fuck about Udonis Haslem, who actually is the 15th man.  Not to mention Rondo has as much clout as anybody when it comes to basketball IQ and championship basketball. You're applying fucking r/nba's outlook on social norms to real life elite competition."
He‚Äôs 31 so he could probably play 3-6 more years. In the next few years he‚Äôll probably be moved to the bench but he could play a bit longer if he hops into that Udonis Haslem role
But think about poor Udonis Haslem! He‚Äôd have to run around strip clubs every night finding James
Udonis Haslem.  40 years old and cashing a million dollar check to vibe check Dwight Howard for 2 minutes?  That‚Äôs real king shit.
"Yeah the thing with murray is that he and jokic have crazy chemistry in the 2 man game. It was crucial in the bubble playoffs and if mpj develops more it will make it that much harder to gaurd. The other thing with murray is his competitiveness and clutch gene are super valuable. Any trade involving murray and picks would have to be too good to turn down, I think jokic would be pretty upset if murray was traded tbh, also the injury complicates the whole picture even more.   They'll definitely have to get creative, use the MLE and try to get guys on rookie deals too. I think nnaji has potential to be a really solid role player. As for millsap I love the dude, and would be happy to keep him around in a udonis haslem type role, but I am excited to move on from him playing significant mins. We've paid him 40 mil the last 2 years so I think we've done right by him. I'm glad we locked up monte Morris too.   I think they'll have a better plan this coming free agency, I think they were caught off gaurd by Grant leaving and had to scramble to piece things together."
"The tough guy think is overblown and never even made sense.   KG has talked trash to plenty of guys who are stronger than him including Lebron, Zaza pachulia, Dwight Howard and others. If people want to say he talked trash without wanting to follow through with fighting anyone‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fine. Think I read before his trash talk was meant solely to get into other guys heads so they were more focused on it than whatever else   I absolutely remember Andre blatch for example being shook by it during a wizards game   The people who have called him a fake tough guy are players like Kenyon Martin, Udonis Haslem after the fact who had plenty of opportunity to do something about it during their careers if they took issue but never did  The other stuff like playing through injuries, playing hard on a daily basis, being consistent or other things at least to me do a better job of defining toughness and he was right there on those aspects"
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"Sasha Vujaciƒá, James Jones, Udonis Haslem, and Manu Ginobili"

Do you have three NBA championship rings? Cause Udonis Haslem
"They'd set a precedent, and be potentially increasing their labour costs long term for no real reason? Especially when the current arrangement is working for everybody.  I think of it kinda like how home prices get pushed up if people start buying homes for $30k or more, over what they are valued at.   Google says Caron Butler is an assistant for the Heat right now.   I dont know how much the Heat is paying him, but if Haslem gets 2.5 million as an assistant, Butler would be unwise to ***not*** use that number in salary negotiations with the Heat or some other NBA team.  ""I am a 2 time All Star, Haslem is not. I can bring All Star calibre coaching to this organisation.""   ..... Anther example..  Tim Duncan was an assistant coach for a bit yeah? If Haslem is getting 2.5 mil with the title ""Assistant Coach,"" Duncan could jump out the window and ask for double that, because you can't pay for the coaching services of a world class, HOF, Top-5 All Time player the same way you would for Udonis Haslem.."

Yessir you make a great point   *Goes to sleep dreaming about Udonis Haslem Crossing up Jrue Holiday Banking a halfcourt game winner in Game 7 of what has somehow became the NBA Finals Against the 98 Bulls*
"There are examples of teams doing a solid for non-stars.  Why do you think 40 year old Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat rooster?   Ex-Laker's big, Marc Gasol, gets a cushy job as Laker's ""development coach"".  I'm expecting the something similar will happen for Kevon Looney for playing through the playoffs with a broken collarbone. Which led to permanent nerve damage.  It's funny, this year they're not even trying to be subtle. They're straight up buying out contracts and letting players go where they want.  Cavs did Andre Drummond a solid. Pistons did Blake Griffin a solid. Spurs did Lamarcus Aldridge a solid."
I was a ball boy this season. Not sure if this counts but rebounding pregame warmups for Udonis haslem and Dewayne Desmond - the amount f bombs and bitch I heard was incredible lol
Udonis Haslem  HEAT CULTURE!!!  /s
"We‚Äôre putting him in the ‚ÄúUdonis Haslem‚Äù category, he‚Äôs basically an extra assistant coach."
I wonder what Udonis Haslem is gonna tell the Heat at halftime.
Might as well put in Udonis Haslem at this point
"[Magic Johnson]: The Miami Heat need to play better! Specifically, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Coach Spo, Pat Riley, their fans"
"I've always thought if I was to be a NBA player I'd rather be a player like Tony Allen, Udonis Haslem, Collison, etc over being a star. Just being beloved by a whole city with so little pressure in comparison."
"Good like Udonis Haslem, the per36 god"

UDONIS HASLEM
You think Udonis Haslem makes Duncan Robinson hold his pocket at practice?
Udonis Haslem gonna spank Herro and Bam at halftime
BRUH WHERE'S UDONIS HASLEM MAKE IT A TRIPLE THREAT
why don‚Äôt teams just do Hack-a-Shaq to get Giannis off the floor  Have Udonis Haslem be designated fouler
Udonis Haslem is needed.
"The Heat are gonna shock the world in the second half, they‚Äôre gonna unleash Udonis Haslem! 2 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 6 hard fouls!"
"The Heat are gonna shock the world in the second half, they‚Äôre gonna unleash Udonis Haslem! 2 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 6 hard fouls!"
What I flashed back to was years ago when lebron got all that criticism for losing a regular season game because he passed to udonis Haslem who missed an easy open shot. Now you‚Äôre seeing the most important shots of the game being bricked by Wiggins and draymond while curry turns the ball over 6 times and people are like ‚Äûwow steph really carried.‚Äú lol he carried them to 2 straight Ls
Udonis haslem is the goat doing it at 40 LeMickey would never
So I guess we‚Äôre gunna pretend Udonis Haslem wasn‚Äôt instrumental to the team on the court
I‚Äôd be happy just having him in a Udonis Haslem role.  Literally nothing negative to say if Iguodala decides to go back to the dubs
"I say he goes as far as steph goes. And if not, maybe a Udonis Haslem type role when he'll be 35+"
Udonis Haslem obvi
UDONIS HASLEM IS 40 YEARS OLD AND GOT A CONTRACT
"He can be our Udonis Haslem. We'll keep him on the roster until he's 40, in 15 years he can regale the young uns with tales about what it was like to play with Steph, Klay, Dray, and KD, then play 3 minutes and then get ejected."
Have you seen Udonis Haslem tho??!?!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!  48 points 12 rebounds and 12 ejections per 36
Fun thing i noticed: if you go to the player ratings thing on 538 and get rid of the minutes played requirement Udonis Haslem ends up being the most impactful player in the league per minutes played
"Danny Green sets the tone because he has a lot of playoff and championship experience with absolute legends. The sixers haven't been to the finals with Embiid and Simmons. So when Danny Green ""sets the tone"" it's by bringing a championship work ethic and mentality to a team that has fallen short a couple times now.   Just because Embiid and Simmons set the tone on the floor, doesn't mean they do in the locker room. A lot of people underestimate the impact of savvy veterans. There is a reason the Heat are paying a 150 year old Udonis Haslem still. Vets keep locker rooms together. The Danny Greens of the league bring the Ben Simmons' of the league back to earth in the playoffs when shit gets really really difficult."
Word. He better be our Udonis Haslem. This man is a hybrid of both GnGs.
I mean isn't that sorta what Udonis Haslem is doing? Certainly not pumping up any stats but essentially being paid as a player to be a coach (not that I have any problem with that).
"There is no way in hell Udonis Haslem makes the HoF. Love Haslem, but he has no chance."
Udonis Haslem up next
Bruh I thought it was about udonis haslem turning 42
I read the title so incorrectly I thought it said Udonis Haslem and was floored lol
Yall got punked. Udonis Haslem had a better game than Embiid and Simmons
I read 'Unless Harden' as 'Udonis Haslem' and now I feel dumb
"Yea I definitely read ""Udonis Haslem"" lmao I was like what like 25 ppg per 100 minutes?"
"I legitimately thought this was a meme comment.  Like, some Heat fan commenting that Udonis Haslem is 25. Or some Jason Tatum being 12 kind of shit.  What in the actual fuck. I was literally wondering the other day if he would retire soon.   What"
"Nick Young is a bad example. You can totally earn this kind of respect and have this kind of intensity without being an all-time great, though. Think of Udonis Haslem in Miami, for example. He's a legend on the team in his own way, but that's always been half about his ruggedness and attitude. He wasn't nearly the player KG was on the court."
Udonis Haslem gets highly rated by other players but is probably an afterthought for a lot of fans.
"Vince retired at 43. Throughout his 40's season he was much closer to 18-20 MPG than 14.      Udonis just turned 41, and has played 45 games the past 5 seasons combined. (which goes back to him being 36, at which age VC was scoring 13ppg.) He played once this season as a thank you game from the heat, and going back to his age 35 season, has been putting up about 7mpg and 2ppg.     Kevin Willis played til he was 44. He didnt play his age 43 season, played 5 games and 43 minutes at age 44. His other seasons in his 40's he was playing about 10mpg and scoring 3ppg.     And of course neither Haslem nor Willis had the peaks that VC had (tho Willis was a beast for a few seasons in the early 90's for the Hawks). It's not that Vince managed to play til he was 43, its that he had the career he did as a younger player and then managed to continue to keep playing and contribute as much as he did for as long as he did. You don't see many ""star"" players have extended careers like that, its usually your Haslem type role players if anyone. Just to add some context to what has been said."
"Kevin Willis also played till he was like 42. Same with Udonis Haslem. Does that make them all time greats as well? Who cares about ""longevity"" if you're averaging 8ppg in 14 mins off the bench."
"You say that in a league that still has Udonis Haslem on a roster.  And fair enough, I didn't insist that she's NBA-level, only that she could ball in the G-League. Mind you, I started this whole comment chain saying why the WNBA is a joke. Lol."
Heat legend Udonis Haslem vs. anyone.
"Damn, what a good list.  I'd throw in Deandre Ayton, but I also think Kevin Love brings value as a veteran.  Think of him as a less tan Udonis Haslem with some more range."
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
I mean I have several players before I pick Lonzo. Jared Dudley and Udonis Haslem for example
Mavs fans swear it's rigged but outside like a pair of 50/50 calls all of them were correct. Wade was just Harden before Harden and knew how to get to the line. That really doesn't explain how Udonis Haslem put the clamps on Dirk though
That Udonis Haslem
"His close-outs on shooters are fantastic. We all know pump faking a shot is effective tool for an offensive player. But Crowder pump fakes as the defender, getting the offensive player to hesitate pulling the trigger on their jumper. This gives him time to close the gap without committing the cardinal sin of letting the offensive player drive past him.  I think Crowder is exactly the type of dirty work player that every championship team needs (a la Udonis Haslem, or Danny Green). I would argue that it's no coincidence that he's been in the playoffs almost every year of his career (Dallas, Boston, Cleveland, Utah, Miami, and Phoenix).  Great content, OP."
Udonis Haslem.
heat  that culture is so strong they wouldn't trade herro for harden  plus udonis haslem would hate to be his OG anyway üò≥üíØ
Udonis Haslem with Miami
40 year old Udonis Haslem took more shots (2) in the 3 minutes he played this season than Simmons did in the 4th quarters of games 2-7 against the Hawks (1).
"The only other guy I can think of is Udonis Haslem, who I‚Äôm not sure counts as ‚Äúplaying pro ball‚Äù"
"Exactly. Shaq was old by 2010 and a journeyman. Not possible. You could have said Kobe and Pau instead.   If Kobe and prime Lakers MVP Shaq against the Heatles, for sure Udonis Haslem and Chris Bosh would be at the hospital and LeBron would have retired early with a broken shoulder."
Nazreon Reid  Moses Moody  Bol Bol  Udonis Haslem
"&gt;resulting in Hakeem going to the Raptors instead of being allowed to finish his career in Houston  This is one of the best examples how a damn good franchise player would look fucking awful in another team's uniform. Udonis Haslem is nowhere near as good as Hakeem, but I can't imagine how he'd look like in a uniform aside from the Heat."
"That's more a reflection of Jrue than anything else. Jrue never struck me as the type of outspoken guy who could fill a leadership role well.   You don't need to play 40 million dollars to find a good leader and role model. The Miami Heat paid Udonis Haslem the vet min to do that. If I'm the GM of the Wolves I'm not paying anyone 40M to take playing time away from my young guys, fuck up our draft position, and provide the same leadership effect as Kevin Garnett did on his retirement contract."
Udonis Haslem
The Udonis Haslem role
"At this point, I could see Cousins thriving as a rich man's Udonis Haslem: solid veteran presence that's your go-to enforcer, with solid post play and rebounding off the bench, but who can start in a pinch, depending on the match up. Plus, he can stretch the floor on a good night. I think you're correct in him being a 15 minutes a night guy, and one that can be an anchor for a second unit of younger players."
"I mean, LeBron is an ‚Äúaging star,‚Äù so that‚Äôs definitely not the same as washed. I thought Blake Griffin was washed. Kevin Love is washed.  Udonis Haslem is washed. CP3 wasn‚Äôt in that list, he just seemed overpaid"
Perhaps having a 12th man prepared to choose violence is a useful deterrent against similar fuckery? at least show me you‚Äôre genuinely outraged and might throw hands.  I promise you Beverley doesn‚Äôt do this to a team with udonis haslem or Zach Randolph on the roster. Unless he‚Äôs suicidal perhaps
Every team needs a udonis Haslem basically
"I have a bias for loyalty to be honest. Especially a player on a small market team who endured all the losing years knowing that someday the hardships will be rewarded. I‚Äôm not a fan of instant gratification through inorganic superteams that were built by players in their primes calling each other to form a team.  I appreciate the Dirk, Duncan, and Kobe‚Äôs of the league and even Udonis Haslem who is not a star but stayed with 1 team throughout their careers and won a championship."
Mentored by Sam Bowie in a Udonis Haslem role.
Cp3 just needs to take a udonis Haslem role. He slows down the suns pace so much.
I ran into Udonis Haslem at a Toys R Us once
"OP is probably a kid. He doesn‚Äôt get yet that vets are essential for all teams who would want to contend for a title. The vets at least provide the calming presence with their experience if they are beyond their prime years. Not sure why some NBA casual fans don‚Äôt wonder why Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat roster when he barely plays. There‚Äôs no team in the history of the NBA who won with all players at age 27 and below. In fact, no legit GM would construct a team without vets."
"Like a Jared Dudley or a Udonis Haslem, he contributes nothing on the floor but is an Off-Court All-Star"
"no way someone who gets 16 mins a game is the worst in the league, its someone you've never heard of or potentially someone like an antekumpo brother or udonis haslem"
"Damn that‚Äôs crazy. There‚Äôs this old interesting story about DWade getting robbed that he talks about sometimes. When Wade was like a few years in the league he was working out somewhere and someone broke into his car and stole an expensive gold chain. This is the interesting part, Wade calls up Udonis Haslem and tells him what happened. UD said he‚Äôll check it out and apparently a few hours later UD got wades chain back from whoever stole it. UD really runs Miami like that apparently."
"I am aware of this. I mean Phil Jackson was not a stand-out player. But with Ime Udoka, there were no past talks at all that he was a people person or like a mentoring vet like Patty Mills or Udonis Haslem for example. I just found out that Pop brought Udoka in as part of his staff after his playing career so again another coach out of Pop‚Äôs school."
He's Udonis Haslem/Robert Horry.
"&gt; This is why the Heat keep paying Udonis Haslem even though he hasn't been in the rotation for five years. &gt;  &gt; Can contribute more as a ""player"" than as an assistant coach in a lot of respects."
"exactly. I don't know if you watch mma, but this is like someone being a good wrestler in mma, and the commentators joke about adding an -ov to his name. It's like that. It's in good nature. Are there other nations and races of individuals that wrestle just as good? Yes, of course. But that's the running joke and it's not racist.  This is similar. He's in a black city, playing in black teammates, as a young player. This is only his third year. They're embracing him. No outrage was made when Udonis was called haslem-berg.   It's usually white racists(Not talking about Saiser-kose btw, just in general) that want to act like they're experiencing the same hardships as black people and want to use any thing as an example. It's not 1:1 and they know that."
"I'm not white(but I don't expect you to believe that),   In any case, Yes Huerter was playing not like himself, hitting saucy as moves, so I don't see the fault in the nickname. I think people look for issues where there is no issue. Like Kevin Martin saying about culture appropriation because Jeremy lin has dreads and Lin pointed out the hypocrisy that he had Chinese tattoos.  It's not always the same. It'll never be 1:1 the same. No matter how many people cry about ""Oh its double standards"" I just roll my eyes every-time I see that.   When Udonis Haslem was Called [Haslem-berg](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1369827658998161408), you don't see any white racists crying about that."
"This is why the Heat keep paying Udonis Haslem even though he hasn't been in the rotation for five years.  Can contribute more as a ""player"" than as an assistant coach in a lot of respects."

"they'd fix him, calling it now.   udonis haslem would kick in his door at 4am on the first day and pat riley would stand there as haslem and jimmy dragged him out to the beach and spoelstra would make him drive against them on a sand court over and over. they'd do it every day all summer until he could lay up shots with his eyes shut but they'd fucking discipline him"
I still love that Udonis Haslem ended his career by smacking Dwight and getting tossed.
Like udonis haslem
"If you count both players and coaches then this will be the first time since 1990 without Phil Jackson, Robert Horry, Steve Kerr, or Udonis Haslem."
Lebron could probably play a Udonis Haslem type role of locker room leader.
"I would honestly say most of the time you would prefer that. I mean look at Udonis Haslem, he's the prime example. Could the heat have had a better player instead of him for the last 5 or 6 years? Yeah. Would it have helped the team? I don't think so"
Udonis Haslem
I wish Atlanta could sub in Udonis Haslem somehow to smack Dwight one last time.
"Good. Now, keep him there! At least in the FO. Also, bring back JJ Barea as the Mavs' version of Udonis Haslem."
heat culture bro      PG: Tyler Hero   SG: Tyler Hero   SF: Jimmy Butler   PF: Udonis Haslem   C: Bam Adebayo
"Don‚Äôt give a shit at all how they ended up on the Celtics together, the Heat big 3 each signed for like $2M per year less than the max, which is absolutely nothing to any of them, just so they could keep Udonis Haslem, and recruiting people to play in fucking Cleveland is impossible as Bron figured out by wasting 7 years there trying to doing it unsuccessfully. Cry more though about how only your favorite team should be allowed to have a big 3."
"when Udonis Haslem calls KG a ""fake tough guy"" I gotta believe him"
"&gt; Udonis Haslem would still be in the league in 2022  Even though he has already been out a season, Vince playing up until 2020 would have been pretty unbelievable. I remember Dwight Howard called him half man half retired when he was on the Magic lol"
He just did it again. 4 minutes ago he stole the Udonis Haslem post lol
Udonis Haslem at his best &gt; Ben Simmons
Thus proving that Udonis Haslem is the greatest player of all time.
Udonis Haslem is the better shooter
Hakeem and Kobe are my favorite players of all time.  Favorite currently is Udonis Haslem.
"Or Udonis Haslem, who I'm convinced MUST be blackmailing Mickey &amp; Pat."
"Love me some Udonis Haslem, but those were weak picks."
I can see youve hit that dreaded period where no player in the league is older than you are. Right now I only have Udonis Haslem saving me
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
Obviously the GOAT Udonis Haslem
Udonis haslem
I would put Udonis Haslem up there for drawing charges as well. That guy takes great pride in his ability to take a licking and keep on ticking.
"Just get a team with five centers/big guys that can't dribble or pass and you complete this challenge. Udonis Haslem, Cristiano Felicio, DeAndre Jordan, DJ Wilson and my guy Andre Drummond can definitely go 1-81."
PG: Grayson Allen SG: Jarret Culver SF: Kyle Kuzma PF: Udonis Haslem C: Bol Bol
Andre Roberson  Mike Muscala  Aron Baynes  Alen Smailagic  Udonis Haslem
"Andre Drummond, Marc Gasol, Ivica Zubac, Isiah Thomas, Udonis Haslem"
"The dude is basically the Knick's version of Udonis Haslem only he's a decade younger and can still provide some spot minutes.   For all of the intangibles that he brings to the team, it's not a bad contract."
It's both - honestly I'd imagine that Taj is a huge culture guy for the Knicks and could see him transitioning into a Udonis Haslem-like role in the future as Taj ages (dude just turned 36)
"I think a few too many people here are forgetting Udonis Haslem during those years also would‚Äôve been taking his minutes and role. Not taking away from Birdman, but he wasn‚Äôt as useful in different defensive schemes."
"Jokic shows to me a systemic failure of NBA scouts.  So do Brogdon, Udonis Haslem and other players that were drafted low or weren't drafted at all, but were starters within a year."
Is this description satire?  You would get 11-0 by Udonis Haslem unless ur an NBA player or D1 athlete
&gt; I think even I could blow by him and do a reverse layup   You wouldnt be able to score on 53 yr old Udonis Haslem even if he both his arms tied behind his back.
I think we should all just vote Udonis Haslem to the all star game.
"Doc Rivers, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson‚Äôs podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn‚Äôt been disrupted despite Jackson‚Äôs track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren‚Äôt actually Jewish themselves."
"&gt;Special shoutout to Udonis Haslem who is an undrafted member of the 2002 class and still active  If you don't count Haslem since he was undrafted, then the 1998 draft class (Vince Carter) and the 2000 draft class (Jamal Crawford) both outlasted the 2002 draft class. Haslem still being around is crazy, but it's also crazy ho quickly that class was out of the league. Nene was the last guy left by year 16."
Nick Collison  Especially his last few seasons but mans very rarely actually played. Hell I don‚Äôt remember if he was ever actually good. But OKC still retired his number and it feels like everyone who played with him spoke highly of him.  He was the Udonis Haslem of the Thunder
"How many years was Juwan Howard a locker room guy? Kevin Willis, Derek Fisher, Udonis Haslem, and AC Green also come to mind.  I bet the lakers miss the [moral support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxVuySQT-eY) of Robert Sacre."
Apparently udonis haslem
Udonis Haslem would probably be the platonic ideal of this in the modern game.
"For your money, are you taking 29 year old Thanasis or 41 year old Udonis Haslem?"
"Yeah, if Udonis Haslem can get a roster spot and not even sniff the court, then I don't see when Thanasis can't."
Energy player? Most end of bench players are locker room guys and cheering guys like udonis haslem. Energy players usually are 6th-7th man
"Disagree. How quickly we forget he was once top 5 in the MVP race, &amp; crucial to an ECF run (which he was then injured for, &amp; facing Lebron anyway lol).   For that experience, &amp; potential for leadership / mentorship alone, he deserves a roster spot. I.e. if scrubs like Jared Dudley, Udonis Haslem, &amp; others are in the league, former MVP candidate Thomas should easily be lol.   Also, stating a man who‚Äôs been out of the league ‚Äúgenuinely believes‚Äù he‚Äôs starting caliber is not only illogical, but speculative. Do we genuinely believe a guy who‚Äôs out of a job in pro basketball wouldn‚Äôt take any contract &amp; role he could get?  His defense is trash, no disagreement there lol. But that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre signing him for. His offensive is valuable enough, especially in today‚Äôs league. See Kennard, Lou Will, Eric gordon, etc. &amp; that‚Äôs not including the value of his aforementioned experience etc.  Does Thomas deserve a starting spot? No. Does he deserve a spot on a 12-15 man roster? Yep. There‚Äôs easily 2-3 guys out of any team‚Äôs 15 - especially bad teams - where he could fit"
"[Per RotoWorld](https://www.nbcsportsedge.com/edge/basketball/nba/player/28920/udonis-haslem):  &gt;Appearing in his first game of the season, assistant coach (not really) Udonis Haslem was ejected in his first two minutes of action with four points and one rebound vs. Philly.   &gt;He's averaging 54 points per 36 minutes this season and should go No. 1 in all fantasy drafts for the next decade, regardless of format"
"You‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think Udonis Haslem, a guy who knows (and everyone else knows) he‚Äôs not gonna play a single minute all season, is out there busting his ass in training.  He just sits around with his ‚Äúveteran presence‚Äù"
Udonis Haslem is a waste of a roster spot and gets too much respect for no reason.   If he‚Äôs on the team mentoring the younger players why not give him a front office position so he can still do the same.
"Udonis Haslem taking up a roster spot is selfish and honestly a bitch move. There's young kids trying to make it in the league and he's just holding a spot doing nothing. I know everyone talks about how it helps him relate to the players, they take him seriously, etc, but I just disagree"
"Pau Gasol, Luis Scola, Udonis Haslem  would make a great Fiba 3x3 team."
"Lol imagine having to be the guy who tells Heat fans that Haslem isn't allowed to ""play"" anymore.  Imagine being the guy who has to tell Pat Riley that Haslem isn't allowed to ""play"" anymore  Imagine being the guy who has to tell Udonis Haslem isn't allowed to ""play"" anymore üò¨  Man's probably got a lifetime contract at this point."
"I'm legitimately convinced that Haslem is on the team so the coaching staff can point at him and ask the other players ""Are you really going to let old man Udonis out work you!!!'"
"Udonis ""Robert Parish"" Haslem"
Player/Coach Udonis Haslem.
Fun fact:  Udonis Haslem and Lionel Messi both turned pro in the same year. Only one of them has remained a one club man.
Udonis Haslem
"For those who don't know the story:  UD got 5-year/34M offers from the Mavericks and Nuggets in the summer of 2010. He was about ready to leave until Wade stepped in and made it work with Bosh/Bron. UD ultimately signed a 5-year/20M deal to comeback to Miami.   Given the fact he's played 45 games total the last 5 years, and made 13M in that timespan - I'd say this final year(in all likelihood) means the Heat will have officially paid him back for what he lost back then.   [Source](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-udonis-haslem-was-ready-to-leave-miami-heat-in-2010-until-dwyane-wade-intervened/)"
"The year is 2035. Pat Riley, now 100 and wheelchair-bound, watches the corpse of a 64 year old Udonis Haslem run up and down the court for 34 minutes a game.  ""JUST RETIRE"" he yells. ""WE'LL PAY YOU ANYTHING!""   Haslem, bent over and support himself on knees held together with glue and duct tape, looks up with defiant eyes.  ""Never,"" he whispers. ""Miami Heat for life"""
"Can't wait for the tweet 20 years from now  *\[Charania\] Udonis Haslem will return to the Miami Heat on a one-year, $12.6M deal for his 39th NBA season with the franchise, source tells TheAthletic.*"
"Udonis ""Thanos"" Haslem: ""I am inevitable""."
Would the league step in if Haslem was 63 years old and himself and the Heat continued this song and dance? Would there be any limitations set by the league for Haslem at that advanced age? Surely Udonis would want to step onto the court if he was in the league for another two decades just to tell his great-grandchild that he did.
Lou Will is not comparable to Jared Dudley or Udonis Haslem at all wtf. Lou Will contributed last season and played a good amount of minutes. Dudley and Haslem are lucky to get garbage minutes.
"If only Udonis Haslem could have been born a little bit premature, then I would not be older than 100% of the NBA."
Udonis Haslem
He‚Äôs just like Udonis Haslem and Juwan Howard. Instead of being born ready he was born old.
Good for him. I know he‚Äôs like OKC‚Äôs mr thunder like our udonis haslem but as a heat fan I didn‚Äôt like him. Probably a testament to him as a player
At a minimum Benny the Bull should be executed and Udonis Haslem should be mandated to start every game for the Heat next season. Any less isn‚Äôt enough.
"&gt;Heat had Chalmers and Cole Anthony as their key role players.  The disrespect to Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, and to Mike Miller's 45.3% 3 point shooting."
"Nick Collison is really the example you wanna use here? Udonis Haslem will get his jersey retired one day too, guess the Heat are a poverty franchise now if they‚Äôre retiring role players.  We handed Ray Allen‚Äôs number to Giannis. The Nuggets handed Melo‚Äôs number to Jokic. But what, the Bucks and Nuggets are somehow more historically important and successful than the Raptors so they need to retire Bosh?"
"I know good and damn well u didn't say Hakeem lmao. And no Tracy and Vince aren't all-timers  &gt;You said Lowry shouldn't have his jersey retired because he's not an all time great. You fail to realize it's the franchises choice who's jersey they want to retire.  Gee, I didn't know that!  &gt;For reference Udonis Haslem will probably have his jersey retired.   And he shouldn't   &gt;Guys like Rip Hamilton had their jersey retired. There's tons of examples of guys worse than Lowry getting their jersey retired. Your argument makes no sense.  And u think I don't say the same things about them? Why make that assumption?"
"Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Hakeem... That's besides the point. You said Lowry shouldn't have his jersey retired because he's not an all time great. You fail to realize it's the franchises choice who's jersey they want to retire. For reference Udonis Haslem will probably have his jersey retired. Guys like Rip Hamilton had their jersey retired. There's tons of examples of guys worse than Lowry getting their jersey retired. Your argument makes no sense."
"He's made $116M in his 17 years.   I gotta say... if this guy had just re-sign in L.A. the very first time he was a free agent. I'd bet he would have literally doubled his money.   Definitely Mitch &amp; Jim making a dumb move too. I mean I'm glad we had Artest, but he was basically good for 2010 and dropped off pretty hard. I'm always tempted to say that even with the Championship in hand that Ariza was the better player and we would have won 2010 a little easier.   He coulda been an Udonis Haslem type guy for us because since 2010 there was never a reason why he wouldn't be playing in our starting lineup or have the most minutes on the bench. The only time it would have been slightly rough was when we were finding out if Ingram was best at the 2, 3, or 4. But Ariza woulda been pretty much the perfect mentor on the team.   Oh well, maybe he would have wanted to leave for a contender or play in Miami like he said since he's from there and was born in Turks &amp; Caicos.   I definitely would have loved to trade him to the Heatles for all their draft picks."
"I honestly don't care if iguodala doesn't play a minute, I'm still stoked to have him back. he's like our udonis haslem, just helps maintain the culture and instill good values and approaches to the game in our younger players. plus I think it takes a lot of pressure off of our big three to be the only vet leaders in the locker room and to carry on the court at the same time. really glad to have another old man leader presence so that steph/klay/dray and focus a little more of their attention on dominating between the lines"

"If Iggy lands on the Lakers, LA will have four of the top seven oldest active players  1 Udonis Haslem 2 Anderson Varejao 3 Andre Iguodala 4 Carmelo Anthony 5 JJ Redick 6 LeBron James 7 Marc Gasol"
Exactly. He‚Äôs Golden State‚Äôs Udonis Haslem. Draymond gonna take over from him in that role when he gets too old to be productive too. Great guys to police team culture.   I hope Myers &amp; co. Don‚Äôt eff this up.  Bring üëèüèø him üëèüèø back üëèüèø
THANK YOU. I want him on the dubs to fill the Udonis Haslem role. Sit on the bench and be a role model for the young guns
honestly he can not play a single minute and he's still worth the roster spot IMO. leadership and mentoring the young guys goes a long way. takes pressure off the big three to be the main leaders while they're also focusing on carrying on the court as well. would be elated to get him back in the udonis haslem role
"&gt;I said they didn't START getting veterans until like 2012-2013 lol   &gt;   &gt;They started getting guys like Ray and Mike Miller later on.   They had Udonis Haslem from the start. They signed Shane Battier, Mike Miller, and James Jones in 2011 (LeBron's second year in Miami). They signed Ray Allen, Birdman, and Rashard Lewis in 2012.  &gt;They literally relying on a washed Mike Bibby  Bibby played the third-fewest minutes of any Heat player in the 2011 Finals. Only Juwan Howard and Eddie House played less.   &gt;trying guys like Oden in the finals  Such a lie lol. Oden played 1:36 at the end of a 19-point blowout in Game 3 and 1:20 at the end of a 21-point blowout in Game 4. They didn't ""try him out"". He was a human white flag.   &gt;Typical Bulls fan making sht up to make LeBron look bad, like clockwork  This is from further along in the thread, but I thought it was a hilarious criticism for you to make given how you made up a bunch of BS to make LeBron look good."
"Yes, guys like Mike Miller and Juwan Howard and Michael Beasley (not really a broken down vet so much as just bad) and Rashard Lewis and Greg Oden (technically not that old, but definitely broken down) and Joel Anthony and Rony Turiaf and Eddy Curry and Udonis Haslem.  The Heat got nice contributions from Ray Allen (but in the 2014 playoffs he was... not good), Battier (by the 2014 playoffs he was hurt and played like ass), and Chris Anderson (great pickup).    The 2011-2014 Heat were some of the oldest NBA teams in recent times.

The Udonis Haslem Shake
"Udonis Haslem. Apart from a brief stint in France, spent his whole career in Florida, winning three rings along the way."
"I like him too. He really is perfect as a 2nd or 3rd string point guard. I get everyone is trying to get the best players available in the draft, but every year there seems to be a couple of players who get drafted super late or go undrafted that I can see being really sold  role players. Pat Connaghton is one that I remember thinking could be solid and he just did pretty well on his way to a ship. Udonis Haslem, J.J. Barea, and Jose Calderon as well are others that fit the mold. Stars are great, but great role players are nearly as important. Plus when you are undrafted, the expectations are low, so it removes some of the pressure allowing you to play loose."

"&gt;what exactly was so good about luc longley to merit a greater amount of focus?  I might personally rephrase the question as, ""What exactly about Luc Longley warranted *any* amount of focus?"", because from I recall, there was no focus on Longley whatsoever and barely any reference at all, via interview nor film.   And my answer to that would be, ""He was the starting center on a team that won three consecutive NBA championships"". That alone, to me, warrants acknowledgement of existence. In a 10-hour documentary on a team, I'd expect to hear, I don't know, a minute or two of cumulative footage, at worst, that might mention Longley's presence, literally anything to remind viewers that the Bulls actually trotted out five starters every game, not four.   It's hard to think of an ample comparison because the Bulls' run is/was so unique. But I mean, while acknowledging the majority of the focus would be spent elsewhere, you also probably wouldn't run a 10-hour doc on the LBJ-Wade-Bosh Heat without mentioning or showing Udonis Haslem for more than 45 seconds (I'm probably using hyperbole because I haven't seen The Last Dance in a year, I just remember Longley being conspicuously absent in all regards, not just via interview)."

"&gt;Yeah I doubt that the lakers would try do something like that it would be foolish and playing with fire.   I don't know that they will do it, but I think it's pretty easy to get away with. It's a different scale, but a lot of people suspect the Heat did something like that with Udonis Haslem. Then there are also all sorts of legit jobs you can just hand a retired player - coaching staff, consultant, in the front office, commentary, whatever. I'm not saying they'd be dumb enough to put pen to paper on a future agreement, just a verbal acknowledgement of ""all the opportunities"" that would be there for an aging or retired Laker."

I mean Udonis Haslem hasn‚Äôt seen the court and id argue his experience has been crucial for Miami.

"So, he‚Äôs a leader? If on court play is what determines who gets to say what then why is Udonis Haslem one of the most respected players in the league? IT3 put in the work. He‚Äôs been a top player and he‚Äôs already been vocal on acknowledging he‚Äôs not that guy anymore and can be a good locker room vet. LeBron has also said he loves it when guys call him out on his shit cause he likes accountability. Who wouldn‚Äôt want a teammate that expects you to do your job well? You‚Äôre talking out of your ass"
"He is simply not that guy anymore. He is now a 32 year old undersized guard who is at best an average shooter and passer coming back from major injuries. He was always one of the worst defensive players in the league, and now that his efficiency dipped to average/below average, he has no purpose on NBA teams, especially since he doesn't look like he wants to be a veteran mentor √† la Udonis Haslem. IT looked awful last year and I can guarantee that he will look awful this year too if somebody gives him a deal. I know this may sound harsh, but there are a lot of great players in Europe that deserve NBA deals more than him, only way he gets it is because of his past resume, not because of his current level of play."
If Miami can keep doing this for Udonis Haslem surely we can throw him a bone
$40M Udonis Haslem
"I mean, that's the narrative that's been thrown around after the high-profile LeBron, Harden, KD, etc. moves  But once you look past those few examples, you have Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Giannis, Gobert, Embiid, Marcus Smart, KAT, all guys who have been on their teams for quite a long time and/or have signed long contract extensions that will likely keep them at the same team for several years.  That's just off the top of my head. Tim Duncan and Kobe only retired what, 5 seasons ago? And Nowitzki in 2019.  Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat's roster.  And the NBA has been incredibly cold and cutthroat at times in other eras.  Jerry Krause cut Phil Jackson loose from the Bulls after he won 6 championships. The Bulls also locked Scottie Pippen into an incredibly low-value contract and refused to renegotiate when the salary rules changed the year after his contract was signed.  And players forcing trades happened in other eras too: Dominique Wilkins refused to play in Utah and forced a trade.  Stephon Marbury demanded a trade out of Minnesota when he didn't get along with KG. Kareem demanded a trade to L.A. because he thought Milwaukee was too small of a stage for him.  Ultimately I don't actually think the NBA is fundamentally very different for the vast majority of players.  There have always been top players who used their leverage over teams, and there have always been teams who didn't look out for their players unless it was convenient.  The main difference now is that it's all happening on social media and everyone's *constantly* talking about it."
"he can‚Äôt but he‚Äôs only be there for his high basketball IQ, at best, he‚Äôd be another Udonis Haslem, minus the ejections"
"Ohh lol. I see what you mean  They aren‚Äôt gonna buy him out because his contract is massive. What‚Äôs the biggest buyout in NBA history? Multiply that by 2 and that‚Äôs prolly how much Rockets would have to pay  I think what Rockets just want Wall to be a $40M dollar Udonis Haslem. They do not want to buy him out (unless he gives back money) and they don‚Äôt want to play games. When you put it that way it does sound like a hostage situation lol  At this time, Wall will remain in Houston unless someone trades for him"

"Look, the Heat were no joke. Wade vs Kobe was a legit discussion. I totally agree with you - he should be first ballot hall of Fame, and this was near his peak. On top of that, it was a great team of young players (young Udonis Haslem!) and solid vets. Shaq was still a problem. GP could still play. I've got no problem with the Heat. I'll admit I wasn't a fan of the Lebron era, but that was mostly because of Lebron. Man, I was rooting for you down the stretch in 2017. (was that an OK peace offering?) That said...   NBA playoff series are typically pretty close. It doesn't take much to swing a series.The way fouls were called in games 5 and 6 were a travesty. Wade was getting calls for fouls on players who were near him. At the other end, GP is holding Jason Terry so much he is literally untucking his jersey, and nothing. No call. It was just so blatantly unbalanced. It's not like the Heat sucked, but the refs and/or Stern had their thumbs on the scale for that series.   Just to be clear, I'm not a huge Mavs fan. I really like Dirk (seems like a goofy fun dude, and an amazing scorer), but I think Cuban is obnoxious, and the sexual harassment/ toxic culture stuff is appalling.   I've been watching the NBA between the those Lakers series in 2000 and 2002 ( I do , 2006,"

I will never understand why he was projected so high."

‚ÄúSomething like Udonis Haslem I‚Äôll never leave my heat‚Äù
"Jersey retirement is special, and though you don't need to be a big star, you need to be something special.   The bottom line is, the Grizz have only one conference finals appearance and four playoff series wins, which is not much.   Some teams hang conference titles and even division titles because that is all they have to hang.  Teams like the Lakers and Celtics don't bother hanging those up: They save that space for championships.    Jersey retirements are much the same.   There are cities/teams who have NO jerseys retired.   Z-Bo and Tony Allen will be the first for Memphis.   I get when a team wins a title, like Detroit say, and they retire the role players numbers on that because they helped win a title. So they got Vinnie Johnson up there.   And sometimes you get guys who played their entire career with a team, even if they didn't win a title (like Stockton and Malone), and usually, those dudes were All-NBA talents!  That said, you may see a role player, like Udonis Haslem, secure a jersey in the rafters because he has played with one team his entire career, and has contributed to three championships.  &amp;#x200B;  But Tony Allen... special player, hard worker, but not the kind of guy you expect to see get a jersey retried.   He didn't play his entire career in Memphis. He didn't win anything in Memphis. He has not All-Star appearances. Not All-NBA teams. A handful of All-Defensive selections, yes, but his best seasons were likely in Boston, where he did win a championship, and where he played only one season les than he did in Memphis, and you'd better believe there is no way Tony Allen is getting a jersey retirement there unless he ends up in their front office, like Danny Ainge, and does something special.   &amp;#x200B;  I mean, Ainge played 7.5 seasons in Boston (more than Allen did in Memphis), made the All-Star team one, won two titles as a player, then built the title winning team as a GM in 08 and put their rebuild in fast forward, and he STILL doesn't have his jersey retired there.   &amp;#x200B;  So people scratching their heads about this and questioning it have a point.   &amp;#x200B;  My position... hey... if the franchise wants to, go ahead. He busted his ass off, I'm happy for him.   But... this is not common practice in the league.   Let's take the Hawks. They have a HUGE fan favorite in Spud Webb, played with them for six or seven years until they traded him (twice actually).  Won the dunk contest... fans loved him. Not in the rafter.   Kevin Willis? All-Star team, All-NBA, played there for a decade, was one of the league's best rebounders... no jersey. Doc Rivers, 7 or 8 seasons... All-Star appearance. No jersey.   And I don't think it's wrong to not retire jerseys for those guys.   But if guys like Tony Allen are going to get their numbers retired... guys who were often simply rotation players/role players, on teams that didn't win anything... that's a pretty low bar.   Tim Hardaway in Golden State, and even Mitch Richmond.   Dennis Rodman in Chi-Town (which is a travesty). Horace Grant even. Toni. None of them got a jersey up there, all of them huge parts of championship teams.   Indiana? Jerome O'Neal. Rik Smits. Antonio Davis. Dale Davis. Guys who made HUGE contributions to their best seasons and who who played with the team for a long time.   Toronto hasn't retired anybody's number.   &amp;#x200B;  So... we look across the league, and I don't think there is any player that Tony Allen would rank ahead of. It's a bit of a low bar to set for a jersey retirement."
"Damn, Udonis Haslem is a massive outlier here."
We didn't think Udonis Haslem would even make it this far but here we are
Oh yeah I do not think that Udonis Haslem will make it that long in this league.
Udonis Haslem is the 9th oldest active player in NBA history. He'd need about a year and a half to pass Vince Carter for 4th and over four more years to reach the number one spot.
He‚Äôs a rich man‚Äôs Udonis Haslem ahahah
"Dude, you should know as a Lakers fan that Kobe's final contract was basically a thank you and lifetime achievement award from the front office for being a Lakers legend.  He was NOT worth that contract for his play on the court, and everyone knew it at the time.  That's an example of front offices overpaying for good will and to reward loyalty.  Another example is the Heat with Udonis Haslem, who took a big pay cut to make the big three happen, he is still earning checks off that shit."
Tbf there are plenty of players that dislike Dwight lmfao  Callback to Udonis Haslem only having two minutes of play last season and using it to get ejected for getting into Dwights face
Nice veteran to have but he ain‚Äôt no Udonis Haslem or Shane Battier.
"I just don't get it because you can have an unlimited number of minimum contract players... The Heat keep saving a roster spot for Udonis Haslem. I guess the Lakers wanted a 15th man who was younger? Doesn't really make sense to me.   They would've been better off buying out Gasol if that's the case, use his spot for a younger dude. Dudley was very valuable imo."
Udonis Haslem.
Lebron rehabbed at Dudley's house he definitely cared. Dudley should've been the udonis haslem of the Lakers imo.
"But I thought it was LeGM calling the shots?  On a serious note, they should've kept him. There's a difference between being a regular vet to being a Udonis Haslem type of vet which I think Dudley is (cue Brooklyn playoff series)."
"Honestly, it can be earned even if you don't play during games. There is a reason teams look for Jared Dudley/Udonis Haslem locker room presences, or players who are like additional coaches. They may not contribute any real minutes during the playoffs/season, but can be incredibly valuable to team chemistry, or just practice in general. It is stuff fans don't often see but really valuable to teams."

"I'm pretty sure guys like Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Udonis Haslem, Markieff Morris already brought toughness."
Udonis haslem
"I mean, Udonis Haslem was never super great, but he was a starter for many years and now is arguably the worst non-2 way player in the NBA.  He gets closer to 'worst' than pretty much anyone here, while being good enough to be a starting 10 PPG player 15 years ago."
whatever Udonis Haslem says it is
Udonis Haslem
"Probably Haslem, but we love ‚Äòem so it‚Äôs all good lol and the 15th guy on the bench rarely contributes anything anyways. At least Udonis is essentially an assistant coach"
Udonis Haslem is basically an extra coach so him. Thanasis isn‚Äôt even the worst player on his team.
Who on the Hawks is ~~stopping~~ sparring with Udonis Haslem?
I'm just here for Udonis Haslem
Who on the Hawks is stopping Udonis Haslem
That's the face one has when Udonis Haslem waves everyone off and you're the one on one defender.

Udonis Haslem
"Udonis Haslem has gotten to play for his hometown team for almost 2 decades, won 3 championships and will probably have his jersey retired &amp; get a nice job in the organisation once he retires. Seems like a great career for an undrafted role player"
"I got screwed out of a manager position last year. The exec gave it to someone else because the dept that they managed was being eliminated, but he completely lacked the technical knowledge. Man didn't know shit. The exec lied to me and I'm guessing it's because he was too much of a pussy to tell me his plan, and/or he was worried I'd quit so he lied so that I would stick around and keep training this guy.  Once shit hit the fan, I told the exec and my boss that the plan was stupid. I asked to be let go or transferred. I got transferred to a dept that is very low stakes, compared to before where I was always needed. It's like comparing the NBA to the G League, if that. Still kept my salary, so while I didn't get a bump in pay, I got a huge reduction in duties. It's extremely boring though, but whatever. I'm just collecting checks from this stupid corporation like Udonis Haslem."
"Ah yes, the Udonis Haslem statline"
Udonis Haslem aka the goat
"He does have a lot of room to grow, and he could easily be worth 11 mil in 2023-2025, but there is a lot of risk there that he ends up injured, not getting much better, or otherwise don't justify the money in the last 2 years.  But, there are a lot of good reasons to believe in him.  Maybe management knows something we don't and thinks he will be a top 75 player by 2023, at which point 11 mil a year is theft.  Personal relationships with a team can still mean something too, but they are hard to value.  Hell, there are a few guys that are kept around pretty much only because of intangibles and what they do for team culture, like Udonis Haslem."
and Udonis Haslem is Michael Vick      Wait no
"I met Udonis Haslem at a fan meet and greet back in the day. He was very cool and funny. I told him my stepdad played football at UF and he was one of our favorite players. I was wearing a Wade jersey and he cracked a joke about that but I deserved it. Seeing the impact he has in our city, the franchise and the NBA means even more now. It was meant to be quick handshake, autograph and keep it moving but he talked to me for a few minutes and it was tremendous."
Udonis Haslem and his dawgs
"Question from NBA.com‚Äôs GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix ‚Äì 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers ‚Äì 14%  3. T.J. McConnell, Indiana ‚Äì 10%  4.

Na. I don't think guys looking for glory would want to go to udonis Haslem. Oh reason why he still around us that Miami is a classy organization and they are repaying his loyalty for those LeBron years and the following season. He's a decent role player but had many flaws in his game even during his prime.
"Udonis Haslem. Whether or not it‚Äôs a right answer, dude has worked hard enough to have his name mentioned"
With competition as cosmic as Udonis Haslem? None
"As a longtime fan of the NBL the main thing that bugs/baffles me about Ben is that his dad was one of the toughest, hardest-working players in the NBL (for the Americans who don't know Dave Simmons, think like a much better Udonis Haslem type), and Ben is well, Ben.  Although same thing seemed to happen with Bruce Bolden and Jonah (dad hard working pro, son definitely not) so who knows."
"From Wikipedia:  &gt; Attles has been on the Warriors' payroll in one capacity or another for 60 years, the longest uninterrupted streak of any person for one team. He is one of the last living members of the franchise who dates to their time in Philadelphia.  People joke about Udonis Haslem and the Heat‚Äôs ties, but Al took being a franchise ‚Äòlifer‚Äô to the next level"
I live in daily fear that Udonis Haslem will retire. The only active player still older than me.      Pau made every situation he was in better. Loved that Spain team. Congrats Pau
The age gap between Udonis Halsem and Michael Jordan (17 years) is smaller than the age gap between Haslem and Jayson Tatum (18 years).
Udonis Haslem is like 42 so not suprising
Udonis Haslem averaged 48 ppg per 36 minutes this year. UD40&gt;&gt;&gt;MJ
Nah its 100% Udonis Haslem
The old guy is Udonis Haslem
Udonis Haslem is still in the league?
"Dude left Lebron James and a team that won the hardest ring to ever win behind, that‚Äôs a bit irrational I‚Äôd say. I see local broadcasters always show the ‚Äúlongest tenured player for a single team‚Äù chart that shows steph, klay, Dray, and Udonis Haslem on it and they always talk about how loyal they are, but like, as long as those three play together gsw will always at least be a contender, why the hell would anybody want to leave that? Loyalty is easy if you‚Äôre on a winning team, unless you are Kyrie"
Im confused i thought Udonis Haslem said Miami was his city.  Guess he was wrong
What's the worst rings team you could build with current players?  PG: Jeremy Lin  SG: Patrick McCaw  SF: Mamadi Diakite  PF: Udonis Haslem  C: JaVale McGee  We're looking at 11 rings with playoff time experience that would probably struggle to win even 1 game
Heat fan talking about fanfics when all they've been doing since the incident is fanfic about the beastly Udonis Haslem lmfao
"So, did we get any footage of Udonis Haslem fighting the Jokic brothers?"
"Udonis Haslem ends the game with 7 high fives, 3 claps and 1 empty threat. Jokic king of Miami"
All that udonis haslem fanfic is going to be put to the test
"In other news, the Heat are starting Udonis Haslem"
"Kurt Thomas.... My memory tells me Udonis Haslem is a good comparison. Dirty work, good locker guy.  Mike James.... Didn't he randomly average 20ppg one year? Nothing too outstanding about his game that I remember. Small guard, quick but not lightning, ok shot but not great. Earl Watson but better scoring potential. I might be selling him short"

Lebron could literally have a Udonis Haslem role and he'd still get voted in as an all star

Udonis Haslem.
4 and 5 in 10 mins is not unproductive      &gt; theres no reason to act like he didnt use to be good lmfao  I'm not. I'm saying the man averaged a double-double **last season** and people are talking about him like he's Udonis Haslem.
What? I just linked the thing I was talking about in my first comment. You're the one finding comments from a week and a half ago to defend Udonis Haslem in the replies on lmao.
Udonis Haslem cackles and hobbles out for his 35th season in 2036.
"Udonis Haslem still being in the league is disrespectful to actual elite guys who earned their really long stints with one team in the league. If he actually hangs on, i genuinely hope the entire Heat roster gets wiped out so they need the slot and have to waive him. The idea of Dirk Nowitzki having to share his record with Haslem should have *every* basketball fan offended."
"You don't have to be even remotely good to be a locker room leader. If you had to, Udonis Haslem would've been out of Miami a long time ago.  Why are you so pressed about this, of all things?"
"I want Julius Randle to play like 2021 Udonis Haslem in the playoffs every year.  That‚Äôs what he gets for playing like prime Dirk against us last regular season which made everybody pick Knicks in 5.   The satisfaction I got from Julius Randle slander during and after that series really was a highlight of my year. Bing fucking bong.   (Really though that‚Äôs just my petty side, Julius Randle is a hard worker and cool dude lol)"
lol quit it. even his teammates will now have to look after him more because he has tendencies to erupt like that. how's that great for the team you need the guy to play on the court. maybe do that when he's 40 like Udonis Haslem
"Miami Heat -- 1988  Udonis Haslem (elementary school, 1988)"
Miami Heat: Udonis Haslem  Lmao
Lol Udonis Haslem
"according to Kendrick Perkins, Udonis Haslem, James Johnson, PATRICK BEVERLEY, Montrezl Harrell and Pops Junior Tucker"
I'm assuming one of them is Udonis Haslem which means it's really only 10
His basketball IQ and mentorship will keep him around way past his ability to play. Think udonis haslem with a little less passion but way smarter
I mean he could definitely be an Udonis Haslem type who comes off the bench 5 minutes a game and shoots a few corner threes. He could do that until he's 50. lol
I think it's more likely Udonis Haslem is still playing in 2030
"Udonis Haslem is a geriatric mascot at this point, wouldn‚Äôt help us at all"
the real highlight is the shocking fact that udonis haslem is actually playing and grabbed the rebound to start off the clip
Udonis Haslem is 41 years old and has a block at the rim and a charge drawn
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."

"Breaking: To justify non-Heat fans complaining about Udonis Haslem taking a roster spot on the Heat, he now takes a roster spot on every other team as well"
"https://www.gq.com/story/udonis-haslem-miami-heat-culture  I know it‚Äôs a bit of a puff piece for Haslem, but this article says a lot about why he‚Äôs still around. He‚Äôs worth more to Spo as a reinforcer of team culture from within than the upside of that last roster spot"
"Udonis ""Bobby Bonilla"" Haslem"
Don't talk about Udonis Haslem like that
Udonis Haslem
"The year is 2045. Pat Riley, now 100 and wheelchair-bound, watches the corpse of a 64 year old Udonis Haslem run up and down the court for 34 minutes a game.  ""JUST RETIRE"" he yells. ""WE'LL PAY YOU ANYTHING!""   Haslem, bent over and support himself on knees held together with glue and duct tape, looks up with defiant eyes.  ""Never,"" he whispers. ""Miami Heat for life"""
Brother 41 Udonis Haslem would give you the business and beat you 21-0 in a 1v1 and he would do that to every single person that you play pickup with.
"Idk about a Slovenian league, I thought I remember hearing about him playing in a euro league of some kind after the Olympics, I might be wrong about that. But what excuse does any professional basketball player have to be rusty? It may take time for performance to stabilize to a reliable level but that‚Äôs not necessarily the same thing as being rusty. I would be worried if one of the best players in the world, at 22 years old, was truly rusty to begin the season. I would understand if udonis haslem was rusty, luka shouldn‚Äôt be rusty."
Udonis Haslem play extended minutes
"Ah yes, the refs that forced Udonis Haslem into minutes after putting 3 fouls on dedmon and bam were on OUR side lmao"
How aren‚Äôt the lakers blowing us up when Jimmy is hurt and we playing 150 year old Udonis Haslem‚Ä¶??????
"Heat‚Äôs depth worse than I thought if they gotta play Udonis Haslem, Caleb Martin and gave Vincent"
Udonis Haslem is literally SEVERAL years older than me
"Eh, he could be a Draymond-type player that can facilitate and play defense, but he still seems to want to be a LeBron-type player without putting in the work. He still seems to shut down and pout if he isn't ""the guy"" on offense, even though he can't shoot and won't try. He needs some actual accountability if he wants to improve or he needs to change his mind about being ""the guy"" and specialize as an elite 3rd option/shutdown defender.   I do think he has been coddled a bit too much by the 76ers org. Like, I don't think it would work at this point, but imagine if he came up in the Miami Heat system where he gets his ass beat from the organizational level all the way down to Udonis Haslem in the gym. If his mentality was better, he could reach his potential as an MVP player."
Udonis Haslem
Udonis Haslem
maybe not but it‚Äôs stupid either way. guy above definitely had hates the Heat though. ‚ÄúGuess that‚Äôs what Heat culture does to you‚Äù is extremely salty for some reason. Calling out Udonis Haslem of all people is a red flag too.
Udonis Haslem can't be overlooked.
"Star players are supposed to be smart enough to not get into stupid shit like that.  That's why you get bench guys to be the tough guys.  There's a reason you never see Lebron out fighting people, or KD, or whoever.  Why do you think Udonis Haslem is still playing?  I promise you it's not for his basketball skill lol.  ---  Also let's get back to the original point.  You agree it's worse.  I said he got a worse punishment because his actions were worse.  Seems straight forward considering you agree with the original point."
Udonis Haslem is a real one.
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections.

Y‚Äôall idolize Dwyade Wade and Udonis Haslem. Do you think Wade is a garbage human for elbowing Lance Stephenson in the head blindside? Or kicking sessions in the groin? I could go on
Butler and Udonis Haslem vs the Jokic Brothers would be the stiffest tag match that didn‚Äôt involve the Road Warriors
Udonis Bader Haslem
I‚Äôm confused if you are arguing with me or against me lol. I think the NBA can‚Äôt really step in and force a team to use certain players on their roster. I just think like who gets to judge what‚Äôs best for a team- the team or the league? And if so what‚Äôs to say it has to stop at John wall? Wouldn‚Äôt this allow the league to force Udonis Haslem to play more in Miami? Or what about minutes per game? Hey luka you need to play at Least 39 minutes a night. See it doesn‚Äôt work. Nba shouldn‚Äôt be able to make a team use players certain ways.
"Everyone knows the All Star votes were meant to troll. So I'll be voting for him daily, just for the lulz. Along with James Wiseman, Udonis Haslem, Russell Westbrook, Tim Hardaway (Sr), LiAngelo Ball, Hasheem Thabeet, Anthony Bennett, Ben Simmons and DeMarcus Cousins."
"As Dwyane Wade‚Äôs Utah Jazz visit, Udonis Haslem reflects on goal of Miami Heat ownership stake  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Nov 06, 2021 at 11:00 AM  MIAMI ‚Äî It is a characterization that comes off as conflicted, the Miami Heat on consecutive Saturdays playing Dwyane Wade‚Äôs . . . Utah Jazz.  For Udonis Haslem, the plans are more linear when it comes to going from Heat playing career to an NBA ownership suite.  ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm happy for Dwyane,‚Äù Haslem told the Sun Sentinel ahead of Saturday night‚Äôs game against the Jazz at FTX Arena. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs weird that he‚Äôs connected to the Utah Jazz.‚Äù  But, Haslem said, also laudable and impressive how Wade has moved into his Jazz ownership stake, the two having long spoken of taking their basketball visions beyond the court.  ‚ÄúThe plan was always to not pigeonhole yourself to just be a coach or whatever everybody else says you should do,‚Äù Haslem said. ‚ÄúDo what you feel is best for you. Do what you feel you deserve. And do what you feel you‚Äôve earned. So for Dwyane and myself, we‚Äôve always talked about being bigger than just basketball player, than just coaches.‚Äù  And, yes, soon enough, once his player career is over, Haslem has visions of an ownership stake with the Heat.  ‚ÄúEven with so much going on in my life, this organization would be a top priority, a major priority for me,‚Äù Haslem, 41, said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I can be a part of this and not focus on moving the needle. I think everything that I‚Äôve been about these last couple of years has been focused on moving the needle, has been from a position of ‚ÄòHow can I impact winning without playing?‚Äô Well, you see how I impact winning without being on the court.  ‚ÄúEven in an ownership role, I would still take that same approach. Just because I‚Äôm not on the basketball court doesn‚Äôt mean I want to be disconnected and not impact winning. I just want to be just as hands on and just as connected as I am now. For me, I think it‚Äôd be a great opportunity. Because when you think of the Miami Heat, when you think of Miami, you already think of me now. To have an ownership position and be the face in the community, it‚Äôd be great.‚Äù  Then there are the finances. Haslem has earned in excess of $67 million over his 19 seasons. Wade, by contrast, earned nearly $200 million in NBA salary, let alone substantial ongoing endorsements. For a franchise valuated in excess of $2 billion, even a one-percent stake would require $20 million.  For now, ownership is the province of Micky Arison and son Nick Arison. To Haslem, there easily could be room for another spot at the table, especially for a lifelong South Florida resident."

"How is it false?   Derrick Rose ($5.5 million), Joakim Noah ($3.1 million), Taj Gibson ($1.2 million). That's a total of $9.8 million in salary.  Mike Miller ($5 million) and Udonis Haslem ($3.5 million) is $8.5 million.  They would have had to take $433,000 less each on their first year to go to Chicago instead.  The Bulls needed to create cap space for the third guy, but even GarPax probably isn't too incompetent to move a 25-year old Luol Deng and a 2nd year James Johnson to get there."
