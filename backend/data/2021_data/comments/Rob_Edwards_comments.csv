"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"Rob is good Theis isn’t a bench player he’s a starter. Our bench consists of Teague, Semi, Nesmith, Grant, Rob, Green, Edwards, Romeo and PP.  I like PP he’s already a good bench piece. Langford is alright but still that is not anywhere close to a good bench. That TPE is necessary or a very good bench piece."
"Eh I dunno, Rob and Grant Williams have both been pretty good for us, and both are still quite young. They're not gonna be all-stars, but I think they'll develop into solid rotation players and potentially starters. Semi's been disappointing for most of his time here, but this year he's actually been pretty good.   Edwards is not a good basketball player lol"
"All I'm saying is that the NBA's definition for close contact comes from the CDC, which it seemed a lot of people didn't know. To your point, they've decided that: 1. Games don't meet that standard, which probably means that practices don't either. 2. Mask-wearing is also relevant (Carsen Edwards was in a car with Rob Williams along with Grant and TT, but since he was the only one with a mask, he doesn't have the same quarantine).  Given those parameters, yeah maybe no one else will have to quarantine. You can totally disagree with those decisions, I probably do too. All I was pointing out is that the NBA's been consistent with their close contact definition because a lot of people seemed confused at how gameplay didn't qualify."
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
"oh boy, another Celtic denier....Nesmith - zero contribution thus far - Pritchard - seems like a capable NBA backup PG, Bane - could have helped them a ton this year, but they traded him - langford - garbage, Thybulle - again, could have helped them, but traded for Carson Edwards - who has contributed nothing  Grant Williams - has played out of necessity, but is a very average bench player, Rob Williams - could be useful, not sure why he doesn't play more - Yabusele - zero NBA contributions - Zicic - same - RJ Hunter - same.  Ojeleye - good 2nd round pick.  James Young, 17th overall pick from the Marcus Smart draft - zero NBA contributions.  Happy now?  Yes, he drafted Tatum and Brown, and Rozier and Smart were good picks as well.  Would you rather have Thybulle and Bane, or Edwards and whatever they got for Bane?  Langford hasn't shown anything."
"Kyrie (traded players plus pick that became Sexton) and Horford left for nothing. Hayward S&amp;T got us the TPE. The two valuable picks we had left were the Kings and Grizzlies but they both exceeded expectations those years and landed us two picks at 14 (Langford &amp; Nesmith). The rest of our picks were late first rounders and seconds (PP, Rob, Grant, Edwards). We’re in a rough patch which is partially due to the fact it looks like Ainge was trying to both compete and develop our young guys which is very difficult to do if not impossible when you have this many young guys."
In the short term yea. Eventually all these draft picks we're going to have to see minutes to play themselves into a roster spot or establish trade value. Rob has really shined and Pritchard has been solid. Romeo's been hurt and Nesmith hasn't been good enough to break into the rotation. Semi Ojeleye has established his ceiling and Grant Williams so so improvement is still TBD. Edwards and Waters are pretty much not NBA level players and Fall is super situational.
"I’m really hoping the new rating system they used this year is going to bring better players back into the dunk contest. And having former dunk contest champions as judges instead of musicians and actors should help too.  Next year I want a dunk contest with: Edwards, Lavine, Zion, Ja, Gordon, + airplane mode and ideally 2 more top tier guys. Give us a damn show. Get on Twitter or some shit and put it in their heads now.  If they HAVE to get “big names” in for judges make it Vince Carter, Nate Rob, or even Kilgannon. Dudes that would actually know how to judge it right, plus two of them are contest champs and the other one easily could have been the GOAT. If people like Kendrick Lamar are judges in the future players aren’t going to take it serious."
"definitely agree w this. Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Kemba, Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Rob and TT are all undersized for their position, they need to get a real big that can actually move his feet (sorry Tacko)"
"You make it sound like we picked Anthony Bennett and shit. We have had very low lottery picks except for Tatum, who is the best player from that draft.  Romeo had been injured but he looked great last night, with more consistency he could become a very low end starter or great 6th/7th man. Nesmith is also looking  like a pretty good pick. We didn’t have a lottery pick 2018 but we selected Rob Williams pretty deep and he’s been pretty good for us, except for injuries. PP also a deep pick that has panned out.  We scored on Smart in 2014, we scored on Terry on 2015, we scored on Jaylen in 2016 but most of those picks around then sucked besides those three. Since then, I’d say the only pick I’ve been super disappointed in is Carsen Edwards. Semi was great for a second round pick and I think Grant Williams has a little more to show, I think we’ll change our tune about him in the future."
"One of these isn’t really his fault (Hayward left and he got all he could out of it in the trade exception), and two weren’t even bad (Kemba was an all star starter for us, we have a center in Rob Williams).   The only one that’s bad is the Thybulle and Edwards, but tbh losing a role a end of first round isn’t the end of the world."
"You clearly don’t watch the Celtics. Al Horford hasn’t been on our team for two seasons. Romeo played in 11 games that Jaylen did, Rob Williams played low minutes until the trade deadline and then got injured not too long after.   Our defense as a whole sucked and we had 37 different starting lineups. It’s very hard to build defensive chemistry and defensive mistakes all around become more frequent when you’re starting guys like Tremont Waters, Javonte Greene, Grant Williams, Semi, Wagner, Carsen Edwards, and Kornet.  He’s been a good defender in a higher stakes setting of the playoffs. In the last two years he’s had a better dbpm than Steph, Capela, Paul George, Gobert, Middleton, and Klay. He had more defensive wins last year than Butler or Bam despite playing fewer minutes and games. Jaylen has flaws on defense but I think you’re going too far."
"Throwing shit at the wall   East  1. Milwaukee: Despite winning a championship, Giannis, Middleton and Jrue go full all gas, no breaks next year and gun for 65ish wins and the 1 seed in the East. Love the Portis re-sign.   2. Brooklyn: Battle injuries like they did last year, but still prevail as the most dangerous team in the league.   3. Boston: Ime Udoka brings much needed cohesion to a C’s team with a lot of firepower. Jay’s + Rob Will stay healthy. Schroeder guns for 6moy.   4. Atlanta: After a rocky first 10 games and everyone questioning how legit the young Hawks are, they explode back. One of Reddish or Huerter gets dealt at the deadline.   5. Miami: Pretty significant drop off in win column from top 4 to here. Heat play hard, but it’s not pretty. Robinson underperforms.   6. Philadelphia: Simmons situation leaks into season. A lot of turmoil. Embiid’s health is a big question. Maxey takes a big step.   7. Indiana: Have a sturdy season led by Carlisle. Warren and LeVert play 65+ games each.   8. Washington: The Wiz outlast New York and Chicago in the play-in. Washington has multiple 6moy candidates.   Other East  Chicago barely misses out. Derozan contract quickly becomes bad, fit turns out to be atrocious.   Cleveland (for no other reason that I plan on hammering the Over for their season win total) takes a step forward.   Charlotte is everyone’s favorite bad team.   West (In general has a pretty down year)  1. LAL: Hate this team with a passion (not Russ &amp; Me7o) so it’s only right. Spacing is a legit issue but the defense is still top notch. Kent Bazemore tries to fight Trevor Ariza at some point.   2. Phoenix: CP3 slows down, but the rest of the team comes to play after slipping in the Finals. Ayton MIP finalist.   3. Utah: Same ole Utah, nothing too crazy. One of Ingles/Bogdonavic gets dealt at the deadline.   4. Denver: Jokic keeps everyone in awe. Porter Jr. never takes that step everyone expects him to with Murray out. Nuggets make a move for Dame.   5. New Orleans: FUCK YOU DONT CARE. Na but Zion and BI take over, Zion comes back and shocks everyone on defense. New back court + defensive depth is a huge strength. Willie Green for COY. Nickeil finishes top 5 MIP.   6. Dallas: Solid year, Luka wins scoring title. Jury is out on Kidd, he and Luka fight a lot. Porzingis bounces back and plays 60ish games. Team defense gets really bad though. Lot of shootouts.   7. LAC: Interesting year for the Clips. They meddle around .500 but are that random team every year that wins all its close games but gets shredded by lottery teams. Terrence Mann has the greenest of lights. Kawhi returns.  8. Minnesota: Now we’re in the ugly. T-Wolves and their fans don’t give a shit though, playoffs baby. Edwards and KAT become unstoppable. DLo doesn’t get in the way. Defense is close to non-existent, but enough energy from Pat Bev keeps the young team engaged enough to go .500.   Golden State: I’m gonna get ripped apart for this but I don’t see the hype. Curry is fuckin amazing, but I think we see a really broken down Klay. Draymond replicates last two years. Youth isn’t what it needs to be. They come up short as KAT gives Draymond and Wiseman absolute hell in the battle for the 8th spot in the play in. Pat Bev gets a clutch block on Curry and the internet folds inwards.   Other West   Portland is horrible after Dame literally sits out (I 25% believe this) and gets traded East (plz). CJ gets dealt. Powell gets the green light to shoot 25 times a game.   Kings finish as the 9th seed but Walton fucks it up and gets knocked out by Curry and the Warriors.   Memphis = Charlotte West  Houston starts 5-0 and finishes with another top 5 pick."
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"I agree that the Celtics front office needs to be aggressive while being lucky enough to have Tatum and brown on the team. That being said, over the last 3-4 years, I don’t think they’ve made any particularly terrible moves (at that time), aside from maybe not trading rozier and mook in 2019 prior to their FA departure.   Trading for kyrie was absolutely the right move even if it didn’t work out. Same with signing and then later not resigning gordon and Al. Both those guys got overpaid. The Kemba signing was a bit reactionary to kyrie, al, and rozier leaving but at the time, Kemba was coming off all nba selection and had been an Ironman for the hornets. Just shitty injury luck with him and Gordon.  Now that being said, I think the Celtics front office has done a terrible jpm with the draft since we got Tatum. Romeo has all the talent in the world but can’t stay healthy after 3 years and grant Williams is a bonafide scrub. Nesmith and Pritchard look like they’ll develop into solid role players (spot starters) and rob williams is really fucking good but like Romeo, can’t really stay healthy. They also traded away FRPs in salary dumps and for Edwards and I think those failures are primarily the reason for the “talent drain” over the last couple years.  I do like our young core though. Smart Brown Tatum Williams Pritchard Nesmith are all locked in for the long term at frankly below market deals (especially brown and Williams should he be able to stay healthy). I trust brad to make the necessary acquisitions and def think with the nets aging out soon that Boston will be the best team in the East in 3 years"
"Rob Edwards, Frank Jackson, Jordan Clarkson"
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
