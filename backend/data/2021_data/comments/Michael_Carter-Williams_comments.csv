"Ever hear of Michael Carter-Williams? Yeah, it’s still way too early to tell."

Ben “Michael Carter Williams with clout” Simmons.
"And the sixers could have taken Giannis, but they took Michael Carter-Williams instead."
"Michael Carter-Williams dropped 22/7/12 with 9 steals on amazing shooting his first start. Huge bust. There are many player in the league who could have one good game.   Why would you want to keep maxey, a player who \*might\* become as good as harden, when you could get harden"
Aahhh the old Michael Carter-Williams except he peaked in his first game
"He’s just Michael Carter Williams with clout and better teammates, I swear smh."
I remember Michael Carter williams as a rookie or Jahil Okafor
Most shocking part of this was Michael Carter-Williams debut numbers. 9 steals!?
"Our current claim to fame is Michael Carter-Williams, Smh"
League MVP Michael Carter Williams agrees
Luka is essentially Michael Carter-Williams 2.0; who is essentially Tyreke Evans 2.0. Luka is essentially Tyreke Evans 3.0.
Michael carter-Williams 2.0
Harden almost had the quadruple double. Shades of Michael Carter-Williams in his debut!
He should keep getting run atleast until Michael Carter williams gets back. Maybe even after that mcw played shooting guard with the bench when Fultz was still playing and cole was backup pg.
I don’t see much difference between LaMelo and Michael Carter Williams except for his fan club. Sorry it’s James Wiseman.
"I’m sure he’ll be a much better pro, but so far Lamelo has basically been Michael Carter Williams with slightly more finishing ability. Recording semi impactful triple doubles at a young age, lot of assists in transition, has a different shooting form every time he shoots a J.  I’m not out on Melo but think a lot of causal fans are rushing to crown him."
Michael Carter Williams
"“I just got out of a Thai prison camp after 8 years, how is Michael Carter williams doing?”"
Michael Carter Williams every time we play the Magic
"Nah, it's Michael Carter Williams. Any money is too much money for that guy."
"&gt;I saw someone say Shaun Livingston if he never got hurt and I shed a tear. Obviously a lot of people will bring up Michael Carter williams but he seems to be much less ball dominant and has way more raw talent.  They play literally nothing alike my guy.  LaMelo Ball is a flashy offensive talent with a penchant for elite passing vision, and the potential to be a triple double machine in the future. He uses his size well, whereas Livingston was more of a dynamic guard who could've literally just plowed through players with his elite vertical and intense athleticism coupled with stellar ability to play the passing lanes. Livingston was an underrated passer, but LaMelo Ball makes passes that literally seem impossible to pull off. That being said, Livingston probably could've dominated the NBA after his junior year, with how well he was playing as a two-way guard. He was well on his way. Still, much respect to the man for coming back and playing  12 more years after that gruesome injury."

Michael Carter-Williams
Worst rookie of the year would have to go to Michael Carter-Williams
Some could even say he’s had a very Michael carter Williams the third. Type of career so far
"Soon enough, Melo will be in the drivers seat. Let him adjust to the pace at his own speed, adjust to the system. With no summer league it’s probably the safest approach to prevent him from becoming Michael Carter-Williams."
"People get so caught up in counting stats with guys especially on bad teams, I mean bad teams have to score too. It’s like the hinkie 76ers, they had guys just racking up points but michael carter williams wasn’t actually any good. I wouldn’t get too excited about Grant he was still a pretty alright player for the nuggets but not like a superstar."

steph curry is a glorified michael carter williams with a worse beard
"People that judge rookie seasons alone are out of their minds, especially for the 18-20 year old prospects. Rookie seasons are almost always bad and inefficient, and the rookie seasons that were surprisingly productive a lot of the times end up being not very good players (Michael Carter Williams, Tyreke Evans, etc)"
Michael carter Williams is the goat if we take the per 36 for only his first career game
The thing is most of his giving away upside guy trades ended up being definitely the right move cause those guys weren't really that good. Like people complained about the Michael Carter-Williams trade as tanking but it was 100% the right move. Hinkie basically got a lot of unnecessary criticism for tanking because he moved on from guys when he needed to and signed young guys who could be good eventually rather than washed vets
does Michael Carter Williams after his 1st game count?
Loved Noel on the 76ers. What’s your opinion on Michael Carter Williams?
I’ve been rooting for Philly since Michael Carter Williams was starting. I don’t know why everyone on this thread started thinking I’m a bandwagon. Must’ve been the Toronto jackass

"I am going to need to see more than like 30 games of LaMelo before I put him ahead of Ja. At least get to the sophomore year so I can see if he regresses once teams figure out his play style and force him to evolve his game. We've seen a lot of players have good first years then fall off a cliff afterwards. Brandon Jennings, Tyreke Evans, Michael Carter Williams, I mean give it another year before I even consider LaMelo Ball."

"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
"Or Michael Carter-Williams who’s well behind Giannis, Oladipo, and Gobert"

"I always think of Michael Carter-Williams during his time in Philly for topics like this.  His career really went downhill, but I mean, I’m honestly not sure what factors led him to become like a role player"
Michael Carter Williams is by far the worst player that's still in the league.  This man fucking sucks lmao
"I remember this game.  In his defense, Dunleavy was always a very dirty player; Giannis was retaliating after Dunleavy had multiple cheap shots on Michael Carter Williams, including fucking up MCW's teeth or jaw (can't remember exactly) which required surgery.  Don't get me wrong, he definitely deserved to be ejected for basically tackling him lol, but it wasn't completely unprompted like this hit on OG was."
Dude we're starting Michael Carter-Williams
Michael Carter Williams the next Jordan don’t @ me.
"I own a Michael Carter-Williams jersey. I'm a long time processor. in my original comment I was specifically referring to this season, the first few games without embiid the whole team kind of looked shitty. And Simmons didn't really step up. That appears to be changing."
"He took a bunch of cheap shots against Buck players during the playoffs in 2015. https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/05/01/before-getting-tackled-by-giannis-antetokounmpo-mike-dunleavy-kept-hitting-michael-carter-williams-in-neck-videos/comment-page-2/ The videos are gone now, but it was pretty blatant and the refs weren't doing anything about it. Fuck Mike Dunleavy"
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."

"""I think if it's one, then it is Lou Will. What's the best they could get for him as an expiring? **A floor general and playmaker is what they need** and I think the best they could flip Lou for would be someone like Michael Carter-Williams who can be their playmaker and he is still under 30. **I don't think they can get a floor general mid season anyway**, so until they can sign someone in the offseason (like Lowry that can solve their issues), that's what I think is best.""

Lol the James Harden riding Michael Carter Williams play is still a top 10 weird call.
Keldon is a way better comp for westbrook   dejounte is like..... i dont know. like if michael carter williams from that heat game kept developing
I think there was a huge boom of Hitler posts after the Michael Carter Williams? foul on Harden where Harden basically leaned onto and fell on top of MCW and MCW was called for the foul
"Michael Carter-Williams actually WON a ROY, maybe the Raps should trade for him?  I think the problem is that you hold an opinion of Kendrick Nunn that is not shared by the Miami Heat organization nor any other NBA team."
"Compared to high level NBA players, yes.  Winning ROTY doesn't mean much. Michael Carter Williams, Wiggins, Tyreke Evans, Emeka. It's not like winning ROTY in this draft class is...remarkable."
"Reminds me of when rookie Michael Carter Williams beat Lebron, DWade, and Bosh by himself on opening night. That was crazy."
"Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Michael Carter-Williams are all injured"
Also Michael Carter-Williams and Giannis.

"All they had to do is keep Ariza. Instead of it they had to pick up Michael Carter Williams, Brandon Knight and James Ennis"
I'm actually a little disappointed its not worse. We need to put worse players out there...Michael Carter-Williams is a good start to that though
Michael Carter Williams 2013-2014  Just because whats happened since lol
"Mate I like Zion a lot, its just called being realistic man. 20 games is nothing in the grand scheme, look at Brandon Jennings scoring 55 7 games into his rookie year. Everyone thought he was the next Iverson.  Or look at Michael Carter-Williams, had an insane debut, and a good enough rookie season to win ROY. What is he doing now?  Going the other way, look at Giannis stats for his first 20 games and look at where he is now.  Obviously Zion has shown more than those guys (Jennings &amp;MCW), and what he has shown this year indicates he is legit but it still applies. You couldn't suggest that a player will be a perennial MVP, title winner based on 20 games."

I dont want to see Michael Carter Williams within 50 feet of a basketball ever again
&gt;Teams do not leave their center defending the rim while vuc stands on the perimeter. Just doesnt happen.  They help off him all the time. You can spend 5 min watching every 3 pointer he's taken this year and see this. [Here you go even enjoy](https://go.nba.com/i7kf). Just because they dont treat you like Ben Simmons playing 10 feet off you doesnt mean you provide floor spacing.   Ill give you his most recent game as an ex   [Blatantly treating him as a guy they are willing to let shoot no actual gravity](https://go.nba.com/sk18)   Same thing [Michael Carter Williams isnt nearly this big a threat on a drive to warrant this kind of attention they are just sagging off Vuc and letting him shoot because they dont care if he does](https://go.nba.com/nj95)  [transition 3 Collins closes out in the end but not exactly playing up on him like you see guys with real gravity get defended](https://go.nba.com/n4fc). Same idea as before [MCW driving in transition isnt nearly a big enough threat bigs have to be ready in the paint](https://go.nba.com/o1n2) coaching instructions are clearly close out if he does shoot it but that they arent afraid to let him shoot if he wants.   Not much to evaluate here [just a scramble type situaiton spot up 3 opening for Vuc](https://go.nba.com/yk4c)  And his last [3 pointer for that game same idea zero gravity just let him shoot](https://go.nba.com/eord). If he had actual gravity John Collins would be rotating off Aminu to prevent a Vuc shot and let Aminu shoot but he doesnt.   I picked this most recent game. You can pick whatever you want youll see the same point. The vast majority of the time he doesnt have gravity and cause defenses to bend or really respect his shot.
"Need to pump the brakes on lamelo he’s been really good, but as we’ve seen in the past the nba is smart they learn to adjust, how will lamelo respond? Tyreke evans was Lebron jr at one point, Michael carter Williams, Jah okafor, etc."
"I’ve watched basketball long enough to be able to tell when someone has a 90% chance of panning out(10% include guys like Tyreke Evans, Michael carter Williams, Jabari Parker, OJ Mayo, etc...), not total busts, but guys that didn’t live up to the hype due to injuries/outside problems... Lonzo is a good dude who puts in the work and truly wants to be great, and he showed many signs of being a big difference for us while he was with the lakers... when lonzo played during his last season with us, we went 25-22, the best record on the team"
"Ahh okay.  I think the disconnect comes from how differently people see his career playing out.    Some see him as Luka v2, others see him as another Michael Carter Williams.  We will have to see"

"Lots of recent names like Tyreke Evans, Brandon Jennings, Michael Carter-Williams, but I’ll give you a throwback: Alvan Adams.   Probably looked like a future HOFer after his rookie year (even led the Suns to the Finals) and then fell off. Unlike the others, Adams actually still had a solid career, but no where near the HOF, which sure looked like he was heading towards after his rookie year."
Danuel house. James Ennis. A bummy Melo that thought he was a starter. Austin Rivers. Michael Carter Williams. Yep g league players.  He had to drop 40 a game.
"Michael-Carter Williams had an good rookie year, won ROY and had legit potential. In fact, his stats look remarkably similar to Lamelo’s"
Michael Carter Williams
"Tyreke Evans averaged 20/5/5 his rookie year and never got better.  Michael Carter Williams averaged 17/6/6 his rookie year and never got better.  OJ Mayo put up 18/3/3 his rookie year and never got better.  I'm sorry, but half a season of production means absolutely nothing in the long term."

Remember Michael Carter-Williams first game? Ill probably never forget it.
"Ah, the Michael Carter Williams ROY campaign Sixers.  The Sixers got one more steal that year in June with Embiid at the 3rd pick."
"**Some historic nominations by me:**  * Jerry Stackhouse (29.8PPG in '00/01 season) - Stackhouse wasn't a bad NBA player by any means, but he also has no business averaging 30PPG and this is evidence by the fact his general average outside of this outlier was around the 20PPG mark. Pistons went 32-50 that season.  * Michael-Carter Williams (16.7PPG in '13/14 season) - An example of why to be cautious of rookies having good looking stats on god-awful franchises. This was doing his ROTY campaign and since the 76ers were fine with losing (19-63 record) this ended up proving to be MCW's peak, as his scoring has diminished greatly since then.  * James Ennis (15.9PPG in 9 games in 15/16 season for NOP) - This is a dumb one but for whatever reason it came to mind. Ennis was a prospect Heat fans got hyped for since I'm pretty sure he won the Australian League MVP. Joined the Heat, big dunker - he can't dribble. He gets traded, doesn't do much - but I vividly remember this hot streak he had towards the end of a season with the Pelicans. They were pretty bad and went 30-52, and Ennis never quite matched this success but it came to mind thinking of this post."
"Michael Carter-Williams had 22/7/12 with 9 steals in his first career game   He played 70 games that season. Assuming he played 70 games for 8 years, while maintaining those numbers he’d have 12, 320 points   That’s more than Al Horford and Jrue Holiday"
Michael Carter Williams.
yo how tf michael williams carter jr 4/10 i thought he was curry now?
"Yes because if you’re MVP then you’re likely also very good.   As for Rose in particular, yes as well.   Let’s imagine that Rose had a career ending injury and never played another game after 2013.  In this scenario I believe Rose would’ve been in the HOF the moment he was eligible. An MVP who had his career cut short is going to get this award for the feels alone. Besides, there’s no reason to think a player would all of a sudden become a bench warmer after being the youngest MVP ever. We’re not talking about ROTY &amp; Michael Carter Williams here. So why punish Rose for coming back from this type of injury and continue to play?"
"&gt; Hinkie intentionally drafted multiple seriously injured players who would not be able to play for at least a season so that he could continue the tank.  Yea, im sure thats why he drafted Embiid and not because he's a hall of famer.  &gt;He traded a rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams  How dare he trade the great MCW"
"&gt;He traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday who had just made the All Star team.   &gt;   &gt;He traded a rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams.  Both of those were good trades. Jrue  hasn't made the all-star team since and MCW fell off a cliff. If Presti thought that he could trade Lu and Shai for more than they were going to be worth in the next 5 years, he'd do those trades in a heart beat."
"&gt;He traded a rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams.  He traded MCW because he knew he was fool's gold. Advanced stats hated MCW.   &gt;Hinkie intentionally drafted multiple seriously injured players who would not be able to play for at least a season so that he could continue the tank.  Imagine thinking he picked players based on them being injured.  He picked Embiid and Noel because of the upside, since they were tanking, it allowed them to take time with their injuries."
Hinkie intentionally drafted multiple seriously injured players who would not be able to play for at least a season so that he could continue the tank.

"Well it’s pretty easy to see why some players have greater ceilings than others. But if you don’t want to look at things through a more educated lens than just current production, than of course not.  Players like Giannis and Embiid were “ceiling” plays. There are also “floor” players who peaked as rookies, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Michael Carter-Williams come to mind.  Not to say Hali or Wiseman will fall into either category. But your criticism isn’t founded in logic."
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."

"He did it with Austin Rivers, Michael Carter Williams and James Ennis"
"That's a kind of selection bias, you're focusing on players who stuck in the league.  Also I don't think most of those guys are enormously better than they were as rookies, most just got more of a chance and are more sure of their strengths and weaknesses, and some improved their shooting a bit.  But think about the counter examples.  Off the top of my head just from our team I recall Grievis Vasquez, Nick Calathes, Sam Young, Hakim Warrick, Stromile Swift, Dahntay Jones, and O.J. Mayo (wasn't old but was picked because of polish on his game, a floor pick).  They got chances to play early on but they just kinda were who they were for their whole careers.  Mayo even got clearly worse his whole career.  And when you open it up to guys who were never even good enough to get a chance that list grows by leaps and bounds.    For every Pascal Siakam there are 5 or 10 players like Michael Carter-Williams and Doug McDermott."

"It's because he worked in Philly. He was basically Keith Pompey at the Inquirer back in the 90s.   My favorite was when MCW called him out in the Players Tribune (nothing really personal against SAS, mostly that he represented the national media and he plays a character) and SAS freaked out and responded with:  &gt;“You’re never going to have the last word over us,” Smith said. “And you damn sure ain’t going to have the last word over me. I’m not going to start problems, but I can damn sure finish them. If these guys want to come at me, let them do it at their own peril. It will be a mistake.”  [Source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/11/17/michael-carter-williams-responds-to-stephen-a-smiths-comments-about-his-players-tribune-essay/)  Imagine being a very well paid and known media personality and getting that upset about MCW."

"Dunleavy had punched Michael Carter-Williams multiple times in the face that game, once in the throat.   IIRC, he also chipped one of MCW's teeth."
"I see most people like the idea but I have a different one as well.  The worst team has their players re-drafted by the other lottery teams. The lottery teams can swap any of their players for the player they draft.  For example, if I'm the Magic I take Christian Wood from the Rockets and then replace him with our worst player, Michael-Carter-Williams. Every team repeats this and then the new Rockets team gets sent to the G-League. Suddenly there's no talent disparity."
Michael Carter Williams would go down as the undisputed GOAT
Michael Carter-Williams looked like the GOAT in his first NBA game.
"Bucks fans will remember this one: Mike Dunleavy punching Michael Carter-Williams for no reason as MCW came down from a layup. Rookie Giannis famously got ejected for decking Dunleavy in retaliation, but nothing ever happened to Dunleavy for committing one of the dirtiest plays I've ever seen.  Delly injuring Korver in 2015, and then attempting to do the same thing to Horford, Carroll, and Iggy. Also Delly punching Iggy in the Balls"

"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?

"And Kidd wasn't nearly as bad at shooting as people would have you believe, he just wasn't a scorer and his total FG% was pretty low because he wasn't a ""get to the rim on dunk on someone or hit a trick layup"" guy as much as some other guards. He shot 32.5% on threes for his first ten seasons, compared to the league average of 35.4% (and a higher percent of his shots were threes than the average - 27.3% of his shot attempts vs 18.1% average). Not great, but not like he was Ben Simmons or Michael Carter-Williams or Markelle Fultz or dear god, why can't young Sixers ""guards"" shoot?"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2015/05/01/bulls-bucks-mike-dunleavy-jr-giannis-antetokounmpo-nba-playoffs  “But Antetokounmpo didn't tackle Dunleavy Jr. as a preemptive strike. Prior to his flagrant foul and ejection, Antetokounmpo witnessed what few noticed during the course of the game. For reasons unknown, Dunleavy Jr. zeroed in on Michael Carter-Williams as a player to pick on during his team's Game 6 matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks.  Dunleavy Jr. hit Carter-Williams above the shoulders and targeted his neck on multiple plays in the first quarter. The initial strike came when Carter-Williams drove the lane and jumped into traffic. Instead of simply contesting the shot, Dunleavy Jr. moved over in help defense and finished the play with a blow to Carter-Williams' neck. Look closely and you'll see Carter-Williams point to his neck and complain to officials about what should have been ruled a flagrant foul.   Dunleavy Jr. followed with another shot when he set a screen on Carter-Williams, who took things in his own hands after officials failed to heed his complaints.   Because the score became so lopsided as the game progressed, the young Bucks no longer had anything to lose. Chicago defeated Milwaukee 120–66, the fourth-largest victory in NBA history. They held a 58–28 lead when Antetokounmpo leveled Dunleavy Jr. just before halftime.”"
Michael Carter Williams. His first 4 seasons on paper look real good with just basic stats but then you start looking at his true shooting numbers. Ouch
Dude they have philly legend michael carter williams. Just looked up their roster. Its pretty bad lol id say their a tie
Michael Carter Williams
Meanwhile Lamelo is wildly overrated too. Disagree? Just remember Michael Carter Williams had a similar first season. (No I don’t think Lamelo is a bust I’m just saying none of these guys are a sure thing. Ever.)
"It’s down to how different websites define what a possession is — that’s why I couched it as **isn’t necessarily entirely true**. Pbpstats gives an explanation [here](https://dblackrun.github.io/2019/04/15/why-pbpstats-possession-counts-lower.html):  &gt; This season the NBA stats website started using exact possession counts instead of the estimate they had previously used. While exact counts had previously been available on some smaller sites, including my site, PBPStats, it was good to see what I would assume is the most visited site for NBA stats finally use exact counts. If you have compared numbers on the NBA site and on PBPStats you have probably noticed that the possession counts are different. How can the counts be different if both are using exact counts? Well it turns out defining a possession is not as simple as one might think. I will use game 1 of the Raptors Magic series to show a few examples of this.  &gt; At the end of the second quarter Danny Green makes a three with 0.4 seconds remaining. Orlando inbounds the ball to Aaron Gordon who fails to get a full court shot off before the buzzer sounds. Should this count as a possession for Orlando? Their percentage chances of scoring here are probably in the low single digits so does it make sense to count it the same as we would count a normal mid-quarter possession with a 24 second shot clock.  &gt; At the end of the third quarter Pascal Siakam misses a corner three. In the play-by-play Michael Carter-Williams is credit with a rebound with one second remaining in the quarter. Does that mean Orlando gets credited with a new possession after the rebound? As you can see from the video, it would take a miracle for them to score after the rebound.  &gt; At the end of the fourth quarter Kawhi Leonard missed a three pointer that would have tied the game and the ball went out of bounds with 0.5 seconds remaining. Orlando just needed to inbound the ball and have time expire to win the game. Should this be counted as a possession for them?  &gt; If you look at the stats for this game on the NBA site it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 99 possessions. On PBPStats it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 96 possessions. I don’t know exactly how possessions are counted on the NBA site, but the most logical guess I can make is the three possession difference is because the three examples above are all counted as possessions for Orlando. None of them are counted on PBPStats. Any possession that starts with two or fewer seconds remaining in a quarter isn’t counted as a possession, unless points are scored. I arbitrarily picked two seconds, but the goal was to limit counting end of quarter possessions with little to no chance of scoring.  &gt; This is why you will see the team efficiency stats 1-2 points per 100 possessions higher on PBPStats. This isn’t the only place where decisions need to be made on how to count a possession, flagrant fouls are another place (I count the free throws and possession following the free throws as two separate possessions), but it is the biggest one that would be causing most of the difference. I understand why one would count possessions the way they are on the NBA site - it’s easy to understand and easier to code, but I think not counting those end of quarter possessions give a better representation of a team’s efficiency. There is no perfect way to do it. Working with play-by-play data is always going to be messy and there will always be issues you hadn’t considered that come up. I think it’s good to have options available that make different choices and let the user decide which one makes more sense for what they are looking for."

"Philly drafts Michael Carter-Williams with the 11th pick and trades him for the Lakers' pick, which is top 5 protected, then top 3 protected the next year. Lakers move into top 3 for both years. Lakers had 3 #2 overall picks in a row. They got some insane lottery luck, blundered their assets, and still dumpster fired their way to LeBron."
How dare you forget the GOAT off that list: Michael Carter Williams
"Magic also called Michael Carter-Williams ""the next Jason Kidd""."
Well I'm NOT Michael Carter-Williams!
"Aside from that one time Michael Carter-Williams slipped on a bootleg AI sticker Philly put down for an honor night, I don't think there were a lot of slipping issues in the NBA. It's a narrative that seems to have taken off after some NCAA coaches raised a fuss and it's carried forth as truth, as though players have been slip-and-sliding since those decals were introduced back in the 90's.   [From a league spokesman when the decals were initially removed](https://the-cauldron.com/where-did-the-nba-playoffs-decals-go-5794cfbde3c4):  &gt;“There were a lot of considerations taken into account in making this decision, including player safety,” said an NBA spokesman. “We haven’t received any complaints about the decals from teams or players this season, but it was among the factors we discussed.  &gt;“We decided to remove the playoffs logo from the court for a variety of reasons, including cleaning up the playing surface,” the spokesman added. “Throughout the postseason, the logo will appear on pole pads and seat backs, and on digital LED stanchions and courtside signage. With this added exposure for playoffs branding, we determined the logos on the court were unnecessary.”  In other words, they wanted to clean up the playing surface so they could superimpose YouTubeTV at six different on-court locations at once."
It's crazy to me that Michael Carter Williams was on the original roster for that team prior to cuts.
As a rookie Michael Carter-Williams was also better than Kobe. So was Tyreke Evans. You taking them next?
Jrue Holiday doing his best Michael Carter Williams impression
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"
Michael Carter Williams was already a victim of this lol. A week or two ago he posted an IG pic of him looking a little bigger and got flagged by the NBA and got drug tested THE NEXT DAY.
Michael Carter-Williams
I think Michael Carter-Williams is a good example of how a decent player can really fill the stat sheet if he’s the lead dog on an offense. Evan Turner was like that at Ohio State too.
I remember Michael Carter Williams first game against the big 3 Heat. First impressions can be misleading.
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De’Andre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
"The Sixers get criticized because they were SO overt about it.   The front office was setting a team up for failure.   What's more, they have little in the way to show for it.   Noel?   Okafor?  Michael Carter-Williams?  Markelle Fultz?  Elfird Payton/Dario Saric?   And Ben Simmons.  They spent YEARS losing to pick up all those players.  And the only one who is still with the team has show no progress in his five years with the team.   The only player who panned out was Joel Embiid, and they got him in 2016.    Trying to WIN and build organically around Embiid would have been far easier for the Sixers than tanking every years.  We've seen with the Warriors that exceptional scouting and player development is the best approach to the draft.  Their dynasty was build primarily through the draft (Curry, Klay, Dray, and Barnes), none of whom were even top-five picks, and a couple of shrewd trades (for Bogut) that made the team a landing spot for free agents like Durant.  When you are winning, free agents are drawn to your team.  They had a sucky year last year, and it was not much better this year due to injury, but they still made a sincere effort to reach the playoffs.  And they still have great draft positioning with a early first-round pick in Wiseman on the roster now, and two lottery picks coming their way.   Sure... you can fairly expect to suck for a couple years during a rebuild and get a couple of early picks, but don't stay down there for five years trying to draft your entire starting line-up. You'll just end up with a losing culture."
Turning Evan Turner and Michael Carter Williams into a #1 seed with an MVP caliber center wasnt worth the 43 straight years of tanking the sixers did for it.
"He doesn’t work at it. If he did, he could be great. Does Michael Carter-Williams ring a bell?"
"I dont know if this counts but remember when Michael Carter Williams almost got a quadrupe double in his first game against miami heat when lebron,dwyane, and bosh were on the team.People were so hype and then he faded away."
"Dang, I guess they won’t take Michael Carter Williams and Gary Harris for him then….."

Michael Carter Williams won rookie of the year then almost immediately fell into irrelevance.
"Michael Carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Evan Turner, Joel Embiid....   God this team's drafting was not great under Hinkie."
Can’t believe Anthony Bennett and Michael Carter Williams went above Giannis 😭
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
Dude is turning into a 6ft10 Michael Carter Williams.
Markelle Fultz   Zhaire Smith  Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons   Jahlil Okafor
Cole Anthony   Markelle Fultz   RJ Hampton   Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons
"&gt; drafted Michael-Carter Williams with Giannis on the board.  Lmao, yeah why didn’t Hinkie have the foresight to draft one of the biggest steals in NBA history?   &gt; Drafted Okafor when they had just drafted Embiid and Porzingis on the board.  So Mr. 20/20, is your issue that he drafted a big man or not the big man that we now know is better?"
"who knows  some ""special"" cases like michael carter-williams peak really early."
How do ORL fans rate Michael Carter Williams
Don’t forget former rookie of the year Michael Carter Williams!
His trade value is lower than Michael Carter Williams after winning his rookie of the year award.
"[i've had this bookmarked forever because it's the best example i've ever seen of a bad team playing their asses off](https://streamable.com/csxp). that's literally what tanking is -- michael carter-williams and isaiah canaan and kj mcdaniels and richaun holmes never lacked heart, they just weren't that good."
He's morphing into Michael Carter-Williams before our very eyes
"Ah yes, the man so obsessed with picking tall players who can't shoot would have definitely been the saving grace of this squad. Maybe you'd have Michael Carter Williams and his protege Ben Simmons on the same roster if Hinkie was still around.  Lowkey, Hinkie wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway. Agents were refusing to have their clients projected to go in the late first to second round work out for the Sixers because they didn't like the contracts he offered those selections. Considering a major part of his strategy was gambling on second round picks, this was less than ideal. Once agents start steering clients away from your team as a GM, your days are numbered."
"Hinkie drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor.  Let's not pretend he knew how to spot talent and would have done any better if hadn't been pushed out.  His only good pick was Embiid and what a great pick it was.  But that's literally the only good pick he made."
The 76ers slander is hilarious but I think what’s even more hilarious is the fact that you guys got 6’10 Michael Carter-Williams.
Ben Simmons is a taller Michael Carter-Williams
Ben Simmons is a better passing Michael Carter-Williams…76ers are wasting Embiid man.
Don't forget my boy Michael Carter-Williams. Had like 6 steals vs the Heatles then fell off
Bear in mind their other two lottery picks in the past decade were Michael Carter-Williams and Evan Turner at #2 lmaoo
"Ben Simmons really pisses me off. He's so passive this series, Sometimes he plays like MVP Giannis and sometime he decides to play like Michael Carter Williams.  Drive the ball you prick"
michael carter williams 2.0. peaked in his rookie year.
IS THAT... COULD IT BE... *MICHAEL-CARTER WILLIAMS*?!?!?
This poor guy's going from the next LeBron to the next Michael Carter-Williams right before our eyes :-(
Michael Carter-Williams peering in through the blinds
"I hope more people realize the 76’ers are so good now because of Hinkie.  People just remember to the tanking part, but he brought more to the table than that. Hinkie also traded Michael Carter-Williams as they reigning Rookie of the Year.  People lost their shit (why get draft picks, only to trade the player even after they’re awesome!??), but Hinkie was right. Michael Carter-Williams never ascended and is basically an NBA never-was.  Philly fans should be nothing but thankful for what Hinkie did.   And also, the NBA MUST MUST MUST fix the draft system so that no tanking plan can ever be used again. The first picks should go to the teams that just missed the playoffs ( est record of non playoff teams) so that winning is ALWAYS incentivized."
He's basically just a rich man's Michael Carter-Williams at this point.
Big Michael-Carter Williams and some guy who might theoretically one day be maybe close to kind of as good as Fox is not worth Fox
Philly gave Ben Simmons a max contract with no requirement he learn to shoot lol. Michael Carter Williams 2.0
"I find it interesting that the Sixers, who worked SO hard to fucking LOSE every year to stock pile lottery picks, seemed to get the most disappointing picks (though they are not all 'busts' exactly).    Nerlens.   Michael Carter-Williams (and he was ROY).   Okafor.  Simmons.   In fact, the only player they drafted during their FIVE-YEAR 'process' that will be with the team moving forward (assuming a Simmons trade goes through) is Embiid.   And they got him the second year.   One of the best players they picked up Mikal Bridges, and they shipped him out straight away but has developed into a solid player.   Ty Jerome too.   They also shipped out Jerami Grant pretty early as well.   That team has just been all about moving and getting assets and throwing everything to the wall and seeing what sticks and jumping off if it doesn't work straight away (with Embiid and Simmons being the only players they have been willing to wait on).   All of that instead of taking the time to develop the talent they get."
"i apparently was in an elevator with MJ and Pippen and another Bulls player when I was 3. My mom says I came up to Pippen's socks  I've seen Cody Zeller, Ben Gordon, Michael Carter-Williams, Gerald Henderson walking around uptown Charlotte during their stints with the team, and I think that's it. I also think I saw a Marvin Williams lookalike in my old apartment complex but I'm not quite sure it was him. the dude was tall but not sure he looked 6'9."
Damn Michael Carter Williams esque
"Depends entirely how you define ""working""   If the only definition of ""working"" is winning a title then you arent going to find a plan you like other than luck into multiple top tier talents and/or be in a top market  Hinkie's biggest issue was always managing relations both within his organization, around the NBA, with agents and with players. Which absolutely matters alot. But that's what got him canned way more than deciding to trade Michael Carter Williams in a vacuum or whatever."
"Michael Carter-Williams, Michael Jordan, Michael Porter Jr, Michael Beasley, Michael Olowokandi"

"He was called that way before that decline tho.  That's my problem, people act like his 3pts shot was always as bad as it is now, and it is % wise, but whe you actually watched games those are not the same shot at all, dude was taking so many stupid 3's but actually semi reliable as a spot up guy, and now he's basically Michael Carter Williams"
"Michael Carter-Williams is the star of this team, that's all I know."
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
Ant was a better basketball player when he was 16 than Michael Carter Williams was his rookie year. MCW wasn’t a #1 pick with outstanding intangible talents like Ant has.
"Exactly, look at Michael Carter Williams 😩"

Michael Carter-Williams is the GOAT
"Gary Harris, Michael Carter-Williams for Hield maybe?  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, not many teams seem to need guards who are only looking to score. The league has taken the small ball thing too far."
&gt;Who were those players on the Magic teams besides Fournier? Aaron Gordon? DJ Augustin? Michael Carter Williams?  When you have those kinds of shot creators  Vucevic? TRoss?
"Bubble TJ Warren, 16-17 Isaiah Thomas in the 4th quarter, linsanity Jeremy Lin, debut game Michael Carter Williams, Klay for 1 quarter against the kings. Missing any?"
Michael carter Williams for his first game was the goat
Clearly it's Michael Carter Williams and I don't wanna hear otherwise.
Michael Carter Williams
"Are people really being honest with their answers?  Saying names like Michael Carter Williams/Tyreke Evans/Jabari Parker and whatever is at the top of the page when you Sort By Best?  Like who do people consider as top 5 players right now?  Players like Giannis?  Anthony Davis?  Kawhi Leonard?   The names that people are listing, do people really think were going to reach that level?   Top 5 is Finals MVP level.  You look at a guy like Jimmy Butler, who was the best player in a NBA Finals team, I doubt majority of the people consider him top 5 level.  Or even the Suns teams this past Finals.  Do people consider anybody in Suns a top 5 player?  Top 5 is a ridiculous high level to reach."
"Literally every sixers first round pick during “The Process”: Jahlil Okafor, Michael carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Markell Fultz. Ben Simmons lol."
Michael Carter Williams looked like a future top 5 guy after his first career game.
Michael Carter Williams
"I also think Mann is better right now, but the debate was ""Who's the better draft pick?"". We won't actually know that answer for a while. If you asked who the best draft pick from Giannis's draft class was after their 2nd season the answer would have been Michael Carter-Williams."
The only guy I could find who was worse with close to 2 attempts per game is Michael Carter-Williams.  Barkley: 26.6% on 1.9 attempts  MCW: 25.5% on 1.8 attempts
Peaked in his rookie year like Michael Carter-Williams.
Michael Carter Williams
He was playing off the bench. They literally wouldnt give playmaking duties to him over michael Carter Williams.
"Jersey numbers shouldn’t be retired. Honor players in the same way by putting their Jersey in the rafters but let the players/fans determine whether they’re worthy to wear a number. If Demar Derozan wanted to wear 23 for the Bulls, let him, but he never would because the city would never let him live it down. But if he wanted to wear 10 because that’s obviously been his number, would Bulls fans go crazy over him wearing Bob Love’s number? Unlikely. Same reason nobody has wore 1 in Chicago. Likely paying respect to D.Rose but I’d imagine there will come a day when D.Rose is no longer playing that someone will wear 1 again… except for MCW who [learned his lesson](https://pippenainteasy.com/2016/10/18/michael-carter-williams-picked-no-1-didnt/ ) the hard way."
"It's even a little worse than that if you think about it. They surrounded Jimmy with Wade and Butler and then decided  ""hmmmmm, you know who would be a great point guard to come off the bench for this roster that lacks shooting? That's right MICHAEL CARTER WILLIAMS"""
"Bluntly, would the Warriors have given him a max contract ?  Being part of The Process earned him around $200 million dollars, because after their several failed picks  - Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor - Philly were desperate enough to lock down one of their semi-successes to a long term deal."
"So if you went back in time you’d definitely to the 2013 draft you’d take Michael Carter-Williams over Giannis, right? MCW was a better contributor and won rookie of the year. Everyone knew MCW would be an NBA ready contributor day 1.   Barnes scored 20 (yes I’m counting the dunk) - 10 - 5 and showed great court vision and nice defense. Suggs played great too.   Everybody and their brother knew that Suggs would be better / more polished right now. Guess what? Neither the Raptors nor the Magic are winning the chip this year. Better to look at how they project in a few years time."
"A truly terrible choice but to be fair that draft was a total crapshoot and one of the worst all time. Giannis went 15, Rudy 27 and a bunch of nothing in-between. Michael Carter Williams was the rookie of the year."
"Same goes for the big 3 heat and they lost to the 76ers and a rookie named Michael carter Williams, which wasn’t even preseason. These games never count for anything. I think it was a ridiculous overreaction over prep games."
A few players come to mind…  Tyreke Evans- ROY and then fell off. He kind of started coming back but didn’t see him at all last year…  Brandon Jennings- 55 piece to memory of a 55 piece real quick.  Michael Carter Williams- another high performing rookie that just continues to fade out each year…

This is just Michael Carter-Williams with a few extra  steps.
Michael Carter Williams
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
Michael carter williams
"&gt;5 years ago the Warriors were 73-9, Kevin Durant hadn’t signed 3 contracts with 2 different teams, and the Lakers, 76ers, Nets, Suns, and Bucks were all terrible.  I get what you're saying, but those types of shifts aren't really changing the Cavs future right now.  To offer a comparison, take Khris Middleton.  Bucks signed him coming off a 41-41 season, where Khris was the 3rd leading scorer at 13.4 PPG, behind Brandon Knight and Michael Carter Williams.  His 5 years/$70M was comparable then to what 5 years/$100M would be for Allen this year.  But that's what small market teams need to do.  Lebron isn't coming back (again), and the Cavs need to collect long-term assets that might turn into something.  If they believe Allen is a *potential* good pairing with Mobley and/or Sexland, then hell yeah keep him here 5 years, let's see what we've got.  Capela would be another example.  Didn't transcend to superstar, but stayed a good version of himself, and because of the 5 year contract, was a valuable contract to trade away when the Rockets went into rebuild mode."

Michael Carter-Williams without a single doubt.
"Wiggins - People kinda forget that the dude won rookie of the year  Michael-Carter Williams - He had arguably the greatest debut game this side of Chamberlain, and he even won ROTY  Dario Saric - This doesn't fit in with the rest, but Dario was a high-end role-player as a rookie, and in all honesty has slightly digressed since then  Christian Laettner - Eventhough he's most famous for being hated in college and then nationally-resented for being on the dream-team over Shaq, the dude actually started his career off well, but outside of one season in Atlanta, the rest of it was very underwhelming  Tyreke Evans and OJ Mayo   Vince Carter (first 3 seasons) - In 2000, most people would've picked Vince Carter over both Iverson and Kobe. Thats how good he was perceived to be, and in that context, 8 all-star games in a 20+ year career is kind of a disappointment"

"&gt;  Magic had so many athletic perimeter defenders  The only positive perimeter defenders on that team were Isaac, Michael Carter-Williams and Gordon. Everyone else was either straight bad, or neutral. Mo is a pretty horrible defender but occasionally picks up blocks from being very long. In any case, he barely played at the stage of his career (I don't think he cracked 20 minutes until after we traded Vuc)."
The only reason Michael Carter Williams will stay relevant
Michael Carter Williams if you only count his first game
"&gt; He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor  He wanted Porzingis, but was overruled.   &gt;Michael Carter-Williams  he won rookie of the year, at one point he was looked at as a good pick."
"He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Williams? The Jrue Holiday - Nerlens Noel trade?   I'm not saying it can't succeed, but I'm saying it's the easy part of a GM's job, to sell everybody, to take in bad contracts.  And it's a way to sell hope to your fans."

Magic about to creep up on the NBA.  So much youth already...plus the #5 and #8 pick...plus they are in position to clear a TON of cap the next 2 years.  Otto Porter off the books - $28 Mil  Gary Harris off the books after this year  -$19 Mil  T Ross off the books in 2 years - $11 Mil  (Michael Carter Williams will more than likely be gone next year too)  That brings the average age to 22 years old for 7 key guys. Then add two 19 year olds from the picks which brings it to 21 years old for 9 key guys.
"Michael Carter Williams dropping 22, 7, 12, and 9 steals on the Heatles in his first career game"
Rookie Michael Carter Williams putting up a triple double in his first game against the Heatles and winning. What a weird way to start the season for the 76ers. They went on to win like 12 games that season..
Let’s not forget Michael Carter-Williams’ first game either
&gt;Michael Carter-Williams  So he's gonna get drug tested if he shows a social post of putting in work flexing?
"Remember the hype around Michael Carter-Williams? Opposite situation, but same idea."
Michael-Carter Williams - your Rookie of the Year everybody.
Michael Carter Williams. Thought he would be the next great PG after his first NBA game.
"Michael Carter Williams is more like ""good"" or ""decent"" at everything except scoring. Definitely not ""great"""
Al horford isnt known as a prolific scorer so i’d list him here  Michael Carter Williams if a sleeper pick
Michael Carter Williams —-&gt; Ben Simmons ———&gt; Giannis
"I know it's a joke, but the real reason is pretty crazy:  [https://www.brewhoop.com/2015/4/30/8525791/video-giannis-antetokounmpo-ejected-mike-dunleavy-punch-michael-carter-williams](https://www.brewhoop.com/2015/4/30/8525791/video-giannis-antetokounmpo-ejected-mike-dunleavy-punch-michael-carter-williams)  [https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/757346](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/757346)"
"What does that have to do with what I said? those guys were putting up stats on bad teams it doesn't compare, the Knicks were on pace for 47 wins, in a full 82 games season, he wasn't just putting up numbers because someone had to, like waiters or dunn did. Michael Carter Williams put up 17/6/6 as a rookie on a 10 win team, why? Because someone had to score and put up stats right.   Context has to go along with it, I haven't just said barett was better I've said what he's better at, to go along with what I said though, barett is more athletic than harden was, is better off ball, is a more consistent shooter and moves well on defense.  Barett had potential to be great, he's not an empty stats young player"
"idk if it's as jurassic as ben, but you could say eric bledsoe or michael carter-williams"
"Well instead they drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, and Ben Simmons  and went 1-23 to start the season. Stop the “the process was shutdown” nonsense   The process was a clown show, and a failure"
Kinda looks like michael carter williams?
Dont know why you got downvoted for asking a question.  Dunleavy repeatedly tried to hurt Michael Carter Williams in the same game. The refs did nothing so once the game was out of reach Giannis played enforcer.   https://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/01/bulls-bucks-mike-dunleavy-jr-giannis-antetokounmpo-nba-playoffs

"Michael Carter Williams, first game."
Michael carter Williams ROY then all downhill from there
"&gt;This was inspired by Michael Carter-Williams posting he might be a MMA ref and eventually pursue his dream in MMA  &amp;#x200B;  Pretty crazy to think about it, his first game ever ended up being his best game ever. Highest gamescore and all."
I can't believe nobody has said Michael Carter-Williams. He's a solid vet now with lockdown D but his first game in the NBA he looked like a superstar.
Heard of Michael Carter Williams
"Michael Carter Williams, Bryant Reeves, Roy Hibbert, Jeremy Lin, Jahlil Okafor, Isaiah Thomas *to an extent* because the argument that his hip injury ruined his career is very valid but even then he hasn’t done much to prove himself  Brent Barry even though I wouldn’t necessarily say he was ever a *great* player, but that 01-02 campaign was pretty decent  John Salmons was pretty good for a bit  That’s about all I can think of"
Hibbert and Stephenson.  Kuzma.  Michael Carter-Williams.  Terry Mills.  Pervis Ellison.  Sherman Douglas.  JR Rider.  Vin Baker.  Calbert Cheaney.
Michael Carter Williams
"The brawl began with 45.9 seconds remaining in the game, when Milwaukee led 97–82. Bulls player Mike Dunlevy was fouled from behind by Bucks 2x MVP and world champion Giannis Antetokounmpo, who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Dunlevy later said that Antetokounmpo had warned him he would be hit. Dunleavy responded by shoving Michael Carter-Williams in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep the two separated.  Bulls coach Larry Brown was not yet very concerned, because fights in the NBA rarely lasted for more than a few seconds. During the altercation, Antetokounmpo lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Bucks radio broadcaster Jim Paschke. The microphone was not live. Paschke recalled that the broadcasting team knew Antetokounmpo’s personality and ""figured it was a great time to interview him because he has a wonderful personality, A great sense of humor and the fans love him"". After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Dunleavy would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Dunleavy’s fans should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Bucks players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if Dunleavy got ejected, he would have to walk past the Bucks bench, which could have caused another incident.  Ninety seconds after Dunleavy shoved Antetokounmpo, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Dunleavy[3](Jeff Teauge was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire game; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Antetokounmpo was lying on the table, Dunleavy threw a towel at him, causing Antetokounmpo to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, who shockingly was also coincidentally named Mike Dunleavy then threw a plastic cup of beer at Michael Carter-Williams, hitting him in the Teeth. Antetokounmpo jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man,  Michael Dunnothing,  who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Paschke stood up to try and hold back Antetokounmpo and was bumped slightly in the effort, and suffered no ill affects and promptly retired after A long and very successful career. Antetokounmpo’s older brother Thanasis followed Antetokounmpo into the stands and punched a Mike Dunleavy fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Michael Carter-William’s face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Additionally players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who did not play because of an injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to get praise Antetokounmpo and to celebrate. Antetokounmpo the punched Dunleavy twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's mother, Daisy .[3] More fans then began throwing drinks, food, and other objects, and a deafening “Fuck Mike Dunleavy” chant began to fill the arena.   The event garnered major media attention and was known henceforth as the “Dunleavy’s game that went badly in the Bradley” and won’t soon be forgotten."
He took a couple shots at Michael Carter Williams head.
"1 game, like Michael Carter Williams"
Michael carter Williams
"Michael carter Williams super fun rookie year.  Game 1 of the season upset against Miami Heat, dueling triple doubles against Oladipo, everyone around him getting traded one by one.  Not a 6ers fan, so really fun to watch from the outside"
"True true! I like this kid. He's got a lot of potential. But the key word is 'potential.' He could flatline, he could soar, he could decline, and he could see incremental improvements and simply be a serviceable starter/rotation player.   I think the only person who can actually see the future of a player is Jerry West. Everybody else is playing the lottery.   You get guys like Artest, Draymond, Stephen Jackson, etc. who come into the league, even in their 20s... 22, 23, 24... and they play for a few years before reaching their potential.   Then you get guys who come on the scene 16/6/6 as a rookie and never do any better (Michael Carter-Williams as the example here).   My MCW isn't an anomaly. Lots of guys play their best basketball in their first couple year. Lionel Simmons. Sherman Douglas. Brandon Jennings.   It's so hard because every guy is unique, and their development is going to be unique to them."
&gt;He averaged 14.6 points on 41.4/37.8/78.1 to go along with 4.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists.  Psht those are rookie Michael Carter-Williams numbers..
"Just like De'Aaron Fox, Mike Connelly, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Steve Nash you can tell that after a bad first year they are a bust.    You need a player like Brandon Jennings, Michael Carter Williams, or Tyreke Evans; after good rookie years those guys were destined to be stars."
*He gave Michael Carter-Williams some extra business to the face. Giannis was standing up for his teammate.  FMD
"There are no players from my hometown, but by far the closest is Michael Carter-Williams. I was surprised to find it was someone I had actually heard of."
One more steal than Michael Carter Williams in his NBA debut against Miami big 3. Not that impressive
"Andrea Bargnani, Michael Carter Williams"
"And just generally waiting too long to make trades.   The team made an amazing trade back in 2015 trading Michael Carter-Williams at the peak of his value. Then they waited way too long to trade Noel, Okafor, and Fultz, to the point where they lost leverage and the players' values had tanked.  Simmons is obviously way better than any of them, but there's still a very real danger it happens again. I don't see his value increasing if they wait until next summer to pull the trigger. Hell you could argue the slide has already started given Simmons was apparently the centerpiece of a potential Harden trade last summer."
"Noel Norlens, Markelle Fultz, Jahil Okafor, Michael Carter Williams. They didn’t have a good scouting team to utilise the picks. Even Joel they lucked into cause of his injury concerns."
Especially that foul in accordance to the rule books when he climbed up onto Michael Carter Williams for a piggy back ride. Super by the books foul there.
Yeah and Michael Carter Williams had a Triple Double against the Heatles in his first game for Philly.  What’s your point ?
"Wow, this is a really good one. I completely forgot about it.  I just looked it up. What's weird is, one of those first-round picks was then traded to Philly in the insane Michael Carter-Williams trade, who used the pick and then traded the player back to the Suns: Mikal Bridges."
"He's not trash, but, he was never a star for two than 2 weeks. Michael Carter-Williams showed out for much longer, but, no one is crying about him"
"""the guy's back"". smh. that's ROTY Michael Carter Williams to you."
"People are already saying Mobley is better than KG. It's wild.   I always have to calm myself down by repeating ""Michael Carter-Williams"" for a couple of minutes before I post anything about a rookie."
"Agreed, but then he fell off due to injury. It’s sad for him, but if he doesn’t have that one MVP season, we wouldn’t talk about him really. His career isn’t a hall of fame career, apart from that one MVP season. By your logic, Michael Carter Williams should get in, because we saw for one season what he could have been, even though he wasn’t that for the rest of his career."
"I'm almost 40, been watching NBA since i was 10 as much as possible, everynight got League pass on, love it man just like everybody else on here.  If there is one thing I've learned in that time, and this is just my opinion, is I literally dont judge rookies.  At all.  I've seen guys come in and rip like Brandon Jennings or Michael Carter Williams and flame out fast or guys come in and crush when not expected to and continue to build off that success like Donovan Mitchell.  Being a rook in the NBA would be so gnarly, the travel, setting up housing, dealing w fam and friends, large purchases left and right, the most travel you've ever done, women throwing themselves at you.  Thats not even on court stuff, traveling, new coach, new teammates, just so much.  Dont get me wrong, I'll follow rooks and scope them and see how they are doing, but i don't hold anything against them, good or bad.  Now year two, it's go time.  I expect them to improve and i think you get a more accurate barometer on how they will turn out to be.  Imagine judging these people based off their rookie year, let alone two games!  Kobe, Dirk, Marc Gasol, Kawhi, PG, Steve Nash, Ben Wallace or many many more."
"Michael Carter-Williams.  Anyone drafted by the Knicks or Timberwolves.  Recently, Russell Westbrook in OKC."
people were calling Michael Carter Williams special a few games into his career too
Reminds me of Michael Carter Williams start from a few seasons ago
"Come on man. Let's debate this after at least half a season. Do I need to remind you that Michael Carter-Williams scored 22pts/12ast/7reb/9stl in his first NBA game?  I'm as high as anyone on Scottie, I actually wanted the Raptors to draft him over Suggs on draft night after hearing the buzz. But chill, Draymond is a DPOY player, Scottie has the potential, but let's not put the crown on him after his 2nd ever NBA game."
I really hope he doesn’t take the Michael Carter Williams route. Shows up big early on then slowly fades.   But the rookies recently have been really on top of things and I’m quite excited for the future
"you're getting down voted but you are so right. a lot of people forget that most NBA players aren't superstars. think about all those NBA players that you don't really think about daily like Michael Carter Williams or Trey Burk. these dudes live normal lives off the court. they aren't hanging out with their basketball buddies, they're spending time with their families."
"Starting with The Process in 2013, pretty much all the Sixers top picks were crazy in one way or another for about 6 straight years. Embiid was the most successful, but he missed his first two years with injuries and has missed 131 games in the years since. Simmons was the second most successful pick and we all know what's going on with him. Then they had Nerlens Noel with the 6th pick, Jahlil Okator with the 3rd pick, Fultz with the 1st pick, the Bridges/Smith swap with the 10th pick and Michael Carter-Williams with the 11th pick. Definitely no shortage of drama with any of them."
The Process edition:  Markelle Fultz  Michael Carter-Williams  Ben Simmons  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlen Noel

"Don’t need Lonnie to be lock-down.  Just need him to be above-average, IMO.  Michael-Carter Williams isnt “lockdown”, but he is a very, very good defender now.  Andrew Wiggins went from apathetic to a plus defender.  Middleton was not a good defender coming into the league.  Lavine has come a long way.  I agree with your assessment on Lonnie.  Defense is something he should be able to pick up over time.  His lack of confidence, ability to finish/take contact, and consistently are still concerns.  Guy just disappears every other game."
Ain't no one taking the Hornets seriously bro. Michael Carter Williams looked great as a rookie too!!!

"The 76ers fans saying Hinkie ""totally would've picked Porzingis but ownership overruled him"" are being revisionist. This is a verbatim quote from Tanking to the Top, I think chapter 7:  ""Hinkie's draft strategy was all about finding value. Reaching for a player like Porzingis, or Emmanuel Mudiay...would have been antithetical to this approach....If anything, he believed, Okafor would have more trade value after spending a year putting up numbers just like Michael Carter-Williams had. From here, the decision was easy.""  Okafor was Hinkie's pick. There's fairly calling out the league and Sixers ownership for their failures. It's another thing to go into full on wish-fullfillment  Also, cannot recommend Tanking to the Top enough. Great basketball read"

Michael Carter Williams
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
"passes on Mike Bibby, Dirk, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter for Michael Olowokandi. idk that’s pretty bad. Also picked reggie williams over Scottie Pippen, Lorenzen wright over Kobe."
Let’s ask Jahlil okafor how great that worked for his development. Ask Nerlens Noel also.  Michael carter Williams developed great playing unlimited minutes on trash teams with no direction.  The rockets are bad but giving these guys structure now benefits them more than bad minutes. Guys can develop in practice too.   Alperen has a fouling problem he’s had since the Turkish league. It’s better to fix that problem now rather than hoping he figures it out later considering he couldn’t just figure it out in the Turkish league either he averaged 28 mpg there.
Change Russ name with Michael carter Williams and he’s not in the league
Michael Carter Williams was a 1st option this century so definitely not.
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
"Evan Turner, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Michael Carter Williams. Philly has a horrendous record of first round picks"
"Michael Carter Williams, the modern day 5."
They said that about Michael Carter Williams too
Debut Michael Carter Williams
"i am by no means saying maxey is not good- he is great! simmons is better. I pointed to all the different teams because you said simmons makes the sixers as or more beatable, which is straight up wrong. And you’re pointing to the playoffs like that’s comparable to this game, which it isnt, and you’re right sixers should have won. They didnt. But the series before, simmons won with embiid out, in a playoff game. He also handily helped us get the 1 seed, going long stretches without embiid and winning anyway. What you’re pointing out as maxey being great is completely true, but michael carter williams did this in his rookie season, it doesn’t mean shit. Simmons has been outstanding for 4 seasons, and bad compared to his usual self in the hawks series. Which is the whole point. Simmons didn’t do what simmons could and we lost because of that. Your revisionist crap is ridiculous  You could at the very least build a playoff team around simmons, that is his floor. So yeah, (some) teams would be dumb to not want him"
Michael carter williams can do that theoretically

Ooooh no don’t even get me started on that. This is after Mike Dunleavy fucking elbowed Michael Carter Williams (what a coincidence) in the face earlier in the game and broke a tooth and didn’t get called for anything. He’d been playing dirty all game and Giannis was understandably pissed off. Not saying it’s right and I don’t think it should happen whenever a player is playing dirty but I don’t feel bad for one second about that and actually thought it showed more leadership than immaturity in Giannis.  Edit: “Fuck Mike Dunleavy” is a bucks fan rallying cry and it’s because of that one series of dirty play.
"He's not even Top 10 yet... but I'll humor your argument, even though your argument contains mostly shitty non-basketball related arguments. ""small college hero"", ""off the court class act"" lmao wtf does that have to do with the GOAT conversation?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Steph’s Accolade’s over 12 years:      3x champion 2nd all time 3-pointers 2x MVP (unanimous) 7x all star 7x all NBA All rookie first team 6-time all NBA 3-point field goal leader      Regular season career stats:      34.3 career mins per game 24.2 ppg 4.6 reb 5.9 ast 47.6 fg%  Some of the GOATS worth discussion (Lebron, MJ) both have 4 or more rings, in which they won Finals MVPs for all of them, have averaged 27 and 30 points in their careers, and are #3 and #5 in all time points respectively. Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"

"Can Michael Carter Williams retroactively file a bodily injury case against Harden now? Dude literally floated on the man's back to draw a foul. If that doesn't disgust you, idk man. Absolutely fuck James Harden."

"It should be the exact opposite. Michael Carter-Williams had one of the best debuts ever, and he became an average rotational player at best. Therefore, since Cade didn't have a good debut, he will become a superstar."
