Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer beater to beat the Lakers
"&gt;Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M  Was certainly an overpay for Bogdanovic but the Hakws had money to spend.  &gt;Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M  Malik isn't limited as a player like Duncan is and is actually really athletic and could improve as a defender whereas Duncan's main problem on defence is that he is slow and anyone can blow by him.  Also Malik's 4th year is a TO so he got like 45/3 (and it's an ascending contract so its worth more in the subsequent years so its more in like 42/3). &gt;Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2)  Certainly an overpay for a guy who made his money as a defensive stopper but he has surprisingly lived up to his contract  &gt;Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  Again Joe Harris actually has an offensive game outside of shooting 3's and is a better defender and rebounder so I'd say he is actually worth his contract meanwhile with Duncan you need to surround him with strong defenders not to bleed points."
"So why wouldn't a different shit team in need of a shooter throw the bag at him and force Miami to make the tough decision?  Other contracts from last offseason:  * Danilo Galinari: 3 years, $61.5M * Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M * Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M * Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2) * Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  $20M/yr might be a little high but every offseason seems full of ""wow I wasn't expecting THAT much"" contracts. I think the Joe Harris 4 years $75M is probably about right, maybe slightly more. 4 years $80M wouldn't be a complete shock."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, if only for the confusion it would create with Bojan.  To echo, Nitro, Lu Dort would be a-frickin-mazing. Similarly, Marcus Smart would be cool too."
"Why stop there? Trade KP for Jusuf Nurkic, get Bojan Bogdanovic from Utah and then Bogdan Bogdanovic as well from Atlanta.  Then we rename Dallas Mavericks to The Yugo Slavs and we all jointly convert to communism comrade."
"It's insane. Dragic-Doncic-Bojan Bogdanovic-Saric-Jokic was right there.    Nurk backup 5, Vucevic backup 4 because he can shoot and Nurk can probably guard the 4 spot when they're in together, and Bogdan Bogdanovic handles 30 of the 40 minutes the perimeter 3 starters sit and surprisingly Montegrin Javonte Green gets the final 10.   Maybe even close with Bogdan in for Saric and Doncic at the 4."
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I’m wrong. I don’t care
Bogdan bogdanovic: bogi Bojan bogdanovic: bogey
Bogdan Bogdanovic.
"Fun fact about him, he was a teammate of Bogdan Bogdanovic and Davis Bertans in 2011."
Bogdan Bogdanovic lmao
Bogdan Bogdanovic jumper is beautiful
"&gt;""The league conducted an investigation into whether the Bucks had discussions with Bogdan Bogdanovic and/or his agent regarding a free-agent contract prior to the date when such discussions were permitted. **The investigation concluded that early discussions did in fact occur**, constituting conduct detrimental to the NBA.""  Quit lying. What are you trying to land a job with the Bucks or something?"
Bogdan Bogdanovic
"When I read ""Brogdan"", I always think they ment Bogdan Bogdanovic"
Bogdan Bogdanovic.  I've watched Jazz local broadcasts and I think they sometimes call Bojan Bogdanovic Bogi as well.
Like 95% sure it’s Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
Bogdan Bogdanovic is an incredibly fun name to say
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Excited to see this years Serbian team.  Jokic, Boban, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bjelica is a talented group."
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
I do think Bogdanovic would fit better in the Bucks offense but the way that five have been playing I can't say they're regretting not having him too much. With the addition of Bryn Forbes I feel as if it'd be a little redundant if Bogdan was the starter and he was the backup though.
"[I'll just refer you to the league's official statement:](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1341068261228769282/photo/1)  &gt;The NBA announced today that the Milwaukee Bucks violated league rules governing the timing of this season's free agency discussions and that the league has rescinded the Bucks' 2022 second round draft pick.   &gt;   &gt;The league condu ted an investigation into whether the Bucks had discussions with Bogdan Bogdanovic and/or his agent regarding a free agent contract prior to the date when such discussions were permitted. The investigation concluded that early discussions did in fact occur, constituting conduct detrimental to the NBA.  If you want to die on the hill that ""early free agency discussions"" is way different than ""tampering,"" I guess go for it, but it's beside the point. It remains true that the Bucks cheated (for the second time), got caught cheating (for the second time), and got punished for cheating (for the second time)."
Yeah I think it’s fair to point out how we won’t actually know whom they are gonna end up relying on for their 5th guy in the closing 5. Looks like it might be Donte so far but we’ll see. Bogdan would’ve helped with his playmaking and versatility but he’s also kind of a guy for whom the idea of the player is a little better than the reality his impact metrics aren’t exactly favorable. Also teams would’ve gone after him a little bit defensively he’s not terrible but he would’ve been their weakest link on that end   Overall I think you can get opportunities later on to flip a cheap Donte for a similar caliber player like bogdanovic if the opportunity arises. For ex if a team has a Bogdan caliber player available at the deadline who’s about to be an expiring and knows they don’t want to pay him they’ll likely consider trading him for Donte over losing him for nothing. By not committing to that you don’t lock in your roster for good have a little flexibility and in the chance Donte happens to exceed expectations you can benefit
&gt; Long term?? They tryna win now  If giannis is a FA in 2021 then yes there’s dire urgency   Once he extended different ball game   Roster still isn’t young but they also have no remaining assets I wouldn’t want to deplete what’s left realistically to trade for Bogdan bogdanovic. Also bucks fans will get mad for me saying this because their owner would’ve paid this year but the track record of that dude ducking the tax on totality is what it is. Bogdan over Donte isn’t a big enough upgrade for me to want to lose what’s left of my remaining assets without having picks to trade especially when it costs so much with an owner for whom every penny counts and is cheap

Bogdan “klay Thompson” bogdanovic
"In todays league few digits on the boxscore can make a tens of millions of dollars difference in terms of contracts.    Take for example Bogdan Bogdanovic and Tobias Harris. They are not superstars, they may even not be all stars but they are good at what they do and if they get hot they can take away the game.   Tobias averaged 19p 4a 7r last season, Bogdan averaged 15p 4a 4r last season. Bogdan took 8 threes a game hitting them at 38%, Harris took 5 threes a game hitting them at 36%. Harris took way more other shots and has a decent percentage, Bogdan was not really used as a prime scorer more of a spot up shooter when he really shouldn’t be one.   Tobias is making something like 140 million while Bogdan is making 72. Tobias has basically double the money of Bogdan but the stats show him as marginally better player and more usefull to a team. If Bogdan was given a bigger usage and got more shots he would also improve the numbers on the stats and get even more money."
donte divincenzo ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint bogdan bogdanovic this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Jamal Murray and both Bojan and Bogdan Bogdanovic on bench for guard depth.   Also, what am I missing with the Irving placement in World team haha."
"&gt; although I have a hard time imagining doing worse with 20 million in extra cap, two 1st's, and a prospect  Two firsts in the 20s, a mid-first who looks mediocre at age-21, and the cap space equivalent of Bogdan Bogdanovic or Danilo Gallinari? You can't imagine that outcome being worse than a guy who has a TS of over 62% this year? Most of the guys picked in the 20s don't turn into much."
"Wow. How you leaving off my boy Bogdan Bogdanovic? Not only was he 25 when he participated, but he also is the oldest Rising Stars MVP."
Brogdan... a cross between bogdan bogdanovic and Malcolm brogdon
Dame  Jaylen Brown  Bogdan Bogdanovic (definitely butchered his name) OG Anunoby or Pascal Siakam  Steven Adams
"We will def need to dip into the Euro player pool for this as well.    C position is obv the deepest. Usually teams carry 3 Cs. Jokic, Vucevic and Nurkic would be the voices here. Boban is also available, Zubac. In Europe if needed there’s others, Zizic, Petrusev, Miro Bilan. Raduljica is pretty washed at this point. Kuzmic has looked bad, since coming back, Milutinov is always injured. I’m sure there’s others I’m overlooking.   At PF Bjelica, Saric are obv main choices. Dubljevic is a beast too, especially if you need a beefier PF.   SF - Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic. Kalinic for hustle, defense, versatility. Lucic, Djedovic. Maybe Davidovac if you’re desperate.   SG - Bogdan Bogdanovic, Guduric, Klemen Prepelic, Jaka Blazic. Nedovic if healthy.   PG - Presumably Dragic and Teodosic are still retired from international play. That leaves the the position pretty thin. Micic, Jovic are probably next."
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
"Also you signed Bogdan Bogdanovic who fills a lot of the same needs as Gallo, worse pure shooter, but Gallo at 20M with that roster makes little sense IMO."

"Height boost: Trae Young. 6’4 Trae with his skill would be the best offensive guard in the league, easy  Athleticism boost: bogdan bogdanovic, if he had a great first step and dunk-in-traffic ability he and Trae in this scenario are the most potent backcourt in the league, up there with prime Steph and Klay  Skill boost: Cam reddish. He is the one player on the roster with all the tools: height, natural talent, length, instincts: if his actual skill level catches up to his body he’s a top two way player in the league easily   Sigh, if only this were real"
"3 inch boost- Trae Young (6 ft 4 would make him insane)  Skill Boost- John Collins (great finisher, but him learning how to dribble and finish would be insane)  Athleticism Boost- Bogdan Bogdanovic (sniper, but imagine he had insane athleticism to get around guys)"
"Sorry, we need Bojan. We also need to acquire Bogdan. The goal is to have an unstoppable all Bogdanovic starting lineup, at which point the Jazz will have assembled Bogxodia and will go undefeated for the rest of the season(s)."
How are Bogdan Bogdanović and Bojan Bogdanovic not on the same team?
This was the Rocket’s version of the King’s fiasco with Bogdan Bogdanovic   Losing a good player because you are afraid of the contract he “might” get is inexcusable and furthermore because Wood AND even Allen making $15-20m would be tradeable
"We managed to finally recognize Bojan from Bogdan Bogdanovic, we can do it again."
"Midrange is dead today. The same problem Bulls would have guarding 7 screens on top of the key, Dubs would also have trying to guard a dude that pulls up as soon as he sees an opportunity, and is super-mega-efficient from there.   You can actually see how modern defenses are confused by mid-range jumpers that Lonnie Walker, Bogdan Bogdanovic (Hawks), or Kyrie often take, people freeze on those. Modern defenses guard for 3pt and for cuts, people are almost not taking mid-range jumpers at all and defenses ignore that possibility   MJ would feast on that."
"Luka wouldn’t have gone undrafted because draft rights are still valuable in case he ever wanted to come to the NBA later on.  The only way his first NBA contract could have exceeded the rookie scale would be if he stayed in Europe for at least three years after having been drafted. Bogdan Bogdanovic did that recently. [This RealGM article describes the rules governing some of these outlying cases.](https://basketball.realgm.com/article/238359/CBA-Encyclopedia-The-Rookie-Scale) :  &gt; If a player spends three seasons out of the NBA after they are drafted, they can sign a contract with the team holding their rights outside of the rookie scale as long as runs for at least three seasons and the first season salary is more than 120% of the appropriate Rookie Scale amount for that selection and season. The player and team could still agree to a Rookie Scale contract and the team holding the player’s rights still has exclusive negotiating rights- the player does not gain any form of free agency just by waiting out a franchise."

Bogdan “despite the bonk” Bogdanovic
People shit on Vlade Divac all the time but bringing Bogdan Bogdanovic over from Europe to Sacramento was one of the better things he has done.
"He's definitely improved this season, especially on Defense.   However, he's still more of a solid bench player at this point because he hasn't made a huge jump on offense as compared to some of the other guys that play the same position (DeAndre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic).  The future looks bright for Huerter. We'll see how he performs in the playoffs, but one thing is for sure. He has a TJ McConnell type of ceiling when it comes to playing on-ball Defense. Hes averaging the most steals on the Hawks this season (also his career best) and it seems under Nate McMillan he's only going to get better.  As for the Klay Thompson comparison, I don't think that holds up too well at least so far in his career. Kevin isn't as good of a shooter even though he's one of the many 3p threats on the Hawks. In my personal opinion, Klay is a super high IQ basketball player and his in-game decision making is what separates him from a lot of guys. Huerter is young but he hasn't shown that kind of brilliance yet. Although he has potential so you never know."

Bogdan Bogdanovic and Bojan Bogdanovic have entered the chat...Boban Marjanovic on deck.
This gives off heavy Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic vibes
I once accidentally drafted Bogdan Bogdanovic instead of Bojan Bogdanovic on Draftkings. Happy accident that led to winning $50
This is Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic all over again.
"That's what I'm saying. ""Nikola"" is hard to mess up, but I still sometimes cringe thinking about Chris Webber announcing Bogdan Bogdanovic as Rising Stars MVP. Not even Bogi knew what was happening."
"If your last name is Bogdanovic, why the hell are you naming your son Bogdan? Or are surnames different in that part of the world like Scandinavians are different?"
"Honestly, to differentiate Bogdan from Bojan Bogdanovic is only tough for the people who can't be arsed to do so"
"Think it'll be easier tbh, Bojan and Bogdan have similar first names but the same last name while Jokic and Jovic have same first name but different past name.  People call most players by their last name anyways so it'll be Jokic and Jovic instead of Bogdanovic and Bogdanovic."
"Considering Bogdan Bogdanovic is constantly called ""Bogey,"" this won't be good"
&gt;I think its already tough for a lot of people to differenciate Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atlanta Hawks) and Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah Jazz)  you're right about that bro!
"Also gobert, bogdan bogdanovic, and Rodman."
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"Rubio and Pau would fit there.   However this is kinda difficult to judge because a lot of Euroleague players get drafted but choose to stay in Europe longer for development.   Off the top of my head, players like Marc Gasol, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic would definitely be lottery picks at their European primes but they get drafted waaay before that."
Bogdan Bogdanovic? Bojan Bogdanovic?

"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."

Bogdan Bogdanovic FMVP Let's go
“no All-Defensive players”  Wow let me just say how great defenders Trae Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic are.
I remember some color commentator asking if Patrick Patterson is the American equivalent of Bogdan Bogdanovic
"PG: Doncic, SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, SF: Bojan Bogdanovic, PF: Vucevic, C: Jokic  Bench: Dragic, Pokusevski, Mirotic, Zubac, Bjelica, Boban, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Samanic...  2 All NBA players and 3 stars (Vucevic was an all star) in starting lineup. Crazy stacked bench.   This team would crush everyone except USA, and it would be on even levels with USA considering they have MVP and a Luka ""2 All NBA First teams in first 3 seasons in the league"" Doncic."
"Idk how to feel about this tbh. Bogdan Bogdanovic and Luka Doncic will play and they have had (well Bogdan’s season is still not over) a similar amount of games played like Jokic. I’m can’t blame him, he brought us happiness by being the MVP."
Bojan Bogdonovic vs Bogdan Bogdanovic  You could call it the Balkanization of Yugoslavia part 2
Someone like... Bogdan Bogdanovic? 😢
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
"Could be a three way trade. Maybe something where you end up with Bogdan Bogdanovic and John Collins, Portland gets Ben, and Hawks get CJ and picks from Portland"
"Bogdan Bogdanovic (and a Hawks 1st?) to Sixers, Simmons to Portland, CJ McCollum (and a Portland 1st?) to Hawks."
"But how often do people call Luka scary, violent, or intimidating?  Or Bogdan Bogdanovic?"
"I feel like this doesn’t really happen outside of jokic and maybe nurkic , like no one is talking about how u shouldn’t fuck with bogdan bogdanovic, or what a menace Boban is (at least not that I’ve noticed)"
"&gt; The Hawks might have also found a lineup combination that works to match the Sixers’ size in playing Danilo Gallinari at the four and Collins at the three. That lineup brought the Hawks back in the game late in the third quarter. That combination, along with Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic on the floor, played the second-most minutes for the Hawks and was a plus-five. Nate McMillan said he likes how that group is still able to retain shooting on the floor while being physical enough defensively to hold the Sixers. Collins has been the only player defensively this series who has done a solid job of guarding Harris, so it will be interesting to see how that unit is used for the rest of the series; it has worked despite that three-man group never being played together during the regular season."
Looks like a less sever case of what happened to Bogdan Bogdanovic earlier in the season
All I know is that I don't want any part of the Hawks this playoffs.  It would absolutely be the most Bucks thing ever to beat the Nets only to lose to Bogdan Bogdanovic and the Hawks.  Literally any other outcome would be preferable to me.
Embarrassed to say I only just now realized that there are both a Bogdan AND a Bojan Bogdanovic
Bogdan “Essential Worker” Bogdanovic always comes thru
"Bogdan Bogdanovic. He has such great handles, and plays so smooth"
"Vucevic, Dragic, Saric and Zubac.  And those are both Bogdanovic (Bojan and Bogdan, not related)"
Both Bojan and Bogdan have the same last name which is Bogdanovic. You messed it up both times and you didn't even mess it up in the same way lmao.
"Oh, Bogdan? Is that short for Bogdanovic, my favorite Jazz player?"
Bruh are you seriously debating James Harden vs Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Reggie Jackson can't win with these cats  Also how fucking insane is **Bojan Bogdanovic**? Dude's defense against Kawhi in the 4th quarter was truly something to behold.   I used to think Bogdan was the better Bogdanovic because I enjoyed his game so much, but man Bojan is fucking insane.  Obviously the 3pt that he's known for, but he can also handle the ball well, finish around the rim, or pull up from mid-range. And that defense is a god damn revelation. I didn't know he was that legit of a defender."
"Bron is Bron, Steph is good enough to guard whoever the SG would be (probably Bogdan Bogdanovic), Harden isn’t a great perimeter defender but he’s good in the post, and KD is lengthy af. They’d be ok especially with a good defensive 5."
Better comparison would which Bogdanovic is better. Bojan vs Bogdan?
Bojan vs Bogdan for the Bogdanovic Championship
"Serbia with Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic,Micic,Boban,Bjelica and Teodosic with some other decent bench players."
"Holy shit imagine if Yugoslavia was still a country. It's basically less than 20 million combined people in that area.   Fucking Jokic, Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Vucevic starting 5. Bench: Zubac, Nurkic, Dragic, Saric, Bjelica, Pokusevski, Marjanovic etc..."
that was Bog disguised as Bogdan Bogdanovic
Bogdan best Bogdanovic confirmed. For real though dude’s nasty!
"I blame the NBA for [blocking the Bogdan trade](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-draft-pick-bogdan-bogdanovic-trade-violate-tampering-rules). Look at how well he's playing for the Hawks.  And if you want to go back even farther, they should have resigned Malcom Brogdan instead of wasting their load on Bledsoe."
"I think if they fire Bud, they should ditch Lopez and just have Giannis play center against most teams. Giannis himself provides enough rim protection and they could be more versatile on D. They could also really juice their offense to another level if they can get another wing playmaker (cough *could've got bogdan bogdanovic* cough)"
why did marv just mutter bogdan bogdanovic lol
"Adam Silver, rigging shit against small markets so they cant even get Bogdan Bogdanovic, sad!"
"Yeah but few mill should be enough like 5 to 7 so you get excelent role player/playmaker for low tier contract, fun fact Bogdan Bogdanovic contract was 3years 27 mill i think"
"Sixers are bigger, more athletic, and more skilled than the Knicks (no offense Knicks fans). Trae is still deadly in the paint, but he's a lot more likely to face heavy contests/blocks against the sixers than against the Knicks. I'd say that's a way better option than leaving Bogdan Freaking Bogdanovic open for a corner 3"
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, Monte Morris..."
"This kinda annoys me. Bogdan Bogdanovic just means “Bogdan, son of Bogdan”. For Americans it’s the same thing as someone being named something something Jr., which there are plenty of. It’s the difference of two people being Mike Smith, and Matt Smith Jr. We have a huge population of international players now, not making fun of unfamiliar names is like the least we can do. I still see many people around the nba unable to spell or pronounce “Antetokounmpo” and he’s a two time MVP it’s kind of ridiculous"
Fun fact: Bogdan means God Given. So Bogdan Bogdanovic means Godgiven Godgivenic
Ok but if Atlanta wins you’ve gotta get a Bogdan Bogdanovic jersey
He'll shut the haters up when he locks down Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kevin Huerter next game and Trae drops 40 on Danny Green. Defensive player of the year? 😤😤
Bogdan Bogdanovic
Bogdan Bogdanovic = Gift from God who is a son of someone who is a Gift from God.
Ben Simmons might have been a total liability on offense today but did you see his defense on Bogdan Bogdanovic while Trae Young was cooking them 😤😤😤
"At the half  Ben Simmons - 7 points, 3 turnovers, 1/4 on FTs  Bogdan Bogdanovic (who Simmons has been guarding) - 11 points on 4/5 shooting.  Most overrated player of this generation by far"
"Herro will never be as efficient as Harris, and Harris can't shoot off the dribble like Herro, he's strictly a catch and shoot player. I think a better comp for Herro's likely celing is Bogdan Bogdanovic or Jordan Clarkson."

Bogdan Bogdanovic is the good version of Luke Kennard and what people wanted Kennard to be in LAC
I see you're just looking at numbers. If you truly think Bogdan Bogdanovic provides the same value as Mike Conley then it's pointless to debate
Well it’s not true. Forbes is a sniper but he’s not the playmaker / ball handler that Bogdanovic is. Bogdan could’ve been a great 6th man for y’all or secondary/tertiary playmaker.
"Conley is far better than Bogdan. You can make an argument the he's on same level as Bojan Bogdanovic, but not Conley."
"You’re right, you are being way more sensible saying that the owners decided to all come together and block a bogdan bogdanovic trade lol"
"He is a better defender, longer and better shooter Campazzo. I would be pretty surprised if he won't be successful in NBA. I foresee a Bogdan Bogdanovic-like career for him in NBA."
Bogdan Bogdanovic. Not terrible.
"Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, John Collins, and Kevin Huerter had never played in the playoffs before this season either."
Bogdan Bogdanovic has done things for the Hawks nobody could have ever expected.
Taj Gibson cannot be the only man going for a fucking rebound  Julius is the 2nd biggest man on the fucking floor and he’s letting BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC jump in front of him for rebounds  Box out you fucking choker
"One of our players used to play for fernbahce, Bogdan Bogdanovic!"
"Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"Without the damn gloating before the time it would have been ok, they'd now have Bogdan Bogdanovic and probably could be favourites even over the Nets."
"I heard if you stack Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic on top of each other, you create a Boban Marjanovic"
"No, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Bojan Bogdanovic are the sampe person. I mean, look at how similar their names are"
"Shout out to the guy that posted here that Bogdan was held back by the Kings in the middle of this game, even if Bogdanovic was bricking everything."
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
I wonder if they confused him with Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Idk maybe because I'm used to european basketball and anything goes there, mom, wife, sister, personal scandlas and insults and so on. There is big rivalry in my city, and when mom from the main player on other team was sick fans took exception and only went for direct insults to him and didn't go for mom jokes. Also some players ride that kind of atmosphere, can you imagine Bogdan Bogdanovic as a 19 20 year old and 10 000 fans cursing him, fans behind the basket fliping him off with middle fingers, and after that he went to fener and it is even worse in Turkey cause they have like 3 4 different derbies. And off the court and when he plays for National team everyone likes him."
"Chicago - Derrick Rose  Milwaukee - Giannis  Boston - Tatum  Warriors - Curry  Atlanta - Kevin Huerter (no clue why)  76ers - Iverson  Hornets - Kemba  Memphis - Zach Randolph  Washington - Nick Young  Lakers - Kobe  Pelicans - Anthony Davis  Wolves - KAT  Knicks - I immediately thought of Spike Lee and Mike Woodson before thinking about Melo, and am now realizing that Woodson also played for the Knicks in the 80s. So, Mike Woodson.  Toronto - Kyle Lowry  Miami - Wade  Pacers - Sabonis  Jazz - Mitchell  Denver - Melo again  Cavs - LeBron  Spurs - Timmy  Nets - Deron Williams (sorry Nets fans lol)  Portland - Dame  Phoenix - Steve Nash  Kings - Bogdan Bogdanovic (yeah that's an odd one)  Pistons - Andre Drummond  Magic - Dwight  Rockets - Harden  Mavs - Dirk  OKC - Russell Westbrook  Clippers - Blake Griffin"
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
Imagine what would have been if they didn't let Bogdan Bogdanovic slip away from their hand.
Bogey is technically both their nicknames but Brooks confused Bojan Bogdanovic who is on the Jazz with Bogdan Bogdanovic who is on the Hawks
"&gt; Are Bogdan and Bojan Bogdanovic related?   Bogdan is related to the late noted Serbian architect Bogdan Bogdanović, sharing the same name. However, he is not related to fellow NBA basketball player Bojan Bogdanović, who is Croatian."
Starting to think that Bojan Bogdanovic and Bogdan Bogdanovic  arn't actually the same player
This feels exactly like when my ex cheated on me with Bogdan Bogdanovic
Could use someone like Bogdan Bogdanovic feel like he would be a good fit 🤷🏽‍♂️
Its gonna be Bogdan Bogdanovic.   Legendary FIBA Bogi will reappear.
"Bogdan Bogdanovic said in an Serbian interview that he talked with Poku and told him to throw away European mindset that he is on a developing team and to use what organization provides him to get better, and to try out things since there is no harm in the stage of rebuild."
&gt;key role players like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kevin Huerter are questionable for Game 1 of the series  no theyre not lol we kept them out cause the last game didnt matter and we didnt wanna risk em
My brain didn't even try to argue that this wasn't Bogdan Bogdanovic.
"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"sad Hawks guard rotation  Trae, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Lou Will/Rondo, Kevin Huerter, Tony Snell"
Bogdan Bogdanovic has the prettiest shooting form I've ever seen
"You won't lose to the rockets with the season on the line, chill out lol. Bucks legend bogdan bogdanovic will ensure you win"
Bogdan Bogdanovic
"when silver punished the bucks of ALL teams for the bogdan bogdanovic trade.  how ridiculous was that?  i just felt like we can hear about trades months early like lebron, kawhi and kd.  but the bucks of all teams had someone slip a trade a day early and they get punished?   was it because the people who released it were to specific on terms?"

"Man, you're all sorts of wrong. Scola isn't 42, he's 41. I know that's not much of a difference but he was 39 when he ""carried"" Argentina to the finals. So it seems like two years is a huge difference in your mind. He also didn't carry the team. Deck, Campazzo and Vildoza are now in the NBA in part due to the amazing performances in the WC. That team was also comprised of well stablished players in Europe like Laprovittola (MVP of Liga Endesa in 2019), Brussino and Garino (all of whom had NBA experience as well). Since you claim to know European basketball so well I believe you should know this. Now, you gotta help me out with this, since I clearly don't know european basketball at all. Which 3 second rules are you talking about? The one by which you can't be in the paint for three seconds if you're the offensive player? Because that one's in the NBA, too. In fact, the NBA has the more restrictive rules, since you can't do that also if you're the defensive player. In FIBA, though? You can live in the paint if you're defending. Now, are you claiming that Giannis can't dominate because defensive players would just wait for him in the paint? It seems like you need to watch him play more, you seem to have the notion that he just jumps from the free throw line and stuffs it in the rim and that's how he got two MVPs. So, two times MVP Antetokoumpo can't carry Greece, but Luka Docic can carry a Slovenian team who has had absolutely no experience in Olympics nor WC. 39 yo Scola can and did, according to you, carry Argentina to a WC final. Finally, you say that all big teams were missing key players. Argentina knocked out Serbia in the quarter finals game. Their best player was Nikola Jokic. I know you claim you watch european basketball so you probably don't know who he is. He's the current MVP of the NBA. Other notable NBA players were Bogdan Bogdanovic (he played in the ECF with the Hawks), Bjelica and Boban Marjanovic. They also had Micic, which is the current MVP of the Euroleague. But you knew that already, you know a lot of european basketball.  In the Semi finals, Argentina beat France. Their best player was Rudy Gobert. As in, NBA's current DPOY. Also on that team: Fournier, De Colo, Ntilikina and Batum. So tell me again, who they were missing? Serbia didn't have 34 yo Teodosic which is a great player but far from the best. He got injured before the WC. So I guess that makes Argentina a non contender for these Olympics. The fact that you think an amazing yet young player like Doncic can carry an unproven and, to be honest, fairly mediocre, Slovenian team past Argentina tells me you know 0 about european (or latin american, for that matter) basketball."
Bogdan Bogdanovic
"Trae Young is going to be eating the cap soon after next season with Clint Capella, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Danilio Gallinari currently eating most cap space. They can trade one of these guys to make room for Collins max. Do Hawks believe Reddish and Hunter will stay healthy and improve? Hawks need player who can handle the ball, and be the playmaker to push Trae Young off ball to accept that role in certain situations. As of right now the Hawks are flexible to go in many different positive routes."
exactly.       Q: Is Bogdan Bogdanovic the new Manu Ginobili?      A: Can he swat a bat?
"Bogdan ""Trae Young"" Bogdanovic"
"&gt;But it still might be closer than it seems because marginal US players are more likely to be in the NBA than non-US players, and not all the top 500 are in the NBA.  I actually agree with this, as much as international scouting has improved, I get the feeling that there's still a lot of guys kicking around the upper tiers of European basketball who could have been nba players but just slipped through the cracks. Of course this is more my gut feeling than a data backed hypothesis.  I would be really interested in a closer look at the topic of basketball in ex-Yugoslavia. My casual count has put the total around ~~17~~16, but I might be missing some, and this includes an iffy one in Cedi Osman.

"I think i would easily rather have Bogdanovic because he would be around for more than one year while offering insane spacing and off-ball playmaking to the Bucks. The problem is that we were going to give up Donte in the Bogdan trade as well so when it comes down to Bogdan vs. Donte and Tucker it’s close, but I really think Bogdan would take us another level offensively."

"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"I mean other than the Harden trade (which is obviously a unique situation) Marks has never really ""fleeced"" anyone in a trade. I mean for the first few years of being a GM he was never really in position to anyway but overall, I think the majority of his trades have been mutually beneficial.  -Trading Thaddeus Young for the pick that became Caris LeVert. He traded a good starter with 3 years left on a very good value contract for a 20th overall pick. Far from a fleecing, if anything its him who got the low end of the bargain (you'd expect at least some random young guy on the roster who doesnt get many minutes to be thrown in for the sake of it but that didnt happen).  -Trading Bogdanovic for Nicholson+the pick that becomes Allen. Bogdanovic was an expiring so getting a 1st for him was great (even better that we got Allen out of it) but we still had to take on Nicholson's contract (dude was playing in China only a few months later with 3 years left on his contract) and its still only a late 1st for a very good starter. Looks worse with Bogdan not staying but they were still 1 game away from the ECF which is the farthest they'd been in nearly 40 years.   -DLo. Sure in hindsight getting DLo for the 27th pick+Lopez seems like a fleece but DLo's value was at his lowest then and the Nets had to take on probably the worst contract in the league to get him. And  we know with hindsight that the pick was used for Kuzma (who for all we clown him for, getting him at 27 is amazing value) and the cap space was used for LeBron.  -Carroll trade. Got a 1st (used on Musa who was traded for Brown) and 2nd (Kurucs who was a throw-in in the Harden trade) to take on Carroll's contract. Sure he was good for us once he got here but again, his value was at an all-time low when we got him and the picks were not great. The Raps got the cap space needed to finish off their championship roster so far from a fleece there.  -Crabbe. Traded Crabbe+2 1sts for Prince and the cap space needed to get KD+Kyrie.   Not really surprising Marks isnt getting the same treatment. Yea the poison pill contracts were pretty crazy but I think most teams acknowledge that they were an act of desperation to try and bring more talent in when he had limited resources and that screwing over the other team was the side effect not the original intention."
"yes, a no trade clause, so it'd have to be somewhere he wanted to go. that was something they could discuss with him early on in the process. as for the trade kicker, I'd say it's worth a trade kicker and, like, Tony Snell to get a pick.

Lou Williams - 7 million   kevin huerter - 2.6 million   John Collins- 2.7 million   clint capela- 15.5 million   bogdan bogdanovic- 18 million   Ummmm should I even put the bucks starting 5 salary? Lol
at this rate looks like it will be Dario Saric vs Bogdan Bogdanovic and you will like it.
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC. HE IS COMING FOR THAT GOLD IN THE OLYMPICS

"He scored 20+ shooting 40% from 3 when he started 2 years ago. So yeah maybe he wouldn't start for the KD Warriors, and yeah, ""starting quality"" is not a very constant level. I could of course say him being good enough to start for the Kings with Fox injured makes him by definition starter quality, but I think he could've started over, say, Bogdan Bogdanovic for the Hawks this year. They had similar traditional stats, Bogdanovic had better DBPM while they had similar OBPM, and Bogdanovic had slightly better TS% but he had Trae Young to take the attention off him, while Hield had slightly better playmaking numbers. Very similar player to Bogdan Bogdanovic, who I hope you think is ""starting quality."""
Joe Harris 🤝  Bogdan Bogdanovic
HERE COMES BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC
"You’re sexy, you’re 6 foot 6, your name is Bogdan Bogdanovic"
"The Bucks originally traded for Bogdanovic and signed him this off season, but the negotiations took place prior to the time when it would be legal. This happens every year, every time you see a guy 'signing' at midnight when the window opens, it's obvious that the negotiations took place earlier when it was technically illegal.  Woj reported the signing as complete, and the league vetoed the trade which allowed Bogdan to sign with the Hawks instead for more money.  The Bucks came away without their guy and were penalized for tampering, and lost a 2nd round pick as punishment.  He would have been pretty nice on this roster. But instead we keep Divincenzo  who was part of the deal. He's a good player with a different skill set than Bogdan and it's nice to still have him, although he is injured and out for the playoffs."
Hot take. Bogdan bogdanovic should be in this discussion.
"Sure Trae can shoot better and is more efficient.   But since when did Trae ever lead a team with no floor spacing to the playoffs? It took Trae a team of Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Galinari, and a coaching change in the middle of the year to get to the playoffs, let alone the conference finals. In the Eastern conference   We can always pull up the fact the Russ is a way better rebounder than Trae, and at best Trae is a comparable passer. But Trae wasn’t even in the playoffs before this season.  So Russ"

bogdan bogdanovic
Norman Powell/Bogdan Bogdanovic type of player
I'm still thinking about those midseason threads of people saying Bogdan Bogdanovic was better than Trae and the team might be better without him.
"Bogdan ""Yo fuck the bucks"" Bogdanovic"
"G - Jamal Murray  G - Mikal Bridges  F - Bojan Bogdanovic  F - Ben Simmons  C - Klieber  Bench:  F - Covington  G - Hardaway Jr  C - Gasol  Everyone on this team are good 3 point shooter and do not require the ball to be effective.  Murray and Bogdan are capable of getting their own shots and play-making.  Simmons would be the main ball handler as well as the main screener and roller.    Defensively, this group can switch 1-5.  Switch Kleiber or Bog with Covington for an even more elite defensive unit depending on the matchup,  Switch Gasol in when facing embid, jokic etc"
PG Jamal Murray  SG Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF OG Anunoby  PF Ben Simmons  C Christian Wood
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
"But fr i think team world can compete.  Starting 5: Steph/Kawhi/KD/LeBron/AD vs Luka/Murray/Giannis/Embiid/Jokic  7 Bench Players: Dame/CP3/Harden/Booker/Tatum/PG/Turner vs SGA/Hield/Bogdan Bogdanovic/Anunoby/Siakam/Bam/KAT  You can add Gobert or Ayton over Hield but they have too many bigs not enough shooting or perimeter  Also just realizing the top 10 C in the NBA nationality are international if you count Bam - Nigeria, KAT - Dominican. Turner is the best american C"
To clear up money for next year to re-sign John Collins. This was reported by multiple hawks reporters all through the year.  Even the kings reporters said this.  https://www.sactownroyalty.com/2021/4/30/22412679/sacramento-kings-news-bogdan-bogdanovic-sign-and-trade-tony-snell-atlanta-hawks
Bogdan   Bogdanovic  Bowl  The real BBB
Bogdan Bogdanovic is about to play in the ECF against the team he was almost traded to.
Bogdan Bogdanovic == Joe Harris
Bogdan Bogdanovic
[Highlight Request] Bogdan Bogdanovic having an existential moment staring into the abyss.
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic  More Bogdans available across various sports and in general across most of Eastern Europe."
"The Hawks strength is their depth.  Their second most impactful player is probably Deandre Hunter who is out with torn meniscus.  The next most valuable guy is probably Bogdan Bogdanovic.  But Capela, Collins, and Gallinari are right there with him."
I'm legit terrified of the Hawks tbh  Ain't nothing more on-brand for the Bucks than to have Bogdan Bogdanovic have the playoff series of his entire life to thrash us in the ECF...
Joe “Bogdan Bogdanovic” Harris
"I kind of find it hard to believe. 3 hours? I know Bogdan Bogdanovic would make over a thousand shots every day before leaving the gym. And I imagine a lot of NBA players do the same thing, or at least did when they were younger. If I had potential to make the NBA I'd be workin out 5+ hours daily for sure"
"Yeah there is, generally when an rfa ends up being sign and traded its because the original team hasn't submitted the signed offer to the nba officially, and they offer the original team the chance to sign him to the same contract, and trading him to the team.  An example of this would be Bogdan Bogdanovic, we offered to not submit the signed offer to the nba and allow the kings to sign and trade him to us, because if you match a RFA then you can't trade him for 6 months."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic is the hawks version of ben simmons, minus the contract."
Bogdan Bogdanovic is the hawks version of ben simmons
"FYI:   Bogdan Bogdanovic is out for the rest of the game due to right knee soreness, per the Hawks."
Bogdan Bogdanovic make one fucking free throw man
"collins and bogdan ""joe harris"" bogdanovic don't have it. This is gonna have to be a carryjob from Trae if they want to win this"
Bucks Legend bogdan bogdanovic throwing rn
Can we check Bogdan Bogdanovic birth certificate to make sure he was born in Serbia not Philadelphia?
Bogdan “The Essential Worker” Bogdanovic takes no days off
"Trey Burke got years and a trade kicker by taking a discount with the Mavs  But really the common way it happens is as a throw-in to a max deal (like AD had one), and as part of an RFA offer sheet to try and stop the other team from matching (Atlanta gave Bogdan Bogdanovic a 15% trade kicker to try and keep Sacramento off matching)"
"&gt; Do players sign that to insure themselves, if they're traded to a shit team at least they get more money?  Yes.  The other common situation where players get trade kickers is restricted free agency (RFA). In RFA, the player's current team can match any offer you give, so you put trade kickers in the contract to make them less likely to match.  For example, Atlanta offered Bogdan Bogdanovic 4/72 with a 15% trade kicker. They don't really care about the trade kicker because they want him to be their starting shooting guard for the next 4 years. Sacramento has Buddy Hield making a bunch of money for the next 3 years, though, so they probably _would_ want to trade Bogdanovic. So they wound up not matching the offer and Bogdanovic became a Hawk."
"For me its Bogdan Bogdanovic, Ben MacLemore, and Klay Thompson"
"Bogdan Bogdanovic plays WoW. David Robinson did as well. I know it’s not cartoony, but they’d be way more “taboo” than playing Mario would be"
made this team contendors?   didn't know Danio Gallinari and Bogdan Bogdanovic is another way of spelling Trae Young
"Oh yeah at one point he mentioned that we would've been bad without the Bogdan thing, but then described the wrong Bogdanovic"
"come on...Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bruce Banner, same initials...coincidence? I think not."
"You know nothing about Euroleague. Sergio Llull is world class,  De Colo is world class, Bogdan Bogdanovic is great (you should at least know him), Printezis is world class... If you don't watch their games just see videos on youtube"
"Bogdan Bogdanovic has a pretty handy 1-on-1 game. Bojan less so, but he's still not a unidimensional player on offense like Danny Green or Joe Harris."
"Lmao sure but raptors had players like Vanvleet, Siakam, Anunoby, and Lowry miss games, while Hawks had players like Can Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, and Bogdan Bogdanovic miss games. While good players, they don’t provide near the defensive impact of the missed Raptors players. If you’re using the coaching change excuse, can the raptors use the “playing in a whole ass new country” excuse? Also lmao the fact that u said the Hawks are a younger team than the raptors just shows how full of bs u are. For the coming szn, the raptors have an average age of 25.0 years, while the Hawks have an average age of 25.9 years."
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
Yeah I didn't even think of the price tbh. Hawks may be trying to elevate their status in the NBA to legit contenders but it's not worth the price especially when you have to ask after the trade how much did this really improve our team. Ben on the hawks sounds fun but complicated as well. I think it'd be more centered around Bogdan Bogdanovic and Cam rather than John Collins though. I doubt Philly says yes anyway though and as a hawks fan I'm not even sure I'd do this.

\*Puts on tinfoil hat\*   Blame teams like Miami and Toronto who pushed the NBA to crack down on sign and trades by investigate the Bogdan Bogdanovic trade because they thought it would impact Giannis's chance of signing the supermax instead of going to their team. /s
"&gt;He got great future thought and medals.  Australia is given a near-automatic spot at the Olympics because one team from FIBA Oceania makes it by default.  Two months ago Slovenia wasn't expected to make it through the qualifying tournament. Several NBA players couldn't even take part in qualifying tournaments because they were still playing (e.g. Giannis, Bogdan Bogdanovic) and their teams couldn't qualify. Same goes for why Slovenia didn't even participate in the 2019 WC --qualifiers were in the middle of the NBA/EL seasons.  Unlike for Australia that will make every Olympics and WC for the next three decades, Slovenia might not even be there again for three decades, unless qualification windows are at a convenient time."
"&gt;and Serbia  Huh? Serbia has a relatively deep team. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bjelica, Boban."
"One thing that Sam Amick mentioned recently on Tim Kawakami's podcast is that he also felt alone/""lost his security blanket"" after Bogdan Bogdanovic and ex-GM Vlade Divac (and maybe also ex-Assistant GM Peja Stojakovic) left in 2020 making him the lone Serbian left on the Kings. Warriors also have known Serbian coach Dejan Milojevic on their coaching staff"
"Team World reshuffled:  Starters: Doncic, Murray, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Giannis, Jokic  Bench: Rubio, SGA, Bojan Bogdanovic, Sabonis, Embiid  Wildcards: Simmons, Gobert, Siakam  Unsure if he counts: Kyrie"
If they also had Bogdan Bogdanovic
"That's not so certain btw. I remember reading that the only 'guard' that had similar stats/attributes to Lonzo that ended up being worth that sort of money was Bogdan Bogdanovic and even then that's debatable. I think Lonzo gives his third team the most value, he's a fine player, im also fine with Griff not going the Lonzo route, because IMO there are more worlds where he's never worth that deal."
"If he had suitors, I don't think it would've mattered. Bogdan Bogdanovic said something similar and had a liberal interpretation of signing for a contender. Maybe he doesn't have suitors at  the number we including myself thought he deserved. I don't think anyone with space who wanted him would risk leaving him in the market for this long if they wanted him because he's willing to take a paycut."
[The double irony coming from a bucks fan.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-second-rounder-for-tampering-with-bogdan-bogdanovic/amp/)
This is the reporter version of the Bojan vs Bogdan Bogdanovic issue.
We are losing a second rounder next year: https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-second-rounder-for-tampering-with-bogdan-bogdanovic/amp/
"I got it wrong, it looks like after the trade was agreed to then the Bucks lowered their offer to Bogdonovic after the Jrue Holiday trade.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/01/report-bucks-lowered-offer-to-bogdan-bogdanovic-due-to-jrue-holiday-trade/"
"&gt; Neither does bogis agent to gain anything from it being reported either.  Other than more money because the Sacramento Kings ended up not matching the increased offer the Hawks gave Bogi?  &gt; Bucks had more to gain, they were trying to show giannis how theyre making moves to keep him around and the intent helps if it fails.  The deadline for Giannis to sign the supermax was near the end of December. If the goal is to communicate to Giannis they're trying to get him more help (this is after the Jrue trade anyway), they a) could have just had a private conversation, and b) can let the trade be announced when it happens - still well before the supermax deadline.  &gt; Bogi and his agent had the most to lose, especially if he wantsd to come to milwaukee  There's no reason to believe this is true. In fact [the opposite](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bogdan-bogdanovic-trade-to-bucks-in-doubt-as-he-plans-to-enter-restricted-free-agency-per-reports/):  &gt; The sign-and-trade hit a major snag on Wednesday when The Athletic's Sam Amick reported that Bogdanovic himself had not agreed to the trade. As he is a restricted free agent, a sign-and-trade would only be possible if he agreed to a contract with the Bucks. As he apparently has not, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that he will enter restricted free agency on Friday.   If you've got other information then great, but I don't know how you've come to these conclusions."
Yeah you right. Think I was just primed by the other thread of Bucks fans calling it an ESPN conspiracy around stopping Bogdan Bogdanovic from going to Milwaukee lol
You think ESPN would conspire on what would be a huge scandal to stop Bogdan Bogdanovic of all people from going to the Bucks?  lol
The Bogdan Bogdanovic
"https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-draft-pick-bogdan-bogdanovic-trade-violate-tampering-rules  yes, the bogdanovic trade was disallowed by the league and would never have been allowed because it was reached through publicly evidenced tampering"
"Bogdanovic had no clue about the Bucks trade lol, he's not friends with Giannis, he's friends with Thanasis. It was the Kings being stupid agreeing to a trade before Bogdan agreed to a contract."
"Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic &amp; Bogdan Bogdanovic"
"Well that's a good environment for him, good hard working coach, exactly what he needs. But I am afraid he ll stay in Europe with Barcelona and coach Jasikevičijus for a season or two (probably 2). But his ascend reminds me of Bogdan Bogdanovic, he was picked as 27 pick, than went to coach Obradović for a couple of seasons, than went to NBA. Think Jokubaitis will not stay for 3 seasons in Barss but he will progress under Šarunas, for sure"
Warriors Legend Vince Carter  Bucks Legend Dirk Nowitzki  Bucks Legend Bogdan Bogdanovic  Cavaliers Legend Andrew Wiggins   I can go on all day
"I get why he's asking for 20m up, it's a weak free agency year and he's young and determined to get better.  It's also tricky because when you watch Bogdan Bogdanovic (18m) or even Kevin Huerter, guys like that can also come up to the mid-range and have more to their bag offensively than Zo does. And they give more gravity to their teams too.   Zo is a very confusing dude. He's like Danny Green with some playmaking but I know he wants to make another jump and he's 23, so young enough to do it probably. 🤔"
"Tell me you can’t read without telling me you can’t read. Lemme quote the article for you bud. It’s the very first sentence, can’t miss it.  “Reddish is probably fourth in wing rotation right now, behind De’Andre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kevin Huerter.”  So what’s his trade value when he’s the FOURTH wing in the rotation and the Hawks are actively shopping him to afford other players?"
"You.just.observed Evan Fournier destroy team USA and that's what you took out of it?  In single games that variance can be huge. Bogdan freaking Bogdanovic can outplay Steph Curry over the course of one game. The distances are not that great when talking of top 50-100 of the NBA.  I dispute that you have watched a single game in your life. Your take is so mind bendingly out of how basketball is that you cannot account how the Warriors superteam lost 3 games to Harden+Paul, that you cannot account the Fiba WC team US catastrophe, you pretty much cannot account for like 1/3rd of all games ever.  Yes! Over the course of (theoretically) infinite games team US *destroys* team Europe, not over the course of a single game or even a few games. Chances are like 70-30 or 80-20 in favour of team USA. That's not ""and it's not even close"", it is far closer than you give credit (to it), literally 1 in 5 games the 20% chances team beats the 80% chances team, it is a semi frequent event."
"Shai, Murray, and Embiid don't count. They're not from Europe.  Out of all the active European players in the NBA right now, these are the best ones under 30: Antetokounmpo, Doncic, Jokic, Gobert, Sabonis, Porzingis, Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Anunoby, Markkanen/Poeltl.  So your starters would be Luka, Bogdan, Sabonis, Giannis, Gobert. Best pieces off the bench would be Jokic, Vucevic, Anunoby, Schroeder, Valanciunas, Porzingis, Markkanen/Poeltl.  They'd go pound for pound against USA, with USA having better depth despite them having no real superstar.   \- That defense is obviously better tho (since their centers aren't turnstiles on D, plus they have better wing defenders too, Mikal and Murphy are gonna be so good), and they got good playmakers too (Young/Suggs/Mitchell/Booker can run an offense to an extent, we can put someone like Cade here if we want some playmaking).   \- USA got better shooters (duh), better perimeter defense (Europe's good defensive wings are Anunoby, Bogdan and Giannis, and even then Giannis isn't really an excellent on ball defender since he feasts on help defense; the rest are decent/average/bad) and USA, they're a jack of all trades master of none team (can do pretty much everything).   \- Europe could heavily depend on Luka PNR with Gobert/Giannis (Gobert hasn't developed an offensive game outside of catching lobs, and Giannis can run the PNR only when Gobert is off the floor since he clogs the paint) or Giannis drive &amp; kick (which can easily be countered since USA can just use the wall, they have the sizeable players with good defense that can set this up). They don't have that many catch and shoot guys, these guys are more creators of their own offense.  \- Porzingis is a shooting guard in a center's body, Sabonis, JV, Vucevic, and Jokic are bad at defense (but their offense is better than USA's), Markkanen has regressed since his rookie days, Poeltl hasn't shown much offensive upside yet but his defense is really good.  &amp;#x200B;  So take that as you will. I think I'm favoring US here, since they have the versatility on both ends of the floor. Defensively, Europe would heavily struggle if they needed stops but offensively they could outshoot team USA."
Bogdan Bogdanovic wasn't allowed to be signed and the bucks lost a pick.
Bojan and Bogdan Bogdanovic
"I'm convinced they were doing their best to piss Boogie off  They draft WCS in 2015, a rim-running center that doesn't shoot and was also already 22. If they were dead-set on an old rookie, and it had to be a big cos Kangz then Kaminsky was still available  The next year, they took Marquese Chriss with the 8th pick. For whatever fucking reason they then traded Chriss to Phoenix for Papagiannis (another big man) &amp; Labissière (another fucking big man). The only reason this trade isn't as criticized as it should be is because they got back the draft rights of Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"Could you imagine team Yugoslavia:  Luka, Jokic , Boban, Jusuf Nurkic, bogdan Bogdanovic, dragic, Vucevic, zubac, mirotic.   That’s a fucking squad right there…"
"True, and I'm on your side generally here and understand the difference between clubs and national teams, but certainly Serbia's or Australia's full team is comparable to healthy tanking teams like OKC in the first half of the season and better than injured tanking teams like OKC in the second half of the season.  And if Doncic played for Serbia (his dad is Serbian) or of course if Yugoslavia existed, Serbia/Yugoslavia would compete for the playoffs in the NBA due to an elite offense with Doncic, Jokic, and Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"I don't think they *want* to, but they have 6 quality  players that play positions 2 thru 4. Gallinari/Bogdanovic/Collins/Hunter/Reddish/Huerter are all capable of being starters,  and Atlanta can't realistically afford keep them all.   Gallo and Bogdan just signed, Collins likely gets a max after his postseason performance,  the hawks are reportedly high on Hunter being a key piece going forward, Huerter is capable of being the 6th man as he had been at certain points. Reddish is just unfortunately the odd man out"
"3 Bigs and no shooting guard?  Yeah you lose, even from a worse (on paper) team.  Starting 5 is never your best 5. You have to have team that can execute plays and defend on the other end. How can you defend the perimeter with 3 bigs (+Bojan). Fournier would go for 40 against such a team, not 28.  In short , replace Vucevic w Bogdan bogdanovic and you have something resembling a team. I mean you still get cooked in the perimeter . At least you do not have 3 big bodies being stuck in screens for half the game."
"Luka - Bogdan Bogdanovic - Bojan Bogdanovic - Vucevic - Jokic   Dragic Micic Saric Nurkic Zubac Bjelica   I dunno if they win, but that roster is probably on par with the US roster."
Bogdan Bogdanovic and Christian Wood  We would have a lineup of Steph/Bogi/Wiggs/Dray/Wood (Klay comes back slowly and eventually overtakes Bogi’s spot) and that’s definitely one of the more well rounded ones out there
"The league stopped them from getting Bogdan Bogdanovic and him + Donte are an interesting upgrade to the roster IMO.   If they can find a guy who can score like that and put him in more instead of PJ, I think they can do some damage.   Giannis having to score 40-50pts for them to stand a chance every game is a tough ask. I think they upgrade and maybe can go again though."
"His release ended up being for nothing, because the sign-and-trade for Bogdan Bogdanovic fell through. Such a shame."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic 3rd team imo  Also you’re missing Kawhi, LeBron doesn’t belong on that list"
"The more interesting question is what would have happened if the Bogdanovic trade had gone through. Do they still think they need PJ at the deadline, do they have the assets to acquire him, and do they still make it out of the East with Bogdan instead of Tucker? Would Bogdan's offense offset PJ's defense on Durant?"
Sign and trade for bogdan bogdanovic
"Bogdan Bogdanovic was really good, his contract might be an underpay"
All Ill say is he did his part to get in the way and played a role in the Bogdan Bogdanovic fiasco last yr.
you could easily bench Sabonis and put in the other Bogdanovic - he's been pretty good. That way Bogdan could play the 2 and Bojan could play the 3. Both natural positions too
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Luka, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Giannis, Gobert  Jokic&gt;Gobert, but not on this team imo. Gobert and Giannis create an incredible defensive frontcourt, which is especially important when none of the other 3 are good defenders. Jokic also shines when the play is run through him, which wouldn’t happen as often as you’d want with Luka and Giannis out there  Chose both Bojan and Bogdan because their shooting is needed, and really there just aren’t  many great options for European players outside of the big men"
"&gt; Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?  That was an exaggeration, but at least 4 of them played equivalent or better in years without Trae. And the rest of the have never played without Trae, so there's no way of knowing.  1. Gallinari: 18ppg in OKC then 13 ppg in ATL  2. Lou Williams: 18ppg in LAC then 10ppg in ATL  3. Bogdan Bogdanovic: 15ppg in SAC then 16ppg in ATL  4. Clint Capela: 16ppg in HOU then 15ppg in ATL  &gt; Hayward played 4/6 games  He averaged 10ppg and wasn't around for the rest of the playoffs to get to that point. Hardly, anything helpful to the team.   &gt; So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.  Wtf?!?!? That's a reach on what I was saying. I said the best players were injured and Kemba was certainly injured and his per 36 numbers certainly show that. Doesn't matter how man minutes he played.  &gt; Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours  Lol wtf does this even mean?"
"PG: Steph SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: Lebron  PF: Zion C: KAT 6: Drose Bench: Bridges, bridges, lamelo, RJ Barrett, Myles turner, THJ"
"It's extra-interesting when the star is not American and decides to skip playing for the National Team ... that kind of went the opposite of what you're describing  I have to say our Serbian fans, after an initially rocky relationship, have really embraced Jamal. But every off-season we get a bunch of fun proposals to trade random guys for Nemanja Bjelica and Bogdan Bogdanovic lol"
Bogdan Bogdanovic
"In terms of what? I mean most euros historically are on the older side since the waive of drafting young euro prospects is fairly new. And summer league as mentioned doesn’t matter, but here are some euros that exceeded expectations as rookies and had strong seasons: Dario Saric (best comparison imo), bogdan bogdanovic, Luka Doncic, kristaps, Pau and Rubio"
"Idk about myself but a National Bogdanovic Association would be fun, Bojan and Bogdan just going at each other for 82 games + playoffs"
"bogdan  bogdanovic was tremendous when he was hot with the hawks, especially during the end-stretch of the regular season, but during like the last games against philly and early games during the bucks, he was cold, as in cold, he was disgusting to watch"
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
"I mean I don't know what they could've done to ""protect"" his value. Yeah sure maybe having a stretch 5 option to allow him to play with space when Embiid is off the floor could've helped him.  Sure Embiid maybe shouldn't have said what he said post game 7.  Sure Doc was an absolute coward after the same game 7 throwing Simmons under the bus despite being as much, if not more, of a problem in that series.  &amp;#x200B;  But the sad truth is that Simmons was bad, in a series in which he was most of the time guarded by an injured Bogdan Bogdanovic, Solo Hill and Kevin Huerter. I'm not sure how they could've really protect his value,he's not a top 30 player in the playoffs that's it"
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
Davis Bertans and Bogdan Bogdanovic are good friends from their time playing in Serbia which is something some fans wouldn’t know
Lavine is better than Donovan. Jazz just have a way better team. Bogdan bogdanovic is better than rj Barrett.
"Harrison is a gem of a human being. Also, just to add, so is Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"MVP: Trae Young  All NBA first team: Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Hurter, John Collins, and Clint Capela"
"* My bold prediction is that Bogdan Bogdanovic will not hold onto the starting spot in Atlanta. Seems like a lot of younger guys are ready to break out for them. * Unsure of the Nets lineup--other than the Big 3 (and KD can play multiple positions), I think we'll see a variety of lineups. They sure have a lot of talent. * I know Charlotte played Rozier at the 2 and Ball at the 1 last year, but I think that will change depending on the matchup given LaMelo's size. * Porzingis at the 4 and Kleber at the 5 is not happening IMO. I see Porzingis at the 5 with Kleber or Finney-Smith at the 4, unless Moses Brown earns the starting center spot. Not sure why teams keep bouncing on that experiment, he had a great season last year. * I think Olynyk will start the season at the 4 for the Pistons, moving Grant to the 3. * I don't see any way Marc Gasol starts for the Lakers. Luckily LeBron can be slotted in almost anywhere, AD has some flexibility, and there are some other role players that can get a shot.  * Sorry, but P.J. Tucker should not be starting for the Heat. Even Markieff Morris would be better, ideal situation is Omer Yurtseven comes in off his hot Summer League and moves Bam out to the 4 for a twin towers effect IMO."
"I've got one. On draft day of the 2016 NBA draft:  Phoenix receives Sacramento's 2016 first round pick (#8)  Sacramento receives two 2016 firsts (#13 and #28), a 2020 2nd round pick, and the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic.  It's not lopsided by any means. I think it would have been a wash if Bogdanovic never came to the league. However, the picks ended up just being a whole lot of bleh.  That 8th pick was Marquese Chriss, who has flashed potential on the Warriors fairly recently, but got pretty badly injured and hasn't played in a while.  That 13th pick was Georgios Papagiannis. We know how that one ended up.  The 28th pick was Skal Labissiere, who was almost projected for the lottery, but kept falling, and apparently for good reason. He's not on a team anymore.  The 2020 second round pick was eventually traded to Memphis on draft day 2020, and became Xavier Tillman (traded for Robert Woodard and a 2022 second rounder). Tillman's a solid rotation player.  -------------  Out of anything, the pick of Georgios Papagiannis is the biggest headscratcher out of this whole trade. Obviously, this isn't at the magnitude of picking Bagley over Luka, and that 2016 draft was kind of crap in the late lottery and mid first round. Honestly this was just a lose-lose for everyone. Both teams had been gunning to find their next solid big man. In recent history, the Suns used major draft capital to select Alex Len (2013), Dragan Bender (2016), Marquese Chriss (2016), and finally Deandre Ayton (2018), while the Kings had picked Thomas Robinson (2012), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Papagiannis (2016), and most recently, Marvin Bagley (2019). House SunKings indeed."
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
"Bogdan isn't even the best Bogdanovic on this list, let alone better than the three all star big men."
"if you listen to McDonough every good pick was McDonough's idea and every bust was Sarver's idea. He's quick to point out that he drafted Booker and Ayton but is pretty quiet about Alex Len, Tyler Ennis, Dragan Bender, trading up with Bogdan Bogdanovic for Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, and Elie Okobo. McD was even sniping the Mikal Bridges pick saying he wanted to get Sahi instead when bridges had his shooting hitch but now is suddenly all in on Mikal now that hes proven to be one of the best 2 way wings in the league. You cant trust anything this guy says about the suns  His tenure oversaw the absolute worst period of history for a franchise that had never been a bottom dweller but if you listen to the guy on twitter youd think hes a genius. Its pretty damning that the team was turned into a finals contender two years after he was fired with 80% roster turnover."
"I kinda struggled with the Russell comp because Bryon was also really good defensively, so a guy like Ingles wouldn’t be a great comp. Covington could also work I guess. With Hornacek I had trouble coming up with a guy in the league today that was as good a shooter but not an impact defender or a particularly high volume player. Maybe Bogdan Bogdanovic?"
"It's a bit of an overreaction for sure, but it's not a gambit without a lot of risk.  See: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Gordon Hayward."
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
Didn’t they screw up trying to sign Bogdan Bogdanovic?

Bismack Biyombo -&gt; Brandon Knight   Kemba -&gt; Jimmer   MKG -&gt; Beal   Jeff Taylor -&gt; Satoransky   Cody Zeller -&gt; Len   Vonleh -&gt; Elfrid Payton   PJ Hairston - Bogdan Bogdanovic   Frank the Tank -&gt; Winslow    This honestly winds up being just as bad lol
"https://youtu.be/T5hrCQrSghU this scenes were usual 5 6 years ago its much more calmer now.   Btw that is Washington Wizards legend Bertans. And the guy in red who threw other dude on the floor is Duke Legend Demarcus Nelson, you can see Warriors draftee Charles Jenkins no22, Nuggets fans can spot Joffrey Lauvergne(or however his french name is spelled) and for Bucks fans can see Bucks legend Bogdan Bogdanovic at the end."
"Shooting. We could really use a third wing who can space the floor at an elite level while not being a huge defensive liability— a 3&amp;D player like Mikal Bridges would be awesome, but even a Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, or Bogdan Bogdanovic type would be fine with our other defensive pieces. People have been overstating our need for playmaking, we've got a bunch of really solid passers (Smart, Schroder, Al, even Tatum when he wants to be) and we'd be averaging more assists if we had guys who could consistently knock down open shots."
"He really is horrible.  He's great when he shoots the ball, and terrible at every other aspect of basketball.  Kings fans used to argue who should start, Buddy or Bogdan Bogdanovic.  Just fucking lol"
"&gt; even an interesting rotation player  While on the team I assume? Given the draft assets used to acquire the player, it's probably Bogdan Bogdanovic. Maybe Bjelica as well, who signed with the Kings after spending three seasons in Minny, was decent in the bubble year, and then got benched to give Bagley more minutes.  Otherwise, they strike out early and often."
Well that’s because Bogdanovic means “son of Bogdan” and Bogdan is a very common Slavic name.
"He can, should, and will.  Western Frontcourt options are a little weaker on the top end because Kawhi and Zion will not be in contention. *Possible* that LeBron isn't, but I would assume he comes back soon and is a lock.  Nevermind Draymond's scoring and shooting numbers. He's playing DPOY-level defense for the best team in the NBA. If the latter holds up, or is close to holding up, I think he should be a lock to get voted in as a reserve by the Coaches.   Starter voting leads to 3 frontcourt starters. That should be between PG, Jokic, AD, and LeBron. With one not starting, then that leaves 2 out of 3 Coach votes that must be frontcourt players.   Out of those two remaining mandatory frontcourt slots, KAT deserves to get in. And then it's basically between Harrison Barnes and Draymond, maybe Bogdan Bogdanovic.  And there's still two ""wildcard"" slots for Coaches to vote for.   Draymond's making the All-Star team."
"I want to know what you mean by great. Top 20? Top 30? Top 50? Top 100? Top 150?  Are we going to start calling every single solid starter a great player? Lonzo ball is great? bogdan/bojan bogdanovic are great? current gordon hayward is great?  Great has to be at least a fringe all star. You don't have to make the all star team but your name should be in the 5 or 6 ""snubs"". Like Lou williams that one year."
"the NBA didn't void the bogdanovic contract he never agreed to a contract with the bucks. And every team in the league tampers in free agency but it's never taken seriously  Bogdanovic interview:  &gt;When the news came out, we were like, ‘What the fuck?’ I didn’t know what was going on. I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure what was going on.   &gt;   &gt;I was sleeping. I woke up, and I saw my phone blowing up. I shut my phone down. I couldn’t believe it. Really. It happened like that. It’s not the part that you were traded (that bothered him), but it’s more like you feel a little be-traded. No one let you know about it.   &gt;   &gt;And weeks before that, we talked about how everything — we wanted to keep it the same (with the Kings), you know? Or a month before that — I don’t even know. I felt we were building something special, you know? And OK, I understand the business and everything, but you know at least you have to let your player know first. At least.

"I don't think aibwykat's comment was a straw man, though it may have been unclear.  Are the Kings' parts truly even a good product? Up until the last couple of drafts, they were really only riding on Fox, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy. They've had Richaun Holmes, Bjelica, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. They finally hit with Tyrese Haliburton and now Davion Mitchell. But tell me how a roster with those players as the core is supposed to keep up with the other Western juggernauts. Their incredibly lackluster drafting for more than a decade now (with pretty much only Fox and Cousins as hits) and their mishandling of draft assets (see the Stauskas trade) are out of Walton's hands. The best coaches in the NBA may have dragged these rosters to a low playoff seed a few times but they've been devoid of talent for a while.  That said, I agree that Luke should have been fired long ago."
grayson kinda looks like bogdan bogdanovic with that haircut
Bojan Bogdanovic - Bogdan Bogdanovic
Hawks get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Juancho Hernangomez (filler)  Celtics get:   * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * John Collins  * Cam Reddish  Hawks end up with the best player overall. Celtics turn two really good players into three really good players.   Hawks run Trae/Brown/Huerter/Hunter/Capela  Celtics run Smart/Bogdanovic/Tatum/Collins/Horford with Cam Reddish off the bench
Bogdan Bogdanovic is still a thug and a punk bitch
"This Atlanta is now weaker with Reddish and Hunter. They are bad shooters + small bb iq. They totally killed Huerter and hid Bogdanovic.   Bogdanovic and Huerter have a lot more sense for team play and ball flow. If the coach does not see that, they will not go further than the first round. Last season they started to play well after injuries to Reddish and Hunter 2 very one-dimensional players who will take fg from much better shooters Bogdan, Huerter and Galo  The Hawks won't be good if Hunter and Reddish take 20 fg + they don't know how to spread the game, tunnel vision. Offensively very limited passing + shooting.   If they want to fight again for the East finals then they must not allow Reddish and Hunter to have bigger usages than Bogdanovic and Huerter, especially Bogdanovic who is a far superior team player and tactically much better with a far bigger bb iq  Of course, most Hawks fans will not agree with that, but they will see for themselves in a few months. Hunter and Reddish will spoil the chemistry, the team from last season with their one-dimensional game"
