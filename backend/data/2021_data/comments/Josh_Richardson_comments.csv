Josh Richardson could be that guy
Josh Richardson
GM  also kinda fucked up trading Seth Curry on that steal of a contract for Josh Richardson.
How’s Josh Richardson been? The trade for Seth curry was widely considered a win/win trade at the time
Soon lol IMO don’t think that though. They have been fine but I think it’s the rest of the team hasn’t been great. They should have never given up Seth curry. Josh Richardson isn’t that good as he should be. And lots of their games have been close. And I thought people were nuts to believe they were gonna be a top 2 seed knowing that kp was gonna e out a month
"Speaking from a Sixers fan, Josh Richardson is just a bad shooter. He's not a 3 and D guy - he might be hot some nights to bring his average to 32-34%, but most nights he's not going to shoot it well."
I get what you’re saying but in last nights game josh Richardson was the best mavs player and it wasn’t close
"Josh Richardson was awesome tonight, his defense is pretty highly rated by most I think and it's still underrated."
Josh Richardson needs some of those Ball Hog gloves... dude is timid as hell when dribbling.
"They were overrated to begin the season, they clearly lost the Josh Richardson trade, and their bench played historically well last year which they haven't been able to replicate but everyone will just blame COVID instead when several other teams have dealt with the same thing lol"
"Brunson has been really solid. Kleber was having a great season until he got covid.  KP, Josh richardson have been awfull.  Powell has also been bad but he was injuried for almost a year and the last few games he seems to be regaining form."
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn’t Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De’Andre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
"Well Josh Richardson was out with Covid for most of that month, along with 2-3 other starters and our 6th and 7th men. Having Curry would not solve the issues this Dallas team is currently facing."
"now put al horford, james ennis, and josh richardson in there"
Wasnt it defense that you guys needed more of? And that's why you traded for Josh richardson?
"""JRich defense can replace JJ Redick's shooting"" ""JRich defense can replace Seth Curry's shooting""  What team will talk themselves into replacing a historically great 3 point shooter in their rotation with Josh Richardson next season?"
"Something about Josh Richardson must cause insanely hyped teams to disappoint lol, happening in back to back years"
"Josh Richardson isn’t good people, Spo product and podcast player"
"I don't get why people were saying this was a ""win win"" trade with the Sixers. Seth Curry is one of the best shooters in the league and on a really good contract. Josh Richardson is an above average shooter and better defender but it ain't making up for what Curry brings on offense."
I like Josh Richardson
"KP (#2 offensive weapon) was out with the meniscus recovery, Josh Richardson (3a offensive weapon) was out with covid, (Dwight Powell (the only backup center with any pick and roll ability) was out with covid, Dorian Finney Smith (2nd best defender who shot 37% on 3s last year) was out with Covid, and Maxi Kleber (best defender/shooter who is shooting over 47% on 3s this year at the Power Forward position) is out with Covid - all these players have been out at least 9 games. Jalen Brunson (backup point guard and is shooting almost 50/40/90 on 12ppg) was also out with covid protocol for like 5 games."
Josh Richardson is an excellent defender.
Think Philly would accept Josh Richardson and Tyler Bey for Seth Curry?  That would certainly help.
"Josh Richardson and James Johnson are a combined 8/41 on 3’s off of passes from Luka  Analysis: that’s bad  THJ, Burke, and DFS shooting pretty well in fairness  https://go.nba.com/lh57"
"&gt;  last summer JRich for Seth trade was brought up surprisingly frequently last summer and if anyone would have suggested that the Sixers would have to attach a mid 2nd rounder to get Seth, they would have been down voted into oblivion.  He didnt have a good year in Philly. HIs value has consistently dropped the past 2 years. I remember Zach Lowe even saying months before he got traded to Philly internally Miami was let down by him in 2018-19 somewhat, they were hoping for more offensive development.   He was an All NBA level defender in 2018, he hasnt been as good on that end since then. The hope was after 2018 he could be a 38-39% type 3 point shooter instead he looks more like a 34-35% type guy. He just stagnated out when the hope was he could continue to build off what he was his first 3 yrs even if it didnt mean future all star.   I still like the trade for Dallas and frankly still think 2018/2019 Miami Josh Richardson is a better player than Seth Curry. But his value has definitely fallen."
"Like I said it’s not in an effort to create efficiency for himself. Teams respect his shot enough to contest it, and that’s really all that matters. If he can draw defenders he can create openings. Efficiency will come when his 3rd best creator isn’t Josh Richardson and his 2nd best plays little to no minutes with him."

Remember when that homer Tjarks wrote a long winded article comparing this Mavs team to the 2020 Lakers and that they were title contenders cause they got Josh Richardson? What an IDIOT
" We've been going 10+ games with most of our rotation players out due to Covid and KP just came back like 10 days ago but hasn't played b2b's outside of one. We've also had like the 5th hardest SoS to start the season  Maxi, Dorian, Josh Richardson, Powell, and Brunson have all missed 5-10 games. That's most of our Perimeter Defense and depth in general. It's basically been Luka, THJ, sometimes KP + the 3rd String."
"not an actual pick but 2015-16 heat had dragic, wade, joe johnson, bosh, amare, deng, winslow, whiteside, josh richardson, and haslem. would be extremely deep if they were all in their prime"
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"2nd-6th best players (Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson &amp; Dwight Powell) have all missed nearly half the season. We've also had the 5th hardest SRS schedule thus far. As of now the remaining schedule is the 29th hardest."
"Tim Hardaway Jr, dorian finney-smith, josh richardson and every pick available"
Josh Richardson iso-ing against Gobert early in the shot clock....the fuck is this team doing?
Josh Richardson

"They were a playoff team 2 years ago led by D'Angelo Russel, Harris, Lavert, Dinwiddie, etc. Lavert and Jarret Allen were homegrown, Harris and Dinwiddie were good pickups/developments. Your organization sucks, that doesn't obligate other organizations to suck too. Where are the players the Kings have been developing for the last few years? Not Fox, I mean projects or mid-tier expectation type players that make significant strides. The Timberwolves too. That's what the garbage franchises really have in common, they only have one pipeline of talent, lottery picks. Garbage franchises are incapable of scouring the undrafted talent pool to find gems like Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn, or make smart prospect acquisitions that they can then mold, or draft a good project in the 2nd round that takes a couple of years to develop but then turns into a role-player-caliber starter like Josh Richardson. Don't worry about how amazing Miami is to live in, worry about why the Kings suck at drafting and scouting and developing players and choosing coaches. People like you cry about how the supermax shouldnt count against the cap and how the league should do all these things to help small market teams. No amount of CBA manipulation will ever help trash franchises because those teams will never overcome themselves."
"Been underrated every point in his career oddly.  The fact that Morey traded Josh Richardson on an expiring contract, for curry locked up for 3 years is insane."
"They’re missing 3 of their best role players, including Josh Richardson who was their big pickup this offseason. Nobody’s an all-star outside of Luka and KP, but the team has some talented role players. They’ve just been out for 2 weeks so we’ve been playing our rookies and end of bench guys who aren’t playoff caliber rotation players"
"Without Maxi, DFS, and Josh Richardson we don't have 3 of our best defenders and 3 guys who can at least reliably hit a 3."
"We are missing Maxi and Porzingis who would be covering Demarcus, there's literally no chance he would be popping off like this if we had someone that could actually guard him.  Our two best wing defenders in DFS and Josh Richardson are also out so Eric Gordon wouldn't be feasting like this either.   I don't know how many times in the game threads we have to keep saying that 3 of our starters who are also our best defenders are out with Porzingis sitting this one. Are you sure you're a Mavs fan? You seem like you have no idea what you're talking about"
"I mean he’s not entirely wrong, but it’s definitely a combination of both. Horford absolutely wrecked our spacing and we basically swapped him and Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and Danny Green in the starting lineup"
Freaking need our guys back. Having Iwundu shooting corner 3s vs Josh Richardson or Finney-Smith is huge. Although he did hit the clutch FTs at the end
Danny Green and Seth Curry aren’t in his way like Horford and Josh Richardson were last year too.
We had the best offense in the league last season. I don't think the difference between Seth Curry and Josh Richardson would take us out of the top 10.
"Seems like Lavine would be the most likely scenario with Dallas being his likely destination. A package of THJ, Dorian, possibly one more role guy and some picks thrown in there. Can’t see them moving Josh Richardson yet. Seems like they figured tyrel terry would be their new Seth curry but hasn’t gone exactly to plan. Lavine seems like a potential solution.  Dark horse; oladipo at discount price due to his expiring"
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson are all still out for Covid protocols and have been for over a week now. They’re also our 3 best defenders."
Josh Richardson of the Mavericks is an Oklahoma guy and so is Shake Milton of the Sixers. Josh might give Blake griffin a run for his money on the “Active” section for Oklahoma. I guess if it’s all seasons considered I’d still pick Blake but in recent years I’d argue for Josh
"Oladipo isnt the only player in the top 25-35 player range that’s going to be available, not by a long shot  there’s more reliable players that are also better that become available each season  paying 30% of the Heat’s cap to Oladipo for 4-5 years isn’t nearly as enticing as you seem to think, no chance we do it without some chance to move him in a year or two and giving up a incredibly valuable 2027 1st for Oladipo is simply a non starter  The Heat offered Josh Richardson and a mid 1st for JIMMY BUTLER when he was on the Wolves, you haven’t been paying attention if you think a 2027 1st is on the table"
"Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and then Powell is still out"
Also let’s not act like Josh Richardson can’t score. He easily swaps as the number 3 option with THJ for the Mavs
"Yeah my friend texted me saying ""oh yeah I forgot THJ is out that's a big one. Then I was like oh wait, Brunson and Dorian and Maxi are out too shit. Then I realized Powell and Josh Richardson are out too.""  That's 6 rotation players and 3-4 really important players for us."
"I realize that as well, but the only guy who's out who helps with that is Josh Richardson a little bit. I do not feel confident in paying KP $30 million a year or whatever he's making when the guy is so limited outside of his outside shooting. Does very little to help the offense otherwise."
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
I am now ready to give Josh Richardson a max
OUT:  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson
"So far it's definitely been those two, but I think THJ and Josh Richardson are our 2 best by the year's end."
Tyrell Terry is Poor man's Seth Curry. Josh Green is really poor man's josh richardson.

Need Josh Richardson and Maxi Kleber for sure
"I could easily see Dallas taking a chance on him. He'd be a great perimeter defender alongside Luka, and we could have him play the 4. His spacing would hurt us a bit, but we have Porziņģis and THJ who are great 3PT threats and Luka and Richardson who are capable 3PT shooters.   &amp;#x200B;  C: Kristaps Porziņģis   PF: Ben Simmons  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Richardson   PG: Luka Dončić  I don't know how we would acquire him though. Pick swaps and/or future firsts, and role players? Doesn't seem like it would be enough."
Probably not by much. Can’t coach a good offense when Josh Richardson and Raul Neto are the only guards on the team
"Teams have no leverage, it's either pay Dipo what he wants or overpay the next best player at that position which would be Derozan, Hardaway, or Josh Richardson.  Again you aren't just letting THJ go, you're literally giving up around 5-7 players just to sign Oladipo. You then have to fill up the remaining roster spots with the MLE and minimum contracts."
Trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson will do that to you
Josh Richardson deserves that talk more than Luka lol. But I'd love to see them both on an all-defense team .
"Brett Brown rarely ran it, his offense of the motion strategy of move around the top of the key until a lane opens up inside for a pass/drive  Embiid has looked ungodly amazing when it’s run, however it was mainly with Josh Richardson last year who was hot/cold from 3 so not a real shooting threat"
I remember thinking at the time when they traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry that must mean they really arent gonna make a move on Harden because of all this lol.   The problem is this new play in format reduces the number of teams who are gonna be looking to tank post deadline.   This will never happen but hypothetically lets say they keep Maxey would you be willing to do Maxey and Seth Curry for Aaron Gordon. I think I would.
"&gt;Butler was traded straight-up for Josh Richardson.  You can't be serious. That was a sign-and-trade.  &gt;Malcolm Brogdon  Another sign and trade. You kind of suck at this.  &gt;the Celtics are paying Charlotte two seconds just to take Hayward off their hands.  That was for a massive TPE.  &gt;you can't whine about the Lakers being willing to trade Ingram ( and four other players, plus picks ) for one season of Davis   I haven't whined about the Lakers. And they weren't trading for one season of AD like the Celtics would have been. He made it clear he wanted to be in LA and didn't want to be in Boston."
"&gt;None of those guys were gettable without at least one of Tatum/Brown.  Butler was traded straight-up for Josh Richardson.  Not on that list, but Malcolm Brogdon was traded for a late-first, and two future seconds.  Meanwhile, the Celtics are paying Charlotte two seconds just to take Hayward off their hands.  Finally, you can't whine about the Lakers being willing to trade Ingram ( and four other players, plus picks ) for one season of Davis if you're not willing to take the same risk."
"We don't have Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Bruson and Maxi Kleber. We are missing 3 starters + our backup guard. Even with KP back we are still missing a lot."
"This is a post about how great the Mavs defense has been so far, partly due to swapping defensive liability Seth Curry for a great wing defender in Josh Richardson. It was absolutely the right move for the Mavs (and for the Sixers too)"
"I mean I would say its more my views on what impacts a team winning. Only way to defend this point is to give a legitimate post and discussion, though I know these are better received on r/nba discussion.  Siakam's offensive game is a little individualistic for me. He's asked to create often, but does it mainly from these post-ups that he's just not very consistent with yet. He can make passes thought doesnt look to use his athleticism to create for others. To me, I can see MOST of his impact on the box score. He's still a very good defender which people often forgot when he wasn't playing well offensively in the playoffs.  On the other hand, Draymond instantly makes those around him better, particularly defensively. Golden State all of a sudden started playing much better defense as soon as he was on the floor. In basketball, the back line of the defense sees everything and to have a player as smart as him out there to coordinate all the players helps the teams defense drastically. Siakam improves defense on 1 guy, Draymond improves the defense on 5 guys.  On the offensive end, Draymond has clearly regressed, but people don't give enough credit to some of what Draymond can do. I am unsure if he's still able to do this (this season will tell more) But in 2019 against Portland, he was exceptionally smart running the fast break. He was often pushing the ball but while understanding where everyone else was. In transition, he's genuinely a point guard and does a great job finding trailers and setting up threes. He's not only a playmaker in the half court. I also think all his skills become more important in the playoffs, whereas Siakam's shortcomings end up hindering him more.  Toronto is a team with people like Lowry and Van Vleet. If this is still close to prime Lowry on this team, I would rather have Draymond on that roster because i think he makes both of those guys waaaay better. Lowry has a second creator, and he would be able to set great screens and find these guys for better shots. Right now, the Raptors offense has a lot of tough shots that Van Vleet is forced to take (though he's doing great with). I think that would get much better with Draymond. The team lost a smart, defensive IQ player to lead the defense in Gasol and I think it will show.  Again, its closer than you think and I understand valuing Siakam more, especially when the Raptors may feel they need that scorer. but I just think most of what Draymond and lots of players in this league do gets underappreciated. Denver will be a worse team since they will be playing MPJ instead of Jerami Grant. Chris Paul will be the most impactful player on the Suns even just averaging 13 points. Josh Richardson has made the Mavs starting lineup so much better. It's just not all about points for me."
"We are missing 3 starters + our back up guard right now. Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Brunson. If this keeps up, we will have Luka + rookies. Josh, DFS and Maxi are literally our 3 best defenders as well. We are so fucked."
"Volume, shot type (pull up/ catch and shoot/ spot up) defender distance  Harden shooting 37% from 3 isn’t the same as Josh Richardson shooting 37%. Harden being able to self create so many looks makes him way more valuable as a shooter than Richardson. Trae is a similar case"
I'm still mad that Josh Richardson is J-Rich now instead of Jason Richardson
This is an awesome write up and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for sharing and I'm definitely going to keep a look out for Josh Richardson this season now.
"swapping Seth Curry for Josh Richardson made us a better team, Josh Richardson is the better player overall though. Don't say he's better just because the team is playing better"
"I think this trade works and fairly equal in value:  Raps: Zubac, Pat Beverley, Josh Richardson  Clips: Lowry  Mavs: Marcus Morris  Raps get decent value in a young prospect Zubac, who could be their future center and two quality wings. Clips get their man at PG and Mavs do this for Luka since he's always getting bullied."
"[Hes getting paid $11m per year for the next two years](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/dallas-mavericks/josh-richardson-17868/). In an era that values 3 and D wings, that’s a sweetheart deal"
"Surprising:  willie cauley stein. I thought he would not be a factor in the rotation, but seems Mavs actually play better with him on the floor. Happy for him.  Disappointing:  josh richardson. He's not bad, but i hope he can become even better in the games to come. Maybe also a bit more consistent on offense."
"When Josh Richardson clapped at the official after Jokic shoved him, I felt that"
Josh richardson !!
Josh Richardson wtf
"Tough shot by Josh Richardson. Great defense, better shot"
I love Josh Richardson
I’m going to kill myself if Josh Richardson shoots one more time tonight
im clowning he just called Dorian Finney Smith and Josh Richardson both Tim Hardaway so far tonight
Josh Richardson is...meh
"Nuggets - have a legit 1-2 punch of Murray and Jokic, and could be legit if MPJ emerges.  Suns - they've been on fire since the bubble, and CP3 raises their ceiling to just a notch below contender  Mavs - Luka and KP are legit, but there are defensive question marks, which Josh Richardson might be burdened to solve  Blazers - call me optimistic, but the Blazers might finally have put an excellent team around Dame and CJ with RoCo and DJJ as legit defensive wings and Jusuf (who I expect to shake off the rust and play much better soon)  Jazz - Donovan and Rudy are studs, but there are questions about their perimeter defenders and secondary scorers.  Warriors - it's really Steph, a little Draymond, and no one else."
"Josh Richardson barely scores consistently, truly can not play make to save his life, and his defense is over rated. But sure he’s younger. Go off king."
Imagine trading a 45% three point shooter on arguably the biggest bargain contract in the nba for Josh Richardson.
"I asked a lot of Mavs fans during preseason how they felt about that trade. Received a large dose of people crediting the system for his 3pt efficiency, and a lot of people saying the trade off for more defense made up the difference.   Josh Richardson has been Josh Richardson so far, but man I still don’t know if that trade was a good idea. Curry is just straight up better, and was a big contributor to their historic offense last year."
"Since I have nothing better to do, I will try my best to do every team the best I can  Atlanta: Trae, Collins, Capela, Hunter, Huerter, Reddish, Bogdanovic  Brooklyn: KD, Kyrie, Harris, Levert, Allen, Shamet, TLC  Boston: Tatum, Brown, Kemba, Smart, Pritchard, Thompson, Grant Williams  Charlotte: Lamelo, Graham, Washington, Bridges, Rozier, Hayward, Carey?

I don’t even think that’s the case.   The reason why we’re winning so many games because of Simmons defense.   People underrate how impactful he is on the game. They focus on his shooting but watch how it impacts a game.   Josh Richardson was not a good pairing with Ben Simmons last year. He’s not really a shooter. Now that we have Seth and Danny Green it’s completely different.
"They weren't as homerish as I had thought they would be, but it sounded like they hadn't really done much research on the Mavs. They said that Josh Richardson loved it in Philly and didn't want to come to Dallas (the reporting has been the opposite), that Powell was a stretch 4 (we wish), and they were just guessing how old Luka was (they settled on 22 or 23)."
"Heat, shooting guards. Last time we had a bad one was 2002. Even then it wasn’t terrible.  2003-2016: Dwayne Wade  2016-2018: Josh Richardson  2018-2019: Dwayne Wade  2019-2021: Tyler Herro  2021-2027: James Harden  👀  Edit: didn’t read whole post. Nowhere near Suns lol I thought you were asking what your team’s rich history was"
"I mean, he’s actually more the fourth defender after DFS, Josh Richardson, and Luka. Which makes him look even better."
I thought that was Josh Richardson?
"Luckily no! Dominique, Spud, Josh Smith, Jason Richardson and Dee Brown are the judges"
1. MJ 1985 double clutch... cradle... reverse?  2. VC 360 Windmill  3. Aaron Gordon under 2 legs  4. Jason Richardson reverse between the legs off the bounce  5. Josh Smith windmill over K-mart
Me and someone on here came up with a Josh Richardson for Seth curry fake trade like 12 hours before it happened on here lol but I didn’t actually think he would be available either   Would you do either of these   Thybulle mike Scott and whatever other matching salary for Patty Mills  Thybulle and a 2nd round pick or two for Devonte Graham
"Depends.  New Orleans got 3 firsts, an All-star, another starter, and two good bench players for Davis.  Meanwhile, Jimmy Butler only cost the Heat about 1 first and Josh Richardson."
Seth Curry &gt; Josh Richardson may also have helped
"Mavs fans are fucking toxic. It's gotten to the point whre Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle and now Josh Richardson (formerly Tim Hardaway Jr.) get hate and are diminished in their value/impact as a means of propping Luka up.   Luka is incredible. Very likely he goes down as the Mavs GOAT if he stays here long enough. He for sure has the skillset. But you don't need to blame everyone else to make him look better. That sub has just basically become a Luka hivemind and then a ""no we shouldn't fire Rick Carlisle, or trade Kristaps Porziņģis and a first round pick for Andre Drummond"" minority.   The amount of hate Kristaps gets on there is unreal. He's our 3rd player to average 20+ ppg since Michael Finley in 2002, but you'd think he was Erick Dampier the way folks complain about him. He's barely removed from knee surgery and is still averaging 21 &amp; 8 on 47/36/84. Jaren Jackson Jr. had the same surgery 2 months before him and still isn't even back on the court.   It's just super reactionary over there."
"I believe people just love narratives man, or maybe the media has trained them to.  If KP could stay healthy longer than 5 minutes, no one would even be talking about this.     The Mavs made the trade because Josh Richardson is a massive defensive upgrade over Seth Curry, it's not even close.  That hasn't changed, they had a perimeter defensive problem last year way more than a scoring problem(i.e. they didn't have a scoring problem), it's been addressed.  The problem is KP isn't giving them any consistent output this year.  If the second best player on the 76ers was playing poorly and I wrote an article saying..oh man they really miss Josh Richardson, how dumb would that sound? Yet that is what's happening here."
&gt;The anti Josh Richardson  My favorite type of player lol
Yeah Gordon is also a legit floor spacer regardless of what his %s are teams guard him. The anti Josh Richardson per se. Solid on ball defender who can switch actually like him better vs quicker guards than Danny green. He has issues never passes not good at quick decision making and injuries are also a concern. But still I think it’s worth it   Lowry is hard to gauge he’s an FA after this year but my guess is he won’t be a raptor next year. I actually think Toronto would listen even with their recent streak if someone made a legit offer.
Er...I think Philly's record has a lot more to do with how well Embiid is playing than a Seth Curry/Josh Richardson swap.  I'd also say the new coach probably has more to do with it as well.
"Yeah he's been the leader (or one of the leaders) in 3PT assists for the past few years. I believe he was the leader last year while passing to Al Horford, Josh Richardson and Tobias Harris."
"Josh Richardson.  You sir, are ass."
"Ah yes it's the semi-annual ""I can't believe the Mavericks traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"" game."
"Overrated: Not sure, Josh Richardson maybe  Underrated: Jalen Brunson"
hard to overstate how little I miss josh Richardson doing that shit
Josh Richardson
"Belive it or not, there is a slight difference in passing to Joe harris, irving, KD, and throwing lobs to DJ and passing to Finney-smith, Josh richardson, james johnson and throwing lobs to WCS lma"
"Richaun holmes, josh richardson, justise winslow"
&gt;  6 years ago and haven’t been discussed since and then ask other too disprove it.  It wasn't 6 years ago. It was written in 2007!  &gt;then ask other too disprove it.  You are the one that said it was disproved multiple times though. If you just said you don't know much about it but doubt it I would understand but I really think it holds up.  &gt;One minute you are bringing up Cameron Payne as this big loss and the next the suns have the best bench in the league.  It is both and the Suns bench was even better when Cam was on it. It was really good at absurd high levels but slowly went down as the year progressed but is still number 1 in the league.  &gt;Like either you need him greatly and him being injured is a problem or you don’t need him and him being injured is irrelevant.  He helped a ton and was one of the top reasons the Bubble Suns were so good as well as Suns hot start of the season but after a while the Suns are really deep they learned to adapt.  &gt;Dallas has been missing 4 out of their 5 starters  Dario Saric Missed 17 games this year. That is about the same as Dorian Finley Smith and Josh Richardson have missed combined.  In addition Cam Payne has missed a lot of games and he is one of the most important reasons the Suns have been doing so great this year (their bench). I am not saying the Suns have been hurt as much as the Mavs. I am simply saying Mavs aren't the only ones hurt and it isn't fair the discount the success the Suns have had because their opponents were hurt but they weren't.
I have seen enough. Cut Luka. Hand the keys to Josh Richardson.
Josh “Steph curry” Richardson
"I’m not feeling great. Ben Simmons is playing great, so a lot of homers in my sub are saying, “Thank god we didn’t trade him, fuck Harden!” But Harden is playing like a top 3 player right now. Ben is playing like a top 20 player. To me, that’s worth surrendering your draft control for the next five years (your window anyway) to pair two top 3 players together.   Anyway, missing on Harden is just the latest in a comedy of errors going all the way back to forcing Hinkie out. In summary:  1) Force Hinkie out 2) Hire the Colangelos 3) Trade draft capital to move back into the first round to take Andres Paschecniks (out of the league) 4) Trade a FRP to move up (with your biggest rival) to draft Fultz.  5) New GM because your last bad one couldn’t stop making fun of his own players with fake Twitter accounts. But first, your coach will run the draft! Proceed to draft the perfect 3+D wing, Mikal Bridges, a senior from a championship team. Wait, nope, you’ll trade him for a total project who’s now out of the league. 6) New GM proceeds to liquidate remaining assets for the wrong players: Jimmy and Tobi inbound 7) Despite being the wrong players, you’re now pot committed so it’s time to pay up for Jimmy because you need a real guard initiator/scorer. Nope. You let him walk and sign a washed big man: welcome to Philly Al Horford. Oh, and let JJ walk because you want to save money on tax. Snag Josh Richardson for Jimmy who will promptly prove his 3-pt shooting was a flash in the pan. 8) Owners clean house because they don’t like how their own mistakes taste. But welcome to Doc and Morey who will try to make this roster work, without having sufficient draft capital or decent contracts to trade.   Being a Sixers fan is fun! But hey, at least Embiid looks like a top-10 all-time big man. There’s that."
No don’t you get it your teams best playmaker by a mile who creates 95% percent of your offense when he’s on the floor should let josh Richardson run the offense.
How dare Luka take precious shots away from Wes Iwundu and and Josh Richardson. Lock him up
"The past 20 yrs on shots 14-23 ft [these are the leaders in % who played at least 12,000 min and took at least 1000 such shots](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15,2012-13,2013-14,2011-12,2010-11,2009-10,2008-09,2000-01,2001-02,2002-03,2004-05,2003-04,2005-06,2006-07,2007-08&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason)  1) Nash 47.8%  2) Dirk 47.2%  3) Horford 47%  4) David West 47%  5) Chris Paul 46.8%  6) Khris Middleton 46.7%  7) Jason Terry 46.7%  8) Steph 46.6%  9) CJ 46.4%  10) Brandon Bass 46.3%  Other notable ones  Durant 44.5%(I thought it would be a little higher)  Kobe 40.8%  Melo: 41.0%  KG: 45.2%  LeBron: 38.3%  Aldridge: 41.1%  DWade: 38.6%  Iverson: 39.3%  DeRozan: 39.6%  Lowest amongst 800 attempts for this stretch  Tony Allen 32%  Quentin Richardson 32%  Trevor Ariza: 32.9%  Corey Brewer: 33.1%  Derrick Favors: 33.2%  Josh Smith: 33.9%"
KP hasn’t been great all year but hopefully that’s turning around. THJ is hot/cold which can be great and bad. Richardson has alright but also missed time due to covid.  I keep seeing this but I don’t think people realize how bad our 8-12th men are. I mean we were playing Iwundu and Josh Green extended minutes. 3/4 players we missed were our top 3 defensive players and the other one was our backup PG. It’s definitely a legitimate excuse. We also went through a brutal stretch of games like that while Portland has had a relatively easy schedule. All this to say that team record isn’t the best way to judge this.
Yeah tbh I think part of it is teams still arent smart about how they attack bad defenders. I remember last year seeing all these Josh Richardson post ups vs Trae Young just fundamentally useless. It's like how teams try posting up James Harden instead of exploiting him off ball in transition and in help defense/rotations.   Think for that series I might kind of ditch Danny Green and start Shake Milton. Make Trae either guard Shake in pick and rolls or especially Seth coming off screens. Because Trae is a bad enough defender still where even for a guard he alone if you go at him right can make it significantly harder for a team to field a good defense when he's on the court.
"Their next 5 after Luka in minutes played are in order: Tom Hardaway, Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, and Kristaps Porzingis.  Is that really so bad?"
"Please explain to me what you mean by that. Maybe I don’t fully understand your take. He brings the ball up nearly every play, defends other guards (some times a 3), and has a typical supporting cast of Josh Richardson, DFS, Kleber, and KP. Who else is the point guard?"
The main difference is he can take more pull up trigger threes and he's more decisive with the ball in his hands. Also he now plays the 4 and with seth curry and Danny Green instead of al Horford and josh Richardson. I think that's bigger for tobi.
"I think you're completely ignoring the player development element of ""Heat Culture"". Year after year second-rounders and journeymen like Duncan Robinson, Nunn, Derrick Jones, Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson... break out because of a) Miami's fitness and player development work and b) Spo's ability to maximise talent."
Data can’t properly account for Josh Richardson being a mental midget and Seth Curry slinging big cock
I can’t believe he only cost us Josh Richardson and a 2nd.
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"no i get what you’re saying, if josh richardson was a plus defender it would’ve been worth it   i’m saying curry’s offense&gt;&gt;&gt; richardson’s offense and richardson’s defense is just&gt;currys defense at the moment so it isn’t a favorable trade yet   maybe things will change, right now, eh"
He was one of our best assests to make a meaningful trade and we get fucking Josh Richardson lmaooo
"just out of curiousity, who would be our PG then? our starting backcourt is him and Josh Richardson."
"He hasn't been very good. Can't knock down a shot and sometimes just holds on the ball way too long without even making a move. His defense has been very good at times, but not as consistent so far, probably has to do with being out with COVID though.  One problem actually with both James Johnson and Josh Richardson is they both sometimes unnecessarily take on a responsibility to  create for others when we really do not always need that of them. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Burke are all capable of creating offense. Richardson definitely is a good passer, but we don't need him trying to ""run the offense"" from the top, he needs to move the ball and find the open man when he sees it."
"To add onto the defense stuff players who were good defensively last year like DFS and KP have been so lazy this year. The only player who’s playing some solid defense is Josh Richardson, and he’s also taken a step back from last season."
"Porzingis is garbagé. Finney Smith and brunson, kleber are good, josh richardson is trash. hardaway is a microwave and everyone else on the roster should be out the league"
why did we leave in jalen brunson and make him run suicides instead of having our top if not best wing defender josh richardson in the last part of the 4th quarter
"Delon had been trash for us. He's supposed to be playing the Josh Richardson role. But he is too passive. Seth well, we need to get a better player in defense so I guess that's understandable."
I hope Josh Richardson can slow down Dame.
josh richardson
"Since the Mavs really need another facilitator behind Luka, I could see them giving up Josh Richardson and another guy for Monte Morris and Gary Harris."
"Hmmmm, I’m going Josh Richardson. Inconsistent shooter, can’t really create anything off the dribble (my handle compared to average pickup player is definitely worse than his vs. average NBA player though), strong defender with long arms and gets a good amount of blocks. Also cool outfits"
Not sure if this is better or worse but here's Josh Richardson jingling Joe. https://youtu.be/lPqd1dzwcT0  We challenged it and lost the challenge.
Josh Richardson and KCP are brothers I think.
How many times can Josh Richardson travel and palm the ball without being called??
"Dallas:   * Missing 5 of our 8 best players for 10+ games with COVID (Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell), they've been slow to get back to form. * Missed our 2nd best player for the first 10 games due to surgery. Porziņģis has also been slow to shake off rust but is getting there.  * Most difficult strength of schedule to start the season (first 20-25 games I believe)"
"lmao they aren't even considering Portland who is down 2 starters, or Dallas (who OP even failed to mention) who was missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith for 10+ games. That's 6 of our top 8 guys, plus we had the most difficult schedule for our first 25 games."
On 61% TS vs 67% TS. The gulf between Embiid’s and Giannis’ efficiency is as wide as Giannis from Josh Richardson
"Ah yes, because Embiid should have beaten an Eastern Conference contender without Ben Simmons and with Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson, the 76ers' number 2 and 3 options in that series, shooting sub 40% from the field."
Getting Seth Curry for Josh Richardson should be enough to at least be in the running.
I dont like josh Richardson handling the ball so much
Josh Richardson is nice
idk if I had the wrong expectations of Josh Richardson out of Miami but he hasn't been anywhere near the player I expected either with the Sixers or so far with the Mavs
"Porzingis played 14 games, Finney Smith played 16 games, Maxi Kleber played 14 games, Josh Richardson played 16 games.   that's basically their entire starting lineup + a few bench guys.  CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.   on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc."
Imagine trading this guy for Josh Richardson
Josh Richardson has the most hollow offense and defense stats. The fact that Morey was able to get out of it for Seth is pretty nice.

"The day after the Knicks traded away Dennis Smith Jr, the last player active with them from our trade, Porzingis goes off for 27/13/4 and 6 blocks and Hardaway Jr. notches 24 points on 15 shots. Love to see it.   Also where are the motherfuckers at who started their “Josh Richardson isn’t actually a good player takes”?? 18/5/8 and got us a BADLY needed clutch bucket, clutch rebound and 2 clutch free throws! Let’s go!!"
That's like ~~just a~~ sadly a big percentage of our fanbase lol. Most of them also didn't want to give up Josh Richardson for Jimmy so they don't learn I guess.
"Brunson is best suited running the offense when Luka rests, Josh Richardson isn’t some consistent shot creator, and nobody should even fathom taking the ball from Luka’s hands to give more shots to TREY BURKE. From the Mavs games I watched this year, the offense completely stagnates when he doesn’t have the rock."
Jalen Brunson exists.     maybe don't trade Seth Curry???   let Josh Richardson touch the ball sometimes????   and Trey Burke can't even get touches off the bench.
Josh Richardson
"No, that cap space was used to resign Dwight Powell who was a UFA and the remainder was to resign bird players DFS, Kleber, and Porzingis to operate over the cap. The trade exception created from Barnes was used for Delon Wright and later on Willie Cauley-Stein at the cost of three total 2nd picks.  Out current potential cap space is mostly due to Tim Hardaway expiring and Josh Richardson who was acquired from Seth Curry who we signed while over the cap."
I can't believe Josh Richardson tried that lmao.
"Reminds me of when Josh Richardson got a ""random"" drug test after tweeting about Family Guy."
"Welcome to having Josh Richardson handling the ball. I watched last year's playoffs against the Celtics. Richardson couldn't get an entry pass to Embiid to save his life, let alone hit him as Embiid would slip a screen."
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
"Real talk the mavs are still so bad at getting him involved. Ignore Luka who is incredible and he dictates what happens out there but when luka goes to the bench, the others don’t even look for him. Why is josh Richardson not kicking it back to KP on a pick and pop wide open? Shit like that should not be happening"
"From the article:  &gt; Five teams are assured of having significant cap room: Three of those teams — the Knicks, Spurs, and Thunder — will have enough cap room for a max contract even if they win the lottery. A fourth, the Mavericks, project to have about $35 million in room if Josh Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million player option, which would put them in play for the max contract for a player with nine or fewer years of service (currently projected at $33.7 million). One other team, the Hornets, will have significant cap room, but probably not quite enough for a max. We project them to have about $26 million below the cap line."
We tried starting 2 centers 2 pfs and Josh Richardson.
"Carlisle and FO will keep tinkering with the roster and the positions till they are satisfied with both the Plan A (dominating with your strengths) and Plan B ( Adjusting to overcome a dominant opponent )   Even before Curry was moved for Josh Richardson, we waived Broekhoff for signing MKG. Luka's game has also improved significantly and this permits the FO to try out more options.  Either way, I just hope they don't do panic buying as that takes a lot of time and resources to fix."
"Did this dude just compare 19 year old who played 3 games to Bogut who had a decade of NBA experience at that time? For his argument Centers take time to know the game.   &gt;7th seed right now if they had just not signed Oubre and drafted nobody   So Steph-Lee-Wigs-Dray-Looney is 7th in West. Damion Lee and Looney vs 7 seed Mavs Hardaway and Josh Richardson. LOL! Not to mention Mavs got Brunson &gt; Poole coming off bench.     Lamelo is NBA ready but a closing line up of Steph, Klay and Lamelo wont scare LeBron or Kawhi in the future. Lamelo is a worse target on defense than Steph. LOL!"
DFS and Josh Richardson are pretty good wing defenders tho
What happened to the Seth Curry/Josh Richardson trade going poorly for Dallas? Richardson appears to be one of the best players in the league
"&gt; Teams are made of players, and the players on both teams were stacked with HoFers of comparable career individual production  https://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/index4f3e.html?p=4229  &gt;Embiid scored more in the several series Boston has dispatched them from the playoffs by making one player try to do too much  Embiid averaged 30 points while the second highest scorer in the playoff series was Josh Richardson last season. But it's totally his fault for trying to do too much. Nonsensical argument trying to blame the most productive player on the team, when if anything it'd be better to look at the least productive players in the rotation.   &gt;It's a weak argument to say player x was better because they scored empty points in a loss  Now this is idiotic. By this logic points are empty unless they come in a win. How that win comes about is anyone's guess.   There's a difference between being the best player on the best team and just being the best player."
Josh Richardson is the leader of the “idea of the player sounds better than the actual reality” in the entire league
Luka  KP  Tim Hardaway JR  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Willey Cauley Stein  Trey Burke
"I wouldn't call under-construction as poorly constructed. Carlisle is testing out our bench players by playing them against starters of the lottery teams. Brunson has improved a lot but him and THJ aside, the others haven't shown enough this season.    Purely from a contending team's perspective, we only have 5 players signed beyond this season as THJ and Josh Richardson (assuming he doesn't take up his option) are expiring contracts. WCS and Trey Burke have small contracts that expire in 2022 and do not affect the cap space significantly. Powell is the only issue considering that he is nowhere near his old form, has 10M+/y and is signed till 2023."
Warriors defense has not missed a beat without klay. Jaylen is def overrated on that side. Ingram got derozan as a sf comps early in his career and I think that’s interesting although him shooting the 3 well on high volume pretty much kills that comp. josh Richardson/Seth curry trade was not a good one by Dallas. Serve ibaka also does not fix really any of the clippers problems and ppl def thought he would cause they still think he’s a good rim protector.
"You know those guys that are pretty decent but one night they just go off. Like KCP, Bruce Brown, Josh Richardson, etc. That was the entire Clippers roster tonight. Every single guy played basically perfect. Insane."
He's a philly fan. Last year the Sixers had 4All Star level guys Starting next to each other with Josh Richardson being another above average starter.
There's is no good reason for Josh Green to get 0 minutes in this game while Josh Richardson goes 1-11
The daily life of having Josh Richardson or Jalen Brunson as your secondary playmaker
"LeBron - loved him since I started watching basketball, that only got better when he joined the Heat. Since he's left my second favorite team in the league has been ""LeBron's team""  Damian Lillard - absolutely electric player to watch, one of the most clutch players I've ever seen, and I like his style of offense a lot  Josh Richardson - Love his approach to the game, is a great teammate, and will try to excel in whatever role he's given on a team. Would love to have him back in Miami down the line"
Josh Richardson keeping luka from getting a tech so luka owes him 2k now right
Josh Richardson against any of his old teams... it’s like watching a different player lol
Lmao. Ben also did a live chat with Josh Richardson yesterday and was asking Josh who he should guard tonight against the Spurs lol. They decided on Murray
Yeah we were forced to trade jimmy butler for josh Richardson that’s absolutely fucking us over. And kawhi brought Toronto a championship how is even the same. Plus I have seen raptors fan be a little salty about kawhi leaving them as they should be. I don’t see how my comment was so stupid other than jimmy butler is on your team so you like him
"He's just been injured a lot, and when he returns from injuries he always comes back slow. For some fans (I  won't lie I have done it too) it's very difficult to assess whether certain deficiencies have come from being injured.   This season he had been one of the worst defenders and it seemed like he didn't know his rotations. I think now that he's comfortable and in better shape he's reacting to plays much quicker and is back to providing good rim protection.   At the end of the day, he's the only other guy on this team with legitimate individual expectations so I think a lot ends up falling onto him. Josh Richardson has also received a lot of blame because we traded a fan favorite for him. He hasn't always been good, but he brings something that our team desperately needed in the Western Conference and now that he's starting to find his groove, fans will turn around on him"
Even Josh Richardson hit a damn near logo three.
Josh Richardson looks like KCP.
Josh Richardson
"I think the money works with just Johnson who we ironically got from the Timberwolves. My point about Josh Richardson, who I noticed you didn't put in your first unit, is that there are only so many guard minutes to go around, so if you add Rubio and move Brunson to the starting lineup, that takes up a lot of minutes taken up by THJ and Richardson right now.  As a side note, I don't think we need more bigs. We already have KP, Boban, WCS, Powell, Bey, and Maxi. That's a third of the roster, so I don't think we need more bigs, but we do need a better big for sure."
Would you take him over Josh Richardson?
"* Tobias is still here and he's been very productive. Maybe he's not worth his contract but he and Mike Scott was ABSOLUTELY worth: Chandler, Muscala(Who then got us a draft pick by winning a game late), Shamet, and the picks * Jimmy Butler: Gave up Dario and Cov for a half season of Jimmy. We then got Josh Richardson, who we then turned into Curry. This is basically a wash"
Went from Butler to Josh Richardson to Seth Curry real quick.

Tobias Harris al horford josh Richardson shake Milton I think jj reddick? Or did he leave? Do you not know the roster last year or what?
"&gt;Their two best players are horrible horrible defenders  This shows you haven't been watching our games. Luka is not at all a bad defender. He's actually been a solid on ball defender this entire season.  Now, KP has definitely been bad this year but he was great last year and looked good last night so maybe he can start to get back to being a top rim protector.  Josh Richardson and DFS haven't been as good defensively this year as many of us have hoped but both of them and Maxi (our best defender) are just now starting to look like their pre-COVID selves."
"I hate it half the time lol. One time I commented something celebratory after a win and this guy came back all “we lost our lead etc etc etc” and I was like “bro we fucking won chill out this is a good night!”  And god forbid 4 of your best players get covid and your star big is coming back from injury yeah you’re going to lose 6 straight. Josh Richardson is not literally a trash can, KP doesn’t have cinder blocks for feet, Seth curry isn’t Steph curry, and Rick Carlisle shouldn’t be shot into the sun lol."
"Luka, KP, Finney-Smith, Hardaway Jr., Brunson, Powell, Kleber, Cauley-Stein, Josh Richardson (though he’s really fallen off lately)  I expect Melli to get decent playing time as well, Redick also if he’s healthy. *Maybe* Burke, but we’ll see"
Josh Richardson
I cant believe morey turned josh Richardson into Seth curry
josh richardson is a good one  kevin durant has the best twitter though. most of the big guys just post ads nowadays
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."
Also 76ers didn't have shooters when they chose Josh Richardson to knock down shots. Let us see about Seth.
Duncan Robinson&gt; Josh Richardson
"I really don't think Brooks would make the Sixers any better. He's a slightly below average to average 3pt shooter and Ben/Jo need space to operate. That's why the Sixers are so much better this year than last year.  Switching Brooks for Curry feels like moving back to Josh Richardson. Great guy, good player, but it didn't work with our personnel."
"This is the problem with Josh Richardson, the idea of him sounds great, the ""thought process"" about him sounds great....and yet every team who has him realizes after a little while it's just not what they were envisioning.   He doesnt actually fit in a 5 man team context the way he needs to. Tries to do too much on offense way too much a jack of all trades master of none. Is a solid defender but isnt what he was like 3 yrs ago in Miami. He's very easy to talk yourself into until you have to actually watch him every night and some new team will fall for this trap next season."
I like the josh Richardson comparison I could defiantly see that
"I think he was fine on the sixers. The fit was wrong and so was our whole team fit last year. There’s nothing I expected out of Josh Richardson that would’ve changed anything about last season  I can’t speak for how he’s doing now, but as a sixers fan who pays moderately close attention, I enjoyed having him on the team"
Josh Richardson is complete ass. That dude should go back to the g league...
thj really out here playing better defense than defensive savant josh richardson
He called Josh Green Richardson at one point I think
Josh Richardson
And Marv called him Josh Richardson
What is wrong with this commentator?? Idk what his name is but he just called Dorian Finney Smith Josh Richardson and then claimed Claxton got the tip in on an earlier play when it was Bruce Brown lol
That is not Josh Richardson lmao marv is so cooked
I tried so hard to believe in Josh Richardson gave up on it last year but I tried like hell
i fucking hate josh richardson and I hope we ship his ass if he picks up his option.
Fuuuuuuuuck Josh Richardson. The biggest fucking bum in the league. Guy plays with 0 energy and his shooting form is atrocious...
"Josh Richardson is really not a good basketball player. Like he has no moves, no strengths, only bricks and missed players."
Just go ahead and put Josh Green in there for Richardson.
Would love to hear some updated thoughts on the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade.
Any updated thoughts on the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade?
We're looking for a Delon Wright/Josh Richardson type of a player. Those two have been misses. So I hope he can grow into something like that.
Josh Green &gt; Josh Richardson
Andrew Wiggins + James Wiseman for KP + ... Josh Richardson? The money works.
"For sure. Morey is one of the best GMs for a reason. Stealing away Seth Curry, who is finally looking like he’s over Covid the last week, was a heist right up there with any I’ve seen. Josh Richardson sucks and Seth Curry is on an absolute steal of a contract. Danny Rings is one of the best role players in the league. Just plays winning basketball. There’s a reason despite his shooting woes he had the highest plus minus for the Lakers in the Finals last season. He just knows his role and plays it perfectly.   But honestly Brett was utterly clueless in how to use Tobias. There’s a reason Tobias is playing at the level he is now and that’s all Doc. Brett legit was quoted saying he wanted Tobias to be his new JJ Redick last season. Like completely ridiculous shit lol.   Doc gets the respect out of his players and also knows how to take a guy in a unique and challenging role and fix him."
"&gt;Haha now you somehow know that they'd be able to get butler while keeping ball/Ingram/hart  Please, for the love of god, learn one thing about the topic at hand or stop wasting my time.  Butler was traded for Josh Richardson.  Caldwell-Pope + a pick gets that done with no problem at all."
Josh Richardson
What's kinda funny is that even with the great turnaround I wouldn't be surprised at all if they sort of blow the team up.  Tim Hardaway JR and Josh Richardson are both free agents.  I have my doubts Mavs want to retain either for what they cost.  Porzingis and Luka together on the court (when he even plays) is barely positive.  Luka without Porzingis net rating would be 3rd in the NBA.
"The Mavs also have 20 mill in cap space after Redick and Hardaway expire. They can sign a big free agent this year and still keep Luka because restricted free agency. Then they could trade Josh Richardson, Josh Green and a few firsts for Bradley Beal. Doncic/Beal/DeRozan/Kleber/Porzingis is a team that could happen. Lebron and the Nets are both aging so this team could be the next powerhouse of the league."
Well rookies don't really deserve criticism because they are you know rookies. It's different to be criticizing Josh Richardson for having tunnel vision because he's supposed to have gotten over that and Ant or Wiseman or whoever.
Josh Richardson has had a bad stretch and when I say stretch I mean pretty much the whole season

"Yeah, but considering what I've seen from Josh Richardson these past two years, the standard for offense from a guy that's a good defender isn't all that high."
Josh Richardson too
"Bruh forget Josh Richardson, they had Kevin Love and fucking KCP over Demar. Thats 10x worse"
"surely the Mavs wouldn't trade him for Josh richardson straight up, they'd never want such a huge downgrade lol"
Upgrade the bench big time. The leads are blown because the bench is like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound.   If these guys don’t get picked up by their current teams  Javale McGee  Daniel Theis  TJ McConnell  Josh Richardson   Patty mills
"There are 30 teams in the NBA who are actively looking for these kinds of players and whom they would be a good fit for. It's always far far easier said than done. And alot of these guys who are called 3+D lists are really either  a) The Gary Trent types who are great shooters but who's reputation as some kind of defender is pretty fraudulent.    b) Or the Josh Richardson types who people say ""are floor spacers"" but nobody actually guards, teams are fine letting shoot and provide no actual gravity or real floor spacing ability even if their %s are ok.   The legit 3+D wings like Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby arent that common, and they arent really going to be available."
Josh Richardson called  Brunson and Burke the water bugs.
I mean I'd take lonzo over Josh Richardson. That man infuriates me.
You mean the simple hypothetical scenario where they give Butler his 5-year max?   We could assume that Morey would have wanted Butler over Josh Richardson based on Morey coveting Butler in Houston and also the fact that Morey isn’t a dumbass like Big Collars and Brett Brown.
"They’re in 5th place in the league right now. When you’re trying to win a championship, it’s not about the difference between being a good team and shitty team, it’s about going from a good-great team to the best team.  Turning Butler (4th in WS/48 this season) into Josh Richardson, and then Seth Curry is some major negative value loss, even though Curry is a good role player.  I’m sure Daryl Morey would have rather walked into a situation with Butler on the team than one without."
Take all of Josh Richardson minutes plz
josh richardson heard that guy talking shit
Josh Richardson just having a good time out here with the boys.
KCP VS Josh Richardson a battle between two brother
Josh Richardson?
"Yeah Jo and Jimmy were and are incredibly tight.   Ben and Jimmy seemed to get along well personally, but both took issue with Brett Brown taking the ball out of Simmons’ hands and having Jimmy run the offense in the playoffs, mostly because they hadn’t been doing that during the season. Jimmy mentioned Ben was frustrated by that and basically said he would be too in his position.  The Sixers mostly just fucked up by not giving Butler the unquestionable full max. He’s a massive asset to let go and only get Josh Richardson in return, and Jimmy only seemed to want to leave after they were wavering on him and reportedly asked if “they could control him.”   Despite the imperfect fit, Ben/Jo/Jimmy were incredibly good together."
Horford wasn't on the team. It was Josh Richardson.
"Eh, gonna disagree with you again on this one, its hard to debate such a subjective take but if anything made this era hard to watch it was just how atrocious the east was.   Most teams out east were just not very good during this stretch but league was full of talented guards/wings; Kobe, Lebron, VC, AI, DWade, Tmac, Melo, Paul Pierce, Baron Davis, Arenas, Michael Redd, Ray Allen, Josh Richardson were all at the top of the league in scoring during this stretch.  You also had Nash+Amare and Kidd leading very good fast paced offenses.  On top of that you had dominant big men in Tim, Dirk, Shaq, Yao, KG, CWeb, Rasheed + Ben Wallace, Dwight, Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol who generally played slower, post up/kick out style basketball and plenty of people enjoy that style of play too.     I just don't know what you mean about shitty defense.   Some basketball fans enjoy watching their team play defense, sounds like its not your cup of tea and thats fine, to each their own my guy but just because the league was dominated by defense oriented teams like the Pistons, Spurs and Mavericks doesn't make it unwatchable.  I thoroughly enjoyed this era and all the amazing big man battles and playoff bouts between the heavyweights of the day, then again I'm a Spurs fan so its easy to enjoy something when your winning, so again, this is all subjective isn't it? lol"
"You’re really going to say “guys like Gallo and Huerter?”  Huerter has been on this team every year that we’ve been abysmal he’s entirely home grown he looks good because he’s been playing with Trae for years.   Gallo looked horrendous at the start of the year. Even now he looks good because he sits on the perimeter and knocks down open 3’s that Trae spaces for him. I love Gallo but Josh Richardson could do the exact same thing Gallo is doing.  Bogi is cooking because he’s got space for days, he’s got someone to pass to him when he runs around off ball. He has been a legit star recently, so I’ll concede that Bogi is probably equal to KP if we’re talking championship equity.  Capela is cooking because he can catch lobs and finish at the rim when he’s wide open.  Trae is elevating them"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
Mavs could easily be a 4 or 5 seed rn if KP wasn't hurt or didn't get affected by covid early on in the season. Josh Richardson didn't make them worse as they're roughly the same with Seth curry last year.
Al Horford and Josh Richardson guarded Embiid last year
"I barely hear people talk about Josh Richardson, so I can’t he is overrated"
"I also don’t remember being saying the sign and trade was a good deal. It was a desperation deal for the 76ers. Butler didn’t want to play for Brett Brown so our two options were let him walk for nothing or sign and trade to get anything in return. JRich was just the best we could get out of a tough situation, no one was praising the 76ers for trading Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson"
"Yo JRich went to Edmond Santa Fe High School. He's a legit player that went to the same school as Ekpe Udoh.  One of the greatest college QBs ever also went their, Brandon Weeden.  So no, Josh Richardson is the man!"
"1) Guys coming off their first contracts are extended Qualifying Offers, which makes them *Restricted* Free Agents. Unless Luka signs his QO (NOBODY ever does), then Dallas will keep him under team control until at least 2026.  2) Hardaway is a UFA this summer and Josh Richardson has a Player Option. Unless it's some funky-ass sign-and-trade, the window for a trade has closed."
You mean you didn't think they would somehow become a top 3 seed after adding Josh Richardson?
Yeah I’m really worried about Josh Richardson and Al Horford having another bad series against you guys
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"Lmao, believe what you want but that’s not what the regular season showed against you. Simmons is the core of our entire team’s defense so it’s kind of rough when you have to face 3 elite wing players with the only good wing defender being Josh Richardson (and Tisse who struggled in the bubble). Ben was playing amazing right before the injury too."
Full tweet  I want to congratulate Dwyane on his recent announcement. We had discussed having him join our ownership group after his retirement but he was not prepared to commmit at the time. Of course I am disappointed that he didn’t reconsider. 1/2  Having said that I wish him good luck and much success with the Jazz. To me Dwyane will always be a HEAT lifer. 2/2   My take:  I think Wade is still hurt that the Heat lowballed him and chose to let him walk in FA because they didn’t want to pay him and  instead chose to pay Hassan Whiteside a 4yr max contract and Tyler Johnson a 4yr 50 million deal that summer.  Mikey Arison has a lot of nerve calling Wade a heat lifer when they chose to pay Whiteside and Tyler Johnson over him. Wade mjst feel disrespected when he returned only to play on the bench while Josh Richardson and Winslow is starting over him
That's Josh Richardson
Josh Richardson what u doin
"Just curious, where did you get the TS% stat. If you are referencing the MavsMoneyBall article, that thing is 2 months old and was written right when Porziņģis was coming back from his injury. Prior to that being published, Porziņģis was averaging 20.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg on 47/35/86 shooting. He was also on a minutes restriction, he was a -3.6 and was also playing alongside G-Leaguers and rookies since the COVID protocols had DFS, JRICH, Maxi, Powell and Brunson all sitting. Since that has been published, KP has averaged 21 PPG and 10.3 RPG on 49/39/83 shooting and is a +6.1.   So naturally KP is going to have worse numbers when Luka sits and he was playing alongside James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nate Hinton and Josh Green.   In regards to winning games without Luka, naturally we aren't going to be as good without Luka, same with any team missing their best player. Last year we beat the #1 seed Milwaukee with just Porziņģis. Dončić missed a stretch of games and Dallas went 3-3 including close losses to Miami in OT (eventual EC champions), Boston and Toronto (#2 and #3 seeds). We beat the Spurs, Milwaukee and Philly.   I think you are expecting Dallas to play at the same level when Luka misses games and that's just not realisitc, there's natrually going to be a drop off. Even Porziņģis playing at his best isn't going to drag a team starting Maxi, Brunson, DFS and Richardson to wins over contenders consistently. That's not possible for any team. Look at the Lakers when LeBron sits and just Davis plays. They are naturally not as good as when LeBron and Davis both play.   I guess I just don't get your point. You say that ""whenever Doncić sits, Porzingis is not convincing at being the first guy the opponents guard.""  However stats show Porziņģis is doing fine when he's the primary option, he's scoring well and rebounding well. Then the argument shifts to well we are 1-4 without Dončić. Well obviously that's going to be the case, he's our best player. Those are also games that Porzingis hasn't played either, so it seems completely irrelevant. You go from arguing Porziņģis isn't a good primary option, to he's good at scoring but he can't lead the team.   The sample size is super small for games with Porziņģis playing without Luka, but he's been able to step up when Luka has bad games. Just look at the last game against Milwaukee where Porziņģis stepped up in the 4th quarter and brought us to the finish line."
&gt;Yeah I don’t think any of them are bringing a star to Chicago lol  Josh Richardson got Jimmy Butler for Miami.  Sometimes stars trade for less than you might think.
"That the 76ers got better by replacing Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick for Al Horford and Josh Richardson.  Nobody would admit to it now, but that was dare I say... an overwhelming consensus opinion heading into the 2019-20 season."
"They should have kept Jimmy. Having a Top 10-15 caliber guy is a massive asset, and to lose him for Josh Richardson is terrible asset mismanagement.   The Tobias Harris trade was also stupid. The Clippers weren't going to re-sign him, and the cap math worked out with cap holds for the Sixers to be able to sign a max guy and bring back both Butler and Redick. I don't 100% hate the trade, but I think they could have gotten it done with only their own, less valuable picks, while retaining the 2021 Miami pick asset.   They could have been much more aggressive including Simmons in trade offers to try to land a third star that better fit around Butler and Embiid too had they kept Butler."
"I'd give him 1% blame, potentially for not getting Lowry, but it sounds like Masai was in La La Land (and not the good one with Emma Stone).  He's not the dumbass that traded Jimmy Butler. He made a very good trade in dumping Josh Richardson for Seth Curry too, who really fits well with Embiid."
"He did a great job, guy got rid of Horford's terrible contract for a 2025 protected first and some nobodies. Turned Josh Richardson into Seth Curry, and brought Doc Rivers who was a huge upgrade on Brett Brown. The Danny Green signing was also a shrewd one but unfortunately he's hurt right now. The Sixers got the goddamn #1 seed this year, it's not his fault his players and cosch are suddenly atrocious when it counts."
Imagine if they still had Josh Richardson on the team ☠️☠️☠️
Some solace from the annoyance of watching the 76ers and realizing some dude getting paid millions traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson.
you know who doesn't miss free throws? Josh Richardson
If the Sixers kept Josh Richardson they’d be out of the playoffs by now
The Dallas Mavericks with a doubt lost the Seth Curry/Josh Richardson trade.  No way JR is giving you a 30+piece
Traded for josh Richardson
Dallas traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson lol
Josh Richardson for Seth Curry is the steal of the decade.
Lol we got this guy for Josh Richardson  thank you mavs!
imagine trading 3 years of seth on 8mil a yr for an expiring josh richardson  mavs got hinkied
where’s josh richardson when ya need him
imagine trading 1 year of josh richardson for 3 years of seth curry
I still ask myself how we got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson constantly
"This year...Butler, Randle, Kuzma, Milton, Beverley, Josh Richardson.   Kemba was a turnstile on defense  PJ Tucker does nothing on offense."
"The thought of Trae with Porzingis, THJ, Kleber, Reddick, Josh Richardson, etc. is very fun, not to mention Brunson off the bench.   Losing Capela defensively would suck, but the offensive upside of Trae with Porzingis and all those shooters would be great."
"Ironic.  &gt; Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. **It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry** and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  &gt; Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says. **Nelson remained the team’s president of basketball operations, a role he has held since 2005, and other executives and agents continued largely communicating with him or Cuban regarding personnel matters. Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021**. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
he is a lights out shooter who can dribble off the perimeter. Something that josh Richardson dreams about every night before he goes to sleep
"He was absolutely ok at his job from 2004-2011 but was absolutely dog shit from 2012 to now.   We can give him a pass for not landing FA it’s hard to do if not on a coast. But some of his trades were beyond bad like Seth curry for Josh Richardson without scooping up something good in return.     Josh johnson who was actually really solid for us and protected Luka on the court for JJ reddick who was legit injured and didn’t even wanna come to Dallas and Niko can’t see the floor bello  in 2021 alone were stupid as hell.   Extending Powell was fine, but the amount of cash they used to do it when he wouldn’t of gotten that much on the open market was stupid.   Signing Harrison Barnes to the max after signing Wes Mathews to a near max was stupid as hell and we should’ve started the tank a year earlier.    Drafting DSJ was whatever we all liked him but we could’ve very easily traded that pick and tanked and gotten Luka and not had to burn an extra first to the hawks.   The only good moves he’s made since 2011 was bringing in Vince Carter, Securing THJ in the Kp trade and. drafting Luka but I think that was a team effort on Luka."
Josh Richardson has the worst late game IQ I’ve ever seen
"Also, the article says he supported trading Curry for Richardson  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says.

The Mavs traded Seth Curry and a 2nd round pick away to receive Josh Richardson and the corpse of JJ Reddic. LOL.  Sixers made such a deal there.
Seth Curry is so good. I can’t believe we got him for Josh Richardson straight up.
For the high value Josh Richardson asset bahahahhaha
"Just a reminder the Mavs traded Seth Curry, on a top five contract in the league, for Josh Richardson who became unplayable in key moments of the playoffs.   Just an absolutely unholy heist by Morey.   Like it was not even close to an even trade despite how long people pretended it was to be nice."
I will forever love Darryl Morey for getting rid of Josh Richardson for Curry. Incredible pick up
Well their defense was also god awful. They didnt think Josh Richardson was a total dud.
&gt;and pushed for trades that made the team worse  Which trade is that? Didn't he push for the team to acquire seth curry and then your GM traded him away for josh richardson?
Luka didn't force the Mavs to trade a 45% 3 point shooter for whatever the fuck Josh Richardson is.
For Josh Richardson who looked very mediocre in Philly. I never understood it.
"They should just fire Nelson for these terrible moves. At some point the credit given for drafting Luka has to run out.   &gt;Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
"You're talking to a Heat fan, they know all about Josh Richardson."
"Dallas announced Voulgaris’ hiring in the fall of 2018 with a title — director of quantitative research and development — that vastly understated his actual role. Multiple league and team sources tell The Athletic that Voulgaris has been the most influential voice within the Mavericks front office since joining the team, either initiating or approving virtually every transaction made over the past two seasons. Those same sources add that Voulgaris has frequently gone as far as scripting the starting lineups and rotations for longtime head coach Rick Carlisle.  That influence has spanned Doncic’s three seasons in Dallas. While he had been drafted prior to Voulgaris’ arrival — Donnie Nelson, the team’s longtime president of basketball operations, was the driving force behind trading up to acquire the Slovenian wunderkind, a process he described in detail to The Athletic last year — Cuban had sought out Voulgaris’ basketball advice in the years before putting him on the team’s payroll. As one team source says, “Mark Cuban is the most powerful person in the organization, but whoever he’s listening to is second.” Cuban was won over by Voulgaris’ vision: an analytics-driven spread pick-and-roll offense with Doncic as the focal point which he has tried implementing in the past seasons.  It’s unclear when the Cuban and Voulgaris relationship began, but their coming together is perhaps unsurprising given Cuban’s origin as a self-made tech billionaire whose first major purchase was the Mavericks. Voulgaris has never been shy about his desire to run a team. In an ESPN feature from 2013, Voulgaris is quoted as saying, “The whole process (of becoming a highly successful gambler) has led me to believe that I’d be able to put together a better team than almost any general manager in the league. If not maybe all.”  The way Voulgaris tells it — the ESPN feature is the only notable reporting ever focused on him, and he declined an interview request from The Athletic shortly after being hired — he began gambling on the NBA in the late 1990s and had made millions by the early 2000s. His success, he says, came in part from an instinctual reading of certain coaches. It finally failed him during the 2003-04 season, causing him to lose much of his gambling wealth and step away temporarily, only returning once he’d developed an analytics model that brought back his old edge. He says he did exactly that, his new model beating the odds at a rate higher than five percent. In 2009, he gave up gambling again to consult for an unnamed NBA franchise. The advisory role lasted one season; he returned to his previous life afterward and began publicly promoting himself. In the coming years, he became a well-known presence in the basketball world.  Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason.

But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
Already here bro. And all it cost was Josh Richardson lol
Can I interest you in one Porzingis with a side of Josh Richardson?
"It makes sense that an elite combo guard like Lillard or harden is the best fit possible for embiid. But Its funny that Simmons and Embiid's fit isn't an issue so thats fixing something that isn't a problem. Simmons and Embiid with all of their supposed fit issues play the best together and are an elite duo according to advanced statistics every year. Simmons' intangibles might actually carry him to elite levels of production. I guess all of his coaches might be right in that he's elite because his combination of defense and passing is second to none. Him leading the league in assisted three pointers while having Al horford, josh Richardson and Tobias as his shooters proved that."
Lost Al Horford and Josh Richardson...pretty different
Seth Curry and Josh Richardson.
Josh Richardson hit the game winner against the Clippers earlier this year   https://streamable.com/yqyj8m
"&gt;    I'd want to throw in Josh Richardson if he opts in too.    I think KP can succeed but he's just not a fit here. Maybe going to OKC with less expectations will help out but it's pretty obvious he isn't happy here.   Horford is $4MM cheaper next season and $7MM cheaper in 22-23, trading away JRich saves up another $10MM this year in addition to our current Max spot opening, which would allow us to go after Richuan Holmes/John Collins and re-sign THJ/ Brunson in 2022."
"Doncic/Finney-Smith/Josh Green/THJ/Kleber/Brunson/Powell/KP?  Who knows how the FO REALLY feels about Porzingis but not protecting him is a free way to get out of his contract, even though it's a huge negative at this point a needy team will give us something in return for him. If they don't protect KP then probably Tyrell Terry considering they picked him over some more NBA ready contributors last year.  If the mavs give up KP then an expansion team is definitely taking him but I would wager Josh Richardson is the one that gets snagged."
"ben and perkins cancel each other out, correct? al horford = thabo   but yeah i think you got me here although josh richardson is quite literally getting DNP'd in the playoffs and was starting last year!"
"He was on a team that started Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefolosha, Russell Westbrook and Ibaka before he started shooting 3's.  Tobi Harris, Josh Richardson and Horford are basically the Curry brothers compared to that. When Westbrook and KD go into the HOF we should talk about those line ups before any other accomplishments lol"
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
Yeah I though that Josh Richardson trade for the Mavs was a good idea. Just an absolute moron
"We traded Delon Wright off too, he really did do all the little things pretty well, but just seemed to hesitate too much when the time came to shoot.  Never could fit in with the starting line up like we hoped, but did alright with the bench unit.  Josh Richardson has become a worse version of Wright."
"&gt;	Hopefully next year more people will bring the ball up and run the offense well (maybe not Josh Richardson) and Luka will add off ball movement to his game.  Me and you both, a secondary ball handler/playmaker would be a godsend and is arguably our biggest need. A Brogdon or a Derozan would be extremely beneficial.   &gt;	And side note I would love if Dorian drove the ball more, he’s had to grow accustomed to taking harder and harder spot up 3 pt shots bc defenders close out on him so hard. Not to mention he was shooting close to 50% for a period near the end of the season. Gotta have something else in the bag, keep them honest.  I was too harsh on Dorian cause he legitimately can drive when the defender tries to contest and it’s actually had some decent results, especially near the end of the season, but he still needs to work on it. I hope it becomes a part of his game like how Timmy started driving more.  &gt;	Also Maxi had 12 pts in a quarter this series when he did more than spot up from 3. Doesn’t have to get all the way to the rim, he’s not so bad at pull up jumpers.   Yeah, Maxi having a pull up jumper was the wildest development lmao, but like Dorian, it’s something he needs to work on still before I’d be okay with it as a consistent option, in my opinion.  &gt;	I appreciate the discussion!  You too, brother, have a good one!"
i think Lowry or even Josh Richardson would be more attractive options
"As soon as he hit the 5/5 from Three, I thought what a steal he was and how Josh Richardson didn't help Dallas with jack in the playoffs."
I need to see him fail though so that I can feel better about the Mavs giving up his great contract for the literal trash can that is Josh Richardson
Imagine trading away Seth Curry on that contract for Josh Richardson.
Josh Richardson
"Man who had the most assisted 3 pointers at 6'10 on a team with Josh Richardson, Al horford and Tobias Harris as his shooters is not good enough"
"People on reddit love to speak on things they really have no business speaking about - like, they may have seen a game or two or they may have read an article or looked at basketball reference but why would they not trust the opinion of fans that watched the team the entire year? Dodo was making a push to put the ball on the floor in the final 10 games of the season but reverted back to being awful in the playoffs; Richardson has been awful the whole year ; KP gets stripped if he ever dribbles with his left hand; Brunson doesn't have good vision or point guard tendencies; Maxi can't dribble; Trey doesn't even play; Boban/WCS/Powell are all centers; Timmy is efficient but never really passes out of drives; etc. So, who does that leave that can realistically dribble and can make plays? Josh Green - the rookie?"
"Everybody blaming Bud but its obvious that Bucks stars are overrated especially against elite competition. **This roster is not beating Nets with other coaches**. Sorry Giannis, you shouldn't resigned. Giannis joining Mavs would solve all the problems for him as he'd create the difference on defense and interior finishing while Doncic do the playmaking.  1- Giannis for instance, dominates the game against most teams. But when he actually faces elite athleticism, star power in the other side, his effectiveness plummets. Because he relies on his athleticism and strength. In the bubble last year, Dallas beated Bucks pretty easily. Doncic was the scorer who Giannis could not stopped. And KP's length, Carlisle's defensive adjustment killed Giannis effectiveness.  Embiid-Jokic also relies on their strength for low post plays but they also have a great skill set. And they have more mass so it becomes harder to put a wall against them or finding a defender for them.  2- Middleton is a legit 2nd option, but not a good one. He's certainly behind of Harden-Kyrie so he can't create much difference. He is no D.Booker or B.Beal.  3- Jrue Holiday was always a fools gold in terms of being allstar player. His worse version, Josh Richardson played for Dallas Mavs this season. So called two-way guards are overrated in this league. Because for the most cases, two-way guards offense are decent at best. And then on defense, they cannot defend elite wing men. Against KD's height, Harden's , Kawhi's, Lebron's drives, JRUE would never have answer. He's not that good of 3rd option.  We all know Kyrie would make shots against any kind of defense. KD is literally an unstoppable force when he is healthy. Harden singlehandedly brought his team to multiple WCF and made them contenders, he is that good as well. Without Harden they still have 2 elite players and rejevuanated Blake."
"i mean, they were mediocre back then, and they were in cap hell. they lucked out on Jimmy wanting to go there, which forced us to either let him go somewhere else and get nothing, or Josh Richardson..."
"Finally. DFS went 9-38 after Game 2. Still he would get the ball over KP. Worse, it was not just Luka. Even JB, Josh Richardson would do it. I am sure that is no doubt super infuriating.   I have been saying this from the start, this is 100% on Rick. For all those slandering KP's post game, watch the early games in this series. He would get into a deep position, be free and the ball would go to a well defended THJ or worse DFS on the perimeter."
"Yeah, unfortunately not. That's why this offseasons is ideal, but there is limited options.   If I was them I would hope Josh Richardson declines his P/O, sign Lowry to a 1+1 (team option) max if he would accept and then if the Mavs get a sign from another player next offseason that they want to come to Dallas reject Lowry's team option, try to trade Porzingis for a lower contract guy and hope he had a good year in the previous year so you don't have to attach a pick. Resign DFS + sign veteran 3/D guys as best as you can."
"46-14 is good on paper but when you think about it including turnovers Luka was probably directly involved in like 50 of their possessions. That’s just way too much from one player. This is why he wares down by the 4th. Josh Richardson is not this bad he just can’t shoot he was solid in Miami, but you have to let him dribble the ball and try to score. As someone who rooted for harden in Houston that style of play as close as you think you are you’ll never really win because it becomes too predictable. A 30 ft step back is still a really hard shot and to hit 7 games in a row on playoff teams it’s just a really hard style of basketball."
"Crazier things have happened. 3 years ago if you told me Miami would've been in the Finals last year, I would've told you you were delusional. They were in cap hell with no good talent outside of an already aging Dragic and Josh Richardson. No potential stars though"
What? My comment was in response to you saying this:  &gt;but Lou Will proved year after year that he's big time in the playoffs  About a guy shooting 40% from the field and 26.5% from three for his playoff career lol. Had nothing to do with Josh Richardson. Getting a 34 year old Lou Williams who is an absolute turnstile on defense wouldn't be any improvement. And even *if* it was an improvement the improvement would be completely marginal and make no sense if the goal is to get better playoff performers.
"The problem with the Hawks is that Lou Will is not their 2nd option not even the 4th, but in Dallas he would have been 2nd option since KP is ass which will make him contribute more. I don't know it's speculations but in my eyes he's a better option that Josh ""No offensive game and an overrated defensive one"" Richardson"
Still way better that Josh Richardson.
"Seth played 29 mpg in that series. Wtf are you talking about? Apparently even in g6, he played 28.5 minutes.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2020-nba-western-conference-first-round-mavericks-vs-clippers.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2020-nba-western-conference-first-round-mavericks-vs-clippers.html)  Josh Richardson played 13 mpg this year with a very underwhelming performance."
"&gt; Dallas will keep developing players in Carlisles system and next to the Spurs it’s about a stable an environment as there is in the NBA  I'm not sure what you meant exactly, but the Dallas FO is much worse than the Spurs FO. Dallas obviously got Luka, but they got rid of Seth Curry. Gave Porzingis 100M contract. Got Josh richardson who sucks. Got JJ who didn't play.   Spurs have been muhc better at finding diamonds in the rough with Keldon, DJM, Derrick white, etc. I'm not sure if Dallas has really been that ""stable"" , but I do agree Carlisle is a great coach"
Somebody on our sub posted Kevin Love + Cedi Osman for KP + Josh Richardson. Seems like one of those trades that would be equally horrible for both teams.
Package him with Josh Richardson for Sabonis.
"&gt;The Mavs can't run things through Porzingis and Jalen Brunson dropped a stinker in the series, so they really didn't have any other options.  That was supposed to be Josh Richardson. They traded away shooting (Seth Curry) for better playmaking and defense. But then they used him as a spot-up shooter."
Well Luka literally can't rely on anyone else to handle the ball and make sound decisions for the team consistently. When he's off the court you can just tell they can't get rolling or pass well at all. Brunson is fine in short bursts but can't really do better than ok. Josh Richardson is a cheeseburger and shouldn't have been traded for the dude with the highest career 3pt shooting percentage ever.
For sure. I agree with you that the Mavs need another real shooter. Ideally someone who can operate as a secondary creator. I thought Josh Richardson would be perfect in that role but that clearly hasn't worked out. Also finding someone other than Powell who can act as a lob threat would be huge. Luka is too good at passing to not have a guy to throw lobs to on the court at all times
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
"the mavs need like 3 ball handlers max, luka really should have the ball in his hands as much as possible. and the mavs, like the sixers, probably thought that josh richardson was someone who can dribble drive and pass reliably"
its not that bad. it wasnt for the lack of trying. actually the one piece missing is exactly josh richardson fail.
"I think it’s a problem that goes both ways. Luka dominates the ball because they don’t have other players who can create and score for themselves. If Luka continues to dominate the ball when they can assemble a roster with more secondary creators or higher level scorers, then I think it’s time to call Luka or the coaching into question.  But having just come off this series - Luka dominating the ball was their best move. KP shot terribly from 3 and was passing them up in favor of driving into contested midrange pullups by about game 5. Hardaway was their second best player and second best creator this series but was struggling to dribble into traffic and also settled for a lot of midrange pullups. Josh Richardson (who should’ve been their 4th-5th best player) could barely get minutes some games and was making awful passes and losing his dribble constantly. And finally Brunson - usually their second best creator - had a terrible series. There wasn’t much they could turn to."
the idea of josh richardson is worlds better than josh richardson
"I agree he could’ve made better adjustments, but he’s also got the shell of KP, the ghost of josh Richardson, and he was playing against Kawhi who was absolutely locked in.   Also Is the narrative that Lue isn’t a good coach going to change?? Guy made the adjustments to get it done"
i think robert covington also gets overrated for the same reasons josh richardson got overrated for a stretch
"Carlise isn't the issue, took the Clippers to 7 games with that roster.  The Mavericks live and die by the 3:  You hit your 3, you win the game, you don't you lose.  It's that simple.  Mavs didn't hit their open looks and lost the series.  If you want to blame someone, talk to the GM.  Questionable decisions regarding KP's contract and going to get Josh Richardson for Seth."
"I don't see why the Pacers would give up Myles Turner to get back another player who has a questionable fit in their frontcourt. Plus Josh Richardson, who just isn't that good. It's straight up a bad deal for them."
"yeah CJ's value gets underrated (maybe not by a lot, but by some margin) due to his defensive deficiencies and some playoff no-shows. But he's still a very good player with a modern skillset and it's no coincidence he's been part of top-tier offenses with Portland. He's a guard who can create his own shot and shoots 9 threes a game at 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? In a league where shooting efficiency is more important than ever, that's still valuable, even if it comes in a package that's not built to be a defender. Peep the advanced stats - they still paint CJ as a very solid, positive player (and not as bad on defense as fans make him out to be). The problem is that he may not fit well next to Dame.  A few trade targets I see:  * Jimmy Butler — would require many additional assets and is 100% contingent on whether the Heat want to pay Butler a massive contract. Very likely they will. Jimmy would be a great complement to Dame as a secondary ball handler and defender, but CJ's volume 3pt shooting would be missed. * Jerami Grant — would require some additional assets and contingent on Detroit looking to flip a player they for value. Grant is still somewhat unproven. He turned into an offensive creator in Detorit and after a hot start saw his efficiency dip, as well as his defense. But he has solid size, a varied skillset, and generates 6+ FTAs, something Portland lacks outside Dame. Blazers could bet on him taking another step by becoming more effecient as a second option. * Tobias Harris + Matisse Thybulle — 76er fans will probably instantly nix the inclusion of Thybulle. That's fair. But it could be a very attractive package for Portland, and would be worth additional assets to bring in a complementary scorer and versatile defender. A third team may need to get involved to provide value to Philly. * Kristaps Porzingis + Josh Richardson — call me crazy, but I think KP has become a distressed asset whose potential is actually underrated. The Mavs let Luka go full Harden-ball, leaving his teammates standing like statues beyond the arc. (That's fine, Luka's good enough to justify that). But skilled bigs require more creativity to use and the Mavs showed no interest in getting KP involved through DHOs (something Portland loves), elbow face ups (where KP's height can really shine) or screening actions (another Blazer fave). This move is a big gamble, but Portland has kept its powder dry for years. Time to take a swing. If it misses, it means Dame time has run out. But that window is closing anyway."
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"Let me know when this gming master gets out of the first round instead of trading a second rounder for josh Richardson   Dirk bailed him out, full stop. It doesn’t matter if you nail a couple picks out of the park if you shit the bed building around them. Unfortunately for mavs fans though, I don’t think luka is gonna stick around for 20 years of the shit dirk did"
"That's his style cause the team has no other good playmakers. The best secondary playmaker is who, Jalen Brunson who's just a good bench guard, Josh Richardson?"
Josh Richardson is utter trash. He was supposed to bring in some shooting and defense and in a game 7 this dude does not even slightly hustle on defense and take terrible shots or drives.
Dude we literally have 1 singular consistent defender on the entire roster in DFS. And don’t say “Trey fucking Burke” like he wasn’t great for us in the playoffs last year. The other option was “Josh fucking Richardson” who been trash all year.
Playing Trey Burke in Game 7 was a good one if you're a Clippers fan. Josh Richardson was phenomenal as well!
"He's usually on point and wins more games than expected based on the roster year in and year out.  You would only ditch him if players tuned him out or he can't get over the hump with a championship caliber roster.  They're not there yet unless Doncic goes supernova all the time or they swap out Porzingis salary slot for better pieces or maybe he gets back to Unicorn all nba level.  Brunson is potential 6 man of the year quality player.  They need to shore up more 3 and D players.  Like the thought of Josh Richardson, not the actual one."
"Oh yeah, Josh Richardson is so much better.  Rick is the Terry Stotts of Dallas."
The Seth Curry Josh Richardson trade was a tough blow. Hated it then and I hate it even more now.
One of the biggest mistakes this off-season was trading away Seth curry for josh Richardson. Richardson was a complete nonfactor in the playoffs. He was complete trash offensively and defensively
Every offseason they bait us with these type of answers and every time our star singin or trade is Boban or Josh Richardson.
Mavs FO says that every year then they end up with Josh Richardson (For Seth Curry :( ) and James Johnson
Haralabob fucked this swap up. anyone that watched Josh Richardson the past years know he inconsistent trash while Seth is cash
"Yeah KP ""13/4/1"" Porzingis , Josh ""Can't make the floor"" Richardson, Trey ""Where am I?"" Burke, Tim ""Coinflip"" Hardaway, Jalen ""Regular Season"" Brunson ain't that bad. Right...."
We were led to believe Josh Richardson could've been that hard-nosed defender who could knock down the 3 but alas...
Why have Seth Curry when you can have 6 minutes of Josh Richardson
Why doesn’t Josh Richardson get more burn?
"hell no. Josh richardson for Curry was the biggest shaft. One scored 30 in a playoff game the other could barely break the playoff rotation and only came in so other guys could rest.     Fuck Donnie Nelson and Daryl Morrey, and most importantly fuck JRich"
"People swear that the mavs roster is full of G leaguers, but they have had a slightly positive to neutral net rating with Luka off the floor in all 3 of his seasons in the league lol.  &gt;This talk about him freezing out his teammates is lazy rhetoric.   Josh Richardson has a career AST% of 13.7%, vs LAC this year it was 7.6% (career low)  THJ has a career AST% of 11.1%, vs LAC this year it was 5.8% (career low)  Brunson has a career AST% of 23%, vs LAC this year it was 14% (career low)  Usage rate was also down across the board for almost every non Luka player. None of these players ever had the ball in their hand to get in any rhythm, then and they were extremely hot and cold because of it.   And ik this sub wants to pretend that Kristaps was sucking it up and is terrible and deserved to just be banished to the corner. But even in the role he was forced into, he and Luka had the exact same TS% (57) vs the Clippers, in addition to having the exact same TS% in the regular season, when he was averaging 20 PPG."
"&gt; Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Josh Richardson, Caris LeVert, Lonzo Ball  That team would be damn good as a player controlled 2k team."
"I went to college same time as Josh Richardson. My freshman roommate was a walk on for the basketball team and invited me to the Rec Center to hoop with some friends. Lo and behold, Josh Richardson is in the group.   Guess who got dunked on? Yea, that's me. Richardson absolutely yammed one on me."
The Richardson story is pretty interesting. I know a guy who played Josh in AAU and they said he was pretty good but they didn’t see him as miles ahead of everyone else lol
"Keep moving those goalposts. lol  - Rozier traded for Kemba.  - Curry traded for Josh Richardson  - Normon Powell traded for Gary Trent Jr.   Small shooting guards get traded for good return all the time. And again, we had up to 5 first round picks to trade with him."
"My friend saying we should've drafted Dante Exam over Joel Embiid on draft night  My roommates dad saying three months ago we should keep Ben Simmons and trade Embiid  ESPN ranking Bam Adebayo over Joel Embiid less than a year ago  Paul Pierce saying he was a better perimeter shooter than Klay Thompson is  On r/sixers last off-season I was downvoted for saying Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons. Their reasoning for why Ben is better was literally just that he plays defense  My GFs brother, a Mavericks fan, saying at the time of trade that they got the better player in the Josh Richardson/Seth Curry trade  My friend draft night saying that Luka Doncic was gonna bust"
Jalen Brunson went to my middle school/high school and lived 10 min away from me. I also used to play Fortnite with Josh Richardson almost every day
"If somebody has seen him play, he plays like Josh Richardson but he's actually an elite defender"
"*Except*, Max is right. How do they get better? Some FA? Is Daryl not one of the best GMs in the league. He got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. And you think he can't trade future pieces like what Max mentioned for a frustrated star? I'd love to see r/NBA collectively be GM for a team and I'd be shocked if it their team wasn't 30th in the league in virtually every significant category"
"Yeah, but the Heat needed a S&amp;T for Jimmy Butler and only had to give up Josh Richardson. Not that Richardson is a bad return, but Lowry isn't at Jimmy Butler level anymore.   That said, the salary match is going to be tricky. At a minimum, it includes George Hill, but it might have to include more."
"A comparison point might be what the Sixers got for Jimmy Butler, which was Josh Richardson. Unless you're LeBron going to Miami, the team losing a free agent is probably not going to get a lot back."
"Spurs get:   * 3rd overall pick  * 2023 1st, top-10 protected  * Kevin Love  Cavaliers get:   * Dejounte Murray  * Derrick White  * 12th overall pick   This is the sort of deal that might entice the Cavs to trade their pick. They get a very good young PG, a solid SG, and a low lotto pick for the crown jewel of the trade (3rd overall), another, protected 1st, and a salary dump (Love). Dejounte pairs well with Darius and White would be a great third guard for them. Plus, they can still get someone promising with the 12th pick. A protected 1st isn't much to dump Love and balance the deal, either.  Spurs do it to get a top tier prospect as well as a veteran who pairs well next to Poeltl. They're guaranteed one of Green/Mobley/Suggs with that pick. Probably either Mobley or Suggs, since top two looks to be Cade and Green. They get a prospect who can be their centerpiece for the future. They also get another first to help them down the line.   Use their cap space wisely on a PG this offseason and some vets for the bench, and they'll still be competitive next season. Something like Dinwiddie or Scroeder /Vassell/Keldon/Love/Poeltl with Patty, (Porter Jr?), Mobley as your first guys off the bench. Maybe they are able to sign two starters, so they also get a SG or SF. Maybe Oladipo or Josh Richardson would come for an overpay."
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"I like that idea. Maybe a Seth for Josh Richardson trade could work?  (Sorry, couldn't resist)"
"Don’t know,But I trust  the man that flipped josh Richardson for Seth Curry and flipped horfords Contract"
Josh Richardson doesn't even deserve to play in the NBA except for making FTs.
They probably think Delon Wright or Josh Richardson deserved to handle the ball more lmao
"Why are you getting downvoted for this? I don't think they fair well if you're marching out THJ, J. Brun, WCS, Josh Richardson, and DFS against these other countries' finest.   Luka is playing for Slovenia. KP: Latvian; Boban: Serbian; Dwight Powell: Canadian; Kleber: German. That's avg. 63 points nightly, not to mention defensive contribution and rebounding ability."
Jimmy Butlers first game back in Philly with the Heat. The Sixers absolutely spanked them. Josh Richardson couldn’t miss that night…it was absolutely the pinnacle of his short lived career as a Sixer.  On a side note that night I had a 6 leg parlay that would have banked me 500+ dollars. It was ruined when the Hornets lost to the bulls despite being up 5 with 14 seconds left. LaVine hit 13 3s that night including two in the final 14 seconds.
josh richardson 😎
Everybody likes the idea of what Josh Richardson could have been a lot more than what Josh Richardson actually is.  He's ok - just really topped out early and stopped developing more quickly than you'd usually expect.  But that's why guys like him go in the 2nd round - 4 year college players tend to come into the league a lot closer to their ceilings.
My God! Jrue out here looking like Josh Richardson
"I mean I thought the Sixers were shit a year ago, and Morey somehow managed to finesse Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and trade Danny Green for that Al Horford contract. Those two players were just what they needed. The team didn’t win this year, but those were impressive moves nonetheless.   I wouldn’t be surprised if ownership was the main factor in a Harden for Ben Simpson’s deal not getting done."
"There's probably something more disappointing than last year's Sixers team (Horford and Josh Richardson), but none in recent memory. It was a shitshow and just terrible to watch. Simmons getting hurt and the Celtics getting the sweep was just salt in the wounds."
"Him and Brunson are always messing with eachother, interacting on social media, etc. Richardson has known him for years and talked about how excited he was to come play with him. Luka and Josh Green also seem close.  Gotta disagree with the idea Luka only seems close with JJ and Boban, he seems to have a lot of good relationships on the team"
Luka is gonna be gone after the RFA extension. That is guaranteed with how badly Cuban is fucking up the Mavericks.   &gt;Hiring Jason Kidd  Literally the dumbest decision by a franchise in the last 20+ years (even worse than trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson LMAO).   Hell Luka may just take the QO to get away from that disastrous situation.
I mean imagine if they resigned Butler and traded Simmons for either another star or a depth of role players. Instead they give up Butler for Josh Richardson and build around a dude who refused to shoot. Straight up said no.
"The moves were made with assets gained during the process.   If the Sixers trade for Butler, for example, they have spent their assets well. Then when they piss away Butler for Josh Richardson, then their account value goes negative.   No one ever said every move was bad by the the post process regime, but the pissing away a 2017 Top 3 pick, the ultimate role player in Mikal Bridges, and trading Butler for Josh Richardson all contribute majorly to the degradation of the team’s asset portfolio value."
"Jason Richardson, Josh Smith, MJ  VC obvious choice"
Dallas prob willing to part with Josh Richardson.
"Why would we give that much up for a free agent?  We got Josh Richardson for Butler.  You aren't getting close to multiple firsts, let alone multiple firsts and 2 young prospects in a sign and trade for a 35 year old PG who would have to be signed for 3 years."
"Not everyone can be redeemed, Josh Richardson is broken and good riddance to him too.   Finding Tims replacements for way cheaper is a lot easier than you think."
"Lmao uh oh someone got holes poked in their logic! ""we'll just turn a 35% shooter into a 40% shooter""  So explain Josh richardson then, literally his worst season shooting from 3. What happened? Can't have two 40% shooters on your team at once? Lol"
"The part I think you're really struggling with is you said Timmy has no offense without Luka, as I said that's stupid. Worse offense does not equal no offense and that's the part you're not wrapping your head around. A player with no offense is someone like Frank Ntilikina or DSJ, now those guys have no offense, Timmy without Luka does not equal no offense. Turning a 35% shooter into a 40% shooter also isn't a guarantee as well, that's another thing you're not able to grasp.  Josh richardson shot 35% from 3 before he played in Dallas, what happened to him? Uh oh, he didn't shoot 40%"
Na he signed 4/32 with Dallas. And they traded that contract for... Josh Richardson
"We really didn’t even get Josh Richardson back, we got a fucking carcass — the man had no functioning presence. Fuck him. I hope he opts out of his last year, and if he doesn’t opt out I hope he’s on the first trade deal out the door."
Man fuck y’all for that. Fucking hated that dude during our Sixers series. And you gave him up for Josh Richardson‽ Fuck y’all. He singlehandedly caused my blood pressure to spike so many times that series.
"Read what I said before: No one else on the team can create offense for themselves without turning over the ball frequently. THJ, Kleber, KP all rely on Luka to create open looks for them. Brunson might be able to play make but he has 0 vision so his drives are always predictable. Who else do you want to handle the ball most of the time? Josh Richardson? lol. When the difference in talent between your best player and the 2nd best player is this huge, why wouldn't you want your best player to handle the ball most of the time. As soon as the Mavs can get a 2nd scoring option, I guarantee you Luka's usage rate will go down. He has usage due to lack of other scoring options."
"Please tell me how he is a ball hog. I'm tired of this argument.  No one else on the team can create offense for themselves without turning over the ball frequently.  THJ, Kleber, KP all rely on Luka to create open looks for them.  Brunson might be able to play make but he has 0 vision so his drives are always predictable.  Who else do you want to handle the ball most of the time? Josh Richardson? lol. When the difference in talent between your best player and the 2nd best player is this huge,  why wouldn't you want your best player to handle the ball most of the time. As soon as the Mavs can get a 2nd scoring option, I guarantee you Luka's usage rate will go down."
"Just sign Josh Richardson and Al Horford, the blueprint is right there."
"the post-LeBron Heat seem to have skipped the rebuilding phase, drafting well (Bam, Josh Richardson in the second round), developing talent (Duncan Robinson was undrafted), and selling high on certain assets (flipping Richardson for Jimmy Butler blows my mind now).  Another finals appearance both so soon after LeBron and without a painful rebuild is really impressive"
"what????? let GTJ walk then, mavs could use him after basically giving away seth curry for the carcass of Josh Richardson"
How much are they paying Josh Richardson?
"I don’t get what this sub’s obsession with Josh Richardson is. He’s an okay player. Decent scorer at times and a pretty good defender consistently, but that’s about it, yet people talk about him like he’s a super amazing get for any team and a borderline all-star. He’s an average to above average role player."
Josh Richardson rarely miss FT though. JRich + KP for PG + Zubac seems fair :)
"By working out the rest you mean change coach, change GM, trade for a terrible ""stretch 5"" and trade Seth Curry for a Josh Richardson?"
"Give up KP, Josh Richardson, and our next 3 first round picks."
Spo is a hardass. Josh Richardson did an appearance on the Lowe post a while back and talked about what a drill sergeant spo was. You’d finish practice and spo would tell you “you need to make 1000 more threes before you can leave” and lock them in there until they did it.  Spo also has the backing of the front office though. If a player cries to Riley about it I guarantee he’d laugh in their face
Sign and trades don’t give back equal value...if you’re expecting a good young player and a first I hate to disappoint. Jimmy Butler was sign and traded for Josh Richardson lol
"Tbf sign and trades never give back equal value, butler was traded for Josh Richardson, KD was traded for Dlo and a 1st(I think), Kemba was traded for Rozier"
"Imagine if Luka had John Collins, Capela, and Bogdan instead of Tingus Pingus, Dwight Powell, and Josh Richardson"
"hes right tho every other player literally turned the ball over 24/7 trey burke,josh richardson, brunson were all garbage only luka could be trusted with the ball in his hands against us"
Yeah let's see Trae lead the ghost of Porzingis and Josh Richardson somewhere
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
Hawks should take Simmons and pass Collins to us. We will send Powell ( or a JJ Redick sign and trade) + Josh Richardson to Philly.
"Bro, the last 2 off-seasons have taught me any contract is movable. I mean, Miami turned Whiteside, Josh Richardson and a second into Jimmy Butler."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"Mavericks  Overrated: Josh Richardson (Would say KP but after those Playoffs I guess nobody thinks that much of him)  Underrated: Hardaway Jr (Although we have many underrated players (brunson, finney smith, kleber))"
"Raptors lose their leader for Tingus Pingis, right...  Rodney Hood has Josh Richardson 2.0 written all over him, and I don't mean in a good way  What tf do the Pacers do with Kemba?  I'd be fucking amazed if Presti can finesse draft picks out of Kemba while still acquiring Lowry (IMO the superior player atm) in return"
"it was almost as bad as our josh richardson trade. what a bunch of bamboozlers down there in miami, telling us how great he is and such"
Traded Seth for Josh Richardson
How much of that was even Doc vs replacing Horford &amp; Josh Richardson with Danny Green &amp; Seth Curry and having pieces around Tobias that actually made sense?
"As a rookie it was just Simmons and Embiid and a bunch of spot up shooters. Since then he's played with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, even Josh Richardson and Seth Curry don't need to just sit on the 3 point line to score points."
"We also did have a roster with Al Horford and Josh Richardson. Our best shooter was Shake Milton. Our best reserve (with Ben out, forcing us to slide Shake in his place) was Alec Burks. Last year’s team was GOD AWFUL compared to this year.  This comment isn’t really meant to be a further indictment of Ben, but even with him, we still likely lose in the first round. Just not in 4."
How about a swap for Josh Richardson?
Josh Richardson? who says no
I'd say Josh Richardson and a 2nd round pick...  Typing that almost made me burst into tears.
Josh Richardson
Apparently not Josh Richardson
"Probably would have been 5 or 6, our roster was still shit with Al Horford and Josh Richardson"
Josh Richardson and Tyler Bey.
Remember when Mavs went from Seth Curry to Josh Richardson and we thought we got a lot better?   I try not to :(
"They were worse because they were surrounded by josh richardson and Al horford. Now they are surrounded by Seth curry and Danny green, both high volume 40 percent 3 point shooters."
We signed Jimmy and traded him for Josh Richardson.
josh richardson and a second. let’s go.
You can have Dwight Powell + josh Richardson
"There were so many people who called this to a T when they moved on from Jimmy and the reports came out that it was because he didn't want to coexist with a primary ballhandler who doesn't shoot the basketball. I agreed at the time that Ben was more valuable for blind faith that he would improve but there were tons of people saying this exact thing would have happened. Of course it's hindsight but we have that benefit, and you judge your FO's moves using hindsight. They're there to make difficult decisions like that.  Even at the time, we all knew how much of an offensive liability Ben was in the playoffs and how much Jimmy saved Ben's ass in those 2019 playoffs. I was against keeping Jimmy if that meant giving up Ben but at least you would have gotten a warchest of players and assets for Ben when all we got for Jimmy was fucking Josh Richardson and cap space to sign Al Horford."
"I think the off season thing is a strange criticism considering how weird the past 18 months have actually been for NBA players. Allegedly Celtics wanted to get off Kemba a year ago because he wasn't doing anything to rehab his knees while the league was on hiatus. This stuff has happened across the board. And at his best, his biggest limitation was the awful spacing around him (lest we forget he played with Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Embiid on the court at the same time), but he should've never been made the point guard of these teams to begin with. Philly bottomed out and tried to draft based on talent, and they ended up with 2 players who ultimately limit each other in the playoffs. Their front office fucked around with bizarre recruitment, and Morey ended up highering a coach who used him really weirdly on offense. This isn't to excuse what just happened, he stunk, Philly are easily the biggest disappointments of the playoffs and thats mostly on Simmons (even though Docs line ups were garbage). All that stuff can effect his development on the offensive end, it probably has."
Remember when the 76ers went from Butler and Reddick to Al Horford and Josh Richardson and r/nba said they got a lot better that offseason?
"Imo the real moment the process went sideways was trading for Butler. Philly traded RoCo and Saric, both process guys, for Butler. Who they traded for Josh Richardson who they then packaged with a pick to trade for Seth Curry.   Not saying that it isn't more complicated than that or that Curry isn't a good player but losing homegrown assets in a series of trades goes against what the process was all about."
"Prioritizing defense over shooters is what got Dallas Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. They need spacing and shooters. Gimme CJ and Roco for Porzingus, JR and a 2nd. Next go after a starting G, Lonzo is my first choice but if you’re willing to go into the Luxury I’d say make a run at CP or Conley, blow one of them away."
"&gt; What are other examples of a players trade value declining or increasing an insane amount over a short period of due to poor play, injury, or great play?  Well, Seth would go for a lot more than Josh Richardson today"
"20 shots a game alongside Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Finney Smith, Porzingis, Powell. CP3 was averaging 16 fga in the Hornets at one point in a much slower paced league.  Assuming that Doncic's shot profile would be the same alongside Booker, Ayton, Bridges paints him presumptuously as a guy who will never give the ball up under any circumstances, when he's shown to be a willing passer and floor general."
"On a side note, now that Philly is doomed, can you please take back Josh Richardson and give us back Seth Curry?"
"Luka single handedly carries mavs, kp is genuine garbage, josh Richardson garbage, people can't even tell much else on team cause they're so unimpactful"
He's never even had the opportunity. Philly's best pick and roll ball handler during Simmons' tenure has been...  TJ McConnell? Josh Richardson?
I know but let us see what Morey has in mind. He turned Al Horford  and josh richardson into seth curry and Danny Green after all.
"Ben Simmons has real problems but I don’t think it’s a hot take to suggest he could add some value to a shake Milton, Josh Richardson, Alec Burks, Raul Neto rotation."
"It'll trace back to 2018-2019 really. Ben-Jimmy. Ben---Brett Brown where you could tell Brett was even just completely exasperated with him and looked like he had tried everything. Josh Richardson during 2019-20 hinted at some dysfunction within the locker room, wouldnt be surprised at all if in some way or another it were traced back to frustration with Simmons even if it wasnt the direct source.  It's bad enough that Philly will probably ultimately be willing to sell low on him, which is basically the antithesis of what Daryl Morey is about. But would be pretty surprised if he's back at this point."
"He's a first-team all defense candidate, the return probably won't be very good but I'm sure Morey will be able to find a buyer, just look at the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade."
Philly did go all in for Butler and then they ruined it and got back only Josh Richardson and had to pay Tobi more than they should have because they tried to rush building a contender. Boston has been the opposite and has played it cautious nearly every time. Their cautious approach has caused them to miss opportunities to get star players and take advantage of the Warriors falling apart. Now their time is running out because JT and JB aren’t on their rookie deals anymore and their war chest of assets is starting to dwindle.
Philly gotta shake that roster up with some big trades. Just spitballing here but...maybe Seth curry for josh Richardson? I hear Dallas is looking for a shooter
"If Mavs didn't trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson who barely played, they'd probably go through Clippers."
I was. In hindsight I’ve probably been overrating josh Richardson since he had that one good season for the heat.
Josh Richardson
"I’d rather have Simmons, they can have Josh Richardson back 😂"
"Well, he would be an upgrade to the Josh Richardson disaster."
It’s more remarkable he’s your 2nd most consistent offensive threat. You traded Josh Richardson for this man haha
Seth Curry is so much better and the Sixers got him for Josh Richardson.   I still can’t believe the Mavs traded away Seth for Josh Richardson.   For Josh Richardson.   Josh Richardson.
"In defense of Josh richardson he's an effective shooter his rookie season. For some reason his shooting just get worse every season. None of AI's teammates that year even had shooting season equivalent to Josh his rookie year. The better comp would be something like poor man Roberson (Andre Roberson, not Oscar Robertson)"
"It's like saying that kobe is overrated by looking at the stretch between the shaq dynasty and the pau years. It's OK to point out the obvious. What's annoying to anyone who watched those teams are ppl acting like the team was actually pretty good. If I could create a modern version of that team for visualization:    Josh Richardson AI MKG Bobby Portis (No good dikembe comp, imagine an older gobert where his jumping diminishes).  6th man (mckie) like a poor man's jrue holiday.    Like yes, really effective defensive team, but holy shit, zero spacing and all players liable to get extremely cold at any given time at the other end. What made AI so great despite the inefficiency was that he would still put pressure on the defense regardless every possession so there was never a play off even if there was a scoring drought causing the opposing team to be alert and extend energy, and he always racked up fouls bc he wasn't afraid of going inside and getting hit."
"Nuggets could be the next Warriors. Murray, Jokic, MPJ, AG is an axing amazing core. All they need is a Josh Richardson type wing defender and to get their bench sorted out and they’ll be elite for years to come."
"Kemba + 16th pick for Horford:  - I didn't really like this deal at first, but once it was clear that OKC had to buy Kemba out, while not getting anything in return, makes me feel better. 16th pick for losing 8mil in salary + better fit + better defense + more future flexibility is....ok. Grade = C  Dennis Schroder:  - I don't know how this happened, but it's pretty amazing. We needed more offense and we needed another PG. The fact that we got a 12+mil player for half the price is amazing. He's not here long-term, but still amazing. Grade = A+  Williams extension:  - He is getting paid like Holmes. Advanced stats and Per 36 numbers suggest that Williams is at least on par with Holmes on both ends of the floor, so, in theory, it's fair value. If Williams stays healthy I think it will be an underpay, (much like Holmes contract). If Williams stays hurt, then he's overpaid, but by only 3ish mil per year imo, so still not horrible. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Marcus Smart:  - I wouldn't look too much into his defensive decline last year. Everyone on the team struggled defensively and we had 0 consistency in terms of lineup. No one is talking about what did against the Nets, where he was clearly our 2nd best player night-in and night-out on both ends of the floor. His half-court play-making is severely underrated. His shooting is ass and will always be ass. He's cheaper than Ball and older than Ball, but I think there are things he does better and things he's worse at. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Josh Richardson:  - Eh, not great. Not bad. He won't stick around next year, but he helps our defense, which was a middling one last year. He is part of a series of additions/subtractions that, in theory, should vault the C's defense back to top 5 status. I wanted more out of the TPE, but getting him for free ain't bad. Grade = C+  Kanter:  - Solid rebounder. Solid scorer. Solid defender against Embiid and big/lumbering centers. Otherwise, meh. He was cheap and will be our 3rd string center. I think we got him for cheaper than he is worth, so it was a good signing. Also, with Horford and Rob potentially missing games due to injury and age, we needed a 3rd stringer who could spot start reliably and Kanter can do that well. Grade = B+  TT for Dunn + 2nd rounder  - Lol I thought TT had negative value in a trade, so the fact we got positive value AND a cheaper contract, really nothing to complain about. I suspect Brad is looking to dump Dunn + someone else to get under the luxury tax, so Dunn isn't doing much for us. The real value is getting something for negative value imo. Grade = A  Draft  - I mean, we only had a 2nd rounder. He looks good, but will be overseas. I can't really give this a value yet. No idea what he's going to be. I lumped losing the 16th pick in with the Kemba deal, so this draft was....idk. Grade = Incomplete  Overall:  - I think it was a successful off-season overall. Our bench is better, our defense is better, and we are better suited to improve this team going forward. We got some good value players and re-signed guys on fair contracts, (I don't think either is overpaid or underpaid). That being said, I don't think we got fair value for the 16th pick, I don't think we are a title contender, and most of the good signings/acquisitions are likely gone by next year. I think we had an above average off-season, but not great and not on the fringes of great either. Just above average. Grade = B"
"Jaylen Brown just put up 25ppg and is an all-star at 24. He wouldn't be the centerpiece in the Beal scenario.  For reference, Miami gave up Josh Richardson to get Jimmy Butler."
"First of all, Rob williams &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Moses Brown. You say ‘an ageing josh richardson’ like he is 35, he is 27, he’s going into his prime. Josh richardson&gt;moses brown, i shouldn’t have to say that. Rob Williams is great when healthy, and if he stays healthy, he will probably end up out playing this contract. He had 9 blocks against the best team in the league in the playoffs on one leg. He was 7th in blocks per game, despite playing 18 mpg. That 18 mpg was mainly due to not being healthy. Therefore, if he can stay healthy, its a good contract no doubt."
"I don’t get why they would trade for Moses Brown, who seems like an as good if not better player than Williams and trade him for an aging Josh Richardson, then give Williams basically the contract Richaun Holmes got"
"Lol it's not screwing over the franchise if they only get 2 picks instead of 5.  The difference with making a S&amp;T happen and signing a 5 year ""with the understanding they would help trade him in a year"" is it takes ALL of the power away from Beal.  So what if Boston makes another ""bad offer"" again.  The Wizards tell Beal they couldn't milk enough out of the Celtics so he has to stay another year?  The S&amp;T makes it an absolute that he goes where he wants to go.  The Wizards had a chance to trade Beal last offseason for a massive haul.  They can trade him again this season for a good haul.  If they wait until next offseason, they will have almost no leverage and be at the mercy of where Beal wants to play.  And if he wants to play for a team over the cap, I guarantee you the Wizards will help facillitate it because getting something back to let him play for the Celtics is better than screwing themselves, Beal and the Celtics over just so he can sign with San Antonio, Detroit etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Look at the Jimmy Butler S&amp;T again.  The Sixers literally only got Josh Richardson back.  Lowry only netted Precious and a bad Dragic contract.  If the Wizards wanted an actual return for Beal, they should have traded him last year.    &amp;#x200B;  But why would Boston want to do Smart and 5 firsts this year without a long term guarantee on Beal (he would not do an extension because he could get more with a new contract) when they can do 2 firsts and guarantee Beal for at least 3 years next offseason.  If Beal signs elsewhere next season (anywhere, not just Boston), I guarantee you the Wizards will facillitate a S&amp;T and it will be for much lower than Beal's value.  The point of a S&amp;T isn't to net equal value for Beal, it's so he can play where he wants to play, and the Wizards get a little something back for playing nice.  Like I said, they aren't going to screw themselves, Beal and whoever is signing him just to spite that team."
"If Beal hits free agency the Wizards lose almost all of their leverage. In a sign-and-trade the Wizards wouldn't get Brown back. Look back at the Jimmy Butler deal, again - Miami is capped, Butler chooses them, what Miami trades out is Josh Richardson and Hassan Whiteside. In this case, Butler is a better player than Beal, Richardson is a less valuable player than Smart, and Whiteside was getting paid more than Horford. Philly only got Richardson back."
He reminds me of Josh Richardson.  More likely to regress than improve and even the contract he got was probably too much.
Josh Richardson made me close my eyes and pray every time he stepped on the court so he should be one of the best players on the team.
"porzingis is better than dlo and beas and ant yes...thj is a better shooter/scorer than beasley yes...josh richardson isn't even on the team  anyways, these guys played like 15 games together anyways, idk how you can see that and still say this shit"
"Porzingis, THJ, Josh Richardson is better than Dlo, Beasley, Anthony Edwards? Damn, gimme a turn of whatever you're smoking."
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
Have you watched Josh Richardson and Dennis Schroeder play?
"Well, plus they saved money, got Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, got rid of Thompson, aren't paying  Fournier 20m a year and now have a 17m TPE."
Yea. Josh Richardson is not good at basketball. Butler is.
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our “GM”). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I’d say he’s done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
"Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  It doesn't always take much, it completely depends on who you're going after and how much that team wants them.  Also keep in mind you have a year to use the TPE, so it doesn't need to be some kind of trade deadline splurge.    So, for example, the Celtics just traded Moses Brown for Josh Richardson using the TPE.  Moses Brown was a throw-in on the Horford deal and a guy the Celtics really had no place for anyways.  Bottom line is it's a good thing to have, because you never know what may open up.  And you don't have to use it."
Well with the new details it’s like literally one second rounder and we get josh Richardson for the whole year now. We’ll see what they use it on
"On its own this is a good deal no doubt it, but you still got to give up something else to get Ingles, so for now you guys have given up 5 or 6 2nd rounders picks in Hayward TPE related deals and only got half a season of Fournier and Josh Richardson to show for it."
"&gt;stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  Just because the Mavs FO is dumb doesn't mean Morey is a genius.   &gt;got Dwight, Embiid’s best backup so far, on a vet min   Because the Lakers fucked it up. But where is he now?  &gt;re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  No other team was going to give Danny 10 million a year. Furkan is just a 3 point shooter."
"In his one year in Philly, Morey has :  **Pros**  * got the Sixers to the 1 seed in the East  * unloaded the horrific Horford contract while acquiring Danny Green, a very useful role player  * stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  * got Dwight, Embiid’s best backup so far, on a vet min  * re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  * drafted some promising young players, such as Maxey    **Cons**   * not acquiring Harden because of a personal vendetta from Tillman  * the George Hill trade was kind of weird in retrospect   I’m feeling pretty good with Morey at the helm."
They couldn’t afford Rubio. He makes 16 million a year.   This article explains it.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-trade-for-mavericks-josh-richardson-after-wing-opts-into-final-year-of-his-deal/
"Could they have used their TPE on Rubio? Because unless the Wolves were keen on trading Rubio for Taurean Prince then that was a missed opportunity to fill their need at a cheap price.. they then used their TPE for Josh Richardson, who really doesn’t do much or do anything consistently these days"
"Sounds like Miami Josh Richardson. So idk, like \~10 mil/year give or take 2 mil if your team needs a solid starter but not any more than that. On a contender best used as a 6th or 7th man."
"&gt; Josh Richardson - $11,615,328  He’s only under contract this year. It’s not a bad contract to ship for dragic lol"
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
"Kindoff feel Horford is overlooked more because his albatross contract.He is definitely a an above avegae centre in my opinion,he had a horrible fit in philly and can hold his own against almost all centres apart from the very best and is a significant enough improvement on what theis offered last yr imo and How much worse is Schroeder than what Kemba offered last year, outside shooting is worse but is definitely a better defender and Josh Richardson though acquired in salary dump is a significant upgrade in terms of experience and defense of the bench and i feel it's acceptable to expect jumps from 2nd yr players like pritchard and Nesmith which will give them a damn solid 9 men rotation imo."
"bring him home, we'll give you one slightly used Josh Richardson."
"Perimeter defense, maybe. We also have Kris Dunn and Josh Richardson. But I’m guessing Al isn’t as good as he was when he was with us, and Timelord is still a little raw and often injured. So I don’t think we have the interior presence to be the top defense"
"Josh Richardson, was getting all defense votes a few seasons in and shot a stupid percentage his Rookie year. I thought he'd be Kawhi and that it would be one of the best draft steals ever."
"Process over results, all the moves were good and made sense. Same way I feel about the KP and Josh Richardson trades. Sucks they didn't work out, but I still think they were smart moves."
"If things break right this season, I think we could crack a top 3 seed. I'm not saying it *will* happen, but people are underrating just how beat-up we were last year, and how good we were during the brief periods where our starters were actually getting some run together. Not to mention the fact that we're going to have an *actual bench* this season for the first time since Kyrie left— Josh Richardson and Dennis Schroder may not be stars, but they're *huge* upgrades from Jeff Teague and Grant Williams."
"We added Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Dennis Schroder to a team that didn't have a bench and was *constantly* injured last year, while losing Fournier (who played sixteen games for us) and Kemba (who played 43 games for us and wasn't very good even when he *did* play). Seriously, I cannot stress how poor our bench was, and how much more our rotation was impacted by injury and COVID— Jeff Teague, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters started a combined **17** games for us."
"Brad Stevens is a terrible gm. Much better as a coach. Trading a lot for moses brown (fine) then trading him, a promising center on a cheap deal who was putting up rebounding numbers we haven’t seen since shaq, for an aging Josh Richardson is absolutely insane. He’s neither rebuilding nor surrounding his stars with good pieces, which makes zero sense."
"I’d love to hear your reasoning for why they’re better than last year, but especially why they should be ranked higher than I have them.   Tatum played 64/72 games and Brown played 58/72 games, but the Celtics were just 36-36. Horford is 36 years old, Schroeder is an average starter, and Josh Richardson is a below average starter.   I just don’t see how they’re better than last year if everyone stays at their current level."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Agreed. I remember Jason Richardson stans coming at Heat fans for calling Josh Richardson J Rich. Like stfu, everybody around them calls them that. Stop gatekeeping nicknames"
"Heat legend Josh Richardson does not suck how dare you, sir."
"I think the Celtics have a lot more depth compared to last season.  Smart or Schröder off the bench, probably Schöder.  Josh Richardson off the bench.  Pritchard, Langford, and Nesmith should all be improved, and one of them is likely to really step up.  Then you have Horford or Robert Williams on the bench. Probably Williams to start the year, but I could totally see it being switched as the year goes on.  It’s a bit dependent on one of their young guys to step up, but all of them have shown some type of promise so it just feels inevitable that one of the three really steps up."
Better than josh richardson
The take wasn't dennis vs carsen; the take was why do the celtics think they can win with a guard depth chart that has fucking 8 guards? You just got josh richardson too?? Thats 2 guard signings that can't shoot taking away minutes from prospects that look like they can.
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford – Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson – Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn – Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
"unless we go ""small"" and start Jaylen at the 3 I have a very hard time seeing that, and even if we do that I think Josh Richardson starts over him.  He's not going to start over Smart at PG and we've needed a spark off the bench since Terry left"
Smart is starting. Dennis will either back him up or start over Josh Richardson who is frankly not very good.
"Or maybe he's 35 and playing maybe his last truly productive year in the NBA. He played with Josh Richardson, Winslow, Whiteside, and Waiters for years and didn't complain. He doesn't want to go through that again"
More like josh Richardson is no longer there to brick 3s all game long
Yes but it’s LUKA’s fault that Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson aren’t all-stars. If Luka just passed them the ball more they’d become great ballhandlers!! /s
Oklahoma  PG: Trae Young  SG: John Starks  SF: Josh Richardson  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Ekpe Udoh  6: Shake Milton
"Bro, Josh Richardson shot consistently below 40% in regular season too when they ran the offense through him. Always a weird stupid sequence with bad mid ranges or a chucked 3. That's why he got benched in the playoffs. We expected him to break out of the funk, but he never did. He's never had anyone who can at least even create his own shot.  I would say this that whenever JJ barea played with him, he would be the one initiating the offence, and not Luka."
"We literally only lost Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Fournier, and added Al Horford and Josh Richardson.   \-Kemba missed nearly half the season and showed close to no burst/athleticism anymore, and was essentially turned into a jumpshooter. He was streaky before getting hurt, then take away his ability to drive and he either scores an inefficient 25 or puts up a complete dud while also being a turnstile on defense.   \-We had Fournier for a total of 16 games and had a losing record with him. I would've liked to have kept him, but he was never really integrated well and therefore him leaving shouldn't be factored into this team.  \-Thompson was awful save for game 3 of the Brooklyn series."
The Mavs have a trade exception that Josh Richardson would fit into perfectly. Just send us a couple seconds and we’ll take his contract off your hands
u know philly got josh richardson for jimmy butler right?
Smart+Josh Richardson+Grant williams 1 frp 2 swaps 2 second rounds
"Woj literally reported the deal was Ingram a first and loul deng (a negative asset who we’d have to take back as a salary filler). Spurs wanted more and the Lakers said no. Sure you can argue that in hindsight Ingram and a first is a good deal, but DeRozan, Poeltl and a first was an even better deal at that time.    Kawhi had no value because he tanked it. The other offers the Spurs had were from the Celtics who didn’t offer sophomore Brown or rookie Tatum. The sixers who wouldn’t even offer Markelle fultz, the Heat whose “god father” offer was centered around Hassan whiteside and Josh Richardson, and the Clippers whose deal was an expiring Tobias Harris and a lottery pick.  Kawhi was out the previous year with a quad and knee injury his team tried to debunk, was on an expiring deal, and had a camp that threatened teams with the possibility of him sitting out another year, and made it known he was going to go to Los Angeles which lead to no teams wanting to give up anything of value."
Seen this said about 50+ players since the Josh Richardson trade
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"We picked him ahead of Norm Powell, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Larry Nance, Josh Richardson, and Pat Connaughton. And now we're trading him for a second rounder *and* uh...some crappy player whose name I already forgot!"
"We...used it tho, hell we use a TDE 3 times in the last year (Fournier trade, Kris Dunn trade, Josh Richardson trade), admittedly not super exciting moves"
They could have used their TPE on Rubio instead of Josh Richardson. That’s an L in my book
&gt;we only had to give philly josh Richardson for Jimmy Butler for crying out loud  Yeaaa but that lowkey was just unfair and you can’t expect something like that to happen again
"I acknowledge that, which is why you’re getting a decent return for a player you were about to lose. However, I imagine you won’t get much more than us adding KZ or something lol. Sign and trades don’t return great value even when they’re absolutely necessary. We only had to give Philly Josh Richardson for Jimmy Butler for crying out loud lmao."
Josh Richardson. Statistically he seems like an ok shooter but teams don’t respect it.
"He’s one of those guys who Spoelstra made look better than he was. A la Josh Richardson, Derrick Jones Jr"
"He's wrong about that though, but this is what I've seen a bunch of Celtics fans telling themselves to try to justify why the front office has made the moves they have. To get Beal in free agency, the Celtics would have to find a way to salary dump Horford with no money coming back, they'd have to let Marcus Smart and Robert Williams simply walk in free agency, and they'd have to renounce basically everyone except for Tatum and Brown and maybe Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith. That's about the only way they could get $50 million under the cap, which is what they'd need to create the necessary cap space to make Beal a max offer next summer, and that all seems incredibly unrealistic.   They could try to figure out a trade for Beal this season, but that would probably involve Jaylen Brown, and I don't think Boston wants to do that. I think if Washington gets any sense that Beal may actually leave next summer then they'll probably trade him this summer or upcoming season rather than let it go to free agency, but I could be wrong.   What Boston is actually doing is just trying to get under the luxury tax. Tatum's extension kicked in this off-season and that made it so Boston either needed to make some cuts or go into the tax. So they gave up a 1st to swap Kemba for Horford and save some money there, and then they let Fournier walk, replacing him with Josh Richardson for about $8 million less than Fournier would have cost. And now apparently the sides are very far apart on a Marcus Smart extension because what Smart wants will put Boston in the tax a year from now, especially since they're gonna have to pay Robert Williams as well.   The big indicator that this ""max cap space in 2022"" thing is bogus will be if they trade Marcus Smart once extension talks truly break down. If this ""no contracts beyond 2022"" thing is true, then Smart being an expiring would be just what they're looking for. But instead my guess is if they can't extend him, they'll trade him rather than just have him walk in free agency like Horford, Hayward, Kyrie and Fournier did. I just don't think it's realistic that Boston would risk the total decimation of their team in the hopes that Beal signs with them. If he didn't they'd be absolutely fucked, and there's simply no way they can count on him doing that. It's just not a realistic plan for any team to have."
Josh Richardson wasn’t enough?
"Their scouting and player development is solid; they find hidden gems not only in the draft but in the pool of undrafted players. Their G-League program keeps churning out rotation players (Rodney McGruder, Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, Duncan Robinson). They seem to get the best out of guys, even revitalizing discarded veterans (Wayne Ellington, Dewayne Dedmon, Birdman, Anthony Mason had his only All-Star year with the Heat). They employ a lot of their former players: Anthony Carter, Keith Askins, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Chris Quinn, Shane Battier, Malik Allen, Caron Butler, Kasib Powell."
The Celtics were not ready to give Fournier what he asked for.  The arrival of Josh Richardson was the signal for this future departure.  Fournier will be able to bring a lot to this Knicks team.
Sounds like Josh Richardson
Josh Richardson is making more than that
Risk-averse? Did you see how bad josh Richardson was last year?
"have fun with josh richardson, lol"
"Miami turned Whiteside and Josh Richardson into Jimmy Butler. Never doubt what Andy Ellisburg and Pat Riley are capable of doing, man."
You know how dumb you gotta be to say this is a bad move lol? It doesn't matter how the end of his contract looks. Pat and Elisburg moved Josh Richardson for Jimmy Butler. Cap space is meaningless when your team is in Miami.
"Tbf, it’s kind of an indictment of those teams that Josh Richardson was our go to guy in those situations."
"Mannix is pretty good for the C's as long as you pay attention to the weasel words.  He states that Brad is annoyed by Smart's inconsistency and that the C's front office has some interest in Dinwiddie, even though the numbers make it very unlikely. That sounds feasible, and could very well be solid reporting. The ""acquisition of Josh Richardson *could* spell the end of Marcus Smart’s run"" bit that follows is pure speculation.   But when a trade doesn't happen, people will pretend that the speculation part was intended as hard reporting in order to discredit the next thing he says that people don't like.  He's got sources inside the C's, but his reporting tends to follow a ""here is what I'm hearing, so we COULD see (baseless speculation)"" format. He's decent, but take it with a grain of salt."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
Uhhh did Brad watch Josh Richardson the last two seasons? Hasn't he gotten benched the last two years in the playoffs?  I get Smart is erratic but he's still one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and if he gets hot he can win you a game.
Luka is not good at getting his teammates involved at all. Notice how every player gets worse when they get to Dallas? Josh Richardson is gonna be solid af for the celtics. He was terrible in Dallas because of Luka.  Luka just dumps the ball late in the shot clock to his teammates to hunt assists.
&gt;Honestly it's a breath of fresh air from the same roster building strategy of only floor spacers  Lol Philly flair. Dude are you that traumatized from the Embiid-Horford-Tobias-Josh Richardson-Simmons core that you completely erased it from your memory 🙂
smart looks like CP3 compared to josh richardson. The Mavs send their regards
If he hates Marcus Smart he’s gonna *love* Josh Richardson
"I just feel bad for Boston. They generated that huge TPE from the Hayward trade and don't have a lot to show for it.  They wasted two seconds on Fournier (granted, they're just seconds). But then they dumped Kemba along with a first to get Horford and enough cap space to re-sign Fournier only to see Fournier dip in search of an overpay.  The other portion of it went to Josh Richardson who's just been meh the past few seasons.  I was a huge proponent of Sacramento finally retooling and trading Harrison Barnes but that didn't happen."
Should have just taken the Turner trade - lost half of the TPE at the cost of two seconds and the other half went to Josh Richardson (oh boy)
"He’s on my “all-hypothetical all-star” team with Lonzo Ball, Josh Richardson, Robert Covington, &amp; Otto Porter."
"1 year ago, I said that Josh Richardson was nothing more than an average starter on the r/sixers and got completely downvoted.   Interesting to see how the narrative has changed."
Might make sense if they are turning Marcus smart into something. He’s got a good contract size. J rich might be a sort of replacement for him. Other guys point was that it could make more sense in the long run. Josh Richardson is a useful player even though he had a couple down years.
Why pay evan fournier when you can pay josh richardson?  big brain moves.
"He'd be amazing playing with Luka.  I feel like you can't really play him at the same time as Hardaway, Brunson or Burke for defensive purposes, but I'm not super familiar with Dallas' backcourt situation, especially with Josh Richardson moved.  We'll have to see what happens in FA. Obviously he'd be good in NO providing spacing for Zion, but if Lonzo goes somewhere else, it's the same issue of who are you pairing Bryn with in the backcourt?   I personally love the guy, but MIL had an amazing situation for him where he could play with their best 3 players, who are all capable of being lead ball handlers and are all good to HoF level defenders."
"Love this, Josh Richardson would be a pretty decent 2 for us and then we could let Fournier(please re-sign) run the bench."
I've given up trying to figure this stuff out since we traded an actual asset for Josh Richardson.
What’s the current “better in theory” team?   PG - ???  SG - Josh Richardson  SF - ???  PF - Robert Covington   C - Myles Turner
We just traded for Josh Richardson. That's more than enough of a connection to Philly on the Celtics already.
I sure would rather have had Indiana's offer for Hayward than a few weeks of Fournier and a year of Josh Richardson.
Remember a couple years ago everyone thought Josh Richardson was really good? Now he’s foregoing free agency to exercise an $11 million option.
"That very well could be the case, but Tatum and Brown are going to be really easy to defend if they are passing the ball off to Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson when they get doubled."
So we got Josh Richardson and Al Horford and dumped a pick to get off Kemba. Its proactive at least
16th pick for Josh Richardson?
A second for Josh Richardson? I thought he was good
"Thankfully Celtics got rid of most players I hated. Ojeley, Carson Edwards, Waters all gone. Thank you Brad Stevens.      People also hate Grant Williams but he still has a chance. So I guess that leaves Josh Richardson to hate but we have enough decent players that he could fall out the rotation and I won’t mind."
Last year I'd say Josh Richardson for the Mavs fans on here but probably KP among the more casuals looking for a scapegoat.  All time is easily Rondo lol
"I disagree. I see this lineup as a bottom 5 defensive lineup. LaVine and DeRozan are decent Shot creators but not high end ones. And both are bad at best on defense with LaVine being just merely bad and DeRozan being one of the worst in the league.  Also Boston also has Horford, Smart (who I'd take over everyone besides LaVine on the Bulls), Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Dennis Schroeder, Josh Richardson, Grant Williams. Celtics have better high end talent and better depth."
"Yeah, and you save us back Josh RichardSon just for the S!"
"Why can't it just be the case that Cuban fired Voulgaris for the Josh Green pick, Nelson for the Curry-Richardson trade, and Carlisle for being disliked by the players?"
"Damn, with the 'S' in Josh Richardson, you couldn't give us Giannis?"
"We'll see. We have yet to get to the conclusion of all this nonsense.   In the meantime, he's already built up a lot of slack because of how he was able to get rid of Horford relatively painlessly (and get Danny Green in return) and trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry.   As bad as our situation is now, it would be 100x worse if our old front office was still running things."
"If the Wolves start hot that offer could dry up quickly. Look at what happened when the Wolves were talking to the Heat about Butler. Wolves turned down an offer with Josh Richardson, he started the year out hot, offer off the table.   It might not be smart money, but GMs and front offices get attached to players once the season starts. There’s not a guarantee offers will get better."
"Literally fans booing him. . . Linked to and article. . . Right above 😐 do you not remember? How bout when embiid goes down, you remember how toxic these subs get? How bout all of 2019 and 2020, tormented horfard Harris and Josh Richardson..."
"[yall haven't supported shit](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/sixers-nba-playoffs-ben-simmons-boos-free-throws-nets-fans-20190413.html) did the same shit to embiid too, harris, horfard, Josh Richardson, hell, yall went to Milwaukee just to boo JJ"
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
Curry Luka Klay Thompson/Paul George og anunoby and gobert starting 5. Back ups I’ll take Dwight Josh Richardson Jordan Clarkon Marcus Morris annnnd Dort
"Robert Williams/Josh Richardson are the starters, Horford/Schoder are on the bench."
Josh Richardson is always the answer to this question.
"Luka still doesn’t turn bad shooters into good ones though. Just look at what Josh Richardson and Wes Iwundu were like in Dallas.  Frank is young though, is improvement is still possible, just not a guarantee"
"Personally, I wouldn't put us as high as this person did. That being said, there is a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the Celtics season.  1. Replacing 6 games of Fournier for a season of Josh Richardson is actually an upgrade  2. Replacing half a season of Theis with a full season of Horford is also an upgrade  3. Replacing half a season of Kemba at 70% of himself with a highly motivated Dennis Schroder is at least a huge upgrade on defense, if we do take a step back offensively   4. The depth this year is waaaaaaaaay better than it has been in the past, with Schroder and likely Horford coming off the bench  5. Most of the changes we made are on the defensive side of the ball and there's a chance we could see a return to a top 5 defense  I think the Heat and Hawks are ahead of us, but I'm still pretty optimistic about how things will go."
A defensive stopper who can't shoot. They got Josh Richardson replacement.
"for sure, with my flair I don't have a ton of credibility as a non-homer, but Dallas just finished 5th, Denver and the Clippers will be without their 2nd best and best players and Dallas upgraded slightly (Josh Richardson to Reggie Bullock) and Porziņģis is getting his first healthy off season in years. I've got us in the 3-6 range, but a lot of folks have us in the 8-10 range.   I guess Kidd and Porziņģis' recent playoff series have a lot of folks down on us."
Al Horford and Josh Richardson: The Return
"not quite fair, we have to give them Josh Richardson too"
I know you did not just put Josh Richardson up there lol. And Harden has one of the quickest first steps in the league
"Solomon hill, josh Richardson, Stanley Johnson, Isaac okoro. Can list more. What’s so special about hardens build ? He’s strong but there are plenty of strong two guards. He’s not a fantastic leaper. He’s not super fast."
"Clint Capela, Josh Richardson,"
"So was James Johnson, so was Josh Richardson."
"Unless I'm misunderstanding what he meant by ""the earliest GAP"", I would think it had to have come in the [Mavs-Clippers game on December 27](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202012270LAC.html) when Josh Richardson scored a basket with 1:15 left in the second quarter to put the Mavs up 74-25."
John Wall is going to be on the Celtics by the trade deadline in some sort of deal surrounding Al Horford and Josh Richardson or something.
"He has to force a sign and trade unless he wants to go to one of five teams -- Detroit, San Antonio, Orlando, Memphis and New Orleans. They are the only ones in range of a max cap space slot. Even if Zach wants to leave, I don't think he'd want to go to one of those teams.  You are saying there are teams that can and will open up the space to sign him. Under normal circumstances, that's definitely a thing. Next off-season isn't normal. Basically everyone saw how bad the market was in terms of what was available and decided to use their cap space in extensions or taking on dead money. (If the Celtics really wanted to save space for a run at Zach, they wouldn't be extending Josh Richardson for instance.) Other than the five mentioned and the Thunder, no one is even range of a max cap space.The Kings, Timberwolves and Knicks are nearly 30 million away from having a max cap slot. This is a really hard year to dump that much money because no one has the cap space to take it on.  One of the reasons Lowry was able to get to Miami is because the Heat had a plausible path of signing him without Toronto's involvement if forced to. Zach won't have that same option with the teams he's interested in. Also, because Lowry wasn't near a max player, it wasn't too much salary for Raptors to take on.  It'd be different with Zach and the Bulls. If the Bulls sign and traded Zach to a team, they'd have to take on $29 million dollars in salary for the trade to work. Are they really doing that for a first rounder and to lose a player they want to keep to a team they can't sign him without their help anyway?    And on top of all that, seven teams are likely to be above the apron next off-season, meaning they can't acquire a player through sign and trade away.  It's a really bad market to leave a team in unrestricted free agency. Zach can do it but he can't just get anywhere and the Bulls wouldn't be incentivized to help him even if he was screaming in the face to them that he would leave. More likely, he'd take their money and force a trade a year later Harden-style."
"I like him, but Josh Richardson got really hyped up for that one season he had in Miami"
We got the corpse of Al Horford and Josh Richardson
"Damn, yall are really low on the Mavs.  Luka is a year older and building off of back to back All NBA first team seasons, KP is having his first healthy off season since his sophomore year and is going to build off of back to back 20 &amp; 9 seasons, THJ is in his prime, we upgraded Josh Richardson who was unplayable for Reggie Bullock and DFS is a great glue guy, as is Kleber. It wasn't a home run offseason by any means, but I don't see how we go from 5th to 8th. Last season we missed the most minutes due to COVID. 6 of our 8 rotation guys missed weeks with COVID and KP missed time recovering from surgery. We were 1 seed behind the Clippers last year and they had a healthy Kawhi and two behind Denver, I don't see how we fall to two/three seeds below them and Denver respectively, when both will be missing star players for the entire season and we are starting off healthy.   IMO:  1. Utah 2. Lakers 3. Phoenix 4. Dallas 5. Denver 6. Golden State 7. Blazers 8. Clippers  I think Utah will gun in the regular season, while the Lakers rest more games and prep for the playoffs, I don't think they care about the #1 seed."
"Trying to think of teams that could really use Rubio, and what they could potentially trade for him and his $17.8m contract; remembering the Cavs largely need wing depth:   **Boston Celtics:** Would have to be some combination of Richardson and Nesmith/Langford.   **Los Angeles Clippers:** Luke Kennard and maybe Keon Johnson?   **New Orleans Pelicans:** Josh Hart and maybe Trey Murphy?   Hard to find much of a market for him where the other team can give up much."
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
Don't forget his biggest assist of all time to Josh Richardson
"The second best player on the Mavs comes off the bench for the Hawks last year. Who is better John Collins or Kristaps Porzigis. Bogdan or Tim Hardaway Jr. Josh Richardson, or Danilo Gallinari.  I said Assist% as they had virtually identical rates for the past 2 years and you know that. Its not trolling to say luka's the better playmaker, and Trae isn't top 10 its just the truth."
"I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto-- Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn were both undrafted players. Bam Adebayo, way better than draft outlook. Herro better than draft outlook. Team frequently finds G league diamonds in the rough. A lot of your teams rotational players were at some point Heat development projects (Tyler Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr, Josh Richardson, etc etc.)"
And instead they kept both and got rid of Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson.
"Yeah man. Rotations and were a problem for us. And having no real centers, hurt. Having to play Boban sucked. And having a terrible josh Richardson sucked also. Which is why I still think, we have the toughest challenge to the clips. And if Kawhi had stayed healthy, they probably would have won it all."
"I’m not trying to argue or anything but you didn’t reply to my other comment and I’m genuinely down to see your side on this - but if you agree that positions are fluid then how can you flat out say Luka is *not* a point guard? When he starts alongside DFS, Josh Richardson, Kleber and Porzingis, I don’t see how Luka cannot be a point guard in this lineup.  You can’t just box someone into one position, that’s why people are labelled as multi-positional. It always depends on who you are playing with on the court. If Luka played the majority of his minutes with another point guard (such as Brunson or Dennis Smith Jr early in his career), then sure he’s not the point guard in that case."
"Positions are fluid, so he’s both. But Luka literally started at point guard this year, because Josh Richardson, Hardaway Jr, DFS are definitely not point guards. Early in his career when he started with Dennis Smith Jr., or games when Brunson starts, Luka is a point forward, not the point guard.  People bring up LeBron being a point guard but he’s started with other actual point guards for most of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). In the Lakers year where Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradley/KCP would start, then yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Either than that he’s largely been a point forward."
"the KG point is laughably stupid so I won’t even address that. LeBron has started with other point guards for the majority of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). So for the majority of his career he’s been a forward. The year he started with Danny Green and KCP or Avery Bradley, yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Because those other guys are flat out not point guards.  Again you’re just dodging my original question lol. Who started at point for the Mavs this year? Hardaway Jr? Josh Richardson?"
"Magic didn’t guard point guards either, Byron Scott would guard the other team’s best guard. But like you said that doesn’t matter.  Luka literally runs the entire offence like a point guard does. Just because he’s a score first player doesn’t make him *not* a PG. He plays the exact role Dame does on offence.  Positions are so fluid anyways so I don’t even know why I’m arguing this lol. If Brunson or another actual point guard started alongside Luka I would agree on your “point forward” distinction. But that wasn’t the case this year. Luka literally started at point guard this year. THJ, DFS &amp; Josh Richardson are nowhere near point guards."
"I just think the lack of self-awareness is funny.  I didn't realize celtics fans actually think they are on some big upswing.  You went from all these picks to having Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford...then to Kemba and Hayward, then to just Kemba with the Jays, and now you got Dennis Schroder and Josh Richardson and old Horford. Two guys whose former teams celebrated having gone lol.  All the while the East got better"
Remember when the Mavs traded for KP and it was a dumpster fire of a move that never benefited them?  That’s not true but we’ll lose the context with time so someday people will think it’s true.  Remember when the Mavs traded a great shooter in Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and then immediately got rid of him when they realized what the rest of the league realized - Josh Richardson sucks? Again - all the context is gone from that statement but the context goes away with time.  Remember when their org exploded and they got rid of one of the longest tenured head coaches at the time?
"&gt;  Huh, they cover each other’s weaknesses perfectly.  Draymond could be paired with literally anyone and help cover their weaknesses.  KP is still a bad defender.  &gt;  KP is way too laterally slow to play the 4 next to a big 5.  You're right.  He's also too weak to play the 5, too slow in every direction to play 3, and unlike all good defensive 4's he's not switchable.  &gt;  KP before this year was actually a very good rim protector, he just needs good help defense in the pnr which draymond can provide.  That's not why he stopped being a good rim defender.  He stopped being a good rim defender because his knees are torn apart and he can't move, and he hasn't added any strength to compensate.  &gt;  On offense, dray gives luka a secondary playmaker and KP can cover for draymonds lack of shooting with his spacing.  Yeah, KP's spacing helps Dray.  That's really the only benefit to pairing them.  Frankly, Luka plays off ball so little I genuinely don't know if he's good off ball.  In terms of cuts, he doesn't have much quickness, but he's as smart as they come with good instincts so I'm sure he could be good this way.  &gt;  They give Dallas the flexibility to run KP as the 4 and Dray as the 5 on offense and then switch to KP as the 5 and Dray as the 4 on defense.  You can't really start Dray at the 5.  It's good in small doses for small ball, but the amount of energy it takes for him to play 5 means we typically only played our death squad or Hamptons 5 (our Harrison Barnes and KD small ball sets) a maximum of 10 minutes in any given game.  The basic problem is this:  KP can't move well enough to guard anyone outside of 10 feet, and he gets bullied at the rim.  Luka is barely a positive defender because he's sharp and strong, but he also lacks lateral movement.  The Mavs two biggest problems were that they had 2-3 people on the court at any given time who could get barbecued in the iso, and that they had the same people who couldn't switch onto other players.  Your offense, especially when you had Seth Curry instead of Josh Richardson, was terrifying.  But the basic idea is that if you guys are able to survive Jason Kidd's coaching, you desperately need a versatile defensive 4 who can maybe hit a 3 at a decent clip."
"There was no need to have an immediate choice. Butler and Embiid were obviously the two best players in the 2019 playoffs. How Simmons and Harris got put ahead of Embiid and Butler by the front office headed into that summer is some piss poor management work.  But they should have just figured it out later on. Having both Butler and Simmons on the roster would have allowed them to be more aggressive in finding a trade to get the right fit for their roster.  The Butler trade was just poor return anyways. Essentially for Josh Richardson and Horford that Morey redeemed somewhat with the later Curry trade. Had they retained Butler, even if they didn’t want him, they could have traded him for something like Wiggins, Minnesota pick, Warriors pick, to the Warriors if they didn’t love his fit, and just overall get way more back for him."
"I don’t see Simmons being a good fit without KP. The issue with Simmons is that he clogs the paint with his lack of spacing, so he needs a 5 that plays best on the perimeter. The Mavs tried enough lineups with 2 bad shooters (Powell, Michael Kidd Ghilchrist, Wes Iwundu, Josh Richardson, etc…) and it never worked out well.   Luka himself can shoot but he’s best handling the ball so you really want him playing with 4 shooters or 3 shooters + 1 role man.   I’m also not sure whether the Mavs can even get Simmons. They can only trade their 2027 FRP since 2023 is going to NYK and is protected they 2025, and the Sixers should get more than a bunch of rope players and a single FRP. Even if KP is on the table, I don’t think KP would work very well next to Embiid at all."
Josh Richardson should be out of the league the way he played with Mavs.
Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson
"Wallace, Garnett was going for sensational blocks and then shouting, shit-talking about it. Their hairstyle/headband etc general styling was also loud. There is also this thing that when you're not that good on offense, you get the defensive specialist title. Ben Wallace, Artest kinda had that thing going for them. Tim Duncan was just so skillful on offense that was shadowing his own defense.  From current, Josh Richardson has been milking this defensive reputation. He is very limited on offense, and for some reason this makes people believe that he is a defensive specialist. The fact is he is not that good on D but people do not want to bash him all together. So they talk shit for his offense and then say he's very good defender to compensate it..."
"I feel like this one's pretty obviously Robert Williams, but Aaron Nesmith might also be up there— if he can take a big leap this year, he's a *way* better fit next to our other starters than Josh Richardson or Dennis Schroder just because of the spacing he provides. He's got legit 3&amp;D potential."
The Mavericks were killed by injuries and slow starts and underperformance and still finished 42-30. They got rid of Josh Richardson. Luka is still getting better. They looked better against a healthy Clippers than the Jazz did against a hobbled Clippers. I don’t understand all the Jazz love tbh
And something we did by getting Reggie Bullock. He’ll arguably be the best 3&amp;D guy on the roster now since he’s a better defender than Hardaway jr. and a better shooter than Finney-Smith and a better everything than Josh Richardson
Josh Richardson
"There are two main reasons I can think of. Last season the team got hit worse by covid that any other team outside of the Celtics, after getting half their rotation back they finished the season 33-16, climbing from 13th to the 5th seed. Also Mavs lineup data would suggest that Josh Richardson was causing issues on both ends of the floor. He was their only rotation player with a negative net rating, and our lineups with him off the court were much better. We replaced him with Reggie Bullock, who's a better defender and waaaaay better shooter, so that could have a big impact."
"I explained it in another comment on this post, but here goes again.  I think MPJ makes another jump this season for Denver, and their overall team is still very good even with missing Murray for most of the year. Dallas has Luka getting better, KP finally having a healthy off-season, and Josh Richardson being replaced by Reggie Bullock. Bullock is a huge upgrade in terms of fit, and imo will help improve Luma and KP by providng much more spacing than Richardson ever did. He himself isn't going to pop off, but I think his vakue is going to vastly increase the productivity of the other 2 stars. Utah imo is very similar to last year with a couple exceptions: Conley is even older, he'll regress some, Gay replacing Niang is better for short spurts, but he's older too and Niang would probably be better for linger stretches needed to fill, and lastly I feel as if Whiteside is not going to mesh with yall and end up causing issues since he usually does.  It's really yall barely dropping and more of the teams I have above you progressing enough. I see 3-5 probably Bmbeing within 2-3 games of each other."
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
and all 3 are still on the team...  it's funny you think Butler won't replicate his 2020 performance but somehow his 2021 performance is supposed to be the norm  did you just say Tatum is an elite defender? LOL. Trae is a top 5 playmaker...did Tatum even make an All-Defense team?  nobody's weak link is as weak as starting Robert Williams and Josh Richardson  no I think you're clearly overrating Tatum
"&gt; was Lowry on that team? was PJ and Kieff? and you said Dragic's big production is not replicable but also criticize them for last season?  I was referring to Herro/Butler/Bam.  &gt;you're also overrating Butler in the playoffs that year based on what he did in the Finals. his first 3 rounds are in line with how he usually produces  Yes, and then what happened to his production the following year, the most recent playoffs?  &gt;based on Trae's elite playmaking ability...?  Both are elite scorers, one is an elite playmaker, one is an elite defender. Conclusion? Neither one is clearly better than the other. Same tier.  &gt;LOL that is pure delusion. if Robert Williams and Josh Richardson are 2 of your starters, you better hope you have an All-Star coming off the bench  Williams is fine starter material, it's J-Rich who is concerning but all 4 of these teams have some form of a weak link in their starting lineup.  &gt;yeah and the difference is Trae Young...which is a star the Celtics don't have  They have Jayson Tatum, they'll be fine. Either you're overrating Trae or underrating Tatum, as they're both top 12-15."
yea you definitely haven't watched Josh Richardson then. and Robert Williams is not a playoff ready defender
"was Lowry on that team? was PJ and Kieff? and you said Dragic's big production is not replicable but also criticize them for last season?  I don't expect Herro to replicate his bubble run it but he doesn't need to for the Heat to be better than the Celtics. you're also overrating Butler in the playoffs that year based on what he did in the Finals. his first 3 rounds are in line with how he usually produces   based on Trae's elite playmaking ability...?  LOL that is pure delusion. if Robert Williams and Josh Richardson are 2 of your starters, you better hope you have an All-Star coming off the bench  yeah and the difference is Trae Young...which is a star the Celtics don't have"
they still had Kemba and Hayward back then who they've replaced with...Schroder and Josh Richardson? so yeah its of very little relevance
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
"This is a great rundown, good summary  &gt;Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson  To be fair, this is better than just losing Butler, but yeah Richardson didn't work out. Butler became Richardson who became Curry so it could be worse.  &gt;Lot of stressors in the Philly fandom. And to think this is just basketball, they still have to worry about the Eagles too  At least there we have a pretty recent championship"
"1) Markelle Fultz forgetting how to shoot  2) Colangelo’s burners   3) *The Shot*  4) Tobias Harris and Al Horford’s contracts  5) Brett Brown’s coaching   6) Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson  7) injuries in general   8) Brett Brown’s coaching   9) Doc Rivers’ coaching   10) Ben Simmons refusing to shoot   Lot of stressors in the Philly fandom. And to think this is just basketball, they still have to worry about the Eagles too"
"It's what happens when tim hardaway jr is his 2nd best player and he's forced to play against Kawhi and PG. Give him Middleton, Jrue, Lopez over Tingus Pingus, THJ, and Josh Richardson and he beats the clippers. The Mavs are not a serious franchise when it comes to building around Luka. They're surrounding him with decent at best JAGs"
Now you just need to find someone who wants to pay $39 million for Al Horford and Josh Richardson and you've got yourself a trade.
"Boston is not going to be any better than last year, I don't think an old as shit Al Horford nor Josh Richardson, or Schroeder do much to improve the roster.   Hopefully their health situation is better than last season, but on paper I don't think this roster is any better than a bottom half playoff team, and nowhere near a real contender.   The Sixers are also going to have a 2020 esque season this year, I think they made a legitimate mistake not trading Ben, not from a fit standpoint (though those issues exist), but just from a chemistry/locker room standpoint. Ben is one of the core issues on this roster as currently constructed, everyone knows it, and as a result I doubt Ben does not want to be there anymore, nor will many of his teammates want him there. It's going to be a shitshow that ends either with an early playoff exist, or trading Ben for literal scraps."
"ugggh, I am so sick of these COVID dumbasses ruining everything for everyone else. Fuck off with your conspiracy shit, josh richardson, you fucking idiot. You're not even a good basketball player."
"For sure, but even if a Beal S+T never materializes, this is Brad Stevens positioning the team to be able to make that sort of move on another player that may be looking to get out of their (then) current situation.   It's not Beal or bust.  Also, I haven't read through all of the comments yet, but there is this quote from Ime Udoka:   [BRobb]: Ime Udoka on Josh Richardson: ""He didn't shoot as well the last few years but we are going to get him back to that. He's a better shooter than he showed in Dallas.""  I think there's a few moving parts to this extension. Udoka seems confident that he can get Richardson back on track as a shooter, as well as Stevens extending him as a potential trade piece in a larger deal that allows the Celtics to keep other players."
"There was a point in time not long ago when many people thought Josh Richardson at $12M was one of the best non-rookie contracts in the NBA. He's had a few bad years but there's a useful player in there somewhere. He was the best guard on the 76ers, he was doomed from the start. He'll be good in Boston imo."
"You're thinking of it as if the Wizards are trading an expiring Beal away.  This would be for an unrestricted free agent Beal, and the Wizards would only be trading him to help the Celtics sign him since they're over the cap.  It's not Beal forcing his way out specifically to Boston, it's him being a free agent and choosing Boston.  Keep in mind, Philly got only Josh Richardson for a S&amp;T for Butler to Miami.  The Cavs only got 2 firsts for prime Lebron going to Miami.  The Raptors only got Precious (and a somewhat negative Dragic contract) for Lowry.  &amp;#x200B;  So the situation comes down to this.  If Beal decides to stay with the Wizards, that's that.  Nothing Boston offers would be fair value really, and the Wizards would be dumb to dump him if he chooses to stay with them.  But if he chooses to leave, the Celtics probably only have to send Horford to anyone with a first attached, and then probably Richardson and a first to the Wizards.  No chance it'll require a package of Smart, Pritchard, J-Rich and 2 firsts for just the Wizards to facilitate a S&amp;T.  Literally 0%, that's a lot more than Lebron.  If the Wizards refuse, it'd be spiting the Celtics, Beal and literally themselves just for Beal to sign somewhere else like the Spurs.  Because if they don't help him, it's not like Beal will go back to them after they screw him over."
Reminder that Josh Richardson posts fake news about covid on social media after having it for three weeks  https://twitter.com/kungu_nba/status/1428803220105740292?s=21
He's really good at selling the nice idea of Josh Richardson rather than the actual player
"I do not think they are at all better or should be favored in any game/series, but in the East the Celtics are the only team I can see matching up well with a fully healthy Brooklyn.  I guess I'm thinking of this question a bit differently - I'm not thinking so much of guys with an offensive game that can expose Nets defenders based on matchups (Embiid, Jokic), but teams that have the personnel to guard the Nets' offensive weapons.  The Celtics legitimately have multiple guys that can guard each of Kyrie, Harden, and KD, and should have a very switchable defense.  I know that they are three of the greatest offensive players ever, so even the best defenders in the world won't slow them down when they're on.  But Tatum/Brown are both some of the better options in the league for guarding KD or Harden.  Smart is definitely one of the best defensive guards/wings in the league, maybe Jrue or Simmons are better defensively but the gap is not that significant, so he is one of the best options to guard Kyrie or Harden.  I admittedly haven't watched him a ton, but everything I've read/seen is that Josh Richardson is a good defensive wing.  And Schroder is typically pretty good at guarding guards.  And maybe this is a bit optimistic (I am not quite as bullish on Rob Williams as a lot of Celtics fans), but I think they can get decent rim protection and help defense from the Center position as well.  So I think from a defensive standpoint the Celtics are one of the best matchups in the league.  They would absolutely need Tatum and Brown to be locked-in offensively, and have all of their role players play to their potential to even make the matchup interesting though."
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."
"The Mavs Trading away Seth Curry to the Sixers for Josh Richardson and the No. 36 pick which turned out to be Tyler Bey, Seth became his brother (Steph) in the 2021 Playoffs against Atlanta (Even tho they loss the series, Seth is still Valuable for the team) will Richardson only played for 1 season for the Mavs, he just disappeared against the Clippers in 2021 Playoffs  &amp;#x200B;  Overall The Sixers won the trade and the Mavs got robbed"
Has nobody mentioned Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson????
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson+pick
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
Trade you the corpse of Josh Richardson for him
Seth Curry replacement lite. no more sad reminders after getting rid of Josh Richardson
"For me, feel OK so far.  Schroeder has been good for us. Really a great fit with JB &amp; JT.  Horford is still a good defender.  I honestly don't know if Josh Richardson is good or not. Jury is out on him.  We actually grinded out a win for what seems like the 1st time in a while, instead of folding.  Ime is getting better with his rotations."
"Josh Richardson as an idea is way better than Josh Richardson the player, could also be said about a lot of 3&amp;D players that people are obsessed with"
Seth Curry confirmed best Curry.   Also. Imagine trading him for Josh Richardson lmaooo
In theory the Mavs really needed more defensive stability and the Sixers needed shooting. Unfortunately Josh Richardson is a leg injury away from underwhelming.
Hey they got Josh Richardson lol
He's no Josh Richardson though.
Still can’t believe Daryl got him for Josh Richardson and a second rounder
"Yeah, I'm not gonna give the starters a pass or anything, but Ime's rotations really hurt us against you guys. He ran a lineup with Josh Richardson at the 4 and Grant at the 5 that just got absolutely *destroyed* on the glass. Rough start, but I'm not gonna be calling for his head *just* yet"
Even if years go by (which it won’t) he’s definitely not getting fired. He’s by far the Best GM the Sixers had in a very long time. In his first year here he got rid of Al Horford and flipped Josh Richardson into Seth Curry.
Don't forget trading Seth curry for Josh Richardson lol. Even though I love j rich
"Curry literally had the same stats on the Mavs as he has had on the sixers, despite playing more minutes on the sixers and starting way more games   Josh Richardson was not good on the sixers. He was a terrible fit. This isn't me coping sixers fans will literally agree with me   Porzingis was great during the bubble season and has faced a major injury since then.   U don't have to lie to prove ur point."
was an all star in NY now looks like trash next to Luka  Curry was ok on the Mavs now he’s abtop 5 shooter in the NBA  Josh Richardson was a dog on the Sixers and now sucks on the Mavs  i see a common denominator
"A big knock on Brad Stevens (whom many regarded as a good coach) early in his tenure was the lineups he put out were questionable. People freaking out over Udoka after 2 games need to settle down as things like schemes take time to implement with guys who were so used to Stevens’ system (Tatum, Brown and Smart specifically). Yeah we were getting killed on the boards and turning the ball over too much, it’s gotta be fixed. Could have used Kanter for a bit there instead of Grant at the 5 in the 3Q even if his defense is abysmal, and Tatum/Brown never seem to have good games at the same time. I think it’s reasonable to question their fit if this continues through this year.  In any case, I’m not sure why the expectations were so high when all the Bradley Beal to the Celtics rumors months ago fell through and we ended up with Dennis Schroder, Josh Richardson, Al Horford and Enes Kanter, but otherwise the EXACT same team and people thought these guys would move the needle to push them to the 3 seed? It was always going to be a non-contending year and they 100% have to land a guy next off season or you can start to blame the FO for not getting the personnel they need to contend.  Sorry, but a bunch of guys who are basically 6th men/bench guys hasn’t changed that. It’s going to be another rough year for Celtics fans I think."

"I’m sorry, but one game into the season isn’t enough to say this is a poor version of shooters around Luka. THJ was one of the best shooters in the NBA last year. DFS and maxi are experts at hitting corner 3’s, KP stretches the floor, and we replaced James Johnson and Josh richardson with Bullock and Brown who both shot better than 40% on 3 on more than 10 attempts a game combined.   Like, is this a championship roster? No. But Luka/THJ/bullock/DFS/KP  With Jalen/brown/green/maxi/Dwight off the bench, that’s a great shooting starting lineup. You can criticize interior defense and playmaking, but we have shooting."
No it didn't you morons. We got Jimmy for fucking Josh Richardson because Jimmy wanted to come here. What other star is ever going to want to play for your front office after this? Just wipe your hands clean and focus on the future.
"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would’ve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn’t have needed to trade up. This meant we didn’t have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It’s really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren’t worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."
Idk why a lot of analysts were high on the Mavs. Kidd has never been a proven winning coach and this roster did not improve from last year. Sure they lost Josh Richardson but Bullock isnt an improvement and KP is still KP lol
Jury’s still out on Josh Richardson but being a Miami/Philly guy has me hate him by default until he proves to me otherwise
Pg= Ben Simmons Sg= Jimmy Butler SF= Josh Richardson Pf= Tobias Harris C= Porzingis
Yeah bc josh Richardson is a real difference maker
"Celtics fans, ""But he doesn't play defense! Overrated! Josh Richardson is better!"""
Josh Richardson is too mediocre and replaceable to be antivax lol
"Trey Burke, Josh Richardson iirc"
Statistically the Sixers have never had a player who could actually pass to him as a roller. He looked good as a pick and roll big for the like 2 games where Josh Richardson remembered how to pass
"It’s funny you say that.  Ben Simmons and josh Richardson called out Brett Brown for not holding players accountable and site that as part of what cost them in the Bubble.  Now we’re a year into Doc coaching the Sixers, Ben’s future in the NBA is uncertain, and Doc is catching slack for holding the player who asked for accountability, accountable."
"After only winning 9 of 23 games and losing our players to Covid, we went on to win 33 of the final 49 games, which is a 67% winning percentage (55 win pace season). We got rid of Josh Richardson and added two 40% 3-pt shooters in Bullock and Sterling Brown, so I'm not sure how our situation is different from Atlanta's sans being lucky in facing a putrid Randle and a hobbled Embiid."
"Same, people clowning the rankings for having the Mavs above clippers and Nuggets but the Clips are missing their MVP caliber leading scorer and the Nuggets are missing an all star caliber wing, the clippers are potentially looking at the play in and the Nuggets may be just 48-50 wins.   When healthy the Mavs last year went 33-16 and Reggie bullock and sterling brown are better than Josh richardson and James Johnson"
"I think we're definitely rated a bit high here but I felt at the end of last season that we didn't necessarily need to make a ""sexy"" move to improve the team.   One of our biggest disappointments last year was KP being regulated to a role player and it's been obvious that the new coaching staff is intentionally featuring him more. That's resulted in KP playing with more confidence and energy and so far he's looking like his 2020 self. Having KP play like a legitimate #2 will be huge for us as that will lessen Luka's scoring burden and keep him fresher.  We also brought in a couple of 3&amp;D guys who honestly couldn't be any worse than what we got from Josh Richardson/Iwundu/Melli last season. Those 3 gave us nothing.  So time will tell but I think we made enough of an improvement to finally win a playoff series assuming the main guys remain healthy. Big if for KP."
Mavs got truly fleeced by the Sixers. Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and a waived second rounder.
"I watched the entire video, and it's so sad seeing all these legends come out and support him. They're all so stupid. Kyrie going on about how there's more important issues in the world than this right now and he isn't even hurting anyone, and then you got baron davis, stephon marbury etc. all coming out and supporting him. current players like josh richardson too."
"We swapped out Josh Richardson, JJ Redick, and Melli for Moses Brown, Reggie Bullock, and Sterling Brown. We’re also utilizing KP far more effectively from what we’ve seen thus far."
But sterling brown and Reggie Bullock&gt;Josh richardson and James Johnson
I agree fuck josh Richardson can never call him jrich thou
Josh Richardson is the only confirmed anti-vax player at this point AFAIK.
"Not saying it's the best but C's have a decent bench (much better than last season)  Schroder, Nesmith, Josh Richardson, Rob Williams, Pritchard, Langford, Kanter, Juancho  One of them will start alongside Smart, JB, JT, Horford but still a good rotation imo"
Simmons looked ok as a roller for the 2 games that one season where Josh Richardson could pass
Josh Richardson has been in the league too long to chase a steal with 3 seconds on the clock
"Okay, missed Josh Richardson. My bad for ignoring that clown.  In the spirit of ignoring clowns, I'm not gonna ignore how you didn't respond to my 3 other points that prove you wrong. Put up or shut up."
"Josh Richardson will help the 76ers with this rivalry. He lacks guard skills, streaky shooter, and pretty much is a undersized wing."
"Yeah, the idea of Josh Richardson is a lot better than the actuality is because his shooting is iffy and his defense isn’t that great. The idea of a player is always going to be better than the player if the idea of them overrated their skill set. Too many 3&amp;D wings aren’t actually that great at one or the other (or both)"
Josh Richardson
"Josh Richardson plays on the Celtics now, so not really random at all"
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
"We're also hurt by a bunch of smaller moves. Seth for Josh Richardson, Delon Wright, all of our draft picks last year, even the Harrison Barnes trade.   The KP trade was a worthwhile swing, but we don't seem to make any good smaller moves either."
Covington  Josh Richardson
Miami Josh Richardson
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
Schroeder is replacing kemba and Josh Richardson doesn't do well when asked to catch and shoot as displayed last season with Dallas
"Josh Richardson, Schroeder, Horford instead of Tristan Thompson, Teague, Semi Ojeyele"
"It’s infuriating, it seems personal because Luka will constantly kick the ball out to Maxi Kleber, DFS and Josh Richardson, all worse or equal shooters than Porziņģis. Maybe it’s completely coincidental, but even if it is, Lukas got to get better at looking for KP.  Brunson, THJ and Burke all seemed to pass it out to KP more than Luka. I love Luka and obviously he’s better than Porziņģis, but he can’t do it all. Porziņģis shooting 38% on an open 3 is a much better option than a 35-40% contested Luka midrange"
Bro just getting Josh Richardson’s ass off the team is an upgrade. What a waste of trading Seth Curry. KP averaged 20/9 in the regular season. He had a bad series against the Clippers but I won’t write him off till I see him again this year after a healthy off season. Bullock is a solid 3&amp;D replacement for Richardson.
G - Steph Curry (5)   G - Lonzo Ball (1)  F - Josh Richardson (1)   F - Giannis (5)  C - Rudy Gobert (3)
"Curry, Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Morris, Josh Richardson.   I’m putting Giannis at the 5 spot since defensively, that’s how he functions anyway. Giannis can also serve as the secondary ball handler and playmaker. Curry’s gravity will leave all the other 3 and d guys open. Mikal is also a capable playmaker so you have 3 options in the half court in terms of playmaking. Defense will be above average to say the least. Steph along with of PGs will be a weak spot on D.  Banking on Steph’s game to age gracefull in his late 30’s. Giannis will still improve his game up till his early 30s."
"Honestly the real question isn't even about starting for him, more about playing time, how much should he play on that C's team. Hard to tell because it depends so much on how Pritchard, Langford and Nesmith develop. Oh and I guess maybe Josh Richardson can go back to being a good player after two abysmal seasons"
"I mean, Morey did somehow dump Horford and Josh Richardson and still get Danny Green and S. Curry. You act like he's done nothing right."
"pretty sure Josh Richardson isn't, he was fairly outspoken against it on media day.  Beyond that it's reasonable to speculate about Schroder given last year's events, and there could be more..."
"Josh Richardson, too..."
Josh Richardson has never looked as good since he left Miami
"Yup and he didn’t like brown. He thought brown was too damn soft on Simmons and the team in general. It’s why he likes spo and Miami, they chew people out and everyone is held to a standard or gets booted   If you want an idea of how nuts spo is look up josh Richardson on the lowe post. He said one night spo locked him in the gym and told him he couldn’t go home until he hit like 300 threes and this was after a practice. So he was dead tired and it took him hours to do it."
"Morey turned Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Simmons going full bitch mode obviously isnt great but trading him for CJ McCollum gets the team nowhere for Embiids entire prime.  Rather wait and see what else is out there or take back a package with picks and prospects easily.  Look where the Sixers were last year as a 6 seed locked into that horford deal.  You are being way over dramatic, it is not his fault Ben decided to burn this shit to the ground"
"Wayne Ellington, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Whiteside, Josh Richardson, DJJ, Winslow, Dion Waiters.  All of them either peaked, had some of their best years or had a resurgence and disappeared when they left the Heat.  Spo is a role player whisper, he gets exactly what he wants out of every player regardless of talent.  this is just in the last couple years."
"Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow"
"One of them is Josh Richardson. Unclear who else, though Schroeder seems likely given he was unvaxxed on the Lakers at the end of last year. Jaylen's comments were a bit weird but I took it as him not wanting to antagonize his teammates, not him being anti-vax."
Did not know Josh Richardson was antivax. Shame
Josh Richardson and Trey Burke off the bench
"Porter Jr, Josh Richardson, John Isaac"
"Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, Michael Porter Jr,  Jonathan Isaac with Josh Richardson as the 6th man."
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"Schroder said he was unvaccinated in May of this year. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/souichiterada/status/1442536533135970304?s=21) would indicate Josh Richardson too.  Smart and Tatum have both said they're vaccinated. JB gave an extremely diplomatic response, which makes sense because he's an NBAPA vice president. C's lost a ton of playing time to COVID last year and there are reports that the team has ""multiple"" unvaccinated players (could mean 2, could mean 7), so it's pretty troubling right now as a fan."
"1. And? Guys like Josh Richardson, Jrue Holiday and Jayson Tatum were extremely affected. It affects different people differently so what’s your point ?  2. No the problem is with anti vaxxers for putting other people at risk out of sheer ignorance. Also the reason kids under 12 cant get it is due to safety... research is still being done to figure out the affects/ dosages for children. You realize vaccines have different affects on different age groups and science requires time to study right ?  3. No, cities making the choice illegal are prioritizing safety. I’m mad at the people refusing to follow that law. And again the fact is the law is in place... so it’s their choice that’s preventing them from playing and helping their team regardless of how you try to spin it.  4. My problem is with employees refusing to adhere to the rules of the business they work for. Everyone has a choice and those choices have consequences. It’s that simple. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, then don’t. But you can’t proceed to bitch about the consequences of it.  5. I have the same reaction when players do thinks that put other people at risk, like assault.  6. The same logic applies either way..."
"For clippers: ""\[Youngmisuk\] On whether Clippers are fully vaccinated, Steve Ballmer says team is very careful to honor privacy of individuals and he says he won't make a prediction when asked if team will be fully vaccinated on opening night"".   For Celtics, Josh Richardson was in a report: ""\[Terada\] Josh Richardson on getting vaccinated: ""That subject is pretty personal. I talked about what I'm going to do ... with my family and my circle. I'm not really sure. I think it's good that people are still educating themselves on the subject. Going forward, I'm not sure."""
"Hundreds of millions of Americans have taken it. What is the exact problem with it that requires so much ""research"" by known academics like Josh Richardson or Cardi B, exactly?"
"Anti Vax all star team looking wild, Kyrie, Wiggins, Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Josh Richardson."
"He used all these words and all this time just to say what he really meant:  &gt; Josh Richardson on getting vaccinated: ""~~That subject is pretty personal. I talked about what I'm going to do ... with my family and my circle.~~ I'm not ~~really sure. I think it's good that people are still educating themselves on the subject. Going forward, I'm not sure.~~"""
"Dude's just horny, not anti-vax lmao. The Rockets are all fully vaccinated so I doubt he's on the level of Wiggins/Josh Richardson."
"I'm all against anti vax, but Josh is quite the smart dude.  &gt;He was set on becoming an orthopedic surgeon. Growing up, Richardson attended forums and seminars on medicine. He learned more about the field, even sat in on a surgery and met kids who shared his interest. His determination to become a doctor intensified.

Imagine Josh Richardson or any other anti-vaxer reading peer reviewed articles
All you had to do was search through the sixers sub for Josh Richardson threads pre trade.  It was already a shitty trade from a contract standpoint.
Damn but Sixers fans said that Jimmy for Josh Richardson wasn’t a downgrade and Jimmy was gonna not make the playoffs and retire on the beach
I was right the whole way and boi it feels good to be right  it was pretty funny seeing people talk about Josh Richardson like the dude is the next Josh Howard tho
Our sub thought we won the Josh Richardson - Seth Curry trade
Celtics receive: Ben Simmons  6ers receive: Al Horford + Josh Richardson + FRP  Who says no?
"I'm a long time Mavs fan, Reunion Arena, pre-Cuban, Three Js era (Jamal Mashburn, Jason Kidd (young Jason Kidd), Jim Jackson). I'm not of the belief we haven't tried... but every move we've made has been bad. KP is a better player than he gets credit for, but, of course, is injury prone. Josh Richardson forgot basketball. Bullock has forgotten basketball. Rick, while a great coach, has always been stubborn. And it blew up.  We suck at drafting. Before the Luka/Brunson draft, the last rotation quality player we drafted AND kept was Josh Howard... in 2003. I want Luka to succeed and succeed with us. But this is year four and we seem to only be going backwards. If we put Luka up for trade, we might get one of the most insane halls in NBA history - assuming anyone can actually give us something that could pan out. You'll never win a trade where you give up a superstar, but we've seen recently many teams get some pretty good deals.  I just don't see a way you fix this with Luka and KP on maxes and Jalen about to be a FA. Fellow Mavs fans will hate me saying it, but it is something to really talk about."
"I’ve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He’s totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn’t enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It’s harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he’s just not really quick. He’ll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he’s not automatic like Durant so he’s inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he’s on, sometimes he’s off.  So I think it’s a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it’s easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there’s no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It’s when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he’s good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
Josh Richardson can shoot a basketball
Thought josh Richardson was a SNIPER
"To be fair, he actually said he didn’t disagree with trading Seth because having him, Luke, and Porzingis on the floor at the same tome defensively is pretty rough. He even said he liked Josh Richardson. He just said he thought the return for Seth could have been different/better."
"POBO Brad built a defense-focused team in the most prolific offensive era in the history of the game. They basically just banked on the Jays scoring ~30 each every night and figured everyone else could throw in whatever bullshit came their way, and shut everyone down on defense to make up for it. But the Jays almost never have great games on the same night, and more importantly one of them is always out of the lineup, so we are left depending on Marcus Smart, Dennis Schroder, Al Horford and Josh Richardson to make up for it, which they can't do.   On top of that, Tatum has really bought in to his own hype, and gives the defense the absolute easiest task of just standing around and watching him Iso into a sidestep 3 as his main scoring preference. He has had a couple of games when he has made a clear effort to not do that, and he has looked unstoppable, and his rebounding and passing have both improved dramatically this year, but he just can't get past defaulting to playground ball, and the worst part is that we don't really have the roster to prove to him that he can defer sometimes to make the defense think and work a bit.   Basically, our team sucks in both roster construction and execution."
"No other team could have sent us what we got for Howard.  The trade ended up being very complicated, but the gist is:  Orlando sends Dwight Howard, Chris Duhon, Earl Clark to the Lakers, and Jason Richardson to the 76ers.  Orlando receives Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, Josh McRoberts, and Christian Eyenga and 1 contingent 2014 1st round pick from either the Nuggets or Knicks, 1 protected 1st round pick from the 76ers, 1 protected 1st round pick from the Lakers, 1 protected 2nd round pick from the Nuggets, 1 contigent 2nd round pick from the Lakers.  Yes, we managed to completely fuck up and are once again rebuilding, but it was a really solid trade on our end since Howard wasn't going to stay under any circumstances."
"Our sub is a shitshow. On any given day, anyone can be public enemy number one. Everyone needs to be traded, everyone sucks, everyone is overpaid. Luka is fat, KP can't shoot, DFS is a G-leaguer, Bullock is a bigger tragedy than Josh Richardson, Maxi needs less minutes (while simultaneously every other center does too), Powell just runs around with a lot of energy doing nothing, WCS can't hold a basketball, etc, etc, etc. Like, it is the most depressing subreddit I'm subbed to. It is always the apocalypse and we should just blow it up and every decision is wrong and Cuban is actually the worst owner ever (in any sport in history)."
"You're insane if you think Morey is getting fired. In his first year he got rid of the Al Horford Contract, Got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson, Then got Dwight and then Drummond. That man will never see a Pink Slip from the Sixers."
"Maxey was an incredible pick, he traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, dumped Horford for cheap, signed Niang and Drummond for cheap who have been huge for us. Re-signed Furk and Danny Green for cheap. Signed Embiid to a Max extension. Literally every move he has made so far has been excellent. Only question mark is Simmons"
KP is much better for us than Ben Simmons. KP shoots much better and is more willing to play based on team needs even when it doesn't suit him personally.   Seth Curry couldn't defend but he kept scoring while Josh Richardson neither learned to shoot nor remembered how to defend.
"&gt;That being said, he's usually not wrong.   Because he twists words to make himself seem right. In this interview he managed to sneak himself out of blame for the Josh Richardson trade, the Josh Green pick, and a few other bad decisions that were reportedly his or that he supported.  It's hilarious that he repeatedly referred to other people being Machiavellian, but if you've been following this you know that it's complete bullshit and he's the one being manipulative."
"We offered him literally the most we could without trading pretty much everyone else on our team so we could max him which would then place us with 3 max contract players on our team. By this point by the way Jimmy had already been leaking stories about his unhappiness with the Wolves, he also didn’t fly back with the rest of the team to Minny after our playoff loss and refused to participate in the standard end of season medical exam.   The trade with the Heat broke down because for once in his life Thibs was smart and decided Kelly Olynyk, Josh Richardson, and a 1st wasn’t enough. Jimmy was fair to be pissed off, but publicly humiliating the Wolves wasn’t a professional way to handle it.   Wolves fans can admit the organization shares some of the blame, but the fact you guys think Jimmy was completely in the right is hilarious. The dudes forced his way out of 2 teams now and is on his 4th team since becoming a star, maybe, JUST maybe, he’s a bit hard to please. Regardless this is a pointless argument, I don’t like Jimmy Butler that much, it’s nice to beat a guy who trashed your team, if you are that upset about it then oh well. Gg tonight"
"It's more believable that a first time gm with no FO experience who was only hired as a player relations guy because the league thought jahlil okafor was going to fist fight every chowderhead in boston, lucked into a GM role and made a bunch of dumb moves with ownership input, than josh harris singlehandedly masterminded turning jimmy butler into josh richardson."
"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
"The Sixers, for most of a season, started Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid. Please don't ask us questions like this."
The Josh Richardson effect
"al horford and robert williams sharing the floor (110 minutes): +6.39, including a 95.45 defensive rating  He can still play PF. The problem was, embiid and simmons were basically both centers offensively, tobias harris was a power forward, and josh richardson was bad. Adding a big man in horford to that mess of a lineup just made it even worse."
Josh Richardson
"From the moment he was traded to the Warriors, people have saying the Warriors should find an upgrade. Josh Richardson and Kelly Oubre where among the players who were considered much better. The narrative was that he was a terrible player who would make the team worse on both ends. Now he's playing better then celebrated 3 &amp; D players like Anunoby, Bridges and Hunter."
If prime Michael Jordan played today he’d look like Josh Richardson.
"I fucking wish  Edit: I traded lebron in 2K for Jaylen Brown, Josh Richardson and a couple of late 1sts. Totally worth it"
"That's not how sign and trades work, otherwise Miami wouldn't have gotten Jimmy Butler for Hassan Whiteside and Josh Richardson"
We have a Josh Richardson sighting!
"This team refuses to box out or put in the bare minimum effort. Once again we get outrebounded, and watch dudes like Marcus Smart or Josh Richardson just out hustle both our guards and bigs to loose balls and offensive rebounds."
Josh Richardson is what I was hoping Nesmith would be this year.
why is Josh Richardson shooting so much
josh richardson is actually playing good 😵‍💫
Is that Josh Richardson or Klay Thompson
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
"That's only part of it. I'm talking more about everything leading up to his departure from Philly. Brett Brown complaining that he couldn't control Butler and the owner thinking that Butler was too much of a liability on a 5-year max contract that they weren't willing to offer him a max contract in free agency. When Philly dragged Butler through their local media for speaking up for TJ McConnell in a team meeting.  Philly was on the cusp of being the best team in the East, and instead of just running back the team that got eliminated on a lucky buzzer beater, they went out there and said Butler was bad for their culture and shipped him out of town for Josh Richardson."
"The Harden Trade alone is bad, but he also moved Horford's contract for Danny Green and got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Also his analytics driven approach to... everything just makes it seem like he's more interested in squeezing out hidden value than he is trying to mutually benefit both teams."
"Here’s the thing that you are missing: Most teams lose all leverage when your star players wants out. Take Jimmy Butler as an example. What did both teams get for him, once he made it known he wanted out? Minnesota got the role players. Sixers got Josh Richardson. So yea, Ben Simmons is very intriguing to a team who is about to lose an all-star."
Marcus Smart +  Josh Richardson + Romeo Langford  Those are some of the top 30(0) players in the NBA
That was another former Tennessee Vol Josh Richardson. Vol on Vol crime.
Brad Stevens thought Marcus Smart is worth a massive extension and Josh Richardson also deserved an extension. Such a brilliant basketball mind.
"Brogdon + LeVert, which is really just a package for Brogdon given LeVert's injury history, was offered like a week into the offseason. I'm not entirely sure we'll net a better player all around, but it's far from an obvious move to make. I wouldn't jump at the first offer either, no matter who I'm trading. Overall most of the packages were for the Buddy Heild/Malik Beasley types. People keep saying we ""fucked up"" because there was some nice package we just turned down. That's not what happened this summer.  &gt;The 76ers are straight up a better basketball team without Simmons. Adding Brogdon and Levert would have been great additions.  Absolute lies lmao this team is a better offensive fit around Embiid, but we are not a better team. Our defense is below average and a lineup of Maxey/Curry/Brogdon/Tobias/Embiid is not that good in the east anyway.  We could be a better team in October/November/December if we had already traded him for role players, but that doesn't serve our long term goals no matter how you cut it.   &gt;Over the summer Morey was sending clown offers like Simmons for Lillard and Simmons for FVV+4th overall+OG Anunoby.  I think the GM of 15+ years knows what he's doing when he calls other people around the league lol. If you read at all about how trades get made it's rather informal and GM's talk all the time. Daryl, is also known for being the most active GM calling other teams with crazy offers and that hasn't hurt his stock, shunned him from the league, or prevented him from making good deals like he did with Josh Richardson and Al Horford.   There's things to criticize from our side for sure, but I would 100% rather wait for Minnesota to be desperate 30 games into the season than trade Ben literally weeks after he had the worst few games of his career."
"Our head coach and star player did not shit on him lol. Doc said he didn't know if he was a championship PG and Embiid said the passed up dunk was the turning point in the game.  The main issue is exactly what you said, a guy shooting 33% from the FT line and failing to make a FG in the 4th quarter of games 5, 6, and 7. NBA GM's have thousands of minutes of footage of Ben and can weigh the positives and negatives.  Most people believe in Morey because his 15+ year track record is pretty good and what he did for the sixers day 1 was trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and get off the Al Horford contract. Nobody is sucking his dick we just think this strategy is our best option. Trading him for Buddy Heild closes our championship window anyway, might as well rebuild if that's what we wanted to do"
"He's been one of the most active GM's on the trade market for years, what are you talking about? This doesn't change the fact he traded Josh Richardson and Al Horford the second he got to Philly. Other GM's actually tend to enjoy doing business with him"
"Bro, we went from Hinkie getting sacked by the league, to a dude who beyond being a terrible GM in trades and the draft, was literally calling out his best player on twitter on burner accounts, to Elton Brand who never had any experience in that type of role and spent the last amount of cap space on Al Horford.  Morey came into this shitty Ben situation, and was not helped at all by Doc after the playoffs. With zero cap space, Morey traded Josh Richardson for Curry, somehow got off the Horford contract without hemorraging blood, drafted Tyrese Maxey, brought in Danny Green, etc. The Ben Simmons situation has always been 24/7 drama, no one in the organization is actually that upset he's gone, if anything it's galvanized everyone else on the roster. I know everyone loves to shit on Philly and Morey, but just caving and trading Ben bc you feel you have to right this second isn't helpful."
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
I trust Josh Richardson to make an iso midrange jumpshot significantly more than Jayson Tatum this year so far
sixer killer josh richardson
"Ah yes, the person who we knew would save us: Josh ""I'm shamelessly stealing Romeo and Aaron's minutes"" Richardson"
"You swept us in our infamous shit year when we had Horford and Josh Richardson.   Wonder Kid Brad then made sure he got not one, but both of them, then hired a Clown Coach assistant.   And you are wondering why you’re booty."
Oh. You can’t get the Clown Coach stank off you once you got it.   And I seriously wouldn’t talk yourself into acquiring Horford and particularly Richardson. Josh is booty ass.
Embiid has had Josh Richardson and Al Horford as starters. The best just offensive player he's had was one way JJ Redick. Murray is better than any teammate Embiid has had.
"Underrated hallmark is ability to find minutes for lesser role players and have those guys excel in their role. It’s why teams uncovered gems like Bruce Brown, GP2, Juan Toscano Anderson.. the role players that probably would not shine for other teams in other situation but coaching and that situation just works.   Billy Donovan and his 3 guards line up, from OKC to Chicago gets some credit here along this line too, you just gotta make it work and find minutes for guys. Brad Stevens able to make jt work with Evan Turner and that got ET paid. Miami under Spoelstra got the likes of Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow look kinda good. Those guys production just drop off the moment they move on from Miami."
"That was less than a year ago. They put Bledsoe, Josh Richardson, and KCP above him."
"But they have neither.  And anyone that has Seth and wants our Josh Richardson, give C's a call man, sure we can make it happen."
"I still don't understand how Josh Richardson got labeled as a 3&amp;D player, he's not very good at either"
The bad deal was from the Mavs perspective.   &gt;How was trading for Seth Curry a bad deal? They sent  Josh Richardson back
How was trading for Seth Curry a bad deal? They sent  Josh Richardson back
"We wouldn't be giving up a 1st for Ross.  1. He's 30   2. We got Fournier for two 2nds. Yes his contract is better but his upside is worse  3. He's a 6'5 SG, we have like 4 of those already  4. He's a less efficient Josh Richardson, despite being the ""scorer"" of the two"
Josh Richardson and 1st for T Ross and a 2nd rd pick
"being on the floor with g Williams, Romeo, Josh Richardson, an Dennis Schroeder will do that to a team."
"but that Josh Richardson DEFENSE. IT WAS SOOOO good, right guys?"
I think they were just too aggressive in trying to field an explosive scoring style offense. Gave up too much defensively for more offensive firepower. The analytics probably weighed heavy into their personnel decision making. Can’t blame them when you have a talent like Luka that can facilitate for an entire offense though.   The Seth Curry-to-Josh Richardson was really the only clear debacle that the Mavs have made.  THJ is and has been exactly the player that people love and hate. When he catches fire he can win a game by himself but for the most part he’s an inefficient chucker that doesn’t do much without the green light. Porzingis on paper was supposed to be a great fit. Shot blocking big that can stretch the floor…but his overall health and inability to consistently create offense for himself made him a bit of a risky acquisition. Powell was looking like a very good player until he blew out his knee and Kleber + DFS are exactly the glue guys you need on a roster.  The Mavs can beat anyone in the league when Doncic + THJ are super efficient  in their FG%/TO. They have enough offense to outscore even the best of teams. In a 7 game playoff series? Unlikely you can maintain that type of reliability offensively to make up for the lack of defensive prowess.
"So Raps had exact same call the day before where Boucher (I think) blocked an attempt by Josh Richardson where he swatted the ball first and then got some contact after. Refs called it a foul. Nurse challenged it, and the challenge was unsuccessful.  Today, pretty similar foul call with plenty of body + follow through hitting Achiwa's arms/head, and now it gets overturned.  It's just frustrating for very similar looking foul calls to work against us in two completely opposite ways on back to back games."
They moved off Bullock because they wanted more offense and now they're paying the price because Fournier isn't nearly the defender that Bullock is.   Opposite thing happened when the Mavs swapped Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Kind of funny honestly
Would you take Josh Richardson instead?
"Watching how hard Richardson played for Boston against us, it looks more like he just didnt give a shit playing for us. he played better defense against us in one game that he did for us an entire season. he fell out of the playoff rotation because he was absolute ass on both ends of the court. if hed played against the clippers like he played against us, he wouldve been on the court 30+ minutes every night.  idk if he didnt want to be here and just stopped giving a shit or what. either way, im not convinced the josh richardson in dallas was really him. guess we'll see how he does the rest of the season in boston."
I’ll never be as mad at a commentator than when Josh Richardson had 37 vs you guys and he was like. “THEY NEVER SHOOT LIKE THIS”
I still can’t believe Mavs straight up traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
"Josh Richardson has never looked like a ""stud"""
I thought Josh Richardson was more than just a role player. This was the year he averaged 16ppg
"patty mills, maybe andrew bogut at some point.  josh jackson, josh hart, josh richardson, etc etc.."
"I’d rather have Bagley than Josh Richardson in a vacuum, but I assume that his contract is being saved for another deal."
That team was bummy AF. 2nd best player was Josh Richardson probably
I know I'm biased but josh richardson has no value at this point so this is basically smart and salary filler for simmons. Not sure if that's fair.
Marcus smart and josh Richardson for Ben Simmons
"how would Celtics fans feel if they traded Marcus Smart, Josh Richardson, and a 1st for him? Not that the Sixers would accept, but just curious"
Josh Richardson
having Reggie Bullock instead of Josh Richardson makes life so much easier
"He was 100% looked at the lesser brother in Dallas despite putting up stupid numbers in an all time great offense and traded for an inconsistent josh Richardson.   No question dude was underrated because of his familial relationship. If Seth was drafted, it may be different, but he worked his was up from the G League."
"They could do it if they send Josh Richardson back, but I don’t think the Sixers would be interested in him again."
"yeah also ignores the development of our younger guys like maxey, furkan, tisse and even seth  also ignores the fact that ben played a year with 2 centers in the starting line up plus known 3 point marksmen josh richardson and tobias harris, so likely if we didn't get big collared ben's stats would be better"
"Such as?  Al Horford?  Josh Richardson?  Been there done that with both, definitely not.   Brown and Tatum are the only guys Celtics have worth positive trade value (Maybe Robert Williams but Sixers don't need a 5, Smart can't be traded until January)."
"Could you imagine a defense with Joel Embiid, Al Horford, and Josh Richardson? No one would be able to score on them!"
"We have Al Horford, I think he's the perfect fit next to Embiid. Josh Richardson could help the Sixers depth as well."
"Josh Richardson - in theory he's like the perfect wing; good length, decent athlete plays d, shoots 3s, goes off at least one game every season, handles the ball well..... But... He's just pretty meh most games."
Bro there's physical and there's what CP3 is doing in this clip. As far as why refs let them who knows other than again their reputations. Guys like Josh Richardson try to play like that and then quickly pick up 2 fouls I've seen it all the time.
Josh Richardson listens to crumb and is good with memes i can hang with that
In the face of Josh Richardson
One thing I hate that we do is we fixate on one person and just shit on them. Looks like it's Josh Richardson this year
I couldn't catch tonight's game - did the scoreboard fall down on the entire Celtics roster in order to warrant Josh Richardson being in the with the game on the line?
Over Josh Richardson too. Luka loves breaking hearts
Nice to see Josh Richardson in some highlights again.
"yeah but like, this way luka could shoot over josh richardson  the same josh richardson who the mavericks traded seth curry to the 76ers for, because josh richardson is a better defender  and then the mavericks sent him to boston this season"
"FUCK YOU TOO JOSH RICHARDSON, GOOD FOR NOTHING BUM"
The classical Josh Richardson one briliant quarter that makes you think that he actually is kind of good.
josh richardson revenge game
"I argued that Josh Richardson would give the Sixers ~75% of what Jimmy Butler gave them on the day of the sign and trade that brought Richardson to Philly.   That was up there with ""Josh Jackson is the best prospect in the 2017 draft"" and ""The RW/PG13/Melo Thunder are comparable to the 2016 Thunder on paper"" in my personal Hall of Bad Takes."
"Seth who wanted to be here, or antivax Josh richardson? Such a tough choice"

I miss Dario too. I know Jimmy was needed but I hated that trade at the time so so much. In hindsight definitely would do it again if we can somehow keep him. But damn that sucks trading Dario and RoCo for a rental and Josh Richardson. At least we got Seth out of it kinda
"Josh Richardson just sold 😭. I’ll be honest I don’t think Seth worked in our system, although better than Richardson did. Obviously in hindsight we should’ve kept him but you never know."
Dallas trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson might lowkey be one of the worst trades of the decade
"One of the best value contracts in the league. I didn’t watch many Mavs games before he got traded but I always thought it was baffling to trade a sniper from 3 like him (who’s only making 8 mill a year) for Josh Richardson. Even if his defense sucks, that contract is a steal."
"The defense has actually been kinda insane so far, even in losses. It’s offense where we’ve been flopping and flailing with our wings clipped, and it certainly feels like there’s a lot of variance involved, but we also play a lot of Shröder, Josh Richardson, and Smart, so I expect we’re gonna stay defense first this season.  We’re kinda like the Knicks."
"If it happened the last two times (curry getting rid of for a worse player [portland - no one, Dallas - josh richardson]), then it’ll happen again. Have fun with kuz"
"The main reason Josh Richardson didn’t play much was because he’s just not an efficient shooter. It didn’t even matter how good of a defender he was due to his lack of efficient 3PT shooting. For guard/wing sized players, having shooters next to Luka is absolutely critical to optimize his passing and driving.  Brown is an even worse shooter than Richardson...."
"josh Richardson does hustle but he fumbles the ball a lot. Also makes dumb decisions offensively. Can't trust him to score also isn't really that good of a defender. Josh Green, however, has shown signs of becoming a good passer and makes good defensive plays."
Yeah like Josh Richardson? Josh Green?
"Josh ""Afroman"" Richardson gonna turn up next year with a bigger fro than Jarrett Allen or Josh Childress"
"I mean Robert Covington and Dario Saric turned into Jimmy Butler turned into Josh Richardson turned into Seth Curry, so maybe Seth Curry was the final stage of the process all along"
"he can make his own shoot, one of the best 3pt shooters.   and on the other hand, bum ass Josh Richardson."
And they got him for Josh Richardson
Haralabos really traded Josh Richardson for this dude
Reminder that Curry is signed for two more years at 8 per year.   And we got him for Josh Richardson lmao
Seth Curry is a fucking beast. Makes no sense how the Mavs thought they needed Josh Richardson that bad lmao
76ers got Seth who’s their 2nd best player in the playoffs  Mavs got Josh Richardson who’s a bench player in the playoffs
"Man, Seth Curry is so much better than Josh Richardson."
Josh Richardson plays defense though
Josh Richardson is better /s
Imagine trading Curry for Josh Richardson
Imagine trading this man for Josh Richardson
"We really gotta talk about how Philly made Brett Brown run out a starting lineup with Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Embiid and then blamed him for that shit falling on its face"
would've been an even trade if josh Richardson just wasn't horrible now
Swapping out Josh Richardson and Horford was the biggest difference from last season.   We already knew we could win 50+ games. We did it twice before with Simmons and Embiid. They did it in their first year together.
"Donnie is a fucking terrible GM, Rick isnt a great coach, Harlabob is probably right, Cuban is right for firing all of them. Donnie traded seth curry for josh richardson... cmon now."
"&gt; let Jimmy walk away for nothing  We got fleeced by S&amp;Ting him for Josh Richardson but then we re-fleeced the Mavs by swapping him and a 2nd for Seth Curry, whose under contract for 2 more years for *checks notes* ~$24 mil less than Horford.  &gt; trades Horford for pennies on the dollar  Danny Green for Horford and a 2025 1st is a pretty good get all things considered especially since his contract can be similarly used as filler for a better player.  Just an FYI too it’s would “have” not would “of”"
No you want a athletic SG who can play defense and shoot 3s aka exactly what Josh Richardson turned out not to be lol
"It feels like the sixers sort of fumbled the process post-Hinkie, i.e trading for #1 pick and getting fultz over tatum, trading jimmy butler for josh richardson, saddling the team with the horford contract, etc. and yet they still have a pretty great team. Speaks to how many assets they collected during their tanking years."
"Not really? That’s such a false comparison. Jack Easterby is a preacher and team chaplain who rose to highest ranks of a professional sports organization in a couple years by becoming a close advisor to the owner. He is in no way qualified in any way for his job.  Haralabob is a guy who made millions with his analytics models and was hired by Cuban to build an analytics department for the team. So I would say he was hired into a top FO job he was highly qualified for. On top of that, they’ve fired a GM who failed to build a talented roster around star players for years. So the GM seems to just suck at his job and probably deserved to be fired given that KP contract which was unnecessary and poor decision alone, let alone josh Richardson/Seth curry and plenty of other straight up bad decisions. Carlisle is gone now too, but read his statement. It doesn’t bitch about Haralabob, but it also doesn’t mention luka which is strange and there’s a ton of reporting that luka is unhappy with Carlisle. So it is likely Carlisle was fired because of luka.  Finally, haralabob is not the one that’s been reported to be the next gm. So I think you guys are just latching on to a juicy story based in misinterpretation of reporting. The one thing I know for sure reading these reports is that luka is not very mature, very whiny, and does not like figures of authority in his professional life. So I would say there’s smoke there but I don’t necessarily think it’s the mavs fault. He’s just spoiled."
"Ask anyone just 6 months ago if they’d rather have Clint Capela and John Collins or KP and Josh Richardson on /r/NBA and everyone would say the latter. Luka is a great passer and playmaker but Trae’s ability to run an offense and raise a player’s floor is on another level imo. I believe that’s more the reason for discrepancy between the teams than actual talent.  Also, the Clippers successfully exploited Luka on defense far more than either Philly or New York has to Trae, so the defensive argument doesn’t hold water. Any competent front office would rather have a deep playoff run from their young star than All-NBA awards, hell, it might be seen as a positive given they don’t have to pay him a supermax contract."
"Not one second did I believe that Clint capela, John Collins, Lou Williams, Gallo, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, fucking Bogdanovic  Is worse than Kleber, Brunson, THj, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, DFS.  Not one fucking second. Every GM would rather take the hawks core then and now, just like they would take Luka instead of Trae if they could choose right now.  Your just on a fucking mission and you fail to see how weirdly you spin your take. The mavs players are shit, their boxscores look ok because of Luka, and you then put the Luka inflated role player stats to say his team is better. Whatever  Trae is fucking lit anyway"
"&gt; You had a 6MOTY candidate in Brunson.  who doesnt share minutes with Luka almost at all  &gt; Josh Richardson was strangely booty all season, just like Porzingis was  Offensively JR wasnt any better before the Mavs and Porzingis had the most efficient scoring year of his career this year with +20 TS% while on the floor with Luka. The fact that he was booty in the playoffs is just that.    And what do you ean by all these dudes. KP and JR running what play?  THJ only shot creation for himself is of the dribble iso 3s or long 2s and is an attrocious tunel vision passer. They never showed no indication that they can run plays even at a tollerable level, certainly not as well as Huerter/Bogdan move the ball and can run some action while Trae moves of ball. Magicaly believeing that they can doesnt change this  And almost all Mavs player have had career years offensively and in shooting % next to luka with him being among the best both in potencial assists and passing rating. He gets them involved a ton according to their offensive skillsets and that led them to having amazing offensive years and Mavs being a great, great offense. They should make a team that can be similarly good on offense but with Luka playing off ball more and having other people run plays but the personel for that doesnt exist in a way that exists in other teams that do so.  Giving them more involvement in things they CANT do (bring the ball up the floor, run PnR , playmake) isnt a solution"
"You had a 6MOTY candidate in Brunson.   Josh Richardson was strangely booty all season, just like Porzingis was. Hmm kinda strange all these solid players just underperforming on a team that doesn’t bother to make defined roles for them.   You had THJ as well who is clearly better than expected, and you HAD Seth Curry who you gave up because you didn’t need any offensive weapons outside Luka.   All these dudes could run a play just as well as Kevin fucking Huerter, it’s just that the team only gives a shit about Luka.  Once Luka cares about making the team around him feel involved outside of occasional kickouts you’re gonna see better performances.  (Using the royal you here lol)"
"More assists doesn’t not make one a better facilitator, especially when the difference isn’t that big. Example: Steph Curry doesn’t rack up assists but he’s a great facilitator and has great vision. Trae is a great passer but Luka is just as good. Literally everything Trae does, Luka does it comparably or better. They both dominate the ball so I don’t get your argument that trae is a better fit because their offensive playstyles aren’t that different besides the fact trae takes more inefficient shots. Trae beat the Knicks and is a game away from eatingthe Doc Rivers Sixers who are choking and shitting all over themselves. A better coached team and this series is over 4-0 or 4-1. Sixers still could win this series.  Luka went 7 games and toe to toe with Kawhi and Paul George while his other max player didn’t help him at all all series and Josh Richardson and JJ Redick, who were the big off-season and mid season moves for the Mavs barely got off the bench. Their second best player was THJ.  Trae is an insanely good offensive talent and will continue to be one of the best players in the league for years to come. Luka is a generational player who at this rate could enter GOAT conversations years down the road."
"Simmons would be awful for spacing in Dallas, especially because we have Powell as our roll guy or Boban/WCS as our 5. That means 2/5 starters would be unable to space the floor beyond 10-15 feet. Then you have DFS and Josh Richardson as the other starters, so you'd have two players in the 35-39% range, one player in the 30-35% range, and 2 players in the 0% range.  Porziņģis would be awful in the 76ers. He can't defend in space, and with Embiid and Harris it would force 2/3 to play out on the perimeter at all times. Porziņģis can score and shoot, but has a hard time creating his own shot, in Philly, he'd have no one helping set him up and would be used again as a spacing decoy.   I think this is the type of trade that hurts both teams."
"He would be dumb to decline imo especially given his injury history  All Philly needs to do is replace Ben with a star ball handler and they should be set. Even Tobi is starting to live up to that trash contract  Seth is fantastic especially given that he was the replacement for Josh Richardson, Milton and Dwight are good bench players, and Green and Mattise is solid especially on defense. The only glaring issue is Ben"
Firing a GM that fails to put talent around him?   He had two chances to get Luka a backcourt partner and ended up with Delon Wright and Josh Richardson. He needed to go.
"I don't know what's more ridiculous, him being on a minimum contract or the Mavs giving the 76ers Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"
Seth Curry scored more points this game than Josh Richardson did in all seven games against the Clippers combined.
"I've been noticing this for some time. It certainly seems to have become fashionable for a lot of guys to execute their dunks in as plain and routine of a way as possible.   It's hard to argue with guys just wanting to get the job done while utilizing minimal energy and creativity (this is likely big among the ""dunk is only worth two points"" crowd) but as a fan, I totally miss when guys seemed like they were dying to show what they could do to the rim when given the opportunity.   /u/honditar already mentioned so many, but it's pretty wild in hindsight to think back to how many entertaining dunkers there were just a bit over a decade ago.   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Jason Richardson  * LeBron James   * Desmond Mason  * Ricky Davis  * Tracy McGrady  * J.R. Smith  * Stromile Swift  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Kevin Garnett  * Darius Miles  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Richard Jefferson  * Gerald Green  * Josh Smith  * Chris Andersen  * Dwyane Wade  Today's game is obviously still amazingly skilled and we're seeing shooting like we've never seen in NBA history but as a lifelong mega fan of the dunk, yeah, I miss it.   As an isolated example, tonight 20-year-old Sekou Doumbouya broke out into the open floor for a completely wide open fast break opportunity. Could have been a windmill, reverse, 360, or even just an emphatic one-handed hammer. Instead, we got slow motion skip step and one of those layup line drop-ins. And again, from a basketball game standpoint, that's totally fine (nice for Sekou to score either way) but I miss the funk."
really? I heard they were saying Josh Richardson wasn't happy in Dallas and called Powell one of the best actors in the league. lol
"I guess so. I’m guilty of saying “he passes the eye test” a lot but I look more towards defense, hustle, shot selection, and IQ when I watch the games since I’m more or less aware of their stats because I’m an avid fantasy basketball manager. That’s why I was a big fan of guys like Josh Richardson (even during his Heat days), Covington, Draymond, and Maxi. And less of guys like Drummond, Whiteside, Bagley, and Kuzma."
Sure but I feel like they should've gotten more. Seth Curry on a cheap 3 year contract is definitely more valuable than Josh Richardson on a slightly cheap 1 year contract.
Josh Richardson
"But josh Richardson is bar none a better player lol. Shooting is all Seth has. Richardson has defense, shooting, play creation."
Josh Richardson (in Philly) He has a little bit every skill offensively but not enough to be efficient at anything.   Nice mid range but poor 3pt shot Can dribble but very pass came a little too slow...  Hope he’s better in Dallas
"It's going to hurt 2.5 times more when we resign Josh Richardson and Hardaway this coming offseason.  To put it in perspective, had we kept Curry we would've had enough cap space to get Oladipo or then Josh Rich as plan B. Now if we want Oladipo (or any max player) we have to give up both JRich and THJ."
I know someone who calls Josh Richardson JR and I kept thinking JR Smith went to dallas
"That was a Morey move through and through. We traded Josh Richardson to get him and everyone figure that Dallas won that trade, but Morey knew what he was doing cause he's one of the best in the game."
Seth Curry &gt; Josh Richardson.
"&gt; Except Gobert who is a defensive prodigy no player in the squad is a difference maker.  Shit man. It took you this many comments to let me know you don't actually watch the NBA? You should lead with that so we can dismiss you as a troll.  &gt;The Lakers, Raptors, 76ers, Bucks and OKC all managed to get all stars (borderline MVP players) with role player trades for superstar ""rentals"", which is what I would do if i were the GM of a bad playoff team like the Jazz.  Yeah, who'd you go for? That idea really sounds like their trade for Mike Conley which I've already gone over. If you've got Conley on the team already how to you get rid of him while taking on a player with the exact same contract situation and not give up all your draft capital? I also wouldn't count Jrue Holiday or Josh Richardson as trading for a superstar. As for the Lakers and Raptors where's the AD or Kawhi level player they can trade for right now? How do you build a trade for Harden around Mike Conley?  &gt;I would be much more like OKC which is fielding the same amount of success as the Jazz with a cheaper squad and more picks.  Again, with their trade for PG you're suggesting exactly what I've written two comments saying they're planning on doing. Also since trading for PG the Thunder have made the second round exactly Zero times. A younger version of this Jazz team without Bogi made the second round twice and has two players still entering their prime. The Thunder have consistently done less with more while the Jazz have consistently done more with less."
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
"Watching the game its hard to blame Doncic for Mavs offensive issues.  Josh Richardson is huge downgrade from Seth Curry. He was providing spacing with his 3pt threat but he was also great offball player that run around the picks and create better offensive possessions.  I never liked D.Powell and with the injury, he looks worse.  Finally, J.Richardson's defense is overrated as hell. Even 2nd year player Herro gets easy foul calls on him effortlessly."
"As much as I would like to shit on the Mavs, I think the only disappointing game was losing to the Hornets which is one game. The team got behind the suns in the second quarter but rallied down 9 early in the 4th to tie it up with less than 2 mins to go and Chris Paul and Booker put the game away. They were outmatches versus the Lakers. Tromped the Clips and had that disappointing loss to Charlotte. They obviously miss KP, I think they lost on the Curry Richardson deal (Josh will bring more defense but losing a shooter on a team without shooters is terrible), and will probably end up winning 40+ games this season. The bigger issue is who are you going to target once Hardaway is off that contract."
All that hope for the Hayward trade exception and it’s spent on Josh Richardson. Eep
Conspiracy theory take -one is actually going to Dallas and they are going to tie the Josh Richardson trade into it which is why the Dallas side of the compensation hasn’t been announced yet
Or Josh “Yoko Ono” Richardson.
"COVID did a number on his health for a while last season and even on the 76ers dude was injured on the tail end of his stint there, so the good Josh Richardson hasn't been seen due to injury for quite some time. He's either been injured or coming back from injury."
Yall traded for Kris dunn and Josh Richardson. Seem like cheap replacements for Marcus smart if he's dealt maybe? I could see yall trading him and then re-signing him next year
"Yeah if you think you're going to get any kind of volume shooting at a good percentage from him you're going to have a bad time. Same if you think you can rely on him to provide any playmaking.   BUT, if you need the occasional 3 and maybe a layup or two along with solid defense in 15-25 minutes per game off the bench then you can probably do worse than Josh Richardson. He's a great free throw shooter too so that's nice too. If that's what Boston needs then he should be fine."
"Paperclips hold things together, so presumably a reverse paperclip keeps things apart. So maybe, Josh ""WD40"" Richardson."
"""If you factor in contracts, Josh Richardson is actually more valuable than Jimmy. If anything they should be the ones adding picks to the deal""   Swear you'd here this back when the Twolves were shopping Jimmy."
i read this as mavs trading their girlfriend josh richardson to the celts lol what
"What's nice is that there's a very real, perhaps overwhelmingly likely chance that the overrated Rick Carlisle completely misused Josh Richardson and he's bound for a resurgence."
"From what I have read, nope just the TPE. Nice move by the Celtics.  Maybe the change of scenery will benefit him and I would say pretty confidently that replacing any minutes of Grant Williams, Edwards, Ojeyele or Waters with Kosh Richardson should make Celtics fans feel good about this move.  Curious what the Fournier situation Play out to be.  The TPE will end up being Kris Dunn, Josh Richardson, Evan Forunier (maybe just a rental?). I think whether or not Forunier re sings goes a long way I’m determining how successful the use of that TPE was"
Good thing Josh Richardson hated being relegated to the bench this year!
"Josh ""Reverse Paperclip"" Richardson"
"if it affects their ability to resign fournier i assume its because they think theyre not gonna be able to resign fournier, not cuz they wanted josh richardson so bad and then they were like “wait oh no we forgot about fournier” lmao"
I think the idea of having Josh Richardson sounds much better than actually having josh richardson
Think of it this way: we traded two 2nd-rounders for Josh Richardson. Not terrible.  Hard to feel gyp'd about Fournier when we really didn't pay out much to acquire him in the first place.
Mavs have a horrendous front office. Can't believe they traded Seth Curry on his incredible contract for Josh Richardson.
I've never been a Josh Richardson fan but I assume the Celtics are hoping for him to function similarly to Gordon Hayward did. Playmaking wing
Seth Curry  lol j/k  There's no way any team would straight up trade away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
"Jimmy Butler trade:  July 6, 2019: As part of a 4-team trade, traded by the Philadelphia 76ers to the Miami Heat; the Los Angeles Clippers traded cash to the Miami Heat; the Miami Heat traded a 2023 1st round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Miami Heat traded Josh Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Miami Heat traded Hassan Whiteside to the Portland Trail Blazers; the Philadelphia 76ers traded Mathias Lessort to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Portland Trail Blazers traded Maurice Harkless to the Los Angeles Clippers; and the Portland Trail Blazers traded Meyers Leonard to the Miami Heat. $110K (top-14 protected)  76ers trade both Jimmy Butler and Mathias Lessort.  Next time don't be so adamant you're right and be an asshole about it, especially trying to use text that doesn't mean what you think it means as justification."
The Josh Richardson 😭
"Say this louder for the people in the back please. If you go to the Mavs subreddit, there’s people saying that DFS and Kleber should be trade filler to get a big name. I’ve even seen people say we need a better 3&amp;D guy. I don’t disagree that DoDo isn’t the best 3&amp;D player in the league but like you said they don’t grow on trees. Not to mention these guys and Josh Richardson all got Covid last year"
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."

"Deal, but we want Seth Curry and they take Josh Richardson"
"I think /r/nba is probably in for a bigger shock when they find out not everyone in the NBA thinks of Ben as trash lol. Morey moved Horford for Danny Green and only had to attach a first. He moved Josh Richardson, for Seth Curry who is on an extremely team friendly deal. But yes, it is the MG of 15 years who is in for a ""big shock"". I know it's an easy excuse when he's your GM but these comments are v funny"
Trading just Lowry for Simmons in a S+T is the most ridiculous fucking thing I've ever heard. The Sixers only got Josh Richardson back for Jimmy Butler. Simmons might be ass but he's worth more than that.
Defense. The whole reason we made the seth for josh richardson trade was for defense
Josh Smith could've been rich man's Bam as much as Jason Richardson could've been Kobe lol unfortunately it was never gonna happen.
"Josh Richardson is the fool's gold, he already fooled the 76ers and Mavs  THJ has his faults but he was one of the few guys on the Mavs not named Luka Doncic who can say they showed up somewhat in the playoffs"
"It’s pretty prized but not that unusual. Klay, Danny Green, KCP, Gary Harris, Josh Richardson, Wes Matthews before the injury. The difference being that Lonzo is a way better passer than these guys. He’s a combo guard not a true SG."
Please don’t refer to Josh Richardson as Jrich. There is only one J-Rich and that’s Jason.
The fall of Josh Richardson has been rough lol
"I wouldn't hate a trade centered around Dwight Powell or Josh Richardson, depending on how it's arranged."
"If the Mavs S&amp;T Josh Richardson for him, I'd feel really bad"
"Josh Richardson sucks. He's a worse version of Marcus Smart. If there is one thing I don't want to see on this year's Celtics team, it's two Marcus Smarts."
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30.

"""Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Josh Richardson, Landry Shamet, Aaron Holiday, and a variety of picks are being dangled in trades talks.""  With all due respects to those players, no player goes from untouchable to ""Landry Shamet's available; let's test it out!""   Keep in mind the organization we're talking about. They pissed away a dynasty with KD/Westbrook/Harden because they *might* (and turns out wouldn't have) gone into the luxury tax by resigning him. Shai's getting $100+ million after this coming season. OKC is far from being good and have confused themselves with an NFL team where a bunch of mid-to-late-first-round draft picks actually are worth more than a star player."
"I get Holiday, Shamet, Josh Richardson. But why Joe Ingles and Bojan?"
For kristaps and Josh Richardson get it done cubes!
I'm not sure it'd be easier. Would y'all want Josh Richardson? Powell? I could see taking on Lonzo from the Pelis maybe but then again they might be able to do that separately and get more in return AND sign Lowry (not sure if that's possible or if they'd have to renounce him)
"Mavs ""obviously""  Offering Josh Richardson In Trade Talks"
"Did anyone else read the title as “okc called det to offer shai and 6 for #1 pick, bojan bogdonovic, Joe ingles, Josh Richardson….”  I was shocked Detroit wanted ingles and more shocked Utah said no."
Lmao Josh Richardson full everybody. Man was good for a quarter of a season in Miami and then go the bag
The idea of Josh Richardson is always better than the reality of Josh Richardson
Hell no lmao. Nurk ain’t getting traded away for Josh fucking Richardson and a first round pick
Josh Richardson. Lol good luck Dallas. Must need an extra second round pick in the old war chest
Well we spent an entire season recently putting out an all front court lineup. Josh fucking Richardson was our half court ball handler behind Ben cos Big Al needed to play next to Embiid.
Those guys are knock down shooters. Josh Richardson has never been that.
"I watched almost all of the Mavs games during the regular season + playoffs and Josh Richardson had so many opportunities to handle the ball and create for himself + catch and shoot from Luka, he did terrible in most of them, in such a way we had to progressively cut his minutes as the season went on because he was such a liability on offense his defense didnt make up for it. By the time the playoffs arrived he almost got no minutes and his confidence was completely shot.  This has nothing to do with fit with Luka or Brett Brown, the guy is straight up not that good, period, he had the ball on his hands plenty of times to create or assist, he was not Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi Kleber just waiting for a 3 standing still, he was just bad."
You clearly haven’t watched a lot of Josh Richardson
"For 2 straight years, Josh Richardson is looking to get shipped out of the team, 76ers last year and Mavs this year"
Lol no one wants Josh richardson
"Dunc’d On’s recent mock off season podcast suggested a DJJ for Josh Richardson swap which I wouldn’t hate if I were Dallas  They would get a rim running forward that can thrive with KP spacing the floor and can also help them defensively, for Portland it could help improve their guard defense"
Sorry I think you mean Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson
"Also you know getting off of Al Horfords terrible contract for a great 3 and D wing in Danny Green and committing arguably the heist of the offseason last year by getting Seth Curry (a guy that averaged 21 on 79% TS in the Hawks series) for Josh Richardson who was space killer and played like 20 minutes total through games 5-7 of the Clippers series, netting unleashed MVP Embiid with all this spacing and a 1st seed finish  But continue"
"Morey got rid of the Al Horford contract after 1 season and traded Josh Richardson for 3 years of prime Seth Curry. He also acquired Harden in Houston in the first place. And Chris Paul. And Dwight Howard. And Russell Westbrook. Sure Harden and CP3 were the reasons the team challenged that KD-era Warriors, but Morey built it."
can confirm  we signed Al Horford and traded Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson to piss off Embiid.  Also let JJ walk  It's a miracle he hasn't asked out already.
"Somehow we will end up with Josh Richardson. It doesn't make sense, but there you go!  Seriously, the amount of rumored player movement is pretty cool."
Josh Richardson is sobbing on the bench.
"&gt; Josh Richardson was acquired by the Philadelphia Sixers in exchange for Jimmy Butler and the draft rights to Mathias Lessort. Hassan Whiteside was acquired by the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Maurice Harkless and Meyers Leonard. Maurice Harkless, the draft rights to Mathias Lessort and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own) were acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for cash. Jimmy Butler, Meyers Leonard and cash were acquired by the Miami Heat in exchange for Josh Richardson, Hassan Whiteside and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own)."
"Lakers fans, interested in any of:  Jalen Brunson  Josh Richardson  Dwight Powell  Trey Burke  ?"
"You don't get players like Simmons in a sign and trade, you get players like Josh Richardson."
"I mean it's Daryl Morey, there's only a few guys that argument works for and he's definitely one of them. Came in last offseason and got us off Al Horford's contract for Danny Green and flipped Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. There's not many others I'd want to be our GM"
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
Josh Richardson is definitely overrated as a shooter until your team trades for him
22/7/6 for Butler vs 18/9/3 for Embiid. Butler also won Game 2 on the road by himself and would have won Game 4 by himself in Embiid put up more than 11 points and Tobias Harris didn’t shoot 2-13 from three in a 5 point loss. Sucks that y’all let your best player in the last 15 years leave for Josh Richardson 😭😭😭
Maybe they'll finally trade for Josh Richardson(somewhat ironic because that was the original offer from the Heat for butler and you guys also traded offense for defense last year and it did not pay off lol)
The worst part is this is like the 3rd worst mistake...  1. Hiring Kidd  2. KP trade and max without injury protections  3. Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
Seth Curry-Josh Richardson trade looking worse &amp; worse by the game
Hot take:   Trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson did not work out in our favor
You can’t understand why a lineup with Josh Richardson as the best shooter didn’t work? lmfao
You thought Josh Richardson could shoot because... reasons?
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson is criminal negligence by the Dallas front office.
"That’s also true. That’s why it’s nice to have the option of playing good defense, to overcome this struggle. And also Luka isn’t in the best form yet and it’s clearly shown. I was 50/50 for the Curry trade. Yes Curry was phenomenal in the offense, but the Clippers literally target him every single attack in the defense-that’s why the trade for Richardson was ok for paper. Mavs didn’t have players that could “hide” curry on defense-the sixers definitely have. I’m more furious on our bad draft picks (Terry who was waived; Josh Green barely plays-cannot shot a thing) and that we didn’t get a secondary playmaker or a big (for instance Rubio was dirt cheap)"
It's both. Tatum's shooting is horrible and our coach keeps playing small ball lineups with bench guys who can't score and can't defend. I really can't take any more Josh Richardson.
How about josh Richardson for jimmy butler?
"Never hated him, never will  I did hate that we ended up with Josh Richardson after he left which was a horrible season for us"
"I mean, Dallas signed him, he shot 48% from 3 for them, then he got hurt, then they let Portland sign him and he shot 46% from 3, then Dallas signed him *again* (for a bargain!) and he shot 50% from 3, then they traded him for Josh Richardson.   Maybe the Mavericks front office is just not the shiniest apple on the tree."
"He’s been amazing for a while, and I continue to be shocked that the Sixers got him (on a cheap as fuck deal too) for Josh Richardson.   Seth has had a better 3P% than Steph every year since 2017, on reasonable (if lower than Steph’s batshit double digit 3pa) volumes.   Sure, he can’t dribble, pass, finish, or run as well as his brother, but as of sometime last year, he had the highest 3P% of any active player over the 5 years. I imagine shooting over 50% this year hasn’t changed that.   Obviously, he’s not really the guy you want to turn the reins of your offense over to in a second round playoff series when your all-NBA point guard mentally implodes and your MVP center is banged up, but, uh, yeah, that’s another story. He did play great in the playoffs, but he’s really more of a SG than a PG."
"Josh Richardson trick y'all, man"
If you want some good shit you should look up that time the Mavs traded Seth curry to the 6ers for josh Richardson
how about the sixers sending Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson in the first place?
"Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, who says no?"
seth curry for josh richardson is an all time trade
Remember when the Mavs gave us Seth Curry for Josh Richardson?   Lolololol
Cause they just had to have Josh Richardson duh
Throwback to when we traded Josh Richardson for Seth Fucking Curry
Traded this guy for Josh Richardson btw
Imagine trading Seth curry for Josh Richardson
We got Zach for him so we good.  Y'all got Josh Richardson for Jimmy.
"Josh Richardson was “decent” 2 years ago. The Celtics have no spacing, and Tatum is figuring out to to play of a consistent trap. He needs to be better at moving the ball before a double team comes."
PP is good shooter they have Nesmith but he doesn’t play for whatever reason. Smart can shoot kinda Shroder is decent Josh Richardson is decent too. There’s no like amazing shooters though you’re right about that
"They role players definitely aren’t amazing but they’re solid. Marcus Smart trash start but he’s great defender, Al Horford leading league in blocks per game. Robert Williams solid, Josh Richardson solid, PP solid but needs more minutes. Shroeder has been good. I don’t expect this group of guys to win the Finals or anything but they’re better than they’re playing now"
"Good idea, could then flip them for some expiring contracts and Josh Richardson."
"Miami scouts deserve a huge fucking bonus after nailing on Herro and Adebayo, but also finding Duncan Robinson and Max Strus.   Honestly even Josh Richardson wasn't bad (solid roleplayer)... and if Justise could just fucking stay healthy."
hell Josh Richardson got paid all the deals on are team are for if a star wants to get traded
"Well Donnie Nelson had a tempertantrum and left the draft. Then haralabob, now in charge of the draft, picked the Australian who never plays  instead of Siddeq Bey whom draftniks had going Ninth, and didn’t even ask the scouts whom they wanted because he’s a bit of a pompous ass. the draft before their first pick was given up to get Luka.  Free agency wise they had the most efficient offense ever but a crap d and lost a bunch of games. So they traded their best 3pt shooter for a supposed two way player in Josh Richardson who just isn’t a good 3pt shooter.  Porzingis is actually good at many things but has a bit of a Dwight Howard complex.  Really they just need elite 3 and D guys with Luka and probably a good roll man center. Problem is they have “pretty good 3 and D guys”. Diff with the Hawks is they gained draft capital instead of losing it in that trade. Also Mavs had next to nothing coming into  the Luka signing in the way of young assets.  But yeah come to think of it, good question!!"
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
"Go back and watch the fourth quarter. They found Smart, Josh Richardson, Schroder, and Al Horford open for 3’s all throughout the 4th quarter. It’s not Jaylen or Jayson’s fault that those guys missed open shots."
"Celtics fans were smug as fuck for years excusing every playoff meltdown as playing with “house money”. Unbelievably satisfying to see it become clear their two overrated “stars” don’t fit together/don’t even like each other and their lord and savior Danny Ainge fumbled 50,000 elite assets only to get stuck with Marcus Smart on a max extension and Josh fucking Richardson."
"tbf when your open player is Josh Richardson, you're not gonna get many assists otherwise"
They’ve gone from Kyrie—&gt;Kemba—&gt;Schroeder and Hayward—&gt;Fournier—&gt;Josh Richardson  They’ve been bleeding talent every year.
I feel like we're focusing a lot on the stars when the main problem I'm seeing is their bench is awful. How is it Tatum and Brown's fault that their 6th man is Josh Richardson?
"Surely some of this has to come down to the organization bleeding talent since that series right? They went from Younger Horford Kyrie Hayward to Theis Kemba Hayward to Older Horford Schroder Josh Richardson. Sure some of the young guys have come along during that time and Tatum and Brown have grown, but it's tough to maintain a high level of performance when you have key pieces leaving every season and your talent keeps downgrading. I don't think I'm being a super biased fan when I say the Raps have one of the best FOs in the league and even they couldn't avoid bottoming out for a season after losing Kawhi, Danny, Marc, and Serge. It's hard to replace top level talent.  I'm not saying that the roster with Kyrie was a good fit chemistry wise, or that the 2020 playoff roster with Kemba and Hayward didn't have its flaws and injury struggles, I'm just saying those groups were deeper and more talented around Jayson and Jaylen, and that counts for something too."
WE will give u josh richardson . Deal?
"I was a huuuge fan of Miami Josh Richardson. since then...,,,,,,, nah"
Josh Richardson is James Ennis with better name recognition
Teams have been getting fooled by Josh Richardson for three straight seasons now. The idea of Josh Richardson is way better than actually having him on your roster
"This is one of the core issues. If you were looking around to pass to a shooter and it was Smart and Josh Richardson and Timelord, you're probably going to start spinning and sidestepping too."
"Don't tell Celtics fans that. People really thought we were better than last year because ""we brought back Al Horford and got Josh Richardson!"""
Friendly reminder that Brad Stevens thought Josh Richardson and Marcus Smart are worth more money than Evan Fournier lmao.
"I mean you guys went from players like Kyrie, Hayward, Rozier, and younger Al Horford to Dennis, Josh Richardson, and older Al Horford."
What potential? People seriously thought 35 years old Al Horford and Josh Richardson who has been bad for two seasons were going to save this team?
I had no opinion of Josh Richardson when the trade went down but whoever warned us about him is absolutely right. This guy is the worst defender I've ever seen.
Imagine giving away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson... ... ...
josh richardson sucks
"I didn't really follow Moses Brown all that much but a lot of OKC fans were suggesting he's a second coming of Andre Drummond. I'm not a fan of Josh Richardson by any means, but the contract he signed was very obviously for salary matching purposes in the future."
"We traded for Moses Brown, who at least has some potential, for Josh Richardson  Gimme Moses Brown on a minimum and let him ride the bench and maybe improve over the year for slightly cheaper"
I’m a die hard Warriors fan who owns one of these jerseys. I checked the store every day for 3 weeks once the heat traded away Josh Richardson so I could get one for half off 😂
He was outplaying Josh Richardson and ahead of him in our rotation before his recent injury.
"I'm still mad we traded him. And then turned around traded Josh Richardson right after that, smh."
can i interest anyone in a gently-used Josh Richardson?
Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson will not be on this team next season. Dennis Schroder too but that's just because he'll get too big of a contract in the offseason
"Josh Richardson - ""From when I was there, Jaylen (Brown) shut all that down, cause they always kicked our ass. We always lost, so like it's not a rivalry"""
Not really. Choosing Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson over Evan Fournier should be a fireable offense.
josh richardson looks like he's gonna have a good game
Would you take a 1st + 2nd + Josh Richardson?
"It's the same team as last year except with Bullock instead of Josh Richardson. That's not a meaningful difference. Bullock is a better 3 pt shooter and on ball defender. Worse with the ball in his hands.  But really Carlisle had you all in the 5-6 range, winning lots of games, and when fully healthy with a net rating similar to the teams in the 2-4 range. The offense was better, more complex, even though it was still very heliocentric around Luka. There was more space and movement.  With Kidd it's literally just PnR and Iso, with some KP midrange post ups (which have never been an efficient method of generating offense). He also has the team playing slower and taking fewer 3s than Carlisle did, which the team is decidedly not built to do. It's built to play with pace and jack 3s. When Kidd's offense invariably doesnt work, 2nd halves have been ""Luka save us by doing stuff!"" and it's kind of worked against terrible teams. It won't work against playoff teams. Jason Kidd is garbage."
"None of the issues so far lead me to believe this is a coaching problem. Kidd is average or below average but he doesn't have much to work with. Not even Pop could resurrect KP's career to turn him into a star. The Mavs have a roster problem and it's been an issue for years. Their biggest move besides the infamous trade was getting Josh Richardson, and that turned to shit."
How is Josh Richardson working out for y'all?
"Nah I ain't fucking off. Donnie Nelson and the FO have built and embarrasment around Luka. The only guy who did anything was Dodo. Trading Seth Curry for fucking Josh Richardson, giving KP the full max. Rick being alergic to playing Powell, despite playing Boban for heavy minutes. Luka just averaged 36/10/8 for a fucking 7 game series and they lost. This guy deserves 1000x better than what this FO has given him."
"I don't watch a ton of Mavs games, but I feel like a lot of your supporting players are good. I think the only issue is that Porzingis is shit and can't be the second star. Hardaway, Dorian Finney-Smith, Brunson, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, and Boban all impressed me this series. Especially DFS. That's 7 quality players. Even Kleber is a pretty solid player."
"THJ, Richardson, Powell, Kleber, Brunson, Burke (KP too?)  Batum, Jackson, Mann, Kennard, Marcus Morris  **Clippers had 5 different rotation players that played better than ANY of those six Mavs rotation players**.   Shit, you could argue KP as well, but I don't know, not what you want from a 2nd option, but I'm not sure you can put him in that list. He played 42 minutes, efficient 16/11, played some decent D and had some nice steals.  The Mavs 2nd best player was DFS or Boban.  Is anything I said untrue? If not, what the fuck man. This Mavs team is such a disaster. What a waste of one of the better series we've seen a star play.  Kawhi stepped up to combat Luka's carry-job, but just wow. The Mavs are straight trash outside of Luka.   The Josh Richardson trade is a joke. People said it's a ""downgrade"", but that undersells it. A downgrade would be a slightly worse 3pt shooter. He's not a downgrade, he's a straight-up useless roster spot. Sucks a big cock on offense and not even that good on defense.  Sucks that we don't get to watch Luka, but the playoffs this year has some great 2nd round series. Suns vs Nugs, Clips vs Jazz, Nets vs Bucks, 76ers vs Hawks. Maybe the best set of conference semifinals from top to bottom in my 20-25 years watching, at least that I can remember."
Trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson so we have more perimeter defence against teams like the Clippers and then proceed not to play J Rich at all. I mean he’s hasn’t been playing great lately but surely it’s better then Trey Burke who’s done fuck all this season.
Agreed. It’s crazy when u compare it to what THJ or Josh Richardson are getting
Josh Richardson is unplayable and doesn’t help on either end.
"We also gave up 126 points, which was supposedly going to be helped by giving away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"
Carlisle blew it in game 3 and game 6. But the roster is terrible. Donnie Nelson trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson is one of the biggest head scratchers of this last offseason.
Mavs shot 28% from deep. Really makes you wonder why in the fuck they gave away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson.
"Porzingis, THJ, DFS???? Josh Richardson, etc.  What am I missing?"
What defenders did we get??? Josh Richardson who was garbage.
"Their GM needs to be fired. The fact that they have to play Boban heavy minutes in a game 7 is a joke. Guys like Kleber, Josh Richardson, Trey Burke are completely useless."
So why did the Mavs trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson again? Josh barely played.
And not the “trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson” type of moves
"Clippers are just the better team. Pandemic P cancels out tingus pingus. It’s the guys like **Josh Richardson** , trey burke and maxi that are failing the Mavericks."
"Friendship ended with the Mavs, now the Jazz are my best friend  For real though Luka matches the star power at the top of the rosters, it's just that the Clippers are a better overall team.  The Josh Richardson trade is a complete and utter disaster."
Lowkey Seth Curry for Josh Richardson was a disaster for the Mavs... Dude has played 6 minutes and is scoreless in a fucking Game 7 and clearly isn’t even good enough on defense to be out there
Damn sure ain’t Luka’s fault... this team is a fucking lottery team without him... Cuban get him some actual help and rather than getting bums like Josh Richardson....
They had Seth Curry then traded him for Josh Richardson. Richardson is hot garbage holy shit he looks bad.
The Sixers actually fleeced the fuck out of Dallas with the Seth Curry-Josh Richardson trade
What happened to Josh Richardson? Is he hurt? Dude played like 2 minutes and left
damn josh richardson has been so bad
Amazing to me that Josh Richardson was known as a sniper in Miami and now I have zero confidence in him when he spots up
it wasnt that long ago josh richardson was good
For the love of God someone please take Josh Richardson off our hands
I haven’t seen Josh Richardson do a single positive thing this series
Josh Richardson is absolute booty
Get Richardson off the fucking floor man. Play Josh Green. Nobody. Idc.
Josh Richardson really watched him shoot a 3 then turned it over in game 7
Josh Richardson just standing there letting Morris shoot a 3
Josh Richardson is so garbage
Josh Richardson is absolute trash.
Josh Richardson has been a disappointment. We really got fleeced by the double chin.
"No it's not. It's because of Porziņģis being relegated to a decoy, Kawhi shooting 62/44/88 for the series, Boban not being able to rotate out to the 3PT line, Josh Richardson being underwhelming, Brunson being inconsistent and many other reasons."
Fuck Josh Richardson. Dudes complete ass.....
"If we lose this game, Josh Richardson shouldn't be allowed on the plane back to Dallas"
"Don’t worry about THJ guys, it’s josh Richardson time"
We gotta play Josh fucking Richardson?
Josh Richardson was never a consistent good shooter and just had a fluky season in Miami. his mechanics are ugly af
"West: LAL, LAC, DEN  East: MIL, MIA, PHI, BKN, BOS  If anyone had the Mavs in the tier of these teams before the season started, then their take shouldn’t have been taken serious.   I remember people thinking Luka would be an MVP this season. But that was more of Luka dominating, than people thinking his team got better. Mavs were a 7th seed last season and came into this season with almost the same team (Josh Richardson was the savior?). + it’s common nba knowledge that his costar is extremely injury prone.   Both teams should have been in the same tier to start the season imo"
"&gt;At beginning of the season everyone said Luka has better team than Trae  Did they? I don't remember this. Can you find me even one example? If anybody did say this, it's because KP looked good in the bubble before he got hurt (that hasn't worked out), and some people thought Josh Richardson was going to be a good addition (that hasn't worked out)."
"Starters: Brandon Jennings, Josh Richardson, Kyle Kuzma, Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond  Bench: Derrick Caracter, Anthony Randolph, Marcus Banks, Jon Brockman  Coach: Paul Silas"
"Not necessarily when the Mavs:   Are an average (at best) defensive team  Have decided to play Boban 15-20 minutes and Josh Richardson 10-12, as opposed to Richardson averaging 30 during the season and Boban 8."
KP played 30 mins had took 6 shots before that prayer 3 at the end of the game. Josh Richardson in 9 minutes almost took more lol. What a tragedy
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It’s not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
Richardson was such a flop. Can't imagine how much better this Dallas team could be if the idea of Josh Richardson became at least partially true
Josh Richardson got shot lol
Josh Richardson is so meh
Josh Richardson is terrible
Josh Richardson taking deep 3’s I hate it here
josh Richardson nba 2k16 god
Josh richardson? He wont even play more than 10 mins
I don't think Josh Richardson has cracked 20 since he left Miami lol
"**Prediction:** Mavericks 118 - Clippers 101  There's a body language clip with Kawhi that gets over 10k upvotes - top comment ""he gone""  A random Mavs role player scores 20+ outta nowhere (I'm leaning Josh Richardson)"
"KP, Josh Richardson, and a 1st for CJ and Nurkic..?"
It makes both teams better. Kp doesn't have to pretend to be a five and pick and pop with dame. And luka has someone else who can handle the ball and can get their own shot sometimes. Definitely an upgrade from fucking josh richardson.
"Nah, I don't really think they're too guard heavy. If Mavs keep one of Hardaway or Josh Richardson, and then give the other's minutes to CJ, then I'd see that as a great upgrade.   Luka doesn't need to defend guards anyway."
"The idea of Josh Richardson for the Mavs was a lot more than anything the lakers would offer, the reality on the other hand..."
"Not mental gymnastics when you’re the most offensively efficient team in nba history and lose in the first round. Easy answer to that problem is prioritize defense which we did. Mavs were one of the best defensive teams post All-Star break, starting line up with Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson was eating (average) guards alive. So yeah sure Josh may be missing shots now but I’d rather have him out there and have the whole lineup be super long then have Seth out there score 30 but be a turnstile on defense. Not even saying Seth is horrendous at defense but if the guards bigger and faster then him he really doesn’t stand much of a chance. Don’t just look at the box score homie watch the games lol"
"Yeah I mean Hardaway got pretty hot towards the end of this year and played well this series, but it’s just criminal that he’s the second scoring option on this team right now. And even he was in and out of the starting lineup throughout the year. Getting rid of Seth Curry was stupid. I know what we were looking for but Josh Richardson has not been it. Kleber is pretty tough to watch at times. I do love Brunson and DFS though.  KP is obviously the elephant in the room. Some people have said the Clippers are a bad matchup for him so all I can really do for now is hope that we advance and he can find a groove in the next series because he just has to do more given his contract and what he’s supposed to be for this team. He was still solid through the regular season and even for the limited time he played in the bubble series last year he was playing really fierce. I just have to think he’s worried about injuries. I so badly want to believe in him and for it to work but it’s just not grooving right now and he and Luka have zero chemistry."
"Also, what's up with Josh Richardson? Dude looked so lost last night. I know he was kinda meh in Philly but he look like he got worse"
"Josh Richardson trick y'all, man."
This is why I’m fucking pissed we let him go for Josh Richardson
Josh Richardson can't even get on the floor lol.
"I don't know why so many Mavs fans are trying to justify that trade at this point. It was a bad trade. It happens, every team makes bad trade all the time. there is no shame in admitting it. Sure Seth was an offensive threat and a defensive liability but so is JJ Redick and your team literally traded for him. Josh Richardson was unplayable in the series. If he can't be on the floor he's useless."
"I get why both teams did it and I wasn’t all that happy at the time but yea Seth has proven himself the better player. Josh Richardson is pretty good though. He’s an excellent defender, his shooting just ain’t great. Seth has his own limitations though, like I do worry about how Seth matches up with some of these teams were set to face. Jrich is more playing against himself whereas Seth is very matchup dependent."
Because the idea of Josh Richardson is better than how he actually performs lmao
Josh Richardson is the best Free and D player in the league
what happened to Josh Richardson? dude used to be a solid defender and looked good on the sixers &amp; heat but he looks terrible
Josh Richardson is awful. Can't believe they gave up Seth Curry for him.
Josh Richardson is the real Kwame Brown
josh Richardson has regressed into nothing
Not to sound hyperbolic but I don’t think I’ve ever seen Josh Richardson make a shot
Also very impressive how useless Josh Richardson has been this series he should be defending PG and Kawhi on the wings
He is when you replaced him with Josh Richardson. Richardson isn't doing playmaking either heck he can barely get minutes
Well they did trade Seth curry for josh Richardson which was a terrible trade at the time and now even worse
Should have kept Seth Curry now they have Josh Richardson
The idea of Josh Richardson is better than Josh Richardson himself. In reality he's mediocre
Seth curry. 30 points tn. Josh Richardson. 26 in the series…
Imagine trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson lmaooo
We really got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson 💀
"I'd perform the ritual sacrifice of Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell on national TV to have Dray even just coach the Mavs on defense, let alone play for us. He elevates everyone around him on that end of the floor so much."
"I guess I get what you're saying but Doc, Jojo, and Tobias especially have benefitted from Al Horford and Josh Richardson being replaced by Seth Curry and Danny green more than Doc standing on the sidelines. Both Jo and Tobi play in the lane, which was ridiculously clogged last year.   I think Doc has certainly been an upgrade over Brett but it's less of a factor than having a lineup that actually fits has been."
"You should support the Dallas Mavericks. We have Luka who won the euro league  MVP when he was 16 with Real Madrid, and Josh Richardson, one of our best role players is a huge arsenal fan and fantasizes about having sexual relationships with Smith Alexander Rowe, Lacazette, and Saka"
"Sabonis does everything the Mavericks need. He scores at the rim and rebounds, he can pass the ball around and move off ball. His defense sucks, but that's about it. Ignore the ""lol Euro team"" aspect.   Maybe KP a a first for Sabonis? I could see Luka/Tim Hardaway/Dorian Finney-Smith/Kleber/Sabonis being a damn good team  Or maybe sign and trade josh richardson plus two picks for Sabonis. That lets Josh move on and clears up space for the Pacers to start Warren and Turner"
They opted for toughness/defensive prowess from Josh Richardson but he's struggling
Hahaha your only chip ever   Lukas going to leave you bums and I'll die laughing  Pathetic franchise  Traded Seth for Josh Richardson hahahahahahhahahahaha
"For the one and only, Josh Richardson lol, who IMO is one of thee most overrated SF/SGs in the league. Mavs have always been in the market for a solid, consistent SF and they thought Josh would come back to his Miami days under their management. Unfortunately, Josh Rich is more of a bust and losing Seth may haunt them."
"They were tricked into Josh Richardson, not really their fault"
"Because the idea of Josh Richardson is pretty cool, much cooler than the reality of Josh Richardson"
"Ok then, instead of discussing poor takes, why not discuss the game? What did you guys see that the Clippers did well/poorly, or the Mavericks did well/poorly?  Personally, I feel like on the Mavericks side, everyone needs to stop ignoring KP. There were countless possessions, whether it was just Luka dribbling before a shot or someone else doing the same thing, where no one even looked KP's way. And I saw several opportunities for him to get buckets easily. If KP gets rolling early, he's a matchup nightmare for anyone. But he's receiving barely any touches. He is making good things happen when he gets the ball, including scoring and moving the ball, but no one seems interested in getting him the ball.  The guy I feel has been disappointingly bad (not just this series but for the season and more) is Josh Richardson. Supposedly a good defender but not doing anything impressive there, supposedly a good shooter, not doing much there. And again, another guy constantly missing KP when he has WIDE OPEN rolls to the basket.  Luka isn't fault-free (neither is KP, I'll get to him). At least in game 3, I saw him, as I stated earlier, ignoring good opportunities to pass for contested step back threes or one legged mid range fadeaways. Which are great when they're falling, but they really weren't.  And KP. In the 3rd quarter when the Mavericks switched to a zone defence, that worked really well. But it falls apart when the big man inside can't defend the rim and gives up free throws. His interior defence has been really poor, and I don't know whether that's something that's held true since his time in NY or if he's playing tentative right now, but the Mavericks will need his defence to step up in a big way. Both his positioning and his actual work when someone does appear in front of him have been really bad. Contesting a shooter as a big man when it's too late and then giving up an open guy right under the basket is definitely not the right move.   I think his offense was really good. Making shots in a fairly wide variety of ways, forcing mismatches for not just himself, but for his teammates as well and positioning himself well. But it's really disappointing when you see the entire team looking like they want to actively hurt his stats because (I think) Josh Richardson flying for a rebound that KP had pretty much secured and causing a turnover is just unacceptable.  Phew, that went a while. Happy to talk clippers as well (am not a fan of either team)."
Biggest relief is no more Josh richardson
Josh Richardson for Seth Curry is one of the biggest fleeces in recent history. Salute to Daryl Morey
This is going to be the Josh Richardson game
"like everyone's been saying, positions are honestly so blurred these days like there aren't many hard distinctions. but at least always watching the mavs, luka definitely is a pg (based on the traditional 1-5 positions). Just looking at our starting lineup, like the other guard was mostly josh richardson and sometimes THJ (more recently too), and I think we all agree that those guys aren't playing the 1. so by default luka kinda has to be."
"Jimmy to Dallas for Josh Richardson, who says no"
Next trade deadline when KP + Josh Richardson are traded for CP3 + draft capital lol
"It’s not like they have any other great driving and finisher on the roster except Luka.  Unless you consider Josh Richardson to be that guy, which is not a reliable diet you want to eat on"
Josh Richardson heard y’all talking trash
"Of course they are contenders, they made the finals last year with essentially the same team, and if they would have managed to get one good player before the deadline they potentially have a completely outcome this off season. Look what happened last year, they traded Josh Richardson and a couple small pieces and picked up Jimmy butler and got all the way to the finals. They might not be the best team in the league but they’re giving themselves a chance to at least compete, and as a Laker fan who just experienced a rebuilding funk very recently, having a team that’s competitive is obviously way more enjoyable.   I think running their team back as they had last year was a mistake to win a championship this year, but they are in the right situation to stay a solid playoff team until, either, their talent develops and/or pickup the difference maker in free agency.  What is your mindset? What do you think they should do?"
"Richardson will probably go unless he picks up his PO - he hasn’t fit the best this season (IMO). This summer will be very, very interesting. I am of the personal opinion that Porzingis needs to be traded and we should sign a center. My dream would be trading Porzingis + Josh Green + picks for a defensive back court player who can create their own offense when needed (not like we could get them but Jrue, PG, type of player). Then, signing someone like Holmes could round out our center rotation."
"LaMelo and Rozier for the Hornets. Was worried about Melo being more flash than substance and being a horribly inefficient offensive player. Kid is amazing. I thought Rozier's year last season was a flash in the pan but turns out he's just an amazing Catch and Shoot guy now and looks way better next to two other facilitators.  other players:   Worse: Josh Richardson, D'Angelo Russell  Better: Randle, Grant"
DFS is shooting 39% from 3 this year though. The worst shooter they play significant minutes is Josh Richardson (excluding WCS who just plays in the dunker spot).
"Even in a bench player lineup, Jordan Clarkson needs to come off the bench. He’s pretty purely a microwave scorer and thrives most off the bench. You’re better off starting Jalen Brunson or Josh Richardson and removing Herro from the team.  Can’t think of someone right now I feel but there’s better guys to have than Melo"
"Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson"
"That max slot is contingent on Josh Richardson opting out, Hardaway leaving, and moving Dwight Powell for cap relief."
I was expecting Josh Richardson to take back the starting position this series since he’s a much better defender if he switches onto Kawhi and PG.  This clip just shows again why I don’t make the decisions. THJ’s a sniper and he’s the perfect safety valve for double teams on Luka
"The guys still gotta hit their shots. Josh Richardson had icewater in his veins hitting those fts, many superstars aren't like that. It's just great to have good guys around Luka that also perform in the playoffs, not like Kawhi in game 1 choking in the last minutes."
"Ty Lue is NOT a good coach, my guess is even after getting waxed in the regular season by the Mavs, he probably viewed the Mavs as: 1 really good player in Luka and a wild card in KP and he favors his duo of Kahwi + George.     The reality is the Mavs are DEEP.  THJr &amp; Jalen Brunson are 6th man candidates.  Maxi, Dorian Finney Smith, and Josh Richardson have become very polished role players.     The Mavs do have a super star, and some nights a wild card star in KP but they are just a really good team."
"Who is better? I’d rather have Luka than lebron from what I’m seeing. Imagine Luka on LA.  Tim Hardaway jr, lebron, dorian finney smith, porzingis, and josh Richardson don’t scare anybody."
"We still have guys that can give us good minutes that havent even been used in these two games. Trey Burke is great at defending small guards and can be a microwave scorer at any moment (great for playoff series when energy needed). We have Josh Richardson, a guy who has been starting for playoff teams, coming off the bench. Hardaway/Finney Smith/Kleber all 40% 3 point shooters. Jalen And then Brunson finished top 5 in 6moy voting. If we need to exploit a mismatch, we throw in Boban. There's just a lot of stuff we can do with out roster and we have a coach in Rick Carlisle who knows exactly when to pull one of these cards.  We lack top-end talent outside of Luka. But we have a very deep team. And when the Clippers cannot contain Luka it makes those role players job much easier. Clippers also have good depth, but similarly lack mid-level talent outside of Kawhi/PG. Batum/Ibaka/Bev/Rondo/Zubac are all great players to have on a playoff roster, but you don't want any of those guys being your third best player. Still got a shooter like Kennard, defender like Mann to bring specific traits to the floor as well. Both teams are deep, but missing a bit in starting level talent."
THJ would probably be the Clippers 3rd best player. Finney Smith and Josh Richardson are both really solid role players and Kleber is a perfect floor spacing big for Luka because he also happens to be a good Kawhi defender. Not to mention Jalen Brunson who's one of the best backup PGs in the league. The team around Luka isn't perfect by any means but it's pretty damn good.
Hearing Josh Richardson get MVP chants at the FT line assured me this series was over
"If it wasn't for Josh Richardson at the end, we would've literally shot worse from the line than from 3 lol"
Wouldn't have been close if the Mavs not named Josh Richardson could hit free throws.
Josh Richardson for MVP
Josh Richardson MVP chants?
Josh Richardson getting MVP chants at the free throw line xD
I like the idea of Josh Richardson more than who he actually is as a player
Josh Richardson did what Kawhi does on every possession.   Rip
Nice Josh Richardson.
Balmer about to trade for Josh Richardson
Josh richardson trolling the clippers is honestly the funniest shit
"You lost to Houston because Jason Terry, Corey Brewer, and Josh Smith all collectively decided to be elite 3-point shooters at the same time     I would have kept Seth Curry over Josh Richardson"
I would offer Porzingis Josh Richardson and 2 first round picks. Celtics would probably say no.
Yeah it means things might open up for the rest of the team. Josh Richardson instead of kleber?? Gets smaller but he can stay with George. Just hope dfs doesn’t get foul trouble
"Dallas invested a lot in perimeter defense this season, trading away Seth Curry to gain Josh Richardson etc,,, this should be regarded as proof of that paying off"
"Luckily Josh Richardson could take all of Luka's penalty kicks, so I don't see him losing against some Potters."
That’s definitely Josh Richardson
"Maxi Kleber, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney Smith are all great defenders...  You're kind of proving my point."
"The narrative will be that they choked, but our defense was incredible down the stretch. Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith and Josh Richardson put on the clamps tonight."
"Him, Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson all had solid games, picking up Porzingis' slack."
THJ and Josh Richardson are fine but the Mavs really need a second star that isn't Porzingas
I really like watching this Josh Richardson kid play.
That last play that ended with the failed pass to Josh Richardson is what the Clippers defence should be
Josh Richardson might’ve been the most overrated pick up of the season
Josh Richardson
"Mavs , Josh Richardson"
"He did the same thing with Finney-Smith last week. Called him Josh Richardson once or twice, then just silence on a few of his big buckets. The next day on Dallas radio they played ""does Marv Albert know who the hell Dorian Finney-Smith is?"""
"Like I fuckkng said jackass he’s terrific when you have someone else running the offense. But he’s also very one dimensional. I’ve watched AC since fucking summer league when we ran him with Zo, Matt Thomas, Kuz and Zublocka. He’s not elite defensively,...very good yes, elite no. Not bad he proven he can even start a full season. Not a shot creator, not that good creating for others in the half court, has been very up and down as a shooter. Despite hitting 40% he doesn’t create the kind of gravity you would expect because he can’t come off of screen or pin downs.   He absolutely has struggled against sg’s in the past defensively, and he doesn’t create much offense for himself “though I will credit him his last year on a two way contract he really showed me more than I expected offensively for like 10 games or so at the end of the season when we were already eliminated from postseason. And he’s had a few good games this year like that such   Caruso hits at 40%, but like I’ve said over and over, he is hesitant to take the shot. For all the open looks he receives only take 2 triples a game is low. Ac is an absolutely terrific role player and I have never fuckkng denied that. But I’m not paying a guy like Caruso anything over ten million if I don’t have a star player do I sting the ball in the half court allowing him to simply defend and catch and shoot. Like I said from the fucking start!!! He’s worth 12 for the lakers and a few other teams. But he is absolutely not a 12 million dollar player in the grand scheme of things.   How many times have we seen overachievers get paid and then struggle outside of the systems that made them look like studs. I guess you would say he’s as good as Marcus smart? Or a Josh richardson,....or anywhere near as good as a Christian wood who only makes 14. Think about this. Caruso is extremely similar to dellavadova in cleveland with bron. Top level d, huh iq, limited skill level, good shooting percentages on lower volume. I’m not paying that kind of money to AC fresh when I gotta still pay THT, Drummond (perhaps even tho he kinda sucks), Dennis, and possibly McLemore. 12 million is just too high for a type of player you can get for cheaper out of a vet."
what if the triangle was a square....and all 4 players were calling for the ball in the post as Josh Richardson takes a fading noodley jumper from just inside the line
I have nothing but love for josh richardson.  al horford is just awful (at this stage in his career) and it’s a miracle morey worked his way out of that albatross of a contract.
"I see where you're coming from. I still think there's flash but the most popular types of flash have changed. Like, Steph's crossover-to-stepback 30-foot trey balls with 22-seconds left on the shot clock are flash to me.   That said, there *are* times where I feel like today's players finally listened to the criticism previous generations always got about valuing the highlight over making the play. High flyers seem much more content with throwing down a routine quick-dunk with barely any hand-rim interaction these days. It's easy, it's efficient, it's certain. But I definitely miss so many dudes aching to break out into the open floor so they can flaunt their stuff.   I kind of think the 2000's may have been the golden era of dunking to this point. There were *so* many dudes unleashing funk back then - either via creativity (Vince Carter) or on account of murdering the rim (Kenyon Martin).   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Tracy McGrady  * Jason Richardson  * Ricky Davis  * Desmond Mason  * Stromile Swift  * Richard Jefferson  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Young LeBron James  * Dwyane Wade  * Young Andre Iguodala  * Kenyon Martin  * Gerald Wallace  * Young Josh Smith  * Young J.R. Smith  Then this whole second tier of not-quite-elite dunkers but still punishing finishers like Chris Webber, Chris Wilcox, Chris Andersen, Darius Miles, Jason Maxiell, slightly less prime Shaquille O'Neal, Rasheed Wallace, Jermaine O'Neal, Dahntay Jones, etc.   At times, it does sort of feel like we're just watching a 3-point factory night-in and night-out. But on that same token, in the 2000's, watching teams like the Atlanta Hawks could feel like watching an iso- or iso-post-up factory so to some degree you have to pick your poison."
"The fully healthy starting lineup throughout the year has been  * ⁠Luka 6’7” * ⁠Josh Richardson 6’5” * ⁠Dorian Finney-Smith 6’7” * ⁠Maxi Kleber (lately Dwight Powell) 6’10 * ⁠Porzingis 7’3”  Please match players above to positions PG, SG, SF, PF and C, one to each.  Really, who else is the PG if not Luka?"
Sixers also had an FO change that turned Al Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry. That's what saved us the most.
"&gt; Luka plays the 4  The fully healthy starting lineup throughout the year has been * Luka 6’7” * Josh Richardson 6’5” * Dorian Finney-Smith 6’7” * Maxi Kleber (lately Dwight Powell) 6’10 * Porzingis 7’3”  Please match players above to positions PG, SG, SF, PF and C."
"&gt;I have always tried to remain at least semi-realistic with positions as long as the league is using positional designations. Embiid is a pure center. Doncic is more amorphous. He acts as the Mavs' point guard, which is why most voters start by considering him at guard; but by that logic, James -- listed at forward most of his career -- has been a ""guard"" all along. (The league made James eligible at guard last season, and again this time.)  &gt;Seven of the Mavs' eight most-used lineups featuring Doncic match him with two of Tim Hardaway Jr., Josh Richardson, and Jalen Brunson. What position is Doncic in those groups? On offense, Doncic is at least as much ""point forward"" as ""point guard."" He defends both guards and forwards -- whatever is convenient night-to-night."
Hindsight but seth curry for josh richardson was a terrible trade for the mavs lol
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
"I completely agree about Richardson, and I don't know how we would replace him defensively unless Josh Green is suddenly ready to play 25 minutes a night. Smart would be interesting, but I haven't been too impressed with him this season. Of course, that's the only reason he'd be available, so you have to take what you can get I suppose. Our trade possibilities all rely on if they move KP and his value, and that's so hard to gauge right now. Anyways, yes, playoffs! It's going to be so good to see the guys balling out!"
"Nope. Him + Morey. If they run back the same FO that overpaid Al horford and didn't trade Josh Richardson for one of the best 3 pt shooters, guess what? They ain't the 1st seed"
We really flipped Josh Richardson and al horford for Danny G and Seth. That is so friggen crazy
