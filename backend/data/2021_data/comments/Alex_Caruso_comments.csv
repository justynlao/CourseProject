[Serious] Has Alex Caruso lost his throne as greatest of all time?
then the % is less comparable - Alex Caruso is shooting 50% from 3 but he isn‚Äôt better at the 3 then Curry because he‚Äôs shooting 40% - quantity matters
Don‚Äôt hate me but Alex Caruso
Yeah. Lebron. Anthony Davis. and Alex Caruso.
"All Star Fan Vote In, Alex Caruso."

Oh yeah what about us LeBron / Alex Caruso bald spot ass motherfuckers
"how is this list sorted or filtered?  my boy ALEX CARUSO should be #21 but the HATERS have filtered him out, PORQUE?"
I hope now people understand why everyone is talking about AMC - Alex Michael Caruso.
"It was an Alex Caruso play from the bubble, I remember the one you‚Äôre talking about. He saved a ball going out of bounds but jumped like 5 feet beyond the baseline. Much further than he would have been able to with the usual courtside seats."

As an honest Celtics fan I have to put Alex Caruso over Bill Russell all time
Alex Caruso is white Marcus smart without the yolo
Alex Caruso looks like Steve Blake and the annoying kid from Polar Express fucked
Just give it to us and the players so we can vote for Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall
Can Steph be a Swiss Army Knife like Alex Caruso doe?
Yes. There were posts about Russ or Jeremy Lin/Alex Caruso
Taking charges = fighting? Lmfao.  I guess Alex Caruso could beat the shit out of most NBA players then.
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
Any reason you included Deni Adjia (46% on 35 attempts from 3) and not Alex Caruso (53% on 36 attempts from 3)?
People always say Alex Caruso looks like a guy that does taxes. Hence H&amp;R block (a company that does taxes)
excuses are the problem? not comparing him to alex fucking caruso?  this sub is a joke
Alex Caruso is a fucking god. Pelinka better lock him up ASAP.
Alex Fucking Caruso Defense
GOD BLESS ALEX CARUSO
Holy shit thank you Alex Caruso
Can't wait till we see a new MVP get bounced in the playoffs by the real MVP. Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso
Or be Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso
No hate on the Joker. He‚Äôs been playing out of his mind and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a ‚ÄúTrue Unicorn.‚Äù But can we take a moment to appreciate the lengths Bill Simmons is going to counter the LeMVP narrative? He did a 2 hour pod the other day where he praised nearly every other MVP contender as being a unique unicorn but asserted that LeBron is only tentatively a unicorn and that Davis is just a Kevin McHale knockoff. But we have never seen and will never see another player like Joel Embiid again for some reason. Now we are seeing regular Ringer bios coming for each other MVP contender.   I‚Äôm not even mad. The Ringer is like if one of us got our own sports website. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd be yelling at KOC to do 6 Alex Caruso articles a day and an expose on why Danny Ainge may have lost the Brooklyn trade once a week.  Having said all that - Joker is playing badass. It feels like he came into the season in playoff shape and has been setting the court on fire. True unicorn status confirmed.
"It's not handing it out. He deserves one, but people are going to waste their votes giving guys who will get in no matter what more votes or giving them away to memes like Alex Caruso."
"Which is why Alex Caruso got 100,000 meme votes?"
"Alex Caruso, switch Icon"
The supervast majority of voters made Alex caruso and tacko fall top 10 last year in voting. Casuals vote on name recognition so Steph and Lebron will have no issues at all. Only the truly ascended vote conley
yeah but Alex Caruso
"‚ÄúHahah we weren‚Äôt even trying dude, we‚Äôre coasting all season. Every time we lost, we were still the better team we just took the night off. Your teams trash.‚Äù  ‚Äî Lakers fan with Alex Caruso flair"

"Alex Caruso, is that you?"

So we have a Mike Conley and Alex Caruso back court
[6'4.5 with shoes](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Alex-Caruso-58733/) per this old draft express profile. 6'5.5 wingspan.
Here is a [picture](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/10/14/21510770/lakers-2020-nba-champions-kyle-kuzma-alex-caruso-draft-picks-summer-league) of him hugging Kuz who's 6'10. It's what made the Lakers defense so great last year. They had great size across every position.
"Alex ""Swiss Army Man"" Caruso"
"If it's short term, I can see 8-12mil per year with options. He can easily be your 7th 8th guy off the bench, and provides good defense and shooting (even if it can be a bit streaky). Like, just watch him, on offense he is always cutting and moving. There's a reason him and Lebron had like the highest +/- last year lol. On defense, he's always a stud, and imo he played great D on Tobias Harris last night despite the big size difference, Tobias just hit the tough shot.  I'm hoping he re-ups with the Lakers for a cheaper and longer deal, maybe 3 years 21 mil, or a scaling one that's cheaper now but grows as Lebron gets older. Every team needs an Alex Caruso type player."
It's so fucking amazing that the crown jewel of the Lakers young core turned out to be Alex Caruso. What a goat
"Alex ""Fingernail Clipper"" Caruso"
5 Alex Caruso?
"Amen, Alex Caruso is an everyman, out there playing with a goat and having a big effect in the win loss column while also not having gaudy stats. The man just gets the game of basketball at a high level and lebron appreciates that part of him."
"I can't be the only person who dislikes Alex Caruso solely because he looks weird. Like, I know that is no reason to dislike an NBA player. But I just can't get over it."
"alex ""taysom ""swiss army knife"" hill"" caruso"
What you mean? Only reason they even closed the gap was cuz of bald god Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso can be a whiney little bitch sometimes but i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a nice guy
Alex Caruso MVP of the game if Lakers win.
"Alex Caruso got a little hot, Schroeder hit a 3, Lebron"

‚ÄúEmbiid gonna drop 50‚Äù  Clearly whoever said this did not account for Alex Caruso in the equation
"That settles it then I guess, trash talk is only acceptable when both teams have the same record, the score is tied, both players are the same height and weight, have the same amount of followers on social media, have the same contract length and value, have an equal length first, middle, and last name with an equivalent number of vowels  per name respectively, grew up under similar circumstances and of course, have given praise to the one true Alex Caruso prior to the game.  &amp;#x200B;  trash talk about to be fire this season"
Alex Caruso looks like the dude from space jam
Embiid stopper Alex Caruso lol
You can‚Äôt be told what the Alex Caruso experience is like. You have to see it for yourself.
"Someone far wealthier than I needs to get Alex Caruso and Joe Ingles to show up to random basketball courts wearing old style shorts and headbands, the plainest pair of Reebok's you can find, and fake mustaches so they can challenge everyone to 2v2. Make it a mini series called ""Vanilla Thrillers"" and throw it on Netflix."

Alex Caruso. So hot right now.
Why was Lebron an MVP candidate last year when he played alongside Alex Caruso?
Yes totally with this large sample size of games I think there's nothing that can be done. Either blow it up now or get nothing in return. Trade Harden and Durant to the lakers for Alex caruso and Dudley.
"Your point about being able to make huge team changes is super valid, but it definitely wasn't just one or two guys that did that for the lakers, it was a combination of a lot of personnel changes.. Frank Vogel was a super well-fitted coach for the pieces they had to work with and they completely surrounded both of the stars with champion role players like Danny Green and Javale McGee and Rondo who knew how to work deep playoff runs and guys like Dwight and Alex Caruso who (for obviously very different reasons) had something to prove.   I will agree that in the end, the difference was still obviously AD and LeBron being able to show why they're the dudes and go super big (and the fact that refs giving AD free throws the moment he approaches the paint), but they couldn't have put AD on that team the year before and won the title without all the other changes they made."
To be fair it hasnt exactly worked out bad for bron either. The dude gets to play with white jesus alex caruso
"Alex Caruso, duh."
"After seeing Alex Caruso in that gym video where he looked like prime Wade against LA fitness scrubs, if Curry plays make it take it and starts with the ball, no one is getting the ball off him ever.  Maybe your uncle can try to hustle the boards but he's not beating Steph in a footrace either. That's the biggest difference between pro and amateur, pro speed is otherworldly. TV doesn't do it justice."
All this just to beat Alex Caruso. Pathetic
All of them do well the ones who play and take damage steroids are also used for recovery not just to look like Alex Caruso
With that attitude Alex Caruso will never be the GOAT.
"Yeah they only missing bums like lemickey, adisney and caruso of alex"
"He was basically a walk-on who became a star. He was picked for Team USA, started a 25-year streak of Arizona making the tourney, and helped lead the Wildcats to their first ever Final 4.  Imagine if Alex Caruso or Brian Scalabrine or any other meme/fan favorite player suddenly became an actual All-Star. People would be going crazy for them too. The closest thing to that in recent memory was Linsanity, and it was the biggest story in the NBA at the time."

Can someone explain to me how the G league/NBA relationship works? Forgive my ignorance.

"Never understand why saying white role players are the GOATS has always been a thing on the internet like its the pinnacle of comedy. Seen this said about Dan Dickau, Luke Ridnour, Brian Cardinal, Brian Scalibrine, Adam Morrison, Alex Caruso, Chris Kaman, ect."
"The difference is that Alex Caruso's impact is mainly on the defensive end, while Deladova outside of that one finals series has never shown to be a good defender. If you check Caruso's defensive stats you see that he's had a positive impact on that end since he got into the league , and according to DRAPTOR he's right behind Davis on that end and top 35 in the league.  When you look at bench role players, the defensive side is usually way more telling then the offense. Matthew Deladova is a ball handling point guard, that's not exceptional at his role. Alex Caruso is an offball defensive player that excels in his role.  Both are bench role players, but one guy has a bigger positive impact on the final score."
Bruce Brown vs Alex Caruso in the finals. The fated matchup.
Alex Caruso?

"Nah, its generally the other way around, a real small percentage of lakers fan do that, while other teams fans act like all lakers are trash and will never ammount to anything BI,Randle,DLO allstars, Lonzo, JC, Nance, Thomas Bryant solid rotation players, and who can forget Alex ‚Äúhes just a meme, people only talk about because he is white and bald on the Lakers‚Äù Caruso a solid rotation player on a championship team"

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a big reason that guys get stuck in the G League is that they don‚Äôt understand the position they are trying out for.

They‚Äôve got guys they‚Äôre paying $30 million a year to score 25 points a game.

Is there a reason to expect them to shoot well? The best shooters in their rotation are KCP and Alex Caruso

"Yes please tell me more about how elite of a shooter Alex caruso is, bird brain"
"I watch enough games to know that Alex Caruso is a shitty shooter, and stats would back me up on that too."
Imagine think Alex ‚Äú0 sports‚Äù caruso is hitting that shot. You have a dumbass take
Don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs 0 for 30. I‚Äôm going down with my best player. I can live with that over Alex fucking caruso taking the final shot
Is anything going to be done about Alex Caruso getting more votes than Devin Booker last year?
Not even my point. Best players on the team take the last shot period. Not Alex fucking Caruso.
Alex caruso would be your second best player
Shouldn't be passing to Alex Caruso for the game.  Or letting Wes Matthews get the big shot before that. Bron legit was the 3rd best Laker tonite behind Kuzma and Trez.
lol alex Caruso failed yall lmao

"I misheard Rachel's statement as saying Herro ""busted to Alex Caruso."""
"&gt;LeBron is averaging fewer PPG/RPG/APG/SPG/BPG than Jokic is this season.   Yeh, almost like.. one of them always COASTS in the regular season and still dominates. No matter what team or conference. And you are talking about ""NUMBERS""?? What a fool  &gt;  Writing some ignorant and shit post like this only makes you look stupid. Compare Jokic with the likes of Embiid or someone else.  Putting LeBron in there, even for the MVP narrative.. is just fuckin dense.   &gt;  Just ""numbers"" don't mean anything.. It might get you a regular season MVP these days, but that's about it. LeBron is always focused only on the Playoffs and the Finals.   &gt;  He still might get another Regular Season MVP, just because he's LeBron. The dude dominates even while coasting. He's 36, (100+ in NBA years, if you count all the endless minutes and games played) and in his 18th season. And yet, nothing has changed.    AD barely played this season, and the Lakers don't even have a proper 3rd option or anything. Just some role players..  Alex Caruso, Kuzma, KCP.. They are still dancing between 1st and 2nd seed in the West. They were the 1st seed in the West last season as well  &gt;  Many players will always average ""better numbers"" in the Reg season. They all going all out. Doesn't really mean much. LeBron is just.. LeBron   You lot should know better by now.."
I just called Stephen Silas and he told me Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma are reserve players for the all star game
"It's not only the media's fault. Alex fucking Caruso and Klay receiving so many goddam votes just shows how dam terrible the NBA Fanbase is when it comes to voting. I get the meme, but at this point is just becoming annoying and stupid."
Then why did Alex Caruso get more votes than De'Aaron Fox lmao  If Dame was on the Lakers he'd be setting records in fan votes.
"I can agree with that. It‚Äôs *A* factor for *some.* Me? I like the underdog story. But I‚Äôm not blind to the fact that when you see someone who you don‚Äôt expect to perform well based on their ‚Äúlook‚Äù (an example might be Alex Caruso. It‚Äôs not really unique to see a white guy in the NBA, but he definitely has a goofy-looking Everyman quality to his look that makes me want to cheer for him) it draws fans. My only evidence to support this is that my 20 y.o. stepson (biologically 100% Korean) could probably only name 20-30 NBA players (past and present), and I‚Äôm sure that Lin and Ming would be among them."
"Alex Caruso is ANTIFA? Has the NBA gone too far? What's next are you going to tell me that Harden is a Marxist? Smh I'm taking my dollars elsewhere. I bet the G League doesn't get into these shenanigans! Who's in charge here? Is Putin going to invest in the Lakers? Where are my pants? Oh they're over there on the dresser. Shit my wallet isn't in there wtf where is it? Oh yeah that's right I was buying something online and needed my debit card last night the cats must have pushed it under the couch. There it is, cool, well gotta go to work holla at ya."
Who else on this garbage ass team would take them? Alex caruso?
Alex Caruso
"Bruh, the main reason why certain players are more popular is because they're the best in the league. That's basically a non-starter argument. The exception is a few cult heroes in a cpl fan bases here and there. Guys like Alex Caruso are just popular in LA and the Zaza Pachulia thing was because he was obviously popular in his home country and an entire nation gave him a fan vote, lol. Same thing happened with Yao back in the day, all of China would vote him in."
"When it comes to Dame vs Doncic as ""who gets a shoe"", that's a stupid argument. They both do. Obviously giving a starter spot to Alex Caruso would be ridiculous but you can't really be saying that this is affecting Dame's career right? ASG does absolutely nothing if not the notch on your belt that you were selected."
You‚Äôd be surprised by the crew behind the Big Ragu. It‚Äôs like an Alex Caruso cult but the player‚Äôs actually good and going to be an all-star.

Isn‚Äôt this a great reason why the fan vote has to be taken away? Or maybe the fact that Alex Caruso was in the top ten of voting last week?
but what about Alex Caruso
"No Alex ""the goat"" Caruso? Down voting."

"&gt; Caruso went from outside the rotation to a starter in Game 6 of the Finals when the Lakers clinched their 17th championship. By that point Caruso was so focused on the task at hand he was barely communicating with his parents, who had come to the Orlando bubble for the playoffs. When his mom found out on the internet that Alex would be starting Game 6, his first start in the postseason, she says she couldn‚Äôt help but be a little nervous.   Great read and I really like this part."

"Alex Caruso being on a team with a good record does not make him a better player than Damian Lillard. The reason I brought up efficiency is because it is a huge part in determining whether stats are or are not legitimate. Besides, Jokic' win% this season is 2% lower than Russ' MVP season, and when he actually had some semblance of a team around him in the last 2 years, Denver has finished 2nd and 3rd in the conference.

"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players ‚Äî and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,‚Äù said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  ‚ÄúIt is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I‚Äôm going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,‚Äù Ms. Hassam said. ‚ÄúAmericans looking to profit off China‚Äôs market find themselves in a much more challenging place.‚Äù       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade‚Äôs Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  ‚ÄúBy speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,‚Äù Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.‚Äôs biggest stars, is known as ‚ÄúChina Klay‚Äù to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand‚Äôs social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to ‚Äúcommit genocide and crimes against humanity‚Äù in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.‚Äôs reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey‚Äôs message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.‚Äôs partnership with China was ‚Äúcomplicated,‚Äù but that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.‚Äù  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  ‚ÄúMy decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it‚Äôs not just one way of doing things,‚Äù Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell‚Äôs contract in November 2019. ‚ÄúI had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.‚Äù"

The Donte DiVincenzo disrespect! /s  And Alex Caruso.  And Luke Kennard.  And Pat Connaughton.
Bruce Brown kinda reminds me of Alex Caruso in how he does a ton of little things that contribute to winning basketball and make him better than you'd think
"So is Alex Caruso, Seth Curry, Marcus Morris, etc.... Are all those better too?"
"I disagree with the article so much, the Lakers would be even more screwed right now if they didn't have Harrell and Schroder. Both of these guys are better individual scorers than anyone else the Lakers had last year. When you have them on the court, at least you have something you can go to, even if it's not going to make you the best team in the league. I think we've all seen enough of Alex Caruso trying to be the primary playmaker, it's just not his game."
yes exactly  Alex Caruso is fine. Lakers fans are insane.
I wanna grow up to be just like Alex Caruso
Can you post a highlight of Alex Caruso breathing
Alex Caruso but only on offense.
Alex caruso is literally one punch man
1. Luka and Jokic tied 2. Jokic 3. Luka 4. Jokic 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Luka 8. Jokic 9. Luka 10. Alex Caruso
"Imagine being so susceptible to r/NBA neffew ""hot-takes"", that you take their bullshit narratives over people who actually watch their own team!  I bet you think Jeremy Lin &amp; Alex Caruso are future HOF players, too."
This man really said Alex Caruso üíÄ
"&gt;The 3 pt% for Ingram doesn‚Äôt matter much on so few attempts.  Yes, it does.  A percentage is a percentage, and it is not easier to shoot less frequently.  In fact, it's way easier to shoot when you are the unquestioned number one option on a team, and cannot be benched -- both luxuries Ingram never had in Los Angeles.  &gt;Ft% is the best indicator of shooting and he jumped from high 60s in la to 85% in no.   Not if the player still misses from the field at the same rate.  The best indicator of shooting is the percentage the player shoots -- Ingram's effective FG% rose less between his 3rd and 4th seasons than between his 2nd and 3rd.  &gt;They be deeper but not better offensively. Ball and hart don‚Äôt add that much offensive value and are taking away minutes from others.   Ball ( 12/7 on 55% effective ) is an upgrade over Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, and Dion Waiters.  Hart ( 10/2 on 53% effective plus 7 rebounds ) is better than a couple of those guys, too.  &gt; New Orleans but he didn‚Äôt have great help most years outside jrue   Anderson/Evans/Gordon/Holiday should be enough for Davis to reliably make the playoffs.  It was not.  Most years, they weren't even close.  &gt;  If ad misses a buzzer beater it‚Äôs 3-2.   And if he shoots better than 11 for 23, a buzzer beater isn't necessary.  More to the point, there's no reason Ingram, Ball, Hart, or some other Laker could not have hit those shots.  It's not like Davis is a good three-point shooter -- he's worse than all those guys.  &gt;There is nothing to outbid for Miami, butler got a max contract with them.   There was still a trade that required matching or beating.  The point is, Butler would've been a Laker if Davis wasn't.  And no one was beating James + Butler + Ingram + the deepest team in the league.  They might've swept the playoffs.  And that team would be even more unbeatable this season, and for years to come, and would still have most of their draft picks.  &gt; traded is irrelevant, brogdon wanted to go there.   Apart from a few years of the Kobe Bryant era, no player has ever not wanted to be a Laker.  In the unlikely event that Brogdon did not, the Lakers still had tons of depth and assets to trade for a litany of other players."
Alex Caruso dunking has more upvotes than this post
"With all do respect, Caruso gets the most out of what he has to work with.   I‚Äôm a huge Mitchell fan. The amount of times he nearly gets stuffed by the rack gives me anxiety.   Alex?   He‚Äôs the Little White Sesna in Flight ^^TM  Dude has hang time and is my favorite in game dunker right now."
I can't believe they missed out on the opportunity to cas Alex Caruso as Elmer Fudd.
"Its confirmed, ALEX CARUSO IS A BETTER DUNK THAN VINCE CARTER"
All time favorite lakers in order  1. Kobe Bryant 2. Alex fucking Caruso 3. Lebron James
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
The record will last until my boi the GOAT Alex Caruso wins MVP next year
"bro, alex caruso at 3:08"

"They talked about as kids on the street in Greece:  ‚ÄúSomeday one of us will block that kid from Texas, Alex Caruso.  I really believe that, even though that white kid will be able to dunk.  We can jump higher!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe might have trouble with the chase-down block, though.‚Äù"
Alex Caruso? He‚Äôs not even really young but he is overrated.
Pfft imagine thinking someone like Giannis can shut THE Alex Caruso down
Giannis just put Alex Caruso in the friend zone
Alex Caruso looked like David Caruso on airball 3
"Caruso and Dennis can't deal with the defensive focus without LeBron on the floor. They can't get past their defenders to dribble and kick, they can't reliably shoot. Alex is fine. He's more of a defense-first player, but Dennis is really not doing him favors with his performance since LeBron went down. He doesn't look like he could be a primary PG."
Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso Laker for Life!
His son Alex Caruso is the obvious choice.
It allows us to move on from all of GarPax previous blunders and keep the one (Lavine) or two (Thad) that ended up being valuable.  It allowed us to also put Lauri in the second unit which was a LONG time coming.  Williams has looked much better in only two games with him.  Bulls might lose a bunch of games still this year.   Badly need a TJ McConnell or Alex Caruso type in the starting lineup instead of Sato or Coby White. The hardnosed defender who can do a little of everything without turning the ball over.  Also we are giving up a pick around 11 this year and hopefully 20 or worse in two years.  Also got off the last half year of Otto Porter.  The trade was necessary for a team that needs an identity.  Thibs is the Knicks identity.
"the 2027 first round pick, alex caruso sign and trade, and tht sign and trade are all worth more individually than ricky rubio lol  2027 could see the lakers lose lebron and AD and have no first round tier prospects in the cupboards  and rubio isn't doing anything for the wolves right now anyway  now i wouldn't trade for rubio, but there's surely more options in addition to him"
Now that the trade deadline has passed they don't really have a way of punishing him for having unrealistic expectations and not playing along with their offers other than to put him back in a potential sixth man role and bring him off the bench.   Removing his starting position would hurt his ability to get paid this summer and would also help the Lakers in alternating his usage against LeBron and AD when they get back. Alex Caruso can very effectively play the role of a starting point guard next to LeBron.
There would be no Alex Caruso without Luke
I guarantee you that ainge will continue doing his job and won‚Äôt give a single shit if u/everyoneonthecelticsarebitchs says that he‚Äôs overrated while using a high amount of laughing emojis while having a LAL Alex Caruso flair
"I‚Äôm not saying that at all. I‚Äôm honestly baffled that‚Äôs the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn‚Äôt fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn‚Äôt make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn‚Äôt inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team‚Äôs *results* would vary from the one he‚Äôd hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let‚Äôs use your Luka example. Let‚Äôs say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren‚Äôt hitting the shots that the first team was?"

"i think it should be most valuable player. that's not going to be perfect, but if everyone who votes for it voted for the player they think has done the most to lift their team over the regular season, then we'd get much more interesting votes. there'd be cases for people from less successful teams who dragged them up by 30 wins and got them to the 6th seed. i think that'd be way cooler.  again, it wouldn't be perfect because some voters will have different ideas, but if they all aim for ""most valuable"" and write like two sentences on why they think alex caruso is the most valuable, then inconsistency wouldn't matter as much as it does now - because it makes no sense right now"

"&gt;I'm talking about the fact that the Lakers are so deep even with multiple guys out they can still put out quality players most teams in the league couldn't if they were in the same situation.  Sure, right.  Guys like recently-cut Damian Jones, who any team in the league could have signed.  Wait, no, that's not right.  &gt; Being a casual is one thing but being an ignorant casual is just a bad look for you.    Well, luckily for me, I didn't wear that look.  What, exactly, were you looking like when you claimed that McKinnie only played because the game was a blowout, at that point?  &gt; Lakers are an all time deep team.   They have 3 players who have ever even made an All-Star team -- and two of them are 36 years old.  That is not in any way historic.  Even when healthy, they are playing Wesley Matthews 20 minutes a night, despite him being the 2nd-oldest small player in the league, and one of the worst regular players of any size.  That is not ""all-time"" deep.  Even when healthy, they are playing undrafted Alex Caruso 20 minutes a night, and he's arguably their second-best player.  Again, not ""all-time"" depth.  Even when healthy, they are playing 20 year-old 2nd-round pick Horton-Tucker -- veteran of 41 NBA games -- 18 minutes a game.  Still more evidence of lacking ""all-time"" depth.  Since you seem to have no concept of what that term means, here is an example.  The 1985 Lakers had ""all-time"" depth.  Specifically, they started two of the best players ever at their respective positions, plus a Top 50 all-timer.  Off the bench, they brought a Hall-of-Fame 3-time scoring champ and ex-MVP, another Hall of Famer, plus an additional player who is currently on the ballot for the Hall, plus at least 3 other very competent NBA players who started for significant portions of their careers on Championship teams.  That's what ""all-time"" depth looks like."
or someone like Alex Caruso/Gordon Hayward?
"Schroder is the only other ball handler on the Lakers.  No one else can create their own shots or create for others.  When Lebron goes to the bench, who is creating?  Alex Caruso?  THT?  Please understand the game and realize that stats aren‚Äôt everything."

Alex Caruso but Lebron comes out to say he gave him the pass
It‚Äôs a lakers fan Alex Caruso meme. I really wouldn‚Äôt even bother.
"Considering KD and Curry played more than 1500 minutes together that‚Äôs bullshit.  And yes of course it matters, if it‚Äôs staggered so Curry plays mainly against the other teams backups with the starters and KD plays with the backups then they will have vastly different ratings. This is just logic. Last year AD had a -3 on off while Alex Caruso was +7. Following your logic Caruso is better than AD."
"Each season ticket holder gets to ask 1 player of their choice, away or home team a question during post-game press during the season. Could be a troll question or genuine one as long as it isn't offensive.  E.g. OKC visits Lakers. I get to ask Dort: ""What's your plan to guard the GOAT Alex Caruso?"""
Alex Caruso is also a better defender than Thybulle.
"Dude i knew someone was going to say that üò≠üò≠  What i mean by basketball player is like Jordan clarkson is a super good example of this when he was w the lakers.  That kid hadn‚Äôt figured out how to play 5 on 5 organized basketball. When he played it was all about scoring in any way he could, there wasnt any of the extra stuff he does now (even tho is still is a dynamic scorer off utahs bench)  A real basketball player doesnt just score, or do one specific thing. The real ball players are the guys like alex caruso, andre igoudala, ect  The guys who put it all together and do all the small things that help you put a win together"
Alex Caruso
There‚Äôs no such thing as an elite low usage offensive player. If it was you could break them into tiers. James Harden is elite. Chauncey Billups is elite. Alex Caruso is elite.  That usage actually proves that his TS is not that impressive. Ray Allen did that too on 10 more shots per game.
Alex Caruso isn't on the list either and no one can understand why
We've been missing Alex Caruso so similar situation. Send him to the Lakers as punishment.

We already are incentivized to hit the midrange and the 3, but our ""superstars"" don't get whistles when they DO drive. Maybe if we had an Alex Caruso we could get more whistles on drives.

Yeah because the media doesn‚Äôt talk about Luka or Alex Caruso either. No it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs white.

Positions don‚Äôt matter actually. Those guys were all eligible at multiple positions last season and will be again this season.  Lmfao if you think Kawhi and Jimmy are better defenders than LeBron right now...  But of course that isn‚Äôt a surprise since you insinuated that Alex Caruso is an autistic cancer patient.

This is what happens when your only playmaker is Alex Caruso
"&gt;Now seeing him on the Lakers without Bron, I'm getting some deja vu.  You‚Äôre getting deja vu from watching Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma run point for the Lakers? That‚Äôs probably why we‚Äôre struggling."

"Not sursprising considering Alex Caruso was our only ball-handler. We win pretty handily if one of Bron, Schr√∂der, or THT play"

"Hey /u/Morezingis, and welcome to /r/nba. Our sub is devoted to one thing and one thing only: serious discussion of the National Basketball Association. You'll find posts deconstructing play schemes, deep analysis of players, and statistical insights of both teams and individuals. The sub isn't for everyone, so if you're looking for a place to make jokes, I suggest you join r/nbaforchildren. This sub is reserved for serious discussion about a game we hold sacred.  That said, as per your request, here is what you might call a short ""book"" that should give you some context as to the meaning of the above comments.  To preface, the players involved in the video are Alex ""Robinson"" Caruso and Paul ""No OT"" George. To properly understand the players, and their reputations by NBA fans, you have to understand a little about their backgrounds.  Caruso's journey to the NBA is one of the most interesting in league history. Much like the titular character in the novel *Robinson Crusoe* ‚Äì‚Äì and also the genesis of Alex's nickname -- Caruso was involved in a plane crash in South America as a child, where the survivors were stranded for three days before being rescued. Because of his seat location on the plane near the engine, he experienced severe burns to his forehead, leaving him unable to grow hair follicles and creating a balding look at a young age. Miraculously, the rest of his body was unharmed.  In his autobiography, *Ernie's Son* -- an homage to his father, Ernie ""Elevator"" Johnson, who was a legendary NBA player in his own right -- Caruso talks about how the near-death experience was the single most pivotal moment in his life. He decided then and there that he wanted more out of life and set his goal to one day play in the NBA like his father.  Both Caruso's heartwarming journey to the NBA and his style of play on the court have made him a fan favorite. And as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, he is well-placed on one of the most beloved teams in the league, by fans and non-fans alike.  If there were an ""opposite"" of Alex Caruso -- a bizarro world version that represents everything he is *not*, if you will -- it would be Paul ""No OT"" George.  A touted five-star recruit, George spent his high school years playing for AAU team ""Pump and Run"", a name he coined to show his support of abandoning women after having sex with them. After a brief stint in college, George declared for the NBA draft and was selected by the Indiana Pacers.  If you don't know, the Indiana Pacers are likely the most hated team in the NBA due to their perennial success. With a record 18 NBA Championships, including five back-to-back wins from 2013-2017, the Pacers are always in contention. This image isn't helped by the fact the team is located in Indianapolis, considered one of the most snobby cities in the country.  But the hate for Paul George in particular comes from his antics on the court. A showboater who never seems to stop, he constantly taunts opponents which is only made worse by his stellar performance in late game situations and the playoffs. George has made a league-record 78 game winning buzzer beaters in his career, while missing only three. Not about to miss out on an opportunity, George subsequently went on to star in a Gatorade commercial in which he sinks a buzzer beating shot, turns to the camera, and says ""No OT tonight"". Soon after, he became known as Paul ""No OT"" George to his fans, which are few and far between.  So there you have it. The history of the most beloved and hated player in the NBA right now. It was a bit short of a full book, but I hope I helped you learn something."

"I love Alex Caruso when he is in his usual role, but it is so painful watching him run pick and rolls as the main ball handler"
1.	Alex Caruso 2.	Tacko Fall 3.	McGee 4.	LeMickey 5.	ADisney
And Alex Caruso is 3rd. What's your point?
"It‚Äôs actually crazy how true that is. Just being a laker boosts your reputation tenfold. AD ended up being a top 5 player all of a sudden and a top 2 pf all time. THT is the best young player ever, Lakers will fix montrezl and lebron will make Andre Drummond good, etc etc. Even guys like Alex Caruso get boosted just because they‚Äôre on the Lakers. The influence is undeniable"
"I‚Äôve been trying to explain to my son that Alex Caruso is the absolute GOAT.  As a teammate of his, what does Caruso bring that makes him such a valuable presence on the floor?"
Hi Anthony! What is your favorite off-the-court memory with Alex Caruso? Is he the life of the team when you all hang out in the locker room or club?
"Anthony, What is Alex Caruso like personality wise, is he a joker or super serious?"
Do you have a favorite Alex Caruso meme?
"Hi AD, you have played with both elite defenders: Jrue Holiday and Alex Caruso. What are the pros of playing with each and how did/do they fit in your playstyle?"
Hey AD! What‚Äôs it like being teammates with Alex Caruso?
Alex caruso isn't good

"I'd like to see it as well but that's not how he's used. Giannis'  biggest weakness on the perimeter is fighting over screens. I've seen him get stuck on a 6'4 186 lbs Alex Caruso screen before. KD or whoever does not want Giannis on them and would rather switch onto Middleton, Divencenzo, or Tucker. He's also like the best help defender in the league. Put him on KD for a few possessions, or crunch time, not the entire game."

"I mean, you don‚Äôt usually stop counting at 3. I agree that AD ranks above pg but the gap isn‚Äôt so vast you just stop counting.

"All-Star Voting Problem Each year, excluding the 2021-year NBA all-star weekend, on a potentially game-changing weekend on Tuesday, 24 all-stars compete in a fun game for charity. While the weekend may seem fun and enjoyable with 0 problems to the casual fan, the NBA all-star game actually has some problems. The one major problem in the all-star game is the voting. Currently, the problem is the fans. While the all-star game is meant for the fans, some antics from the fan are enough to spur change in the voting distribution. Currently, the fans get 50% of the votes, and the players and the media 25% each. What shocks me, even more, is how the media, a group of (generally) smart and devoted analysts only gets ¬º of the total vote. My plan is to give the 50% of the fan vote to the media. Fans might be outraged at this plan, but they hurt the integrity of the all-star game. For example, a role player Alex Caruso got 1.3 million all-star votes, due to him being a fan favorite, athletic, white, balding, young player. The fans don‚Äôt take the votes seriously and vote based on popularity over skill. Each year, many all-star worthy players are left out, due to fans trolling in the votes and not voting for the worthy players, wasting the votes on people who won‚Äôt make it. Even though the troll players don‚Äôt get in, those thousands and millions of votes could have potentially got a deserving player into the all-star game over a less deserving one. By putting the majority of the votes in the media analyst‚Äôs hand, we are making the all-star voting process fairer. The all-star game appearances can have major implications on a player‚Äôs legacy and career and can possibly change how big a player‚Äôs contract is. Some NBA contract clauses provide money bonuses for all-star appearances, up to 200,000 dollars, a sizeable amount. In conclusion, the NBA all-star game has one major voting problem, and my plan will hopefully fix it, with your support."

"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"

Anthony Davis.  Davis has been one of the most valuable defensive players in the NBA this season (some would even argue the most valuable) but his value to the Lakers specifically has shined through in the postseason, where he‚Äôs been able to show his defensive versatility in multiple positions. Through 10 playoff games, the Lakers posted a defensive rating of 101.4 with Davis on the court and a defensive rating of 113.7 off of the court. His point differential of -12.3 is the highest point of anyone on the team. Alex Caruso is second with -10.1.‚Äù  You can check this site if you wanna make comparisons: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  This is coming from someone who almost never uses defensive stats, i do think the eye test holds more weight which is why i usually like to refer to video evidence."
Alex Caruso
"Yeah man, Alex Caruso **definitely** deserves more attention than half the small market stars in the league!  Do you even believe the nonsense you're saying?"
"Half the people in here complaining about hearing about Jokic's greatness so much are the  same dumbasses who upvote the 100,000th Alex Caruso meme.  Lel he bald and wite guyz!"
Lonzo is not a better shooter. He takes more attempts. Dennis is more offense all the time. His IQ is above average. Nothing crazy on turn overs and he has much better agility. You have to realize we don‚Äôt need another star. We need guys to star in their roles. Ala Alex Caruso and KCP. One of the only reasons Dennis is starting with us is because he asked. Which is fine. He‚Äôs definitely not a net negative and tries way harder than half the guards in the league. His tenacity and durability will afford us another chip. During the playoffs Lebron and AD will get the majority of touches. Shroder as 15-20 points a game well be devastating when Lebron and Ad go off for a combined 60 every night. That‚Äôs 80 points right there. While the rest of the team will only need 5-10 points each to obliterate the competition. It‚Äôs going to be a quick exit for a lot of teams this year. Because we also have Kuz that can go off for 25-30 or hit like 4 3‚Äôs. Harrell that can go off for 20-25. Morris 20. THT 15-20. KCP 15-30. Etc We got DOGS on this side. Probably the deepest team in the league outside of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is mostly washed up anyway. Lebron is well rested. Bootys are ours for the taking LOL.
Does alex caruso win mvp or does he get robbed again?!
"Tomas ""Alex Caruso"" Satoransky"
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."

The disrespect to Alex Caruso

Hot take. Alex Caruso is a better perimeter defender than Jrue Holiday. Holiday overall better defender because he can bang down low. But still. Bald mamba no respect.

"People like Caruso because of his looks and how he doesn‚Äôt look like your typical nba player and a major part of that is him being white. If he wasn‚Äôt white than a major aspect of that appeal would be gone. Trae young doesn‚Äôt have the typical nba look and his also balding. On top of that, he isn‚Äôt tall or a freak athlete. The difference is Alex Caruso doesn‚Äôt look like your typical nba player and he‚Äôs white. A lot of nba fans can relate to that so they gravitate towards him"
"The cedi one is true. The Caruso part is 100% not true, Alex Caruso gets overrated all the time and not just on this sub. This sub is definitely becoming a lot more self aware Caruso definitely gets overrated by nba fans. He shot 37% from the field and and 29% from 3 and got no blame, hate, or criticism yet all the other role players on the lakers got plenty. Yet when he does good he gets a shit ton of hype"
"Right away from the first paragraph of this study I see a glaring flaw.   Implying that people love Cedi and hates Tristan because of skin color just sounds like someone took a glance at this sub but never actually spent time here.   Cedi isn‚Äôt a well liked player because people actually like him as a player, he‚Äôs a meme. People meme about him but a great player who‚Äôs talent is indescribable because he‚Äôs a meme. Same with Alex Caruso, people don‚Äôt actually like Caruso as a player, he just became popular because you would never expect a guy who looked like that to be a basketball player. They‚Äôre shitty players who people like to joke around about because they‚Äôre white as shit.   People aren‚Äôt actually following Cedi Osman as he rots on the Cavs bench and pay attention to his game by game performances lmfao. He‚Äôs a meme."
2020 Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso and Robert Covington.
"Yeah, he's not wrong to think he's better than Alex Caruso. Now do I think he'd have been more effective for the Lakers if he ran the bench unit and Caruso started? Yes, absolutely. But people  are acting like he pulled a Reggie Jackson wanting to start over Russ."
Let's go Alex Caruso making a big impact off the bench!
&gt; Los Angeles pest Alex Caruso  Lol we‚Äôre obviously not talking about the same Carusho.
His son of course: Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso should unironically be an off-season priority for the Lakers
So we gonna ignore that Alex Caruso commercial?üòÇü§£
Role players are overrated. Look at how much Alex Caruso got overrated because he had Lebron and AD
"I can‚Äôt defend the Dwight mistake, but Javale was out of the rotation in the playoffs he was not good at all, Rondo wanted a lot more money and signed for 9m or more with the Hawks. AB showed he wasn‚Äôt needed since Alex Caruso really took the next step with his hustle in the bubble and this year he was even better but AB at the min would be good ig?"
"During the Lakers series, Booker held:  * Dennis Schroder to 27% FG% on 3 of 11 shooting * KCP to 14.3% FG% on 1 of 7 shooting * Markieff Morris to 20% FG% on 1 of 5 shooting * Alex Caruso to 25% FG% on 1 of 4 shooting * Kyle Kuzma to 0% FG% on 0 of 2 shooting  AD, Lebron, and Drummond, obvious mismatches on Booker, were the only players to shoot 50% or above when Booker was the primary defender."
Alex Caruso
I'd rather go with...   PG: Alex Caruso SG: Brian Scalabrine SF: Joe Ingles PF: Cody Zeller C: DJ Mbenga
"Clarkson going off, love it.  Crazy to think of the Laker's 07 Roster. (I know they got AD for some of these pieces but still)  Lonzo Ball: Max potentially incoming Alex Caruso Josh Hart Brandom Ingram: Max Contract Larry Nance Julius Randle: MIP Jordan Clarkson: 6MOY"
Bruce Brown would be this years Alex Caruso if it went in!
My favorite is when a random low-tier team manages to sign Michael Stauffer and Trent Pederson as their coaching duo and ends up going from like 21-61 to like 70-12 with their best player being an Alex Caruso that left the Lakers and immediately starts scoring 26ppg.

The data is skewed because of Alex Caruso
Did Alex Caruso intentionally thin his hair to earn a Manscaped sponsorship?
"man, I forgot when r/suns fell in love with Mike ""Jordan LeBron"" James for a few weeks there  if that dude played in LA then, he'd be Alex Caruso with hair"
"The GOAT, Alex Caruso"
"except for alex caruso, all alex caruso hype is well-deserved"
"No, the win-loss column makes you a joke of a team. Leveraging anything (within the rules) to win 6 championships in the last 20 years, makes you very much not a ‚Äújoke of a team‚Äù.   It‚Äôs just as stupid as saying ‚Äúthe only thing separating Steph from Alex Caruso is that Steph can leverage the fact that he‚Äôs a good shooter‚Äù"

"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA‚Äôs golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him ‚Äúa stud‚Äù and ‚Äúbuilt different.‚Äù They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka‚Äôs play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then‚Ä¶ right? If you‚Äôre familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you‚Äôre reading this) then you might have an idea of what‚Äôs coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there‚Äôs lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a ‚Äúflopper‚Äù a ‚Äúchucker‚Äù a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù and a ‚Äúchoker.‚Äù I even found two comments that said ‚ÄúI hate [Harden] as a person.‚Äù (It‚Äôs odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that‚Äôs a topic I‚Äôve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what‚Äôs different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don‚Äôt seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that‚Äôs it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, ‚Äúthe Mavs didn‚Äôt have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.‚Äù r/NBA doesn‚Äôt have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he‚Äôs a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
"Shit, we were all Alex Caruso this whole time?"
"I think it‚Äôs more personal with basketball. Baseball you hate the name on the cap, basketball you hate the name on the back of the jersey. Even though most people hate the Lakers, it mostly stops after the stars. No one hates Alex Caruso. No one‚Äôs saying fuck Aaron Judge, they‚Äôre saying fuck the yankees"
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"The fuck? Kcp was out for game 4 , he had to get an mri because he was so hobbled. He was questionable for game 5.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-05-28/lakers-kcp-injury-update-no-structural-damage-quad%3F_amp%3Dtrue  KCP is one of the best lock and trail guard defenders in the league, and the second he went down booker started going off, you think that's a coincidence lol. In game 5 and 6 KCP looked like he was wearing leg weights he was that slow on the trail.  Without a doubt KCP is our third most important player, especially when playing a team with explosive guards.  Caruso had back spasms and an ankle sprain and missed multiple halves.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/5/1/22415063/lakers-injury-report-lebron-james-alex-caruso-questionable-vs-raptors  Did you learn nothing about Caruso from the playoffs last year?"
Luke kennard is Alex Caruso with hair
"This is a hard time to be a laker fan. Lebron quit before it was over, AD is made of glass, and our third best player was Alex fucking Caruso. This team was horribly constructed. But that‚Äôs still not an excuse for lebron to go out the way he did. The Suns are for real, D book and cp3 are capable of taking their team to the finals no doubt.  Probably most likely going to lose to the nets tho"
Luka doncic or Alex Caruso? Who would you take? Delete this post
Difference between having an actual team. AD doesn‚Äôt get injured I‚Äôm sure they win. Alex Caruso was the 2nd best player
I sure did. The 36 year old played 41 minutes and had to carry the team since the 2nd best player on the team is Alex Caruso.   I saw two maybe three times were he didn't get back when he should have. But he was also probably exhausted.

Alex Caruso is questionable to return with a left ankle strain.  https://twitter.com/LakersReporter/status/1400663562306002945
"I haven't watched the Jazz a lot, but maybe he's like the Alex Caruso for them given that minivan description. I like sparkplugs off the bench. The Jazz bench is pretty deep."
If he fucks off that means the Lakers can keep Alex Caruso and THT. I'm okay with that alternative
Alex Caruso should never start for an NBA team trying to win a playoff game.
"My prob with Dennis isn't that he's bad(although I don't think he's as good as HE thinks he is) it's that if he doesn't score he's much deadweight. He's not a guy who creates for others, his defense isn't super elite(it's good but not better than say Alex) He isn't very good off ball. He's a great player for a 2nd unit where his above average defense can lock down average offensive threats and he can score at a much easier level. He also doesn't need to play make as much off the bench due to most teams needing iso scoring during that time.   I've always liked Alex Caruso more and I'm surprised they don't start him more. The Lakers need his energy, maybe he can only play in spurts because of how hard he plays but he's such a good defender and his play with Lebron is extremely good both high IQ players who can feed off each other."
"dang, Trae is balding? Is he Alex Caruso level? or LeBron level?"
Our most consistently dangerous role player right now is Alex Caruso. I love bald mamba as much as the next Lakers fan but‚Ä¶ yikes.
"I think he's one of those players that's great on only one team and would be pretty bad to at least mediocre on other teams. He's in that Alex Caruso, Lance Stephenson, Draymond Green specialist."
Lakers fans - Beal for Schroeder a first and an Alex Caruso jersey?
"Is Alex Caruso ""young""? He's younger than lebron."
have to wait until Alex Caruso retire to overtake his father's position
The absolute audacity to just snub Alex Caruso like that
I like Royce O Neal and Alex Caruso a lot
So Alex Caruso money
&gt; Best thing about this game tonight is not having the subreddit flooded with 600 clips of fucking Alex Caruso or someone doing a simple layup.  Facts.
"I mean take away AD from this Lakers team and who is the 2nd option? Dennis Schroder? He just scored 0 points. Alex Caruso? Genuinely asking. This team is horrific without AD on the floor. Their ""best"" shooter is KCP and he has been trash and injured as well.    I get that you're memeing, but this Lakers team is the opposite of deep. Wes Matthews sucks, Drummond sucks, Gasol can't play big minutes because he's old and slow.    It's just not a good basketball team when it's not LeBron + AD and it reallllllly showed last night"
[so im just going to go ahead and dust this bad boy off](https://streamable.com/38fh8)   Cameron Payne take a fucking bow  Best thing about this game tonight is not having the subreddit flooded with 600 clips of fucking Alex Caruso or someone doing a simple layup
"Alex ""the goat"" Caruso 1 rebound and 2 turnovers in the second half"
If your second best player is Alex Caruso you are gonna have a bad time
Alex Caruso and his relish fetish is getting out hand.
didn't the lakers just win a championship with rondo and alex caruso playing point guard
Who is a more complete/effective player: Ben Simmons or Alex Caruso?
Alex Caruso is in the playoffs tho
"Alex ""Michael Jordan's Dad"" Caruso"
"I get that they will look at the film and adjust to playing without AD as best they can. But for me, if you‚Äôre gonna say stuff like this, it better not be after you came out and laid an egg in the third quarter, only scored 2 pts, and kept passing it off to Alex Caruso to initiate the offense.   We saw in Game 3 he came out locked and loaded in the third and started to put the game away. If he‚Äôs capable of playing like that, him being so passive and lackadaisical in the 3rd was weak. After you play like that I don‚Äôt want to hear about how big your shoulders are; if that‚Äôs the case you should‚Äôve shown it coming out of the locker room lol.   Tl;dr it‚Äôs a bad look to say that after a game in which you spent most of it being passive. It would be better to come out and show this next game and let your game do the talking first IMO."
You forgot Lakers legend Alex Caruso
Star player: Ben Simmons  Role player: Alex Caruso
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Does that make Alex Caruso Kuroko?  Because there's no way Lebron'll be able to hide his presence.
That explains a lot. Also herro should model his game after Alex Caruso instead
Alex Caruso
"the origin of this joke is amazing, it was a few years ago and they showed throwback footage of ernie and Shaq goes ""look, a young Alex Caruso"""
"&gt; If Crowder does that to literally almost any other player in the league, that player is probably crashing down  I have to disagree in that if Crowder did that to any other player in the league, they probably would not have been strong enough to have kept going at the same rate Lebron was.  [Lebron has made a career out of finishing through wrap up fouls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKYgFa1pIzs)  If that was Ja Morant or Alex Caruso or even Drummond, I doubt they would have had the combination of speed and strength to burst through Jae's wrap up attempt, more likely they just stay grounded entirely."
"I was expecting him to come out firing in the third quarter like he did the previous game. Instead he came out and...did absolutely nothing and kept giving the ball to Alex Caruso to initiate the offense. It looked like he‚Äôd decided we were going to lose regardless, even though we were only down 4 at half, and wanted to get out of the game expending as a little energy as possible. Just a straight up bizarre approach."
"tbh it doesn't even really matter, even the way brooks tweeted it is correct - black players in all sports are treated as entertainment, and they only enjoy their status in that context. that's why they get assaulted by cops like anyone else (thabo sefolosha), profiled by cops (sterling brown), turned away from restaurants until someone realises who they are (dominique wilkins).  none of this will ever happen to gordon hayward or alex caruso or jj redick."
lol run it back? we are going to be missing Alex Caruso next year and Lebron will be a year older and AD could always be out again next postseason.
"If you go by ones that can be proven false, I‚Äôd go with either Stockton‚Äôs assist record is just because he had home cooked stats or played with Malone. You can look at the numbers and it just doesn‚Äôt add up but you see them all the time.   This is also only including takes people actually believe and not that Alex Caruso is better than Paul George trolling"
Excuse you. That spot belongs to our accountant. The one and only Alex Caruso.
"Alex Caruso dunking on the Warriors with a quote from Kevin Harlan: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop him, you can only hope to contain him‚Äù"
"Awesome stuff, OP! Would love to see a Draymond version of this as well. I don't remember him being in the draft mix at all, but would also be curious what the first mentions of Alex Caruso were."
We need our secret weapon Alex Caruso 2 save us
"Yeah and it only took every western conference foe being down a superstar for your Cinderella squad to scratch and claw their way to the Finals barely.   Yes the Laker super team of Lebron AD and Alex Caruso. Meanwhile the Suns have a premiere guard in Booker, the best point guard in the league, and a center who was picked #2 who found himself. Still barely made it.   Cope come Tuesday night when you lose. Looking forward to seeing the western conference title banner raising ceremony in October scrub üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠"
Top 5 I guess  1. Alex Caruso  2. Dort 3. Poku 4. Tacko Fall 5. Giannis
Reminder that Booker also pushed Alex Caruso while Caruso was midair...I'll never cheer for this clown ass team.
Media assigns more masculinity to Black men and gives them less wiggle room when it is convenient to white men. But then on the court Alex Caruso is the ‚Äútough gym rat‚Äù while Black guards are ‚Äúgifted‚Äù
Alex BabyDaddy Caruso
Where‚Äôs Alex Caruso when you need him?
Alex Bomb Caruso.
Alex ‚ÄòBalding‚Äô Caruso?
"Simmons and filler for Dame makes a lot of sense for both sides. Portland would have to blow it up. Simmons gets a low pressure environment to evolve into whatever he's gonna be and Dame goes to a team immediately contending in the east.    And no for the millionth time - the Lakers DO NOT have the assets to get him unless he forces his way there and even then not happening and yes that makes me want to cry. Kuzma, KCP, tonal signed by Alex Caruso, a second round pick, harrell, and a bag of balls."
People on this sub have probably seen a lot more Alex Caruso highlights than Kareem highlights
"I would only take Drummond and his brick hands if we could send him down to the G League for practice.   Sign and trade Schroder for anything.   Retain THT and Alex Caruso, ideally Ben Mclemore on a minimum as well.   TJ McConnell would be a nice pickup on the MLE, but I don‚Äôt know if he will come that cheap.   Figure out some sort of way to trade for Myles Turner or Buddy Hield if it‚Äôs possible"
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
Id take my chances on all-star players learning to play the role of role players than have Alex Caruso in a medal game in the Olympics.
"Replacements should be pure role players who just play defense, hustle, and keep the ball moving. Marcus Smart and Alex Caruso would do wonders for this team."

"the same def raptor rating that says alex caruso is a better defender than anthony davis? kk  you mean 0.6 DBPM which is a good mark, anything positive is good  amusingly sabonis has a +0.4 defensive raptor so if you're trying to say he's a bad defender and 2 comments later justifying it with their RAPTOR rating then you've contradicted yourself"
The convicted felon Alex Caruso?
The Tax Man Alex Caruso?
"So Lowry was actually healthy for the second half and the ""injuries"" were faked just for tanking? From the outside, all we saw was Lowry being out for like a week, coming back to light us up, then being out 2 or so more weeks after that.  If that's the case (that the injury was fake), then sure. Otherwise, those absences alone would have tanked us out of the playoffs because our guard rotation for that entire duration would be Alex Caruso, Ben McLemore, and not even a third stringer on the roster to dribble the basketball."
It‚Äôd be interesting if they constructed the roster with actual role players. Feels insane to say but I truly believe taking away a couple of all star iso guys and swapping them with hustle guys like Alex Caruso and Marcus Smart would create a more cohesive team.
"It‚Äôs not that he isn‚Äôt seeing well, it‚Äôs that he started playing real defenses and was actually tested instead of going against alex Caruso and facu"
"If you really want to play the Injury Game:  Suns  1. CP3 was hurt in Game 1, struggles game 2 and 3 with lingering effects for the rest of the series.  Lakers:  1. Lebron had played 2 games prior to the series after an injury two months prior that takes 6-8 months to recover from. Clearly wasn't close to his normal level. 2. AD Hyper Extends Knee in Game 3, Can barely move for first half of Game 4 before straining his groin and out for rest of series. 3. KCP strains his Quad in Game 3, misses Game 4, can only play 15 minutes in Game 5 and plays Game 6, both of which he was struggling to move and jump. 4. Alex Caruso has back spasms and Ankle Sprain, particularly bad in game 5 and 6 where he can barely play.  So one of your top two players is hurt but doesn't miss a game. Meanwhile our best player is still injured, all of our top four players are hurt, two of them miss games.   Both teams fully healthy Lakers take it in 5, 6 if they take a game off like against the Heat last year."
Alex ‚ÄúAdios Motherfucker‚Äù Caruso
He makes more than Alex Caruso. That‚Äôs effed up.
Alex Caruso
"Defensive stats are terrible. Not to argue, your point, but RAPTOR also has Caruso at +3.9 and Simmons at +1.8. Unless you want to argue that Alex Caruso was twice as productive defensively as Ben Simmons, you shouldn't really be using it."
Jrue Holiday is just a 25 million dollar Alex Caruso
"So does Alex Caruso, but he is still liked"
Alex Caruso taking notes now
First Alex Caruso and now Harden. They‚Äôre really trying hard to crack down on nba superstars nowadays huh
"Alex Caruso, and then some other people who aren't as good as him so why care"
"Sure, agreed and I understand what I think you‚Äôre trying to say: if Kyle Kuzma had a more realistic perception of his ability, he may be a more successful NBA player. No arguments there, and not every player needs the all star mentality to be successful. Alex Caruso comes to mind as someone who doesn‚Äôt think of himself as an all star yet most would agree he‚Äôs successful. I‚Äôm just trying to suggest some people are wired differently and need to think that way, and for Kuzma, he may not even be in the league if he didn‚Äôt have that confidence in himself."
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
Alex Caruso. Already over hyped like a MF. But still. He has that NBA finals Delly vibe to me. Not sure if that regressing or if that's over hype catching up to them.
"KD maybe? At times better than LeBron, both have had multiple peaks where they're better than the other.  However, Messi and LeBron changed how we imagine soccer and basketball, whereas KD and Ronaldo are kind of like the perfect players of maybe just before the new era that the GOATs brought us into.  Messi didn't create the False 9 role and LeBron didn't create the idea of a point-forward, but without the change of ideas that Messi brought, there's no way that say, this season Manchester City doesn't go out and buy or at least loan in a center forward with Aguero out with a long-term injury. The old conceptions of who the PG is have some sites listing Danny Green, KCP, and Alex Caruso as starting PGs on the title-winning Lakers."
That's strange. I don't see Jake Paul and Alex Caruso.
I would say 90.03% of the league smokes weed.  Alex Caruso was caught with a pound last month.üòÇü§£
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
Alex Caruso too unless he's the ultimate fall guy
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed ‚ÄúPlayoff Rondo‚Äù.  KCP: ‚ÄúBinary Mamba‚Äù for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers‚Äô Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe‚Äôs word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers ‚Äúain‚Äôt the one‚Äù. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become ‚Äúwashed‚Äù. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to ‚Äúgood‚Äù teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, ‚Äúto continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation‚Äù. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. ‚ÄúFOR KOBE‚Äù is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets‚Äô bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a ‚Äúmickey mouse ring‚Äù or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  ‚ÄúJob‚Äôs not done‚Äù  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
Jrue is just a black Alex Caruso with Hair
"Alex Caruso, the Rastafarian legend"
"You're probably right. Im imagining the rest of the roster filled with some of the other white American talent, kaminsky, reddick, Alex Caruso, Tyler Herro and I just feel like there is a lot of talent on that roster that could flourish with larger roles. I am also of the mind Love is capable of far more than what he has shown with the Cavs."
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
Surprised nobody said Alex Caruso yet.
The disrespect to Alex Caruso
"Fair. But I don‚Äôt think Alex Caruso was on his first contract. Even if he was, he‚Äôs a free agent now. :)"
"Lebron played well but anyone who watches lebron knows he wasn't even at 80%. Hes lebron of course he can catch lobs with a bad ankle. But you are still hurt and u still have the thought of reinjuring the ankle when driving.  And I like the heat, but everyone knows that Lakers Vs Heat match up Heavily favored the Lakers..  You're talking abt Anthony Davis , Mcgee and Dwight Howard vs Bam Adebayo and a bench stretch 5..  Kcp , rondo, Alex Caruso vs dragic, and lebron vs butler   In that match up lakers were Heavy favorites. No one can say suns were favorites against lakers nuggets or clippers if both sides r healthy. Its all good. Even if they win 1 , let's see what they do going forward when everyone gets a full off season of rest and everyone isn't injured"
Pat Bev Alex Caruso
This is slander to Alex Caruso and I wont stand for it
Alex Caruso at 3m was pretty great.
&gt; Alex Caruso and Boban would have been voted in.  You're vastly overstating how popular Caruso is. Also Boban almost made it one year because players voted for him.
If that was the case‚Ä¶then people like Alex Caruso and Boban would have been voted in. But no‚Ä¶frankly there‚Äôs only maybe one or two players per all star game that I think were kinda undeserving‚Ä¶otherwise they mostly pick the best players (per conference at least)
"To start Jesus Christ is arguing on the internet all you do? You act like I threatened to kill you because I clarified a fact about a player on your favorite team lmaoo chill we are talking about basketball players.  Anywho sorry for disrespecting your boy, but even if it‚Äôs about switching who is he switching on to? Alex Caruso? Nic batum? I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not a great defender, I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs not like an all defensive stopper or some shit, he‚Äôs played 3 heavily injured teams."
I was making a joke about how Caruso had a shit ton of all star votes. https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/02/11/alex-caruso-lakers-all-star-game-voting-top-10  Edited: a word
"And according to the fans, so is Alex Caruso"
Alex Caruso
"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo, Alex Caruso"
"Alex Caruso, aka the Accountant, is my pick."
"u have alex caruso on ur team the poster child of a guy who has a high impact without scoring, ppg isn‚Äôt everything   *looks at flair oh that explains it"
A white dwarf üòÇüòÇ yeah that‚Äôs more like Alex Caruso
"That‚Äôs interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don‚Äôt think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it‚Äôll be an interesting free agency!"
Alex Caruso for Kyle Lowry who says no?   /s

Alex Caruso.
"Absurd take. Caruso is a pesky defender that can hit an open shot and make a play in transition. He is essentially a taller/longer Jevon Carter. There are plenty of Alex Carusos in the league, but not many guards that can create their own offense, hence the differential in pay."
"Alex Caruso is absolutely a good player lmao. That isn‚Äôt really debatable.  He‚Äôd only get ‚Äúexposed‚Äù if you have unrealistic expectations about his strengths and weaknesses. Like if you go in there expecting him to run an offence that‚Äôs more your fault for not knowing what he‚Äôs good and bad at. It‚Äôd be like saying Schr√∂der is ‚Äúexposed‚Äù for being a poor 3 point shooter. Next to LeBron, Caruso is the more beneficial player."
"&gt;he improved lebrons, alex caruso and rajon rondo   He improved LeBron and Rondo? Lmao"

"&gt; Trez has to opt in to make that happen and he has no reason to  Of course he does, you think he's getting more than 9mil on the open market? I dont think so. He's useless in the playoffs, no one is paying him more than that  &gt;Also, why would the Raps want Trez and Caruso?  Trez is a 9 mil expiring, thats worth pick 22 in the draft. Alex Caruso is a good bench player to have. Why do you ask the question I already gave you the answer to?  &gt;Might as well let pat Lowry on the back and let him walk.  I mean guess, if you'd rather not have a FRP and a decent role playing guard."
"Is that dumber than making yourself a laughing stock state for giving the cultural icon that is alex caruso a pointless charge. To me, the crime of pot possession is less dangerous to society than rolling through a stopsign.  Reading about a professional athlete rolling through a stop sign doesn't really impact my opinion of that athlete, but it does make me scratch my head and wonder why this is even a story...there's nothing to say and if anything, it makes you wonder why we are wasting resources on such trivial shit."
Sweaty Alex Caruso has been hit with some light that nearly blinded me

In his defence this is Alex Caruso before he went bald
"Oh trust me, we annoyed. But personally, our guys are sitting at home nursing their injuries and their losses for the offseason, so we mostly laying low while everything plays out for those still in the hunt.  edit: also we are more outraged at the injustice that befell our beautiful bald eagle Alex ""The GOAT"" Caruso"
"We are firing Nurse and hiring Master P as head coach and trading OG and Siakam for Alex Caruso so he can smoke weed legally without worrying which province he is in, which will be Newfoundland where he will team up with NBA champion and fellow chronic big baby Davis for the St. John‚Äôs edge."

"Was hooping with these 12-15 year olds today and one of them called me Alex Caruso cuz I‚Äôm balding and I played it off, then he called me it a second time so I said he looked like Lil Terrio  They were too young to know who he was, so they all looked him up on his phone and proceeded to clown this kid for being fat and short   He obviously was hurt, didn‚Äôt say much rest of the time, and definitely was self conscious about his height and weight, I feel really bad about it, was tryna poke fun but obviously hurt the poor kids feelings"
Being a meme  Alex Caruso and Brian Scalabrine  The Battle of LA and Boston continues.
"Because fouls don't get called all the time, especially when it's a superstar. Especially when it's LeBron. For the same exact way that James Harden is going to get way more foul calls than Alex Caruso, the same tends to happen on defense.     This is not a unique situation nor something that I thought would have to be explained or wouldn't be understood by anyone who has watched the NBA for even just a couple of years.      If you genuinely don't see the fouls then I'd be glad to highlight them for you, but I honestly do not believe any basketball fan could watch that and not see that unless they are blinded by the player who is involved in the play."
"Hart is a better defender than Pat and he'd get better quality looks with the Bucks. That % probably jumps from 33.  &gt;Not to mention DiVincenzo would have closed games over both had he been healthy.  Sure, but he wasn't healthy.  &gt;And if the Lakers wanted to go 'big' at the guard position, why would he play over Alex Caruso.  Caruso is more accustomed to the bench unit. Caruso has started like 19 games out of the 184 he's played."
"He's not better than Pat. Hart shot 33% from 3, that's horrible. Not to mention DiVincenzo would have closed games over both had he been healthy. And you saying he would have started games for the hospital Nets kinda proves my point. He's like an 8th/9th man on that team. And if the Lakers wanted to go 'big' at the guard position, why would he play over Alex Caruso."
Alex Caruso - Defense (According to James Worthy)
"Money. You‚Äôre never going to make as much on endorsements in okc or even San Antonio than you would in LA NY Miami etc. big market teams have big market money, massive fanbases and a lot of revenue can come through. I mean really Kyle kuzma Alex caruso and fucking tacko fall were in the all star charts. Even Anthony Davis who basically got fucked previous years simply because New Orleans existed. You get a ton more exposure and ability for endorsements being the 2nd 3rd or 4th best on a big market team compared to say idk Minnesota. They aren‚Äôt bad places but to maximize profits you‚Äôre damn sure not gonna want to be in Toronto if you aren‚Äôt super max worthy"

&gt; Contending big markets lose role players all the time because they don't want to pay the luxury tax. That move was not influenced by the Lakers not being backed by enormous wealth it was backed by not wanting to tie up your cap in Alex Caruso when they think they can do it for cheaper  Their cap is tied up either way; they weren‚Äôt going to have cap space with or without Caruso since their big 3 by itself is already over the salary cap. Their decision to let him go was textbook luxury tax concerns; I‚Äôm not sure there are too many much clearer examples out there‚Ä¶ When you are over the cap you don‚Äôt let a good player and fan favourite who wants to stay with your team walk for nothing unless you are concerned with the luxury tax. He didn‚Äôt sign some ridiculous contract that would be a negative trade asset.

Take a look at what the Warriors owners were willing to do last season with the Oubre contract and the luxury tax hit they took of $80M. For KELLY OUBRE.  We weren't even willing to do a fraction of that for Alex Caruso who was instrumental in our CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING SEASON.  Unbelievable, and very disappointing.

Alex Caruso hands down. The mans work ethic is unmatched and he‚Äôs way more athletic than he looks. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he is a serious contender 6th man of the year this season and I‚Äôd even be willing to bet he makes an all star team within 2-3 years.
"Only the third tallest on his team,[4] but called ""easily the No. 1 player in college basketball today"",[8] ""the best amateur basketball player in the United States"", and ""The White Oscar Robertson"" via Wikipedia   In modern terms does this make Alex Caruso the white Russell Westbrook?"

"I love 3 guard line-ups with some defensive oomph. I hated hated HATED Boylen, but the ONE thing I liked about him was his Kris Dunn + Shaq Harrison + (3rd guard) blitz lineup. It was so fun watching Kris Dunn and Shaq Harrison go all out on defense and attack the ball like absolute attack dogs.  In a weird way it reminded me of Devin Hester on the Bears. Devin made it so the boring part of football (special teams) became THE most exciting part of every Bears game. Similarly, that lineup made the defensive end so exciting to watch.  Can't wait to see Alex Caruso being an absolute dog on defense. Let's bring Kris Dunn or Shaq Harrison back home to play alongside him."
"ESPN: Alex Caruso slams LeBron. ""I'll be lobbing to Zach LaVine now"" says Caruso."
"There's no way you can justify a 30mil bill for a player like Caruso. That's just not a good business nor a sports move. I believe the team believes THT will make a jump this season and replace Caruso. We'll see. If that doesn't pan out, the Lakers can still make a move before trade deadline.   The bigger loss is KCP. I wouldn't say that it was a mistake as the Wizards would probably haven't made the Westbrook deal without him. KCP was arguably the third best player on the title-winning team. His absence will be felt more than Caruso's. Alex is replaceable by one player. KCP's contribution on both ends of the floor means that the team will need more than one player to step up to match his value."

"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Everyone reveres Alex Caruso so I'm good.
Cause we didn‚Äôt overspend for Alex Caruso? üòÇ   You can worry about who pays more money while the Lakers compete for a chip.
"I may eat these words later but I still don‚Äôt get why we gave up a guy like Caruso over THT. Like I get the idea that THT might be better down the line but we are in win now mode, Caruso fit well next to Lebron and AD and could be trusted to with big time minutes down the stretch. THT has had some flashy plays in garbage minutes, Alex Caruso started a finals game. If you are in win now. Pick the guy who you have won with before."
How is it weird for me to want to see tweets featuring stats out of an NBA twitter account that is... labeled for being about stats  If I wanted to see someone rip on an NBA player I'd follow the dumbass stan accounts for guys like Lonzo Ball or Alex Caruso
I would make it so only reddit polls could let you get in.  In other words   -&gt; Alex Caruso would be in already  -&gt; LeBron wouldn't qualify  -&gt; The logo would change to Brian Scalibrine
"[Where was this same anti vaxx energy for Bron?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/05/21/lebron-james-says-availbility-playoffs-not-factor-vaccine-decision/5211176001/) Is Lebron an asshole? Also he is allowed to feel like he should start over Alex Caruso I'm sorry that offends you. He should want to be the starting point guard on that team he is better than every other guard on that squad especially with Bron want to play a forward spot. Also, how do you know he is toxic to the locker room lmao. You there? He was great in OKC, Atlanta was a shit show because the entire locker room was toxic not just him. Its like you guys want him to be a bad guy for believing he is good enough to start over the other guards. He did not play well in the playoffs where EVERYONE sucked on the Lakers. He shoulda took the 80 but he is not this bad player that is ultra toxic he is literally one of the best locker room guys we ever had in our club. Maybe the fit isn't right for you guys, but to blanket this whole asshole thing on him is ridiculous you don't know the guy."
"Yep. Besides, 84 million for at least 2 more realistic shots at title with Ad n Lebron? In LA? Alex Caruso got paid more than Dennis to leave, and will still eat free in LA forever. Winning in LA is diffrent"
I still can‚Äôt believe that the Lakers helped create a universally popular bench player in Alex Caruso.
I think the bench would look nice with Lauri.   Clear offensive focal points with White and Markkanen and three defense first guys.   Alex Caruso Coby White Troy Brown Jr Lauri Markkanen Tony Bradley
"I enjoy the Summer League.  I was most interested as a Laker fan to watch someone like Mac McClung.  Obviously isn't projecting to be some sort of crazy superstar, but seems like he has a great feel and IQ for the game so far.  His athleticism may not be ELITE like it was playing in HS, but you can tell he seems to understand what his role is.  I know this is may be just my sadness and grief overtaking my mind - but in like 2 years or so...I can easily see him being like an Alex Caruso type guy.  hard nosed athletic player, who will use his motor and defensive instincts to get easy transition baskets for either himself or the team."
How could you play like that on the lakers in the nba playoffs and get outshined by Alex Caruso and think you worth 120million  üòÇ bruh got greedy he didn't deserve the 80mill  offered.

I think what you might not be aware of or ignoring is that the deals that were announced are verbal agreements and not contractual agreements. Alex Caruso does not have to read through a 200 page document before Shams announces that he has agreed to a deal with the bulls. Its no different than a normal salary negotiation...they will give you a figure and you might accept immediately. Then the paperwork and finer details get sent to you for review
Alex Caruso   Not just a meme but a fan favorite in LA
"Alex Caruso on hgh confirmed, also you know most don‚Äôt because?‚Ä¶"
alex caruso lets go
"I hope Alex Caruso isn‚Äôt remembered as a meme when he retires for this reason. He‚Äôs a solid player, but I feel like the level of meming people do on him will result in him looking the 14th man on any team by people in the future"
"The Lakers have a $4 billion TV deal. Please don't make excuses for them with this.  It was disappointing to see them not try to retain Caruso considering how important he is but I'm happy with who they pivoted to find instead.   It was especially disappointing considering Jeanie has always talked about paying the tax and stuff like that. But Pelinka won a title, I trust his moves. I don't think Alex Caruso swings a championship series and I understand not retaining him to some degree, but this was clearly them dodging the luxury tax."
"It's so tough explaining Chicago to outsiders. It's not Detroit, it's a very safe chill city. We just have a literal warzone on our west side. If you dont buy or sell cocaine, it's one of the coolest places on Earth. If you do sell cocaine, go home. This is an extremely violent, dog eat dog world. If you're reading this on the internet, Alex Caruso is more gangster than you. Dont even try. Go home."
"Draftexpress pretty much nailed it with him:  &gt;Overall, Caruso has the size and skill-set to succeed as a backup or third string point guard at the next level. He needs to cut down on his turnovers and continue to improve his shooting to carve out a niche as a big, steady, reliable backup in the pros. Still, he's a player almost any coach would love to have and he has an impressive knack for making winning plays.  http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Alex-Caruso-58733/"
[Who the fuck is Alex Caruso?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6mmbxr/who_the_fuck_is_alex_caruso/)
Alex Caruso is an irreplaceable player and letting him go was a bad move.
"According to r/NBA, Alex Caruso, a $10m player, has absolutely gutted LAL championship hopes"
‚ÄúWill Alex Caruso be better than lonzo for the bulls‚Äù
"&gt;I could see Pelinka offering him a 3yr/$40mil deal to play as the 6th man  We have zero reason to sign him for anything above a steep discount, with the Westbrook signing.  None.  And I presume/hope Pelinka's thinking the same thing if he let the better team fit in Alex Caruso walk purely as a salary dump.  It makes no sense to let Caruso walk but resign Schroder."
"Went to one of those team-affiliated signings and met Harrison Barnes/Seth Curry, Barnes was super nice and polite, Seth was kind of an ass  Met Alex Caruso while at A&amp;M, I thought he was a decent player and had size/potential, but this was right before he kinda became A&amp;M‚Äôs star. So I asked him for a photo at the Rec and he almost seemed surprised, but he was a good dude and nice and obliged me"
"I give up lol, yes Alex Caruso is better at getting to the rim than DeRozan.  Lmao"
Not sure honestly. He tried to leverage the shit out of the Lakers knowing they had already sunk a 1st RD pick to acquire him and would be up against the hard-cap so they couldn‚Äôt sign any free agent PG to replace him. Once Pelinka swung that Westbrook trade it was basically a big fuck you to Schroder.  I‚Äôm pretty sure he knew he wasn‚Äôt going to get +$25mil/yr on the market from any team besides LAL but now literally EVERY team has spent all their money.  I could see Pelinka offering him a 3yr/$40mil deal to play as the 6th man if they are willing to eat more luxury tax‚Ä¶it might even be LESS considering they are bidding against themselves at this point. We haven‚Äôt heard any other team with interest at all.  Going from a 4yr/$84mil extension to possibly being paid less than Alex Caruso is a Nerlen‚Äôs Noel type blunder that Schroder and his agent executed here.
‚ÄòBe ok‚Äô is a bit of a misnomer. They didn‚Äôt keep Alex Caruso in large part because of a luxury tax bill. Sure they‚Äôll be ok but it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre likely to do it or see it as a good idea to send assets to Chicago for the opportunity to pay multiple millions of excess tax to bring in Lauri.
They will pay Russell Westbrook 5x more than Alex Caruso despite being only 0.5x as good.
"Alex Caruso, marijuana connoisseur, returns to LA to face off against the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only in my 30s‚Äù Los Angeles Lakers"
"These guys all looking for Lebron to get them paid.  See JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Timofey Movgov, Matthew Dellavedova, Kantavious Caldwell-Pope, and Alex Caruso for more information."
Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso did get paid.  He's making almost $10M which is pretty good for someone who isn't a handling the ball and isn't taking very many threes.  Dennis Shroder would have gotten paid if he didn't play himself and act like a complete asshole last year.   But you're right on Chalmers. With Avery Bradley he's quite old and to be fair he skipped out on the playoffs.
"I don't think you would get as big of a boost from a star player as you would from a surprise player.  My choice would be Alex Caruso.  From going undrafted to G league player, to NBA player, to meme, to legitimately decent player, to solid role-player on a championship team, to Finals MVP.   That would jump him up in standings way more than it would an established superstar like CP3 or Harden"
Alex Caruso diddnt join the league until 2017
Alex Caruso would like to have a word with you.
Looks like Alex Caruso
And Alex Caruso at QB
Lakers fans and overrating Alex Caruso. Name a better duo.
"He‚Äôs just another role player. He‚Äôs not bad. But teams tend to over react to their bench talent.   Talen Horton-Tucker really is just a regular bench guy, same way Alex Caruso is, same way that Poole is. They‚Äôre not bad players and they‚Äôre not busts or anything. But they‚Äôre literally 12-15 minute a game guys and nothing more.   It‚Äôs okay to like role players but we don‚Äôt have to hype them up as way more than they really are.   Food for thought: Poole played last year. He‚Äôs probably not better than Klay Thompson and Moses Moody so I don‚Äôt know how many minutes he even gets this year on a WINNING warriors team.  Any role player can score 12 a night on a losing team"
Alex caruso. Goat vs goat
Alex Caruso no doubt
Ah the Alex Caruso and Coby White debate
"If Alex Caruso played like 1988 MJ he'd be the best player in the league. Effort doesn't always equal results, you can work as hard as you want and still be a bench warmer"

Also, we need a good Center. I wanna be hopeful for their upcoming season but I also have to be realistic."

Hello you forgot the motherfucking GOAT Alex Caruso.
That's Alex Caruso music
Lol Ben Simmons &gt; Alex Caruso is probably unpopular on here at this point.
Genuinely rooting for this guy.   It'd be fitting if he ended up on the Lakers roster to replace Alex Caruso.
"1. Ben Simmons  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Domantas Sabonis  4. Brandon Ingram  5. Pascal Siakam  6. Jamal Murray  7. Malcolm Brogdan  8. Dejounte Murray  9. Caris LeVert  10. Buddy Hield  11. Fred VanVleet  12. Malik Beasely  13. Jakob Poeltl  14. Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
Alex Caruso
Can I say Alex Caruso? I‚Äôve rarely seen a fanbase of a championship contender lose their minds so much over a 6 PPG scorer because they couldn‚Äôt retain him. And the reaction was mostly serious.
I always thought he looked like Alex Caruso meets Larry Bird with just a dash of Mike Haggar and how fun it would be to see that dude demolish the league
"OP how you not going to include to the GOAT defender himself, Alex Caruso? Coby is also missing from here. But to answer your question I think we will use Demar similarly to how Toronto used him his last year there and have him play with the bench a lot. We‚Äôll probably pull him 5 minutes into the 1st, bring in Caruso and let Zach and Lonzo play until the 8 minute mark and then bring Demar back in. In other words one of Zach or Demar will always be on the floor. They will always have some combination of Lonzo, Caruso, Pat, Troy Brown and Derrick jones around them who are all solid defenders, I think our defense won‚Äôt be nearly as bad as some these analysts think"
"This is understandable if it was like say Alex Caruso, but Tyler Herro? Not worth your car"
"You're thinking too narrowly here.   Multi-sport athletes may not choose basketball as their primary sport if there are more lucrative alternatives. If there's less money to be made in the NBA, that also means there's less money to be made by everyone around the game, which means less (shady) money for college athletes, weaker AAU programs, etc.    The impact may not be huge in America, but it would be be much more pronounced in other countries. Alex Caruso would still choose the NBA, sure, but you'd lose a lot of overseas depth guys, and they'd be replaced with domestic talent that otherwise wouldn't make the league.   Also, the smaller the gap in pay between NBA and other leagues, the more likely it is that another league sees it as worthwhile to boost salaries and operate in the red for a few years to overtake the NBA. Right now that's not a gambit worth taking. Cut the money in half and maybe some oligarchs start feeling frisky.  It is basically an economic impossibility that the talent level would stay the same if you cut the revenue in half."
The odds of a decent NBA level player not coming to the league because of the salary would still be incredibly low. Okay players like Alex Caruso would be making more than what the highest paid players in the Euroleague make even if you cut his salary in half.
Lakers fans should be mad at this. The second round pick is an asset. Paying $10M in luxury tax is not an asset. The most prestigious franchise in the NBA parted with assets of Alex Caruso and a 2nd round pick this offseason for no other reason than to pay less luxury tax. Penny-pinching in a championship-contending season is shameful.

"jr smith, lance stephenson, alex caruso, michael beasley and jared dudley"
"Just like Alex Caruso. It wasn't even Alex Caruso, someone just photoshopped him on a body builder."
"I really have to disagree - and I guess it's more to do with the term ""champion level PG"" than your comment in particular. The starting PGs since 2010 of NBA Champions are:  * Jrue Holiday * Alex Caruso * Kyle Lowry * Steph Curry (x2) * Kyrie Irving * Tony Parker * Mario Chalmers (x2) * Derek Fisher * Jason Kidd   This list goes to show ""champion level PGs"" vary wildly. Also shows that if Ben Simmons had a jumpshot and replaced the PGs in the list, he would've been an NBA Champion more often than not."
Is this another one of those Alex Caruso shopped workout photos drug test things or did he really get swole in one off-season?
Throw back to Alex Caruso getting drug tested for a photoshopped picture
The Alex Caruso special‚Ä¶ üí™üèΩ
Perceptions of how good a player or team is are wrong on almost every count. I know sports in general get people all riled up and cause them to take homer takes but I think money and popularity cause just as bad takes. There's also people who take team accomplishments and personal stats at face value way too much.  Alex Caruso is a solid bench player but it's also easy to look good when you're throwing lobs to LeBron and AD. The Lakers structure hasn't imploded because they lost their 8th player.  You can look at 95% of players and teams and pick apart how wrong people are with their opinoins. It would be nice to have some deeper analytical takes but most of it is: x player gets paid too much. LOL WHO? x players is a 20ppg player. x player is a good defender now (bonus points for literal no change in their defence)
lmao funny to think about it that way. dude is the same height as like alex caruso

LOL. Alex Caruso started in an NBA finals game. If that doesn't tell you how solid he is then i don't know what to tell you.   Would you start THT in the NBA finals right now?
"Yup. Definitely. The Lakers love guys like THT throughout the years.   ""Young with potential"" who were late picks.  We've had a few who didn't turn out well like Darius Morris, Devin Ebanks, Andrew Goudlock, Anthony Brown etc.   But we've had some success too with Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, David Nwaba.   THT has been good enough. It's just that Lakers fans are just more vocal and lakers players get more spotlight.   JC and AC were better prospects IMO but they don't have THT's physical gifts which the Lakers are banking on."

Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."

He's just entering the window of it being possible. They weren't going to do a 3-year buyout. 2 years is when it starts to get interesting, and we've started to hear rumors about it being entertained."
"using the full MLE would hard cap them, they won't do that.

White American players can't compete at all with Euros anymore. I wonder what happened?"
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers.

One of the criticisms I heard is that he's not a great point of attack defender and, like, I *guess* that's true in that he's not literally like a top 10 PG in that role, but he's not *bad*, he gets to cede that role when Alex Caruso is on the floor, and he's awfully good at just about everything else you want a guard to be good at - jumping into the lanes (he's top 5 in that), keeping up with smaller players, etc. - and even some things you don't expect a guard to be good at - using his length and jumping ability to stop guards, wings, and even sometimes bigs in the post, grabbing boards (not exactly defense but preventing second-chance points is definitely defense-adjacent).   I totally get why if you look at him certain ways you might be disappointed - he wants to be a classic 1 but he doesn't really have the quickness or the handle to break down other 1s in a halfcourt setting - but man, that whole deal with looking at what a guy can't do is a bit toxic for a younger, not very good team. Instead, you build around what your guys, especially your younger, more talented guys *can* do and figure out if that's enough or what you need to add from there. And on top of that when it comes to Ball specifically if you cordoned him off 3 years ago based on what he couldn't do, you'd be adding to that that he can't shoot from outside or even midrange particularly well (for that matter he shot under 50% from the line his rookie year). He's worked very hard to add 3s to his game."
Alex Caruso has entered the chat.
The bartolo colon of basketball is Alex Caruso
"I‚Äôd probably like Alex Caruso, but his place as a white basketball icon is annoying. He‚Äôs so good at what he does but when Chicago fans chant MVP for him at the line...... why?"
"I saw Alex Caruso at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Things haven‚Äôt been right for the Lakers since the departure of the enforcer Kyle Kuzma and defensive anchor Alex Caruso
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
"No Zach, please take it easy for your health and rest!   ..And not because Alex Caruso is on my fantasy squad and I could use the extra 10 minutes a game he would get if this happened"
Alex Caruso leads the league in steals.
Alex Caruso is a good example of this being on Lakers and now the Bulls
Not a bold prediction when you have the greatest player in NBA history with Alex Caruso
"&gt;Meyers Leonard for example is fucking huge and jacked and so are a lot of white players. Never heard them called ‚Äúphysical specimens,‚Äù more often ‚Äúgym rats‚Äù or whatever. I agree that most amazing athletes in American sports are Black, but I don‚Äôt see how that relates to my point. The ‚Äúphysical specimen‚Äù language simply doesn‚Äôt get used as often on players like Meyers Leonard, Alex Caruso, Jonas Valanciunas, or JJ Watt in football, despite its arguably equal applicability.  The thing is, nobody cares about Myers Leonard. That's the honest truth. Tons of people talk about Caruso's hops, but he isn't really jacked like Giannis or as quick as Fox. Again, people just don't care about Jonas that much."

There are enough white players that take bad shots such that the lack of ‚Äúlow-BBIQ‚Äù white players is more than just a reflection of their lack of representation in the league. This one is a little entangled with the perception of all white players as shooters, admittedly, but I do still believe there‚Äôs something to be said for the difference in perception here between a white player and a black player with otherwise similar stats."
Reaves reminds me of a white Alex Caruso.
Sigh. The reason why they didn't pay Caruso was because they would have had to pay extra 30mil in taxes. Alex would have cost more than 9mil for them.
"I'm imagining Jordan waiting in line going out of the airport like Dominic Cobb of Inception, to be greeted by his father-in-law (Michael Caine), Alex Caruso"
"Also only the good parts of MJ, most of what Alex Caruso is, and Hakeem‚Äôs presence."
The lack of Austin Reaves and Alex Caruso is disturbing

Alex Caruso stealing hearts is 100% sustainable
"&gt;Keeping Caruso would‚Äôve end up costing the team an additional $30m a season   It's frustrating that people keep repeating this over and over again even though it's not true. Every contract counts toward the salary cap. It's not like it was mandatory to sign everybody else, therefore Caruso would be the only one who could make them pay luxury taxes.      Russ is the highest paid player on the team, and his salary takes up over 27% of the salary cap. That's absurd. Before the Lakers agreed to the trade, they should have told Russ that, instead of owning him the ridiculous amount of over 91 million dollars for two seasons, they'd instead rework his contract and still (over)pay him at approximately  82.5 million per the next two seasons instead. That reworked contract would have paid for Caruso. Why would Russ take a pay cut? Well, Caruso publicly said that he'd take less to stay in LA because the Lakers are contenders, he'd get to play with LeBron and AD, the fans are worldwide and diehard, ***and because he'd make more money due to the exposure a player gets when he's a Laker****.* Caruso admitted all of this, which is unusual when you're a free agent who has never secured big money, but at least he was honest. Do you think that Russ and the Lakers didn't know that he'd make a lot more money in advertising in LA as a Laker than he did when he was a Wizard. Russ will easily make way more in endorsements than Caruso ever could, so it's all good for him, but not for the team.   Now, every single Laker game, I already see Russ just about every time they go to a commercial break. By being in LA, he's easily going to make up the money he would have lost to take a pay cut to play with an even better roster, and he'd still get a chance to finally win it all with the team he's wanted to play for his entire life.   Caruso would have taken millions less than even THT, and AC's contract would have taken up less than 5% of the salary cap, yet somehow it's his fault that the Lakers would have to pay some luxury taxes. If you've watched the Lakers just the past two seasons, then you know that what AC was asking for was more than fair, especially because he was underpaid the entire time he was on the Lakers even as he helped them become champions again. AC was willing to take a pay cut to stay on the Lakers, while Westbrook didn't, so now Russ needs to be worth seven to eight Alex Caruso's. Good luck with that...  Just to clarify, I don't blame Russ for taking a job that's going to earn him over 100 million dollars during the next two years as he finally gets to be a Laker, while the team couldn't spare around 8 million a season for Caruso because they're not rich like Ballmer. I do blame Pelinka, Jeanie Buss and the rest of the organization, though, even though they've done an excellent job acting like they didn't know that their transactions with other players would mess up their salary cap."
And Alex Caruso. Right?
It's official (again).  The Chicago Bulls are the best team in the league.  4-0!!!    Third highest point differential at +10.    4th best in points per game allowed at 97.5/game.

Can Alex Caruso still be Bald Mamba now that he‚Äôs in Chicago? Or does he have to be His Hairlessness?
He sure does hustle a lot. Reminds me of vintage Alex Caruso.
It's fair to say Alex Caruso is better than Westbrook right now lol

Anything by Alex Caruso.
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù DeMar DeRozan gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lonzo Ball belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Alex Caruso hit the locker room door, NBA star Zach Lavine hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
"Literally nobody of consequence said this  How could they with Alex ""The Calcite Clamp"" Caruso"
"Trade Russ for KCP, Alex Caruso, and Buddy Hield.  2 good defensive guards and a shooter seems like a decent team."
Unironically maybe Alex Caruso? Running around and stuff is the kind of thing he does well right?

"&gt;they had schr√∂der chasing curry around, and curry scored 30 in the first half. The put Caruso on him, and he made multiple steals and held curry to 5 points.  This is what doesn't show up in the stat line. Curry was cruising until Vogel made that switch.   After that game, Vogel flat out said that the Lakers don't get that win without ""Alex being Alex,"" so who's going to be Alex for the Lakers this year?"
Smh the disrespect to Alex Caruso
"Bro, nobody has to feel bad for Alex fuckin Caruso. Maybe he‚Äôs not rated accurately and those MVP chants aren‚Äôt ever serious.   But let‚Äôs break it down:  First off, there is no chant from fans for a player besides their name or MVP. We can blame this on many things but it basically is consistent in every single American sport except soccer.   MVP is also way way loose now: From 2005-2012 two Lakers got MVP chants: Kobe and Pau and those were about 90-10 respectively.  Since then? I can‚Äôt even count how many get those chants. It‚Äôs not consistent, it‚Äôs not even loud, and it goes to everyone. Dwight got them G1.   Second the dude has a fucking army supporting him (me included) that argue that from a legitimate basketball standpoint the guy is elite.  He‚Äôs not an All Star, he‚Äôs not top10, but neither was Shane Battier or Tony Allen‚Ä¶.  He is elite at what he provides in the minutes he plays. If he can do that in more minutes maybe he is a star. If he can‚Äôt? No knock on what kinda support he deserves. Quintessential fan favorite and I miss that bald fucking head."
"I'm trying to think of a few players who could improve the team and here's what I've come up with: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Montrezl Harrell."

For some reason I read Alex Caruso lol
"Love those type of players, Alex Caruso, Bruce Brown, De'Anthony Melton etc."

No one went ‚ÄúJeannie Buss refused to pay Alex Caruso‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs usually referred to as the team or the GM didn‚Äôt.   And Sarver has paid for so many people already ‚Äî Saric, Bridges, and CP3.

I think he‚Äôs just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they‚Äôre not on the Lakers.

Y'all could've really used an Alex Caruso out there.
No. Ask Rondo and Alex Caruso in 2020.  SHOCKER: Being a good player when surrounded by other good players is actually a lot easier.
"Nah this system is way better for all the players who aren't superstars. Teaks have to spend a minimum of the cap and decent starters make great money because those superstar contracts are limited. Remove the salary cap and you just have a few large market teams being in contention, even worse than it is now. Money gets spread around to players where guys like Alex Caruso can get a bag (well deserved)."

The New Meme is born. You will be remembered Alex Caruso.
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."

"And most of the moves made to win that chip wasn‚Äôt even thanks to genius thinking on his part:  1. Kyrie. The obvious No. 1 pick in his draft. Dan may be terrible, but even he isn‚Äôt that stupid to not pick him. Or that was what we thought until he picked Anthony Bennet 2 years later.   2. Love. A Love-Pick no. 1 (Wiggins) deal wasn‚Äôt some genius move Gilbert pulled out. It was already being discussed as a popular trade option the moment the Cavs won the first pick. All Dan had to do was to make the move.   3. Lebron. Cleveland is lucky as hell that this man was willing to come back after the shitshow they put him through. Dan Gilbert had *nothing* to do with this man coming back.   4. Supporting cast. Yes JR and Shumpert were good pickups but nothing too extraordinary. Tristan Thompson developed into a good starting C playing alongside one of the greatest playmakers of all time. Matthew Dellavedova wasn‚Äôt signed with ‚Äúback-up PG on a championship team‚Äù mindset, so you can‚Äôt praise Dan for that.   And when you compare this to what the Lakers were able to do in the 2019 season alone, Gilbert pales in comparison. Signing guys like Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, and an *upgrade* in the head coaching staff, and resigning others like Alex Caruso was better than anything Dan Gilbert has accomplished over his 2 Lebron stints *combined.*"

Alex Caruso is not just a meme. He has an important role on the Bulls

"Vucevic had a great game. I hope he can build on this because he's been MIA all season. He had a slow start and was just starting to warm up when he got COVID, sat out a few games, and was cold again when he returned. It's amazing the Bulls have done so well essentially without his help. They will be so much better with his help.  Another Bulls player who started the season late and still isn't in his groove is Coby White. A lot of Bulls fans are calling for rookie Ayo Dosunmu to get more of Coby's minutes, but Coby has played much better than this in the past and it looks like the coaches want to give him minutes so he can get back to form. Even if they ultimately trade him, as some fans are saying they should, they need him to be playing well or no one will want him.  And Ayo, for all his great plays, also makes a lot of rookie mistakes. With the Bulls playing as well as they are, there's nothing wrong with bringing Ayo along a little more slowly.  Alex Caruso has been wonderful on defense but not as wonderful on offense.  He, too, can play better, and his last two games -- really three of his last four games -- have been good offensive games. He needs to keep that going, because it's harder to play him long minutes if he isn't offering much on offense.  It's annoying that the Hornets went on a 19-4 run at the beginning of the fourth quarter to make the game close again, but at least the Bulls responded well and won handily in the end. The Hornets are a good team and this was a great win."

Had a guy use it this morning to show how Tatum is better than Booker ‚Äòand it ain‚Äôt even close‚Äô. The same metric has Alex Caruso and FVV ranked ahead of KD on the season and Lebron currently sitting at 76th in the league. Biases make people delusional.
"Caruso? LOL who posted this, Alex Caruso's family ?"
"Alex Caruso is the biggest thief in the NBA and it isn‚Äôt even close. Caruso is averaging 2.2 steals per game, and Jimmy Butler is averaging 2.1 steals per game.  If you‚Äôre wondering who the worst thief is. It‚Äôs Payton Pritchard, who has yet to get a single steal in 159 minutes of play."
What random stats lmao. Book‚Äôs EPM is [higher](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) anyway and if we‚Äôre just using raptor then I guess Alex Caruso and FVV are both better than KD apparently. Not to mention LeBron ranks at #76 in the league based on Raptor. Tatum‚Äôs been ass this year
"I was just looking at the $9 mil and how the Knicks could use a good spot up shooter or impact player instead of Kemba. $9 million on the open market can get you an Alex Caruso, Montrez, Seth Curry, Dario Saric--all around $9 mil a year."
Alex Caruso
"I mean‚Ä¶ it has John Collins, Fred VanVleet, and Alex Caruso as better players than Durant  And it has Gary Payton II as the 21st best player in the league  And it has the Warriors at 4% chance to win the championship at this point in time (with an 18-2 record!) even though it assumes Klay will return."
"You been watching these games? LeBron has arguably been the best defender on the team. Westbrook Albeit is just meh at defense right now but he's not playing anything abysmal, he can stay in front of his man, and isnt great at off ball defense. So I'd say he's playing average defense. The biggest problem with the Lakers defense, as opposed to last year, is the loss of KCP and Alex Caruso. As well as Kuz and Morris who were good defenders as well. Theyre getting destroyed on the perimeter and have dropped considerably in paint defense in part because Anthony Davis hasn't been as dominant as usual at that end, but he's also like second in the league in blocks so there's that. Of the big three of the Lakers the one underperforming the most right now is AD."
"It‚Äôs actually 33 million sweaty. . .Here is how it compares to the actual contenders: GSW $184mil, BRK $130, LAC $95, MIL $53, UTH $38, LAL $33. Looks like a whole Alex Caruso could fit in there and some"

Gabe Vincent vs Alex Caruso is why people turn on that game right?
[Alex Caruso at the free throw line always lookin like](https://media0.giphy.com/media/3ohuPvppoXR2QzFDwY/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47zp5ji8t02agbs5c33ly7qulqbqmfu1963hbo087r&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g)
"Alex Caruso is a bad boy. Really hate playing him, which is a compliment - hope you Bulls fans enjoy him"
"god man, Alex isn't a meme. it's funny how as athletic as he is, he really maximizes it. not everyone is like that. if Lonnie walker played with the same aggression and effort level on both ends as Caruso, he'd be a star. lol"
I heard Jesus and Michael Jordan birthed out Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso Lakers in 4
"Regular season and Playoffs are different animals.  We‚Äôre built for the Playoffs, with our top 3 players who actually been all the way to the Finals.  Bulls got none of that, unless you consider Alex Caruso their top 3 player then he‚Äôs the only 1 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"He‚Äôs still trying to justify his draft pick when he blew the pick. It‚Äôs maybe not a shot at bey, but it‚Äôs absurd to say that josh green was the right pick when you see the players picked after him, not just bey. He doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for any wrong doings, but wants credit for hypotheticals like wanting to trade up for thybulle or liking Alex Caruso. It‚Äôs easy to say these things now when you are unemployed"
"KCP and Harrell do not qualify here because they‚Äôre not drafted nor even started their career with Lakers. Harrell was on the Rockets and found himself to be the player he is with the Clippers. KCP was an already established role player with the Pistons before his Lakers run.  Josh Hart and Alex Caruso are better selections   It‚Äôs worth noting the other young guys on that list  have not made any impactful Playoffs appearances or any appearance at all.   DLo was a bum in his first and only Playoff debut with the Nets, Kuzma was absolute dogshit against the Suns last year, Randle was legit awful in the Hawks series. Zubac didn‚Äôt look too good against the Mavs.. Larry Nance and Jordan Clarkson were not ready and just not that good on that 2018 Cavs run with LeBron leading the way"
Will the real Alex Caruso please stand up?
Alex Caruso
"Nah.. that‚Äôs not it. We were implementing a new defensive scheme for like the first 5-7 games of the season where we would have the center play out at the level of the screen.  Now we‚Äôre just grasping at straws. The only time our defense looks acceptable is when Nassir and Nance are out there together. Nurk is having one of his best seasons as a rim protector, but there‚Äôs not much he can do out there. Even if he shuts off the basket an open three is usually just one pass away.  Even if we had a defensive mastermind like Popovic or Nurse running the show it‚Äôs not like we have the personnel to execute some inventive scheme.  We‚Äôve traded three consecutive first round picks to surround our guards with two of the best defensive forwards in the game. According to RAPTOR we have a top 3 defensive center (I don‚Äôt actually believe that, but Nurk is top 7ish for sure). At this point it‚Äôs very clear that the problem is the backcourt.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible to build a mediocre defense around Dame and CJ, but you just need one guy who can guard the opponents best player. We need an Alex Caruso or a Gary Trent or a Dillon Brooks. That way we could at least hide Dame and CJ on worse offensive players."
"I just think it makes more sense to be mad at the sports media, or the Lakers themselves for spending so much money, leveraging their position in LA to attract players. As far as I can tell, Laker fans are pretty well behaved on this board.   Lakers fans are actually pretty laid back compared to other fan bases. And Caruso actually being good should give us some vindication that we‚Äôre not just making stuff up.   In the last decade, we signed Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng to massive deals, were horrible for a long time, then traded away our entire future for one bubble ring. And now we‚Äôll need to rebuild. We‚Äôre stuck with Westbrook next year too, and he‚Äôs owed 50 million. Our roster could be Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Zubac, with Alex Caruso coming off the bench. Instead we have the retirement home.  It‚Äôs been a tough run for the Lakers too."
Could the Lakers be missing.....Alex Caruso?
"&gt;  I think he‚Äôs shown he can be a good asset, but we have a lot of offense but not enough defenders.  Defenders like Alex Caruso?"
Alex Caruso didn't have his contract matched so that the Lakers could make room for Talen Horton-Tucker. You love to see it
More joint issues than Alex Caruso.
"Alex Caruso is averaging 2.8 steals a game, and the Bulls allow 103 points per 100 possessions when he is on the court, which would make them the second best defensive team in the league behind the Warriors."

"It can happen if you're an amazing defender, without much of a role on the offense e.g. Alex Caruso. The only problem is that THT ain't an amazing defender."
One word: Alex Caruso
"False advertising!   This wasn't a fun in any way.   Why didn't they just give Caruso the money? He actually would have made such a positive impact in these ""almost wins"" (this is the crap that some Laker fans are appeasing themselves with), and he was willing to take a two year deal.   ""Almost wins"" turned into ""wins that count"" means pay the man!   Regarding this decision, Jeanie, Pelinka and everyone involved are all idiots. Sadly, I don't think Vogel, the actual head coach, had any say in that decision. He looked miserable last week when they asked him about Caruso:  ""Who wouldn't a guy like Alex Caruso?""   High energy+momentum changer+elite defense+plays perfectly along LeBron=no thanks. Make it make sense."
Alex Caruso got more allstar votes than Devin Booker lol
Any dunk by Alex Caruso
He's young and has more potential than Alex Caruso as a player. As you said he is undisciplined but I think you can live with that since he's only 20/21. He can grow out of bad habits (hopefully)  He's part of Klutch  The Lakers also probably want some sort of future when LeBron retires and probably think THT can become that 2nd guy to AD once that happens.
hell ex-7th men of the Lakers on new teams get more press  Alex Caruso is all over the frontpage of r/NBA for a month now even though r/NBA is not a indication of media exposure but still.

"Like I said in another comment they aren't mutually exclusive. No one is saying ""only white players are getting spammed on /r/nba"" but white players disproportionately get talked about on r/nba largely in part to the reddit fan base being mostly white. It's why guys like Alex Caruso, Brian Scalibrine or TJ McConnell are talked about constantly.  For the example of Unicorns or unique build players like Yao, Boban, Bol Bol, Tack Fall are all going to get hyped more than shorter or less unique physically built players."
Lol yea your right... Alex Caruso is the key to LeBron being great
"Trade Dennis, KCP, and THT for Lowry at the deadline last year, extend.  Kuzma, Harrell for Buddy Hield if they both preform badly, I actually thought Harrell was nice for the regular season and Kuzma is an underrated defender, maybe Lowry would‚Äôve helped out his offensive woes in the playoffs.

If I was the lakers I would unironcally rather have alex caruso for 44mill than russel westbrook.  &amp;#x200B;  Sure he won't score 19 points a game on terrible efficiency but he'll play great defence and won't take awful shots/ try to play hero ball
"If you're being paid $45 million a year and you're a third option, your team is honestly better off with Alex Caruso and KCP"
"If you're being paid $45 million a year and you don't drop 33/11/11 on decent efficiency on a somewhat regular basis, your team is honestly better off with Alex Caruso and KCP"
"Those players all ended up sucking though. Dwight Howard (2.8 PPG) and Alex Caruso (6.3 PPG) were the only role players on the Lakers to score above league average TS%, and Caruso only did it by .002 over league average.  The supporting cast was so bad in the finals that they probably would have lost to the Heat had the Heat's three best players not gotten injured in the first half of game 1, and that would have been with LeBron and AD both having elite series. That's how bad the supporting cast was."
"Caruso was the one guy who came out in the 3rd and fucking gave it.  He would single handedly get the team hyped and moving when we were slowing down.  He would get stops, steals and breaks.    Dipshit Buss family didn't want to pay 20-30 mil in luxury tax when it wasn't even Alex that was causing it it was Russell Westbrooks fucked up contract.  Fuck this team."
This is what happens when you don't re-sign the GOAT Alex Caruso  Look at Chicago now
The difference is Alex was exactly what the lakers needed and has been grinding and working hard and proved himself  The hate comes from tht being young and raw and losing Caruso to buy into his potential

"I agree. KlankThompson (excellent name btw) knows faaar more about LeBron Leadership than those other guys who have praised it. What the heck do, wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Love, osman, Morris, Howard, rondo, Davis, Korver, Caruso, Reddick, Vogel, spolstra, griffin, etc know that Klank doesnt???  I mean come on, we never see quotes about LeBron like the one from Dave Griffin: "", ‚ÄúHe got his work in before we flew. ¬†Nobody does that ‚Ä¶ His single-mindedness and focus, I‚Äôve never seen before.‚Äù ¬†LeBron James didn‚Äôt let setbacks discourage him or stop him; he used them to make himself and his team better.   And certainly a hall of famer like Bosh would never say anything about a regular season game like:  ‚Å∏ ""The Bulls had beaten us 10 days earlier, and this win on our home floor gave them the season series sweep and propelled them to a 24-4 finish. It also meant they took the No. 1 seed from us. Needless to say, it was a low point, and the media was loving it.  The next day at practice, I remember Bron coming in‚Äîand you could see it on his face. It wasn't that he wasn't happy. No one was. There was something about him that just¬†embodied¬†bouncing back. That he was back on track and we just needed to get on his energy.  The intensity that he brought to that practice was inspiring. To see the best player on the court sprinting full speed and leading the team with intensity and effort was what we all needed. We were all diving on the court for loose balls, taking charges, bringing that same intensity to the seemingly mundane drills. Getting back to the basics.  That's what a leader does. It's not just hyping the team up when you're winning and everything is comfortable. A leader shows composure when others would fall apart. LeBron didn't need to say anything to get us fired up‚Äîhe just needed to set the example and trust that we would follow him. And we did.""  Or maybe Alex Caruso when asked about LeBron Leadership in preparing and reaching out to his team:   ‚ÄúIt is ability to put everything in a perspective. He‚Äôs one of the smartest players I‚Äôve ever played with if not the smartest. He always knows how to put people in a position for success,‚Äù Caruso said. ‚ÄúAnd I think for him to be able to understand that as a player it really helps me, it really helps our team.¬†   But hey, let's not take anyone's word for it. I mean, didn't he throw Kevin Love under the bus or whatever. Listen to these mean things Kevin Love has said about LeBron leadership:  """"He's demanding in all the right ways and for right reasons,"" Love said. ""He has that strive for [greatness] saying that he always lives by, and he really won't accept anything else. I think Jordan was...they're different in their own right. I think Kobe was the same in trying to get the best out of their guys. I think Bron was absolutely very, very demanding but always was looking out for his guys. Always wanted to build you up. Always wanted to set you up for success.¬†"""

"1st, some of the players you added to your response are other great picks for this list, and should also be in the conversation, which is all I was suggesting for ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù in the first place, however I would venture to argue anyone that‚Äôs on a newly signed max deal or is destined to sign a max deal shouldn‚Äôt be included in this topic, we should be praising people who outplay their low contracts not stars who have already received their payday or are surely going to get one  2nd, You clearly don‚Äôt watch every laker game otherwise you would know that ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù is a much more consistent player than kuz and markieff, even if it doesn‚Äôt show up in the box score he does all the intangibles that those guys don‚Äôt  3rd, if you can‚Äôt conceive through context of our conversation that AC refers to Alex Caruso then that‚Äôs on you, i‚Äôm not going to pander to the oblivious observer i‚Äôm going to refer to the person that is being discussed in a way that I see fit, in this case ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù is commonly know as AC Fresh or Carushow by laker fans, so that‚Äôs what I call him, i‚Äôm not going to change what I do based on how you believe I should do it"

I'm not saying that this is a sensible trade, but just for example, he could be traded for 2 years of Donte DiVincenzo straight up.  Or Matisse Thybulle and 3 years of his contract.  His salary would fit with trading for Alex Len, if the Lakers decided they do need an actual backup center.

Are the Rockets being called by those podcasters who flipped out when Alex Caruso beat them?
"Lakers are good at finding and keeping players who are not afraid of the moment, you might have noticed a lot of ""good players"" once they put the Lakers jersey on and play along side great players fall short of expectations and are soon let go. An Alex Caruso who is solid or even improved in the heightened intensity of the playoffs is more valuable than a Lonzo Ball, while perhaps more talented, shrinks in the same situation."
"&gt;Regardless of where he grew up, if you've ever played against a legitimate NBA talent, you'd know how massive the gap is between them and some random guy from a playground court.  First off, we're not talking ""talent"" here.  Just size and athletic ability.  Last year, Simeon High -- Horton-Tucker's old school -- had four guys at 6'7"", two more at 6'6"", and two more at 6'5"".  These guys grow on trees.  That said, that talent gap is a lot wider in some places, than others.    And, for the record, Alex Caruso was a pretty random guy off the street after he went undrafted, among many other undrafted free agents.  Horton-Tucker himself was not that far off being an undrafted guy on the street, either, being a mid-second-round pick.  There are a ton of guys hanging around Chicago playgrounds who played DI ball very well, but didn't make the show for one reason or another.  Or really talented high school kids who may some day make it -- Horton-Tucker was one of those.  Only the best \~400 players in the country ( not sure how many internationals the NBA currently has ) are NBA players.  That leaves many thousands of really talented guys playing, well, wherever.  For comparison, there are 350 NCAA D1 programs.  So every year, about 1500 ex-D1 players finish their eligibility.  A dozen or two make the NBA.  Some more go to Europe, overseas, and the G League.  Most of the rest just go home, and get real jobs.  Plus all the guys who couldn't or wouldn't pass the required tests to be eligible.  &gt;The only place THT was going to get tested was in some AAU games  I believe you are underestimating disorganized basketball in major cities, but I'll let you argue with Doc Rivers.  ‚ÄúYou play against everybody,‚Äù Rivers said. ‚ÄúI mean, how many kids can say, unless you grew up in Chicago, you can have a pickup game out in the park with Isiah Thomas, Terry Cummings, Maurice Cheeks, Mark Aguirre, Darrell Walker. There‚Äôs not a lot of pickup games like that in your same grade. That‚Äôs every year. That‚Äôs called Chicago basketball.‚Äù  [https://www.nba.com/news/chicago-week-chicago-mecca-basketball](https://www.nba.com/news/chicago-week-chicago-mecca-basketball)"
"Alex ""Average Player"" Caruso and Talen ""Scrub"" Horton-Tucker"
its ok Alex Caruso only got 3 points today
HE HAD SIXTEEN POINTS. SIXTEEN! ALEX CARUSO. UNACCEPTABLE.
ALEX CARUSO... 16 POINTS
Y‚Äôall remember when that rockets podcaster had a meltdown over Alex Caruso?   #Freaking average players
I guess Alex Caruso?
"There are also workout videos of Alex Caruso looking like Michael Jordan.  Also, there's a difference between John Wall looking ""good"", and looking ""$45 Million per year good""."
It's actually 4th best all-time.  1. Alex Caruso (1-0) is undefeated when scoring 30 pts or more
Alex Caruso
Yeah but best Charlie Brown lookalike goes to Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso
"Well duh...  Payton Pritchard was the 26th pick in the 2020 draft.  He was a 2X All Pac-12 selection, a Cousy Award winner for top PG in the country, and was a concensus All-American in his last season.    Alex Caruso was not only undrafted, he didn't even make ESPN's top 100 NBA prospects list for 2017.  His only award was his selection to the All SEC Defensive team in 2015-2016.  Nobody ever expected him to become an NBA player.      It's pretty damn based on Pritchard's college career that he should be a superior player than Caruso.  but that's no slight on Caruso who has proven to be a solid player for the Lakers, especially defensively in closing out games."
Payton Pritchard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alex Caruso
The Celtics version of Alex Caruso
He's like a young Alex Caruso
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."
"üò¥ He‚Äôs trash.  I‚Äôm starting to get annoyed that bc they‚Äôve unexpectedly won a few games people are starting to overhype his impact. Like he‚Äôs some intangibles genius. Like stop it. Draymond makes his team better....like Alex Caruso makes the Lakers better. Like Delavadova or Tristan Thompson made the lebron cavs better. Or Pat Beverly a few years back. Are these plus players ? Sure. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre anything more or really that good.   Draymond is a quality role player who perceives himself , and has fooled fans,  to thinking he‚Äôs some elite player. It will be hilarious when they start losing again as Draymond triple singles it up."
"I think it was Alex Caruso who talked about the transition from G-League to NBA by saying:  Most guys (G-leaguers trying to get into the NBA) think they are applying to be CEO, when really the job available is the cleaner.  That is 100% the approach for one of these guys. You will never be the most talented guy on an NBA court. What you can be is the guy who puts in the most effort and tries to fill his role - which is unlikely to be as a star/scorer. What will get you minutes is to play hard-nosed defence, do ALL of the little things (box out, screen, go for loose balls etc.), and then take shots/play your role offensively when its available. Do that, train hard, and be the ultimate towel-waving teammate when you're on the bench - and thats how you stay in the NBA, and with a bit of luck find the right environment to go from 3/4th options, to say maybe a key role player off the bench, or even a starter, on the right team."
Alex Caruso new #1 option on the Lakers
Yeah calling them idiots and stuff without knowing the full story. Next person to have to sit out was Alex Caruso and there were crickets lmao
I mean when you have the GOAT you don't really question when people put you at Number 1. It's the Alex Caruso effect.
"then you add Alex Caruso to the mix, your odds of winning drastic go up"
"Alex caruso better stay in his lane, i better not see him talking to halsey OR ELSE"
What's more infectious: COVID-19 or Alex Caruso memes
Not sure. But I am positive that Alex Caruso would be starting.
It's like when Alex caruso or Ben Simmons hit a three or Matisse Thybulle scores on your team. You know the defense is lacking
"Thomas Bryant, Svi, Zubac, Alex Caruso (Undrafted), Mo Wagner, etc. I don‚Äôt think they have a single miss in like six years in the sense that many of them are still playing solid minutes on NBA rosters."
"so many idiots in this thread. none of the players, coaches, or team management is involved in this and yet y‚Äôall dumb fucks are making predictions about certain players. didn‚Äôt see any of this the last week that alex caruso has been out for health protocols."
Or AC - Alex Caruso
"Yeah but they've also hit on a few lower picks and got solid players at the bottom. Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Alex Caruso, Josh hart and Kyle kuzma are all guys they've found who have become solid players in the NBA. And that's just from the past few years. Admittedly Josh hart and Thomas Bryant were draft day trades but still. Credit where credit is due, Lakers scouting department is elite."
"As I keep telling people in the 500000 times this question gets posed: nothing is stopping you from generating hype for your favorite players. A lot of Laker fans like Alex Caruso. For a variety of reasons, he resonates with them and becomes someone to root for. So they post about him, post his highlights, create memes, buy his merchandise, and talk about him on social media. My suggestion for those wanting more attention for someone like Shai, or Ja who gets a lot of attention as is, is do the same thing if you  feel like there's a disparity.  The new post button is over -----this way-----&gt;"

Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso
This is right after Alex Caruso took out Paul Millsap and the ESPN broadcast completely ignored it and completely ignored that Millsap never came back into the game
Alex Caruso
Play him but have Alex Caruso literally carry him on his shoulders all game long.
"Alex Caruso talked about how Sam Presti came once met with all of OKC‚Äôs g-league players to answer questions they had about what he was looking for in a player. This is the understanding he got when he came away from that meeting:   ‚ÄúA big reason guys get stuck in the G-League is because they don‚Äôt realize the position they‚Äôre trying out for. It‚Äôs like going to a job interview thinking you‚Äôre going to be the CFO of the company, and they‚Äôre looking for someone to clean the bathrooms.‚Äù   Basically, if you don‚Äôt have obvious star potential a front office is looking for you to fit a certain role and show that your willing to fill that role. There are lots of guys in the g league that can put points on the board, those guys rarely make it to actual NBA teams."
Alex Caruso
"Alex Caruso is way more athletic than Steve Kerr was. I don‚Äôt know why people think that role players haven‚Äôt gotten better from an athleticism standpoint. Through advancements in medicine, physical training, and a wider pool of talent to draw from of course the average player is way more athletic than they were even 20 years ago. It‚Äôs happened in every sport."
White guy here to talk about Alex Caruso
"Rondo isn't anywhere close to Westbrook no.  He was never a top 10 player, and yeah he was a valuable role player for 2 titles team, 2 playoffs runs in which he often was benched in the clutch behind guys like Eddie House, a post prime Sam Cassell and Alex Caruso.  Parker I was stupid to dismissed like that, Rondo ain't close not even sure if he's top 20"
And the same guys act like Alex Caruso isn‚Äôt playing meaningful minutes on a championship team in the current NBA lol
Alex Caruso
"Man I really love what the jazz have been doing this year but calling bogey or Clarkson future all stars is pretty nutty imo. Players look better when they play in good systems on good teams and don't have to play outside their best areas. Do you really think Clarkson would be having such a great season (great ppg off the bench on great % plus improved defense and decent) on a team where he had to be the 2nd or 3rd option as a starter? Getting your non stars to play to their full potential is what champions do, look at the Lakers last year. No ones confusing alex Caruso with an all star but damn if he wasn't a key component of last years title"
Alex Caruso one of the best defenders in the league  Can't say I've watched many Lakers game this year but just stop it
Black Mamba = Kobe Bryant (RIP)  White Mamba = Brian Scalabrine  Red Mamba = Matt Bonner  Bald Mamba = Alex Caruso  who else?

NBA champion Alex Caruso disagrees.
Worst in the league? You think Alex Caruso is better than Westbrook?
"Joakim Noah, Alex Caruso, Sheldon Williams, and Charlie Villanueva are up there for me too"
"To be honest, it's as much the fault of the NBA's lackadaisical approach to voting as it is the fans' fault for memeing with Alex Caruso. Klay's been injured the whole season, he shouldn't have even been in the list of eligible players to begin with.  That being said, I hope Fred makes it even though his chances are pretty slim lol"
"I'm not a fan of it and I'd rather it be coaches, players, and media. they all have their biases but it's better than Alex Caruso being top ten."
"Yup, its a real shame Alex Caruso is only 10th for west guards just bc he averages 5.5 ppgs."
"There were a lot of giannis highlights posted.  His double clutch dunk, the pick and roll move with khris to tie it late, the spicy alley oop etc.  It's not that highlights don't get posted it's the fact the bucks are small market. You swap out giannis or khris or donte with alex caruso or curry and they'd get thousands of upvotes instead of like 5."
Oubre goes 10/10 from 3 but Lakers win it with an Alex Caruso buzzer beater
I see people still think Alex Caruso a meme.
&gt;Alex Caruso  Caruso started in the finals.
Here goes Alex Caruso
"Man... I just don't understand fans... I really don't. Every year, this ""fan voting"" is losing more and more credibility and probably is going negative in that category.   Im going to list some of my notable gripes with this list:  Kyrie having too many votes(Dude played like half their games)  Klay shouldn't be on the list  How is Trae still this low(Last year, had a worst team record and this year Hawks are a playoff team)  Still don't understand why Alex Caruso made the list  Joel Embiid but no Ben Simmons?   &amp;#x200B;  Glad it's only 50% but seriously needs to be lower... Fan voting is absolute troll nowadays."
"There seriously should just be a pool of players to vote for rather than having it open to every player in the league   They should cut it off at like the top 100 players of the league so we don‚Äôt have Alex Caruso being voted in. Players injured for the season should also be excluded.   Obviously the players don‚Äôt really get screwed around much because the top voted players will still get starting spots and the rest are up to coaches, but it‚Äôs infuriating as a fan. Big market teams have so much more power"
Is Alex Caruso being on the list a meme or is he actually worthy to be there? legit question.
How does fucking Alex Caruso have more votes than  De'Aaron Fox? The fuck?
Because there‚Äôs no reason that Klay Thompson should be on this list and Alex Caruso is an absolute meme.   De‚ÄôAaron Fox is having a career year and deserves to be up there.
"1. I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY DEROZAN IS LISTED AT A GAURD WHEN HE HASN‚ÄôT PLAYED A SINGLE MINUTE AT GUARD FOR 2 YEARS   2. Spurs fans need to do better. No reason for Alex Caruso, Klay Thompson who hasn‚Äôt played in 2 seasons, and CJ who has been out for like a month to be getting more votes than him.   3. Where tf is De‚Äôaaron fox"
Bron looking like Alex Caruso on that last play
So a much shorter Alex Caruso with less athleticism and worse shooting? Don't count on it.
It‚Äôs hard for Dame to be my favorite player when the GOAT exists. Alex Caruso is just too good
"The Lakers were missing their other star, Alex Caruso"
"Of course the Lakers will lose. Lebron's main sidekick is out, after all.      Hurry back, Alex Caruso!"
"You think Alex Caruso is better than Brook Lopez? That is absurd, and the only way you can justify that is with the classic cop-out of yOu DoN‚Äôt WaTcH. LMAO."
ah yes the /r/nba users that convinced themselves Alex Caruso was a meme player.
"Unfortunately we only have one year of data for both these guys together, and unfortunately we keep moving the goalposts in this discussion. Danny Green was prioritized above Alex Caruso throughout the regular season and the vast majority of the playoffs - is that statement incorrect?   And two more notes: 1.	The playoffs are much more matchup dependent so of course there‚Äôs going to be some variance between series. 2.	The sentiment here was very low on Danny Green‚Äôs contract just last year, especially his perception by Lakers fans. If you‚Äôre going to argue that Talen Horton Tucker deserves 15M a year, there must be better evidence than Danny Green"
"Are you telling me you think Alex Caruso, a random undrafted player averaging like 6 a game, would be as popular as he is today if he played for the jazz or something"
&gt; Ignore my flair  [But your flair combined with shitting on Alex Caruso just begs for this to be posted.](https://streamable.com/hb8dog)
"Mike Trudell last year said on a podcast or something that Alex Caruso was a better player than him, just straight up.  He caught a lot of shit for it at the time, but he ended up being completely right."
You cannot seriously say Alex Caruso is better than Patrick Beverly
"Interesting choice of words, but yeah sure the Lakers did beat the Rockets. Ignore my flair for a moment and consider the statement - do you really think someone who‚Äôs less of a priority than Alex Caruso is a 15M/yr player right now? Please note that I‚Äôm not making any statements about the future potential of either player"
"Isaac Bonga, Alex Caruso and Andre Ingram have joined the room"
He‚Äôs playing a ton with everyone out. But we don‚Äôt use him every possession obviously. The problem isn‚Äôt minutes at the moment actual. It‚Äôs possessions. He only gets a handful of touches a game. He‚Äôs only on his second year and didn‚Äôt play most of his first year because he was injured. I believe he finally started playing by the bubble. He showed up and showed out. We have Alex Caruso as well. But his priceless on defense and effort plays. He‚Äôs like a baby Rodman without the absolutely insane rebounding. Which is why we got Drummond. But apparently he‚Äôs a diamond in the rough and I wasn‚Äôt aware.
Chris Bosh was an all-star six times in Miami and was part of a squad that won two rings. In what way does Alex Caruso do more winning things
Never compare Chris Bosh or Serge Ibaka to Alex Caruso ever again

People really forgot about Alex Caruso huh
This is the MVP ladder and it‚Äôs undebatable:  1. Brad Wanamaker  2. Julius Randle  3. Alex Caruso  4. Michael Jordan  5. Joe Ingles
"Embiid does lots of foul baiting too, just not as much as harden.  I remember one time Alex Caruso got paired up on him, and instead of trying to attack the basket, Embiid did a rip through on Caruso to try and get a foul call."
"NBA finals: Joe Harris vs Alex Caruso   Adam Silver: there‚Äôs no more injuries than average, here are my stats"
"Why is the PBA a mediocre hellhole?  Imagine Steve Ballmer owns the Clippers, Knicks, and Bulls.  Imagine Joe Tsai owns the Nets, Lakers, and Sixers.  Imagine that aside from Lacob's Warriors and Cuban's Mavericks all other teams exist to trade their best players to the aforementioned six teams the way you trade Zion Williamson for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Kyle Kuzma, and Alex Caruso.  Imagine the salary cap implications of the aforementioned trade are irrelevant because the first six teams mentioned can pay their players way more than the what's on their official contract.  That's the PBA for you."
"fuck that! Im the shit, I know im making the league. I style my game like a hybrid between alex Caruso and Kobe Bryant. Theres no way a team passes on me"
"Definitely agree , Alex Caruso has been dominating the league."
It‚Äôs an easy argument: how many rings did Jordan win in LA without Alex Caruso? 0  How many rings did LeBron win in LA without Alex Caruso? 0  Alex Caruso is the GOAT of GOAT‚Äôs.
Listen I‚Äôm tired of this argument. Y‚Äôall never get it right.   GOAT ranks:  1) Alex Caruso  2-50) also Alex Caruso  51) Giannis
"&gt;But Mike Brown made it to the finals and by your logic he is a great coach  No.  I never said making one trip to the finals makes for a great coach.

Or don't, but stop wasting my time.  &gt; Does that make Rondo the greatest PG of all time because he led the Celtics all by himself as a rookie AND led the Lakers to a ring last year??!! Alex Caruso the Goat now?   Rondo, as a rookie, came off the bench for a 24-58 Celtic team.  Your complete ignorance -- whether intentional or not -- is tiresome.  If you aren't totally embarrassed by now, I cannot imagine what it will take, but for the love of god, stop humiliating yourself here.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Cousy didn't win shit without Russel so how is he in your top 4?   Cousy won an MVP, and they didn't even start giving those out 'til he was 26 -- and he was top 4 several other times.  He also led the league in assists 8 straight seasons.  Oh by the way, he largely invented the position as we now know it.  You can go on flaunting your utter ignorance all day long, if you want, but it's just making you look dumber and dumber.  Remember how I told you that you should listen to your elders, because they know far more than you do?  Here's yet a couple more examples."
But Mike Brown made it to the finals and by your logic he is a great coach!!!!

"You're both clutching at straws, the true MVP is Alex Caruso."
Does that make Alex Caruso or Kuzma Frodo?
is this a parody of the alex caruso RAPTOR post
Alex Caruso looks like the type of guy that dominates the Ymca league.
"nice one, but seriously alex caruso is underrated"
"Realize that using the Raptor metric, he is literally a negative on offense at a negative .7. His defense is overated by the metric unless you GENUINELY believe that he is the BEST guard defender in the league. If you think that this isn't the case, you concede that Raptor hasn't accurately assessed his impact. If you do believe that Alex Caruso is the THE BEST guard defender in the league well... there's medicine can be taken for psychosis."
"He literally deserves less respect. Every single NBA team has an ""Alex Caruso"" on their bench but only rabid Lakers fans yap about their guy to the point where he becomes an annoying meme"
alex caruso
RAPTOR and CARMELO rankings are the defining traits of a successful NBA player. That‚Äôs why I consider Kobe Bryant the 35th best player of all time adjusting for competition and time on court and consider Alex Caruso the GOAT.
"&gt;	RAPTOR ranks Alex Caruso as the 47th best player in the NBA over Kristaps Porzingis, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vuecevic, Bam Adebeyo, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Domantas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward.   this really does speak volumes, perhaps not about what you think"

"Thanks for putting Lebron and those other scrubs up there, but we all know we're only interested in watching Alex Caruso."
"How so? Compared to most NBA players, he doesn't run fast or jump high. However, he compensates with guile, footwork, skillful post moves, strength, body control, and a good (but not great) jumper.   (Also, in case anyone is wondering, it's not a racial thing. I think Alex Caruso, for example, is very athletic.)"
3 best players... Alex Caruso exists.
He's waiting for Alex Caruso to sit him down and have the talk

"Yeah, Alex Caruso would have to put the team on his back to make it past the first round."
Yeah because she was definitely a diehard Hawks fans and not some Kardashian wannabe looking for an opportunity to increase her IG follows...  You're dumb as bricks if you think she does that if there were no cameras or phones in the building. You think she would have even been at the game if it were the Hornets instead of the Lakers? You think she would have picked a fight with Alex Caruso instead of the most famous basketball player in the world? I think you know the answer to these questions. She went immediately to her IG live after being kicked out. That shit was as scripted as Pence walking out of that Colts/49ers game over kneeling. They knew exactly what they wanted accomplished before walking into the building.
And then gave them both to Alex Caruso.
"Alex ""One Puuuuunnnncccchhh"" Caruso."
"Alex ""Saitama"" Caruso"
That's what I was worried about. Jae Crowder got clowned on by Alex Caruso last game and clowned by LeBron while being mocked by the Lakers bench. He's a dirty fucking player who is going to try and take our guys out if things keep going this way.
Caruso. His name is Alex Caruso. And he is the indisputably greatest Laker of all time.
Alex Caruso just waived off Lebron on a fast break and blew a layup. That XXXL headband is cutting off circulation to his brain.
A SPECTACULAR PLAY BY ALEX CARUSO
"They could take a page out of the Lakers book and see how they took the ball out of Harden's hands last year.  People were right to question how the likes of Alex Caruso and KCP were going to stop an MVP who could drop a 40 point triple double in his sleep, but Lakers doubled late and got him to pass the ball off to a random guy with like 6 seconds on the clock, not enough time to get the ball back, not enough time for the other guy to really make a move.  Completely took Harden out of the game and they had no answers.  Clippers have the personnel to do this, but they need good coaching to make sure players know how to run this scheme and what to do in situations when it breaks down."
"uh, bro? Alex MOTHAFUCKIN Caruso yo."
But imagine losing to average players like ALEX FREAKING CARUSO

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a total coincidence that all r/NBA‚Äôs favorite players just happen to be white and asian. Alex Caruso gets more hype when he makes a layup than when Booker scores 40 but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs just a total coincidence.

"You either aren't paying attention or are delusional if you think Dame gets anywhere near the love that Doncic gets. And Jokic has been getting it on r/NBA for much longer than just this year.   Individual fan subreddits are different because obviously people like the players on their own team. I'm talking about /r/nba   Even Giannis never got the love Doncic or Jokic gets. Any thread that comes up people only want to talk about him losing to the Heat or how he ""chokes"" in the playoffs.  /r/nbacirclejerk exists almost exclusively to make fun of how racist r/NBA is. All white and Asian players get hyped way out of proportion. Even fucking Alex Caruso got tons of posts last Finals"
really odd description of Alex 'Kyle Kuzma' Caruso
They win with Alex Caruso instead of steph
If it was Alex Caruso you'd have Lakers fans sitting here jerking each other off over it.
Alex Caruso
Yeah Alex Caruso needs a place to play once Lebron leaves for the Knicks.
"Nah, he was just bad, his head wasn't in it like it's sometimes not. He'll have games (even recently after he came back) where he'll completely go off and be unstoppable, and then sometimes just get bullied like he did today and be super quiet. Just AD things.  Obviously we're not going to be a very good team if he and LeBron combined for 30 points on bad shooting lmao. Alex Caruso was the only kinda bright spot."
"There's this weird narrative about Trae being basically the worst defender of all time. And don't get me wrong, *he is pretty bad*.   But he's not even bottom 3 on his team. Not a very high bar, but the whole ""Trae is actually a net negative because the defense is historically bad"" is crazy. He's 169th out of 500+ in DRPM. You know who is lower? De'Aaron Fox. And I'm not hating on Fox, I love him and think he is amazing and fun and a true talent to build around. It's the narrative that is weird to me. Other notable players with lower DRPM than Trae: KAT, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Ja Morant. Even players like Alex Caruso have a lower DRPM than Trae.   So then you say ""DRPM is a flawed stat"" to which I reply ""absolutely"", but it is the stat that gets thrown around to shit on Trae all the time.   Trae's defense isn't special bad. It's just regular bad. If he was a guaranteed bucket every single time, it would be punished a lot more. People just really really hate him."
Great. Hope so. You don't get to that level without being an elite player. People aren't irrationally hating mike conley or alex caruso. if he becomes as hated as harden is that only means positive things for him as a player and in turn the Hawks as a team.

"""WHY AREN'T WE WINNING?"" Frank yelled to his players in the halftime locker room. He was so furious he could barely keep his teeth from biting his tongue as he screamed.  ""They got more points than us"" smart-ass Lebron replied. ""I need to hit my shots, coach"" Dennis replied. ""WHY AREN'T WE WINNING GUYS??"" Alex screamed as he tried his best to get his teammates pumped. Everyone just stared at him with glazed, confused eyes for a few seconds.  ""Thank you Alex that's enough"" Vogel said calmly as he gave Caruso a big hug. LeBron and Anthony's eyes connected as they had so many nights before and they smiled at each other while wiping the sweat off each other maintaining strong sensual eye contact. ""We can do this"" Lebron whispered. ""We really can Bron! I know it in my heart!"" Anthony replied.  Lebron grabbed some hair out of his jar and placed it on his forehead without applying any pressure as if that would fool anyone. ""I'm ready coach"" he said as he furrowed his eyebrows and ran back onto the court.  ""Yeah coach. You hear that? We're ready."" Anthony said in a condescending tone.  Frank sank his head into his own palms for a few minutes while the other member of the Lakers sat there helplessly staring around for the rest of the halftime duration.  ""WHY AREN'T WE WINNING??"" Caruso yelped again like a hopeless dog. Frank ran out the room before saying another word and the Lakers players soon followed. It was time for the Lakers to kick things in gear for the second half."

Alex Caruso could shit the bed for the entire playoffs and the Lakers will still match whatever offer they are allowed to.   Schroder has his contract to prove though after missing so much time and having s few stinker games down the stretch.  One guy is asking for 25+ a year and the other is probably going to make half that at best
Same but with Alex Caruso.
Yeah stars with big contracts would just opt out and we‚Äôd just be watching Alex Caruso vs. Jae Crowder

"[NBA commissioner Adam Silver forcibly administering LeSuperSerum to a young Alex Caruso (2014, colorized)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAbYdJSXkAEg6uB.jpg)"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"I agree with you and thought it was a clear flagrant, but JVG, Steve Javie and Mark Jackson all thought it shouldn't have been. I found that a bit odd.  They really let the teams play last night, and  I'm not sure if I like that.  Alex Caruso made a lay-up in the first half and got fucking clobbered - no call.  Jordan Poole tried to dunk it on Lebron in the second half and got fucking clobbered - no call.  If the playoffs are going to be called so differently from the regular season, I dunno. We'll have to see, but I don't think I like it."

"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.

"i think it's possible for someone to be naturally talented at something and put in enough effort to get so high up, and then not want to go the last few steps to become the best/better.  there's like 500 players in the NBA, and they're the best of the best in the world right? but then you look at the top players, take KD as an example, and he's so far above someone like alex caruso. he's decently above someone like AD who's considered top 15 by a lot of people. the difference between top 3 and 15th is enormous, so i can sort of understand someone getting there and settling, especially if it's on something like defence rather than an entire set of abilities."
alex caruso and fred vanvleet went undrafted that year lol
I mean Alex Caruso was a two way guy originally and started in the finals last year. You can definitely get something meaningful out of those spots.
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
Worked out for Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso with Alex's Caruso's D and Alex Caruso's **D**
"I'm so sick of Laker fans offering garbage for great players. ""I'd be okay if we parted with Alex Caruso and maybe a pick to sweeten the deal for Jimmy Butler."" Their hypothetical Lillard trades are a joke."
No Alex Caruso?
You‚Äôd get weird donnies like Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall in there.  Fan votes are almost never a good idea.
Not who you are replying to but I don‚Äôt see lebron and AD being healthy enough for another playoff run ever again. Meanwhile their second best player is‚Ä¶ Alex Caruso?
He had 16 points....  HE HAD SIXTEEN POINTS!!!!   alex caruso.....  UNACCEPTABLE.    üò°üò°üò°üò° ARGHGHHHHFHHGHHHHHHHH üò°üò°üò°üò°
"First: Every starter in every team. Most 2nd unit guys on any team. As for actual player names, for defensive play I would take a guy like Alex Caruso over Simmons. At least he frustrates the offense and draws charges. How many times does Simmons throw his body in the way and draw critical fouls? I haven't seen it. In offense, I would take a player like Dario Saric over Simmons any day. He takes 3s and hits them at a respectable rate. He attacks the rim and can throw down a dunk and get and 1 (and make it). He also moves away from the ball to try and space the floor,  meanwhile Simmons impersonated a statue on offense.   And for what's it worth, I don't think either of those guys are particularly good. But I would take both of them over Simmons. At least they don't play scared. And it's not just those two players, it's any typical bench guy that plays like them. Seriously dude, look at Ben's shot chart in the 2nd half this series. If you saw it, you would think you were looking at a 3rd stringers shot chart. Not a supposed all star.   And I am not even bringing up how much these guys are getting paid. If you made a cost to performance ratio of every player in the league, I would shocked if Ben wasn't dead last."
Like Alex caruso
"That settles it, best player in the NBA must be balding.   It's Alex Caruso."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
You named Eric Bledsoe and Alex Caruso bruh
Thats Alex Caruso money production.
Ben Simmons or Alex Caruso who do you take?
"If you really want to play the injury game:  Lebron had only played two games prior to the suns series coming off an injury two months earlier that takes 6-8 months to fully recover from.  AD Hyper extended his knee in game 3 after absolutely dominating in games 2 and 3, has to have it drained, can barely move in game 4 then pulls his groin, out for the rest of the series.  KCP, our best guard defender, injures his knee in game 3 and is out for Game 4, can barely play game 5 (15 mins).  Alex Caruso, our best help guard defender, has back spasms all series and an ankle sprain following game 3.   Our four most important players all suffered severe injuries. Schroder may or may not have had COVID right before the series as well.   I find it funny when teams struggle to admit that they won because of injuries. Raptors fans act the same way about their championship.  Both teams fully healthy Lakers take it in 5, 6 if they don't take a game seriously like they did against the Heat last year."
"Kuzma, THT, KCP, Harrell infinity loop second round picks, a bag of balls, a house in malibu, a tonal signed by alex caruso, and 25 free visits to UCLA Health for Luka ...   Who says no?"
Explain Alex Caruso
"Its soft racism. Not many people are calling anyone the N word here, but look at how this sub treats white players vs black players for example. Since we're on the topic of trae anyways ill use him as an example. Alex Caruso, balding white guy gets all the love because he looks just like an ""average joe"", at least thats what the excuse is. Yet young balding black star player trae gets shit on left and right. If anything Trae should be adored, hes everything alex caruso is but black and better. And even LESS athletic so he should be MORE relatable. Whats the difference between those two? If Trae was full white he'd be the most popular player in the league, guaranteed, especially after this playoff run  Thats one example but i can go on and on and judging by your flair i doubt we'll agree anyways"
To pick the next alex caruso or THT
"Chris ""The Caveman"" Kaman... If you only saw a headshot photo of him, you'd swear he was homeless. More unassuming than Alex Caruso by far, imo."
"Bench- Alex Caruso, kyle Kuzma, THT,"
"It's not just the ring but the exposure that comes with the ring. Like Alex Caruso probably doesn't get almost $10 mil a year if he played on a small market team tbh. Not saying he's not worth it, but just looking at his stats most people would be like huh this guy got $10 mil?"
"I was going to say the Bulls. With Zach, DeMar, Lonzo, Vuce, Patrick Williams, Alex Caruso.. that's an East playoff team, and should give other playoff teams a good challenge."
The goat Alex Caruso is 1960th with 5.9 ppg
Willing to spend the 10 mil on him vs. Alex Caruso would be a strange choice by the lakers.
Nah I was being serious lol. Like Alex Caruso said   &gt;That‚Äôs a big reason that guys get stuck in the G League is that they don‚Äôt understand the position they are trying out for. It‚Äôs like going to a job interview and thinking you‚Äôre gonna be the CFO of the company and they‚Äôre looking for a guy to clean the bathrooms [‚Ä¶] Guys in the G League try to average 25 points a game. They‚Äôve got guys they‚Äôre paying $30 million a year to score 25 points a game. It‚Äôs a self-awareness of understanding what you‚Äôre good at and what teams need and trying to do that.‚Äù
Alex Caruso sends his regards
Depends if I‚Äôm the gm or the coach  If I‚Äôm the gm I want Alex Caruso since he is so popular he would bring in more fans and more fans= more money but if I‚Äôm the coach I‚Äôm selecting Tj because he‚Äôs the better player
Alex Caruso got finals experience
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he‚Äôs traded for some defensive bigs because we‚Äôre in a bad position if we don‚Äôt get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
You‚Äôre kidding right? I can think of a few of the top of my head. You‚Äôre telling me when you Google Alex Caruso dunks you don‚Äôt get what you want?
"Google works great for superstars, but for example [Alex Caruso](https://www.google.com/search?q=alex%20caruso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=il:cl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwjY0cjvtJjyAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&amp;biw=1833&amp;bih=949) doesn't have any good action pics."
Always been a 6th man in my eyes. He was cocky thinking he was worth more than 84 million. Needs to realize hes not a star and accept alex caruso type deal.
"Anyone can win if they're on the right team. Hell, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma are NBA champions because they were on the right team."
"&gt;But the Lakers are seemingly not done with the Schroeder move wouldn‚Äôt that factor into the tax implications?  &gt;  The Lakers have Westbrook, THT, Ellington, Nunn, Bazemore, Monk, Ariza, Carmelo, Lebron, AD, Dwight, Gasol, Ayayi, and Reeves.   The last two are 2-ways, but they signed with the promise of time with the main team and that's 14 total players. If this isn't the final off-season iteration of the Lakers it's very close to it.  &gt;Also reminder that Lakers ownership is a group of millionaires not a billionaires like GSW and Clipps &gt; &gt;It‚Äôs all the same to people like you and me but it‚Äôs not to them when you are talking tens of millions.  That's the point, the Lakers may be an insanely valuable team, but their ownership group is not in the business of cutting fat luxury tax checks since the introduction of the progressive tax structure. It may not matter, but they could have paid Alex Caruso anything they wanted and they didn't keep him in order to save money."
"As of right now,  Alex Caruso  Coby white Troy brown jr Lauri Markannen Tony Bradley  Ayo"
"[Fivethreeeight projection based on 19-20](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/alex-caruso/)  [RAPTOR 20-21](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) literally has him at +3.9 on D, tied for 1st with Dort in guards.  I'm not claiming that he can shutdown Kyrie/Harden/KD (there's not many in the league that can); he is however the best defender we have on a team that was 3rd in DRTG in 19-20 and 1st in DRTG in 20-21, and Danny Green is the only one that came close in D-RAPTOR - defense is team effort, but given the same team as his comparisons KCP / Danny Green / Wesley Matthew / Dennis Schroder, (the Lakers, 19-20 and 20-21), the results are better when Caruso is on the court vs. when he's not, which also shows up on other metrics like DBPM, On/Off.  I think we can agree to disagree, meanwhile the Bulls are paying 37M/4yr so there's that."
You have the goat in Alex Caruso and he isn't in your nickname? God damn.
"No it's Alex ""Balls"" Caruso"
"Thaddeus can only play so many minutes. When he's not on the court, we lose his defense  Now we are set so that we can have 1 solid defensive wing on the floor at all times.  Backup centers? You mean Theis? He's the only backup center worth talking about that we lost.  Essentially, your entire argument is that DeRozan is so bad defensively that it outweighs gaining 2 good wing defenders.  2020-2021 Season  DeRozan Defensive Win Shares (DWS): 1.5 | Defensive Rating: 115  Alex Caruso DWS: 2.1 | Defensive Rating: 106  Lonzo Ball DWS: 1.7 | Defensive Rating: 113  vs  Thaddeus Young DWS: 2.2 | Defensive Rating: 110  Daniel Theis DWS: 0.7 | Defensive Rating: 111  I'm not seeing it"
"Oh I‚Äôm sorry, are you talking about Alex Caruso? The guy that averages a +20 in playoff starts and closes out a world championship every single time?"
"Alex Caruso and the lakers is like Delavadova and the Cavs, remember that they let him walk to MIL. I think it's LeGM calling the shots."
I miss alex caruso already extremely underrated.
Lol of course. No one is saying that they couldn't have had both.  But in reality very few owners open up a full pocketbook. Alex Caruso being on the 2021 Lakers isn't worth $100M of the owners cash or whatever it would have been over his contract considering the luxury tax. They have a realistic cap in their mind that is relayed to the GM so the GM did what was best for them by spreading that $10M onto four rotation players rather than one.  Not sure why you're pretending that a GM just has unlimited $ to spend.
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"Thanks for explaining this, The luxury tax is complicated.  You don't pay that much for Alex Caruso. He is worth 10mm to a team, not 45mm."
Hold on. You are seriously comparing Alex Caruso to Russell Westbrook?
The power of memes makes you into hitler if you decide not to give Alex Caruso a supermax
"I don't know how he (Caruso) didn't think he could make up the extra 2m from the kind of endorsements he'd get being a Laker vs. a Bull.   The Lakers determined what a player of Alex's skill level was worth and wouldn't pay over it. Alex found a bigger offer, and L.A. said take it.   Nothing wrong with this in my book."
7 million is way too little lol. Doug McDermott gets 14M a year and is a significantly worse player than Alex Caruso if you look beyond the most superficial stats like points scored per game.

I absolutely agree that Alex Caruso is the greatest NBA of all time
that title only goes to chicago bulls legend alex caruso
You mean Chicago Bulls legend Alex Caruso?
"It's not a premium. That's the point.   We're giving almost that much money to Zach Collins. The Nuggets are giving *more* to Will Barton. Alex Caruso is getting that kind of money. Kuzma gets more, and he's garbage.   He's getting a role player's salary, he's already proven he's a plus-defender, and I think he's going to keep improving since he's **twenty**"
&gt;Alex Caruso has a 54% TS% which is very good.  League average is 57% so Idk what you mean it's very good. Most people consider 60% and up very good TS. Certainly not 54 lol
People use true shooting to illustrate how good a shooter a player is and it often doesn‚Äôt work. Alex Caruso has a 54% TS% which is very good. Any Laker fan will tell you (my brother is a Laker fan and I‚Äôve watched a lot of their games) that Caruso was an ok shooter at best. Teams went underneath his screens and gave him room to shoot and he often was left open on rotations. The reason his stats look good is because he had good shot selection and he only would shoot consecutively when he was feeling it. TS doesn‚Äôt account for the fact he plays with 2 superstars that draw attention away from him. TS doesn‚Äôt account for the rotations he‚Äôs paired that may or may not leave him with open opportunities. He‚Äôs gonna go to a new team where he‚Äôs probably going to be guarded more honestly than he did in LA because there‚Äôs no AD or Lebron
Always hated the Lakers. Was lowkey rooting for them when they were led by Fightin Texas Aggie Alex Caruso the bald mamba. But now he‚Äôs moved on to further his career and become the greatest Chicago Bull
"Bruh, it's Alex Caruso."
Lavine isn‚Äôt close at all to the offensive playmaker Trae is and their best point of attack defender is Alex Caruso. Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre contending
"Nikola Vucevic yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Zach LaVine gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Alex Caruso yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before DeRozan hit the locker room door, former NBA great Joakim Noah hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"

"Caruso got left than the MLE. The Lakers wouldn‚Äôt even match the offer let alone give him more than that. Lol that‚Äôs disloyalty at its best.   You dumped Kuzma for Russell Westbrook. Kuzma would‚Äôve gotten that contract on any other team that drafted him, it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfat‚Äù contract. You keep calling these mediocre contracts ‚Äúfat‚Äù. You do NEED Westbrook. You just lost the first round and panicked. That‚Äôs why your roster is completely overhauled right now. Your team from this year and last year are completely different than the championship team.   Thanks for the long winded way of telling me what I already said. The Lakers dumped all their young players for Anthony Davis. BI and Lonzo only got paid as much as they did because of the strides they made with NOLA. Their reputations weren‚Äôt high when they left LA.   ‚ÄúYou find me another team who wouldn‚Äôt make that trade‚Äù Find me another team that doesn‚Äôt trade IT for Kyrie Irving. You see? You‚Äôre proving my point for me.   IT didn‚Äôt get paid before or after his injury because he wasn‚Äôt good enough to get paid that much. Either way he wasn‚Äôt getting paid.   Why didn‚Äôt the Lakers re-sign him after they traded for him the season after? Because he wasn‚Äôt the same player.   You just asked me sarcastically if the Lakers were supposed to over pay Alex Caruso because you had his bird rights, but now you‚Äôre implying the Celtics should‚Äôve given an undersized injured point guard a max contract instead of trading for Kyrie? Lol   AD‚Äôs father wasn‚Äôt right. If anything he exposed he‚Äôs a hypocrite. The Lakers dumped all their players for his son because he colluded with LeBron and his agency the year before and quit on his team. But yeah the Celtics are disloyal. It has nothing to do with just wanting to play with LeBron and be in LA. Definitely. Haha"
You forgot about the champion and laker legend Alex Caruso
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, and now Alex Caruso all we‚Äôre done terribly by the Lakers who dumped them the first chance they got to get a star. They probably did Caruso the worst.   Good job ignoring 5 of the 6 players you fucked over though."
He started for us in the finals. And THT isn‚Äôt even in the rotation yet. Caruso is one of the best defenders in the NBA according to basically all defensive stats.   I‚Äôm not saying Alex will be better than THT in 5 years. But if you had to pick one of them to put beside Lebron this year I don‚Äôt understand the THT pick.  The only explanation that makes sense to me was ownership simply wouldn‚Äôt pay the tax.
Is Alex Caruso expected to play defense for everyone?
"Def better than Alex Caruso at shooting however, similar 3P% but on double the amount of attempts."
"You‚Äôre right, how can they use the will of the D without the initial.   Alex D. Caruso coming to you soon"
Alex Caruso: a God amongst men
"Not spending 50M between salary and tax bills to keep Alex Caruso isn‚Äôt being a cheapskate. There are other owners as well and it‚Äôs a business that just lost two years of income. If it was a star I guarantee she makes sure it‚Äôs paid. And we got Howard, we don‚Äôt need Drummond."
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
Is it blasphemous to say I'd rather have Alex Caruso?
"Lonzo D Ball, Alex D Caruso, Patrick D Williams.  They all gonna die happy."
Alex Caruso. TAMU
Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan Nikola Vucevic Lonzo Ball Alex Caruso   Damn

Wait. Are you referring to Alex Caruso as a young star? I think you mean solid role player if that‚Äôs the case.
I don't understand of all the free agent news today why is the number 1 post Alex Caruso? Please explain
Random shitty lyrics I just came up with.   Drake voice    Told my city I neva leave Em: Antetokounmpo   Sometimes gotta throw it down in a new town: Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso
"37,000,000 / 4 = 9.25mil per year  after tax according to the free calculator i just found: $5,185,789 per year  after buying the 4bed 3ba house i saw on zillow ($325k) and then buying a new house every year: $4,860,789  $10k for food and $90k for candles: $4,760,789 per year  $4,760,789/$80 = 56,509 eighths, but we'll round it down to 56,000 and assume he tips.   56,000/8 = 7,000 ounces, or 198kg, which means alex caruso can now be arrested for trafficking"
"That's Chicago Bulls legend Alex Caruso, you mean."
"Nothing drives me more crazy, than losing average players, which is what alex caruso is."
Alex Caruso is the new Mike Bibby glad he got his
"Uhhh, I hate to break it to you but any team that spends 30m/year on Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso isn't competing for jack fucking shit."
"Alex Caruso leaving and the Lakers signing Mac McClung is the equivalent of a man (Lebron) divorcing his old washed up wife and marrying a younger, hotter woman."
And that's the last we hear of Alex Caruso
[Wojnarowski] Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso receives Michael Jordan‚Äôs blessing to wear #23 jersey in upcoming season
"Westbrook destroyed the cap, the Buss's aren't gonna go head first into luxury tax hell for Alex Caruso for four years."
Alex Caruso
&gt; you realize that we have to take back salary right? it's not just a free second rounder for sending him on his way? salary that the lakers just thought was too much for 10m a year Alex Caruso. If the player is useful to us then yes we   Isn't that what they have been reportedly trying to do all week?
you realize that we have to take back salary right? it's not just a free second rounder for sending him on his way? salary that the lakers just thought was too much for 10m a year Alex Caruso.
"What the fuck are the Lakers thinking, https://www.wsj.com/articles/alex-caruso-lebron-james-lakers-nba-playoffs-11600406618  Caruso is one of Lebron's best teammate ever according to the numbers, there's literally 0 reason not to bring him back."
"update: [you're wrong](https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/2021-nba-free-agency-live-updates-news-analysis-trades/Sv5IIlL9fSee)  &gt; When faced with the prospect of losing Alex Caruso, the 27-year-old guard whose Bird rights they carried and could thus pay whatever they wanted, they didn't put up any free-agency fight en route to him agreeing to a four-year, $37 million deal with Chicago. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, Caruso's camp went back to the Lakers after the Bulls made their offer and were told that there would be no counter."
"He will not make 20m/yr below is reasoning  Here's 5 relatively similar free agent's deals today:  Tim Hardaway Jr 4/74m - better then Oubre and proven fit w/ DAL, older  Gary Trent Jr 3/54M - Trent is better, younger, and more potential  Will Barton 2/35M - ~even, but older then Oubre and injury prone, also specifically fits really well with DEN when healthy.  Alex Caruso 4/37M - Oubre is better and younger (Caruso 28 wow)  Alec Burks 3/30M -Oubre is better and younger  So for 25 year old inconsistent Oubre with seemingly more potential to unlock, and GSW isn't totally convinced he fits in that well...  Oubre will not be getting 20M/yr. I see the Warriors low balling with the full MLE (~9M) (he'd likely do a 1/1+1 deal to prove himself for a bigger deal), or the Spurs/Pelicans/Thunder (only teams with capspace) offering a 2/22-28M deal (12-14M/yr) or 2+1 player option."
Bulls got Alex Caruso. They're having the greatest off-season of all time
Alex Caruso. Lakers guard.
lol the first thing that happens when garpax leaves is giving 100M to Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso. im sorry chicago
Alex MJ Caruso. The MJ is for Mac Jones
"you won the title with:  * Kentavius Caldwell-Pope  * Good Rajon Rondo  * Danny Green  * Kyle Kuzma  * Alex Caruso  Instead of those guys, you now have a 33-year-old point guard who relies on his athleticism and can't shoot, defend, or play off ball."
"Alex Caruso is the GOAT, I don't need stats for that"
That Alex Caruso is coming home to the goat's city of Chicago
the Alex Caruso/Lonzo Ball bromance continues
"For half a sec i thought it said Alex caruso to kings, phew"
The original Alex Caruso go paid!
"‚ÄúSQUAAAK  Don‚Äôt do it Alex! Chase the bag, I‚Äôll be ok!  SQUAAAK‚Äù  Final words to Caruso. A tear rolls down his cheek as LeBron RKOs a helpless bird. This, my friends, is the cost of free agency. One is never *truly* free."
"Role players get into plenty of local ads regardless of where they are. The only ""big"" ad he's been in is a Manscaped commercial. Which again, could happen anywhere with these random meme players that get popular online.   He's not in any national campaigns and that's the point I'm making. Regardless of location role players aren't going to get paid big bucks by any company advertising a product. Just because they have a Lakers jersey on doesn't make them inherently more valuable to these companies. It's about name recognition not team recognition. Kids aren't gunna see Alex Caruso on a box of cereal and go ""that's awesome, I want it!"" They only do shit like that for guys like Lebron."
Was that Alex Caruso from 0:23-0:26
The evidence that Lonzo Ball is better than Alex Caruso is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?????
"I'm not convinced that their defensive success towards the end of the season was sustainable, and I'm not so sure they got better on paper‚Äî replacing Thaddeus Young with DeMar DeRozan is a pretty big defensive downgrade in my book, and having watched Lonzo in New Orleans, I don't think he's the defensive stopper that people seem to think he is. Alex Caruso is a great pickup coming off the bench, though."
Do you mean Alex Caruso?
Alex Caruso ‚Ä¶ oh wait ‚Ä¶   Austin Reaves?
"The Ball bros.    Edit- Nvm that's prolly been done to death. What about someone like Alex Caruso, to see what happens after being a Lakers, like will anyone care about him at all?"
Alex Caruso and Lebron James had the best net rating of any duo in the NBA in 2020.  https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;GroupQuantity=2&amp;sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*500
"As expected from Alex ""Bathroom Cleaner"" Caruso"
Lebron is not the actual GM. He just made an instagram post last night calling Caruso a king. He loves Alex and it definitely wasn't his decision to let him go.
dirk was basically just a taller alex caruso with a better post game
hEs a mEmE tHoUgH   - every single /r/nba analyst ive had the pleasure of talking to about Alex Caruso over the last 2 years.
"People put a spotlight on Caruso for memes, true. But that spotlight allows peoe to see the little things and the hard work he puts in Everytime. It's in there, that the Caruso appreciation transforms from sarcastic to genuine. I hope one day Alex himself understands that."
Are u saying Alex Caruso isn't a superstar
"Im basically Alex Caruso with 0 BBIQ, less athleticism, worse shooting, and better celebrations."
Is every Alex Caruso highlight going to get this much attention?
"THT sucks and nobody would know who he is if he wasn‚Äôt on the Lakers, same thing with Alex Caruso. -r/nba"
Alex Caruso and Patrick Williams
Thank god I can like Alex Caruso now. He‚Äôs rad.
Alex Caruso seems to fall in the same category as Tacko Fall in terms of people getting excited about them even though they'll never really be more than small role players.
"You all thought we were just memeing. But now that he‚Äôs not on the Lakers, you‚Äôll all finally come to realize that Alex ‚ÄúHair Jordan‚Äù Caruso is the One True King‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
"""Is Alex Caruso good or is he a meme?"" is itself a meme."
Alex motherfuckin Caruso.
Hmmm...Andre Iguodala on when he was on the Warriors championship team. I thought he was like top 3 best swingman in the league at that time just based off of his impact on the team. You could also say Alex Caruso
I think you mean if you squint at Michael Jordan you can see an Alex Caruso
"Steve Nash was basically Alex Caruso with amazing BBIQ, less athleticism, and better shootingn."
So nothing like Alex Caruso?
ALEX MICHAEL CARUSO
He‚Äôs an less athletic Alex Caruso. But he‚Äôs a pretty solid shooter‚Ä¶doubt he gets many mins though.
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
Alex Caruso has left the chat.
you white? Then you Alex Caruso.
Alex Caruso is the indisputable GOAT we just don‚Äôt like to talk about it
Why do they hate Alex Caruso man
"Boobie Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic, Drew Gooden, Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, Matthew Dellavedova, Tristan Thompson, Timofey Mozgov, Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton-Tucker, Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope...  Be lucky to be a member of a LeBron team ---&gt; make three good plays in the playoffs ---&gt; get overpaid for those three plays ---&gt; never sign a big contract or play well ever again."
"Alex Caruso is going to make the ""he would have never been hyped if he wasn't on the Lakers"" people look stupid when his insane dunks get posted while on the Bulls. He's also going to make the ""he's a borderline NBA player, really overrated player"" people look stupid as he shows out as a key role player on the Bulls."
MVP - Giannis or Steph.   MIP - OG  DPOTY - AD  6MOTY - Alex Caruso  ROY - Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley
MVP: Luka Doncic  MIP: Killian Hayes  DPOY: Rudy Gobert  6MOY: Alex Caruso  ROTY: Ben Simmons (obviously)
Idk man I think it‚Äôs pretty obviously   5- Kobe 4- Shaq 3- Magic 2- Kareem 1- Alex Caruso
Alex Caruso
"We should start calling him Lex Caruso. Alex is such a lame name for a drug kingpin like him. Also, he's bald like Lex Luthor."
Alex Caruso   Lakers cut him for tax savings üò¢
"They tanked and got Alex Caruso? Kyle Kuzma? Talen Horton Tucker? Jordan Clarkson?  Just trying to figure out how those 4 players in particular fit into your bs narrative.   It‚Äôs also funny how one comment says you can‚Äôt count top picks, if they bust or not, because it‚Äôs consensus, and you say you can‚Äôt count them because they ‚Äútanked‚Äù.   Your insecurity is showing."
"People are going to be saying, ‚ÄúThis Trae Young guy, he‚Äôs looking like the next Alex Caruso, who famously averaged 45 ppg.‚Äù"
"&gt; Those who are down on Ben say things like ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt trade him straight up for Alex Caruso‚Äù  Surfing team subreddits, I can't tell you how many comments I've seen about how they wouldn't take ben simmons for free. What you're saying isn't even an exaggeration lmao.  My point was more about how people will upvote contradictory shit. I really don't think most fans know what to think about ben at this point."
"One‚Äôs more ridiculous than the other, though. The people who are still somewhat optimistic for Ben are like ‚Äúwell, look at his accolades so far in a relatively short career and his defensive ability is still worth a lot.‚Äù Those who are down on Ben say things like ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt trade him straight up for Alex Caruso‚Äù (an exaggeration, but not much of one).   One of these two groups is going to a far greater extreme."
Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball. However we're lucky enough to see them team up this season üôè
Do you think Alex Caruso only smokes weed in states where its legal?  I think we know thats not true from his arrest.
I‚Äôm sorry I saw Rockets flair and Alex Caruso and thought of that Rockets blogger that was so upset after Alex had 16 points
Alex Caruso
"But his ""cost"" to the Lakers would be around 30 million dollars in luxury taxes. That's why they didn't pay him. The ownership isn't as rich as the other teams by the way.

"People said that about Alex Caruso, we‚Äôre still hearing about him on Chicago"
"I just think it‚Äôs always incredibly anecdotal when talking about how ‚Äòbasketball fans‚Äô rate x player  Like you throw around terms like ‚Äòpeople think‚Äô or ‚Äòbasketball fans‚Äô like that means anything at all but it doesn‚Äôt. The entirety of ‚Äòbasketball fans‚Äô don‚Äôt have consensus opinions about anything. You show me 100 people who sleep on Vanfleet and I‚Äôll show you 100 people who would say he‚Äôs Steph 2.0.   Look up FVV current 2k rating. 1 point lower than Lowry‚Äôs current rating. Look at FVV contract, 12th highest paid pg in the league. That would seem to show that GM‚Äôs at least would rate him as an above average starting pg.  So like where‚Äôs the underrated part? I swear all these posts about ‚Äòx player is under/overrated‚Äô are just circlejerks where people can trash on whatever player is on the hot seat (Ben Simmons right now, Paul George last year, Russell Westbrook anytime) or where people can circlejerk about players that only they are smart enough to realize are actually good (FVV, Alex Caruso, Robert Williams, ect) and where they have to put down the filthy ‚Äòcasual fans‚Äô"

I‚Äôm not a dumbass bro I watch the league I know Alex Caruso earned his check as a consistent role player and Bulls fans are excited that they built a playoff team around Lavine. I also know that the Wiz fuckin suuuuuck and Bradley Beal isn‚Äôt going to make Kuz look like an NBA starter if Lebron couldn‚Äôt. Eat a dick
Alex Caruso
All I want is Alex Caruso
alex caruso
"&gt;Whether they‚Äôre cheering for me out of sarcasm or actual fandom or whatever it is, it comes with it‚Äù   I know that AC loves to prove people wrong, but I hope that he know that almost all Laker (and now Bulls) fans are cheering for him because of his selflessness, attitude, tenacity, IQ and hustle. LeBron didn't already ask for AC's jersey when the Lakers face the Bulls because it's funny. He asked for it because he respects and likes Caruso, and he knows what AC means to the Lakers. I also think that the majority of fans who follow the NBA, but aren't even fans of the Lakers or Bulls, now understand that he's a valuable role player.   During their postgame shows, Robert Horry and James Worthy have raved about AC for years. Horry has called Caruso ""my man ACFresh"" countless times. Vogel called Caruso ""an important part of our team who also happens to be an extra assistant coach."" As for Lonzo, he just called Caruso ""the perfect teammate.""   Caruso was so focused on the playoffs in the bubble that he simply sent his parents a short text telling them that he was starting game six. His Mom admitted that she felt slightly nervous when she found out that news, but Vogel said that he wasn't a bit nervous because starting AC was his checkmate move against the Heat. AC went out there and proved that Vogel was right.   If people are cheering for AC due to sarcasm, then they're underestimating him, and all that seems to do to give him more power.   &gt;‚ÄúI was a little surprised it was as loud when I first came in. I would like it to be a little more warranted with some success and winning. But hopefully we‚Äôll get to that point.‚Äù  Oh, just shut up, Alex, and just accept that fans love watching you. Well, most fans do anyway. There is this one podcaster in Houston..."
can't wait for the multiple alex caruso vs tj mcconell showdowns
Alex Caruso is an NBA player  Guess you gotta stop watching basketball
"When I see an NBA meme, first thing that come out of my head is him, Alex Caruso. Lmfaoo"
"Alex Caruso is a gift. I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs off the Lakers and in the East so I can really root for him. As a Sac fan, I remember watching him in summer league, when he still had the combover, the dude is just effective. What a win for Chicago"
Accordingly to Lakers fans the next Alex Caruso
"Dont forget Alex Caruso, Nikola vucevic, and pat connaughton"
I'm building my team around Alex Caruso but 3 inches shorter
"They couldn't have paid both and not be in the tax, so they had to choose one.  THT being younger and having a higher ceiling played a factor, but I think him being Klutch and not getting any outside offers forced LeBron's hand.  FWIW Caruso has more years but is being paid less than THT.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/chicago-bulls/alex-caruso-21076/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/talen-horton-tucker-31605/  This is the Klutch Tax at work"
Steve Blake was exposed to a moon stone and evolved into Alex Caruso
"The PJ Tucker and Alex Caruso situations were such gut punches.   You always want players like that to get rewarded - did everything right and sacrificed everything for the team, resulting in a Championship.   But then to see the owners cheap out over the luxury tax, it's honestly kind of heartbreaking, on a human level, to see the players treated like trash."
It‚Äôs impossible to like basketball and not like Alex Caruso.
"Until I see more from Caruso, I‚Äôm not ready to call him a 6th man. Coby has filled that role at different times before. You look at the construction of the bench and it seems more designed to benefit Coby than Alex."

"Serious question, how good will Alex Caruso be if he can create his own shot and has consistent finishing ability?"
"Sekou Doumbouya is the prototype of the ultra-talented player who will not be able to make a career in the NBA because of a bad mentality and a very poor work ethic. Talent is important, but there is no substitute for a strong work ethic and motivation to succeed.  I have a good example in mind here with Alex Caruso. He is not as talented as some in the NBA but his motivation to progress, his work ethic, and his intelligence in understanding his role have made him indispensable.  Doumbouya is not capable of that. He will return to Europe and probably France.  But if he doesn't change his mindset, he will have a hard time making a long-term professional career even in France."
A spectacular move by alex caruso!
Alex Caruso with the Alex Caruso switch hands up and under finish.

"okay i get the joke you're trying to make but have some respect for my team and for the GOAT.  and by the GOAT i'm talking about Alex Caruso, the greatest guard to ever play for the Chicago Bulls"
Alex Caruso is so godamn fun to watch.
Alex Caruso with the 10 and 10 too. I predict 5-4th seed for this bulls team
"I love you Alex Caruso, have fun in Chitown &lt;3"

"Alex caruso, and i honestly belive he could average 25 with more usage"
"yup, more people can recognize alex caruso off the street than domantas sabonis. That says it all"
alex caruso is oldder than giannis
Listen to how you sound rn lmao in my original comment I said it was unlikely but you really think Kevin porter going in to his third year improving his APG by 3.7 is  just as unlikely as Alex Caruso winning mvp ? or u/spinexel dating PRIME Jennifer Anniston ?   Like come on ‚Ä¶ one is clearly more likely to happen than the others lol
You're arguing on the technicality that KPJ averaging 10 ast is not technically impossible then might as well say Cavs winning the championship next year is not technically impossible either lol. Or Alex Caruso winning MVP. Or Lebron coming out as trans. None of these things are technically impossible but just insanely unlikely
Alex Caruso and it‚Äôs not even a discussion
Thank goodness Alex Caruso was available to help
"If people knew how to actually fight through screens, Curry‚Äôs ‚Äúgravity‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be so effective. G-league player Alex Caruso caused multiple key turnovers during the play in game because he isn‚Äôt a bitch who switches instantly"
Having ‚ÄúAlex Caruso‚Äù as your badge is one of way
Alex Caruso is better than MJ
You forgot a major goat in Alex Caruso
"Michael Jeffrey Jordan was 6-0 in the finals. SIX AND O! Never seen anything like it. Alex Caruso is DISQUALIFIED from the GOAT conversation because he lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Phoenix Suns. I mean, seriously? The Phoenix Suns? Michael would've beaten that team with both hands tied behind a chair. You know it, and I know it."
"I'll be that Lakers fan who raves about Alex Caruso, the numbers back it up that he's an elite defender. I am excited to see both him and Lonzo on the floor together locking up opposition guards.  Don't know about how bad defensively the rest of the roster is, but Lonzo and Alex are elite defenders who play the right way offensively."
The Alex Caruso slander is unreal /s
alex caruso is so corny . I wish he wasn‚Äôt on the bulls cause I like the rest of the team
"Very few stars end up on the bench holding a clipboard and some of the best coaches were former role players rather than alphas, therefore I present for discussion:  Alex Caruso."
"Alex Caruso being such a defensive juggernaut has masked the fact that he's posted a team high 20.6% TOV rate this year. He's not a backup PG, and the Bulls really do need a backup PG. the team has a lot of undersized SGs but not real backup PG for when DeMar is off the floor (and no Coby is not a PG, he's one of the undersized SGs.)"
Alex Caruso out here like Steve Blake
Lakers really chose Westbrook and renaming Staples over Alex Caruso
They posted Alex Caruso doing the exact same thing to Steph during the bulls game.
"From Amick's article in The Athletic they did: ""When faced with the prospect of losing Alex Caruso, the 27-year-old guard whose Bird rights they carried and could thus pay whatever they wanted, they didn‚Äôt put up any free-agency fight en route to him agreeing to a four-year, $37 million deal with Chicago."""
"Alex Caruso. Used to think he was just another mediocre white role player hyped up by Laker fans and suburban teens as a meme. And maybe he was a bit of that at a certain point early in his career. But as he got more playing time, he just made more winning plays. Started to realize he was actually a good NBA player around the bubble season."
"Looking back at that 2016-17 OKC roster now is pretty funny. A rookie Sabonis, Oladipo, Alex Caruso, a young Doug McDermott and young Jerami Grant.  In fairness looking back, a lot of their young players have gone on to be pretty good."

"This is a homer take. Dude, look at your record. Playing guys like Bazemore is part of why y'all suck. Your FO chose to spend the money on Westbrook and use the rest on end of the bench guys, except now they have to play actual minutes. Bazemore ain't good and he shouldn't really be playing minutes against DeRozan, but yeah, who else are you gonna have out there, Buddy Hield and Alex Caruso?"
No. But Alex Caruso will.
"Alex Caruso the best PF in the league? Also, is DJJ the best back up center in the league?"
"Lonzo appalled, Spalding Ball, balding, Alex Caruso taking balls from y'all"
Alex ‚Äúfaustus‚Äù caruso
"Caruso:  0 points   1 shot attempt   \+28   LeBron [Tweeting him](https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1460487931982856199), basically during the game.   It was just a normal night for Alex Caruso."
Alex Caruso has obviously ascended beyond this little chart. If he tried he would average 65/20/20/10 steals/ 7 blocks
You just know r/nba was getting ready to shit  all over the Lakers if Alex ‚Äú0 points‚Äù Caruso had played better than THT lol
Alex Caruso should be above MJ to be honest.
Alex Caruso is 2-0 in games he has started as a PF
"After watching Lonzo, Brandon, Josh and Alex today and in previous games this season here is my ranking of the 2017-2019 Lakers ""core""  Brandon Ingram  Kyle Kuzma = Lonzo Ball  Alex Caruso = Josh Hart"

Way to ruin Alex Caruso night
Alex Caruso
I feel so fucking justified in Alex Caruso getting the love he truly deserves by fans around the NBA now that he isn't on the Lakers. Our FO are dumb as fuck for lowballing him that hard.
The lakers had Alex Caruso.  Now they‚Äôre out there looking for players like Alex Caruso.
"I 100% agree with you on literally everything you said. He should have 100% been compensated more. I‚Äôm just explaining why Alex Caruso was willing to take an unfair pay cut that underpaid him, because he probably loved his time on the lakers."
"Can confirm, I ""hated"" KCP, Kuz, and Alex Caruso.  Now that they're no longer on the Lakers? let's fucking go."
"Is Alex Caruso an all-star now, writing that like there is some huge difference between the two is delusional."
"Lol and we're happy to have you. I came from the opposite direction, lifelong bulls fan who never though Alex Caruso was anything more than a serviceable role player who's perceived ability was inflated by playing next to LeBron. I've never been happier to eat crow"
What do you mean??? They just wish *thugs* like Trae Young would be more classy like Alex Caruso.
....So you think jeanie telling the other buses that there lakers profit/salary would effectively be slashed by 30-50% for alex caruso is a conversation they want to have? Lmao. Delusional.
*Anything* could be in the box - it could even be another Alex Caruso!
... I mean why would you spend 3.4% of your net worth for 2 years of Alex Caruso?
"For context, Alex Caruso lead the Bulls in minutes played last night (one more minute than DeRozan and Lavine). The Bulls defeated the Clippers."
"It's also worth noting that it's not as if the Lakers had already given him a bunch of money and ""taken care of"" him previously.  His first couple seasons he made the two-way minimum, which is normal person money, and then he made $5.5m over two years. They wanted a guy they hadn't really paid yet to give them an enormous hometown discount even as they rewarded THT for, well, nothing really.  Caruso helped them win a title and the Lakers were like, ""Ehhh, we're gonna give your money to this inefficient chucker on the off-chance he might end up being as good as you already are, Alex."""
"Lebron also knows the difference between Mickey Arison and the six Buss children. A $30million luxury tax bill could cut their annual income *in half*. And again, these people might still seem exceedingly rich to you, but they are dirt poor in NBA owners circles. And Alex Caruso is probably not worth  half their income to the Buss family.   Source: McMenamin on latest Windy podcast."
"OK, I get ""it"" as the true implication is that Alex Caruso is a scrappy hustler-style player who MAY potentially be over his true salary number. BUT, Horton-Tucker COOOOULD be a person who is underpaid at the end of their contract.   Basically a Jeremy Lin 2.0 situation where Lin was hot shit until he got paid....and then frankly fell the fuck off.   The issue is that Alex has since went to Chicago and balled the fuck out and looks very natural in his role, so now the Lakers look like fools for letting go of a role player who would have just made the Lakers charge say $3 more a seat for season ticket holders to ""make it work"".   Silly shit"

Alex Caruso.
gg to the best team Alex Caruso has ever played on
"DeMar DeRozan is an offensive weapon.  Alex Caruso with team-high rebounds, and tied for both team-high assists and steals. Does all the little work."
Alex Caruso has never lost a game in the Staples Center
Alex Caruso has never lost a game where he starts at PF
yup definitely a good time to be alex caruso
When do y‚Äôall think we will see a 6‚Äô10 &amp; up defensive stopper on the perimeter as well as interior ?   I‚Äôm talking like visibly great ..like imagine a big Alex Caruso but with a post presence   As much as the game has involved in regards to player types I‚Äôm surprised one of these tall junkyard dawgs hasn‚Äôt emerged  Big men are getting notably quicker moving laterally so idk how this hasn‚Äôt come to light   Bam? Perhaps .. but I don‚Äôt see him clamping ppl like Giannis
"We also drafted Reaves who has an incredibly high BBIQ, great defensive instincts and can shoot it from three albeit he‚Äôs much less athletic than Caruso.    I didn‚Äôt want to see Alex go but THT has way more upside so you have to roll the dice on the guy with the higher ceiling.  Toss in the fact that they scooped up a kid who looks like a Caruso replacement minus the high fly act and you can see why the Lakers did what they did.  We haven‚Äôt even seen Nunn hit the court during the regular season yet too."
who the fuck needs alex caruso at that price when you can have monk on a vet min.  in pelinka we trust
"I think it's a 3 guard, small ball unit with;  Jalen Brunson Tyler Herro Alex Caruso Cam Reddish Precious Achiuwa (now that he's coming off the bench)   Most of these guys could start on many teams and have shown that. They also play as closers frequently.   As a Spurs fan I had to stop myself from putting Devin Vassell in there for either Brunson or Caruso (although he might play his way in soon at this rate)."
"When was the last time Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso guarded a top center well?"
"Jordan isn't even one of the top 5 Bulls let alone top top 2 players in NBA history.Maybe he is at best a top 10 bull  Derrick Rose is 1,Alex Caruso is 2,Jimmy Butler is 3,White Mamba is 4 and Reggie""Coach Fuller"" Theus is 5"

You realize that LeBron is the cause of this ‚Äúdumpster fire‚Äù right? He and AD balked on the Hield for Kuzma trade to target Westbrook because they wanted that third star on their team - despite Westbrook being well‚Ä¶himself.  No doubt LeBron and Klutch are also  heavily influencing management on how valuable THT really is when in reality not packaging him for Kyle Lowry and forcing ownership to penny pinch on Alex Caruso are clearly huge mistakes.  If this season implodes it‚Äôs squarely on LeBron who pulled the strings on most of the trades and FA acquisitions.
I‚Äôm sorry lakers fans for ever doubting Alex Caruso
"My dad only really watches national games with us, so this is his first this season and even he was like ‚ÄúHow could the lakers let Alex Caruso go?‚Äù"
tonight's card is Gary Payton II v.s. Alex Caruso.
"James Worthy has said on several occasions that Alex Caruso is the best defender he's ever seen. I'll trust the hall of famer on this one, thanks."

"Sir Alex ""*His Goatness*"" Caruso *would like a word.*.."
I‚Äôm enjoying Kyle getting a chance to shine a bit with the wizards. Just like getting to see Alex Caruso tear it up off the bench for Chicago.
"Alex Caruso- 49.2%, 40.7%, 86.4%. 1st &amp; 2nd in the league in steals and deflections respectively. AC is quietly going fucking mental"
The new new Alex Caruso
And they say Alex Caruso is elite at deflections!
"I'm a Wolves fan, and I knew they won the trade the second it happened. I don't care about Wiggins vs D'Lo, I think they're both overpaid glorified role players and I'd take Alex Caruso over either of them, but adding a first round draft pick w/ minimal protections was absurd.  The only people I've seen trying to justify the trade is other homer MN fans."
you did not just call alex caruso a star
"&gt;2). Austin Reaves, LAL - 34.9%  &gt;10). Alex Caruso, CHI - 37.9%  suck it Laker haters"
"Austin ""Alex Caruso"" Reaves"
"Man they could really use a scrappy guard that can make plays, idk someone like an Alex Caruso."
"I am not a basketball fan, honestly cannot tell you that I‚Äôve watched a full game in the past 5 years. The only player that I follow is Alex Caruso. I caught a bunch of his older hustle videos and I, like everyone else, was blown away but what he could do. Anyways it‚Äôs awesome seeing how far he‚Äôs made it and I‚Äôm rooting for whatever team he‚Äôs on."
Alex Caruso is not better than Michael Jordan. It is close tho.
Alex Caruso on the bulls is a breath of fresh air
"Got a white-skin friend look like Michael Jordan, got a black-skin friend look like Alex Caruso."

Alex Caruso is Mike Bibby's love child
"Caruso was called into the game. He pulled his crew socks up as he readied to enter the hardwood but he mindfully made sure he didn't pull them up that high. ""Not that high"" he thought to himself as he remembered all the times the kids made fun of him on the playground when he wore his white socks up to his thighs.  He pulled down his headband and it stung a little as it pulled on the prickly hairs of his near-bald head. ""My time"" Alex thought.   He pulled up for the three pointer and it was perfection. Nobody could stop his motivation now. He was the greatest version of himself and he wanted the world to see."
Alex GOAT caruso has entered
Alex Caruso!?
Which team has Alex Caruso?
"Boban, Kelly Olynyk, Alex Caruso, Frank Kaminsk . . ."
"1. No, there's nothing wrong with being an elite athlete, but relying entirely on your athleticism over improving your fundamentals makes you predictable, and predicable players get shutdown in the postseason.  There are all sorts great players that come from different molds from Jokic, to Curry, Lebron, Kawhi. Embiid, etc.  The one commonality between all these players is they have deep tool kits, allowing them to beat you in a myriad of ways, WB is just a one trick pony, and its a good trick, but not good enough to make a deep playoff run.    2. His defense is the same as his offense, entirely reliant on athleticism, with poor fundamentals, he makes flashy play but get beat way to regularly, most top guards are wayyy better defenders than WB, which is sad since he has significantly better tools than most of them  3. Within the NBA ecosystem there are a variety of different types of role players.  Some are purely one dimensional guys, spacers like Korver or Mcdermott, defenders like Thybulle, they have one elite skill and are meh at everything else.  Others have 2 skills they excel at, 3&amp;D players like Danny Green, Alex Caruso, etc.  Still others are multi dimensional role players, like Andre Iguodala, Aaron Gordon, etc.  WB turns all role players into one dimensional tools, which if youre a one dimensional role player is great, but if you have more to your game it hurts those players ability to contribute by crowbaring a round peg into a square hole (see Oladipo's and Sabonis's growth after they left OKC).    4. Sure but WB takes it to another level, dude hunts Triple doubles.  There is no rebound myth, lmfao WB collects tons of ez defensive rebounds rather than leaking out so his bigs can pass him the ball to start the break.  You can easily inflate assists, just run low percentage actions off P&amp;R, EZ.  5. Ah yes the KD choked narrative, lets look at the final 3 games of that series  Game 5:   KD: 12-31, 40 pts, 7 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 3 TO's, -4  WB: 11-28, 31 pts, 7 rebs, 8 assists, 5 steal, 1 block, 7 TO's, -9  Verdict: they either both choked or both played meh  Game 6:  KD: 10-31, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 2 steal, 3 block, 3 TO's, -6  WB: 10-28, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 9 assists, 4 steal, 0 block, 5 TO's, -11  Verdict: once again they both chocked, but WB def chocked the game away turning the ball over 4 times in the final 2 mins  Game 7:   KD: 10-19, 27 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 2 TO's, -4  WB: 7-21, 19 pts, 7 rebs, 13 assists, 2 steal, 0 block, 3 TO's, -14  Verdict: WB chocked  WB chocked 3 out of 3 games, KD chocked 2 out 3.  Also just for fun Wb career playoff stats  106 games played, 24.8 pts, 7.7 A, 7.0 Rebs, 1.8 steals, .3 blocks, on 41/30/83 splits, with an eFG of 44.4.  6. 2011 playoffs, game 5  OKC vs. Denver, KD definitely didnt carry his ass.    KD: 14-27, 41 points, 5 rebs, 2 assist, 1 steal, 2 blocks, 0 TO's,   WB: 3-15, 14 points, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 0 blocks, 3 TO's  7.  Really?  Then how were the Spurs so successful? or the Mavs with Dirk?  or the early 2000's Pistons?  Or the 2012-2016 warriors?  There are plenty of teams that found postseason success without multiple superstars.  Virtually every WB centric team has catered to his needs and its proven not to work.  If he needs such a narrow team construction that its virtually impossible for a GM as good as Presti to build around him, maybe he just isnt that great of a player."

Alex Caruso is going to have to carry Lebron yet again.
For real. No way Lakers can trade for Lavine without having our offer centered around Alex Caruso
"&gt;League executives also mentioned Bruce Brown, Alex Caruso, Talen Horton-Tucker and Nerlens Noel as players who could be in for significant raises averaging above $12 million per season.  Shit! I am afraid to see what Tim Hardaway is going these guys are getting above $12 million."

I have never seen alex caruso make a three with my own eyes
Trae Young  Alex Caruso  Lebron James  Other balding NBA player  Cody Zeller
And don't even THINK about complaining about Alex Caruso. I learned that one the hard way
It matters for other reasons‚Ä¶ namely using Bird Rights to retain Alex Caruso.
"Lol I know that literally no one wants to hear this in the NBA fandom because billionaires lul, but 12 Million in luxury tax is absolutely insane because Luxury Tax is a progressive tax.  Let me use this example, let's imagine the Lakers are right at the luxury tax line, and literally the only person they need to sign to go over is Alex Caruso. He signs for $12 Million.  for first 5 million dollars, they pay 7.5 million. For second five million, they pay 8.75 million. For the last two million they pay 5 million dollars.  So all in all, you just spent 12 +7.5 + 8.75  + 5 = 33 million dollars to hold on to Alex fucking Caruso.  And keep in mind, this is assuming Alex Caruso is the only dude you're signing that is costing Luxury Tax. You guys are already at $131,666,854 payroll next season with just your big 3 and luol Deng. This means that pretty much every player you sign after this will be luxury taxed. Lakers could easily spend far enough into the luxury tax where a 12 million dollar contract actually costs 50-60 million, and Jeanie Buss is by no means a particularly rich owner compared to someone like Ballmer."
Alex ‚ÄúWinter is coming‚Äù Caruso
"Not just that, but from [B-Ball index](https://twitter.com/Tim_NBA)  &gt;Alex Caruso was the most impactful PG last year on D by our math, had A Matchup Difficulty &amp; A- Defensive Versatility grades, and based on how lockdown he is on-ball &amp; off-ball. He had an A Passing Lane Defense grade &amp; an A- Pickpocket rating. Held opponents below expected % at the rim as a guard &amp; had an A- DReb success rate +/-.   &gt;   &gt;He's also solid 1v1, but there are so many other important parts to defense he excels in"
Wait...  Is King Lebron  And  Saitama  Alex Caruso?
[Here's Caruso](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/alex-caruso/)
"Brian Scalbrine, Alex Caruso, Jared Dudley and Javale McGee  Fight me"
Avery Bradley is not better than Alex Caruso lol
"No need. Lakers just inked a deal with [the white Alex Caruso, Mac Mcclung!](https://imgur.com/o9BxSAT)"
"The money being committed to those three players doesn't matter though, the Lakers were going to be over the cap anyway, adding Westbrook didn't change that. They'll have to fill up their roster, of course, but they already should be the favorites to re-sign Wes Matthews, Markieff Morris, Alex Caruso, and Talen Horton-Tucker. They will probably get something for Dennis Schroder in a sign and trade, and then after that they'll have the MLE and vet minimums to use for the remaining 3-5 roster spots."
alex caruso
"What's the all-time dunk record, because Alex Caruso about to rewrite the history books"
"&gt;Obviously I was speaking outside of Lebron and AD.  And you were still wrong, despite your furious backpedaling.  Gasol shot 41% last year.  They will almost certainly [re-sign Caruso](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-confident-alex-caruso-re-signs-in-free-agency-because-he-loves-playing-with-lebron-james-per-report/), who also shot 40%.  Hell, McKinnie shot 41% too!  So of the 5 the Lakers have, plus Caruso, three shot 40+% last season and none of those three are Lebron James.  In other words, it would've been difficult for you to be more wrong, or more ignorant.  &gt;Yup, having five players under contract with no assets or cap space.  Meaning whatever their roster eventually looks like, you were talking completely out of your asshole."
I believe the DM from Alex Caruso is the real prize here.
Dammit this team is going to be a nightmare to defend. I mean you can't double AD or Westbrook cause that will just leave Alex Caruso wide open every time.
"Can't they still retain Alex Caruso, Wes Matthews, Morris, THT, and McLemore?  I think they can also still S&amp;T Schroeder. They have the MLE, the vet exception, and vet minimums."
"Russell Westbrook yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Anthony Davis gave a look of pleasant surprise. Alex Caruso belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúWhere is everybody?‚Äù"
how tf is it 'up in the air'  you think the kings want alex caruso and THT?  with their 3 top players all being guards current? fr?
"It will be really interesting to see how the Lakers fill out the team. They already have above average 3-point players in Wes Matthews, Alex Caruso, and Marc Gasol, all of whom could potentially start depending on who else they pick up. Here are some of the players I'm guessing they try for:  Buddy Hield (3-team deal, sending out Schroder as a sign and trade)  Laurrie Markannen, (sign and trade Schroder)  Danny Green (MMLE or vet min)  Carmelo Anthony (MMLE or vet min)  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, this is a bit of a replication of the LeBron Heat team. You have two athletic wings who thrive on driving to the basket, and a big who can pop and shoot. Of course LeBron is not the same player he was back then, and Westbrook is no Dwyane Wade --- but AD is much better than Bosh on both offense and defense, but the style of play may be similar, with the Lakers having two wings who can relentlessly attack whether they are both on the floor at the same time, or individually.  I was not a fan of bringing Westbrook to the Lakers, but LeBron and AD were obviously in favor of it, and I assume they know what they are doing. If the Lakers can still add a couple of shooters, as I expect they well, this is on paper the best team in the Western Conference (pending further moves by Golden State)."
"Tell that to the two-way GOAT, Alex Caruso."
How much help does Alex Caruso need?
"No one is saying what he did is some great thing. Theyre saying man, that‚Äôs sad he lost his life so young. No one is claiming he was perfect in his actions before death but with the way some of you are acting in a thread like this is acting like the title is ‚ÄúCOMPLETELY INNOCENT ANGEL TERRENCE‚Äù no it‚Äôs simply showing respect to the young man that lost his life. He didn‚Äôt kill a family. People make mistakes and while I understand what you mean, I‚Äôd be willing to bet half the NBA has worst in their past. Man was 20 years old. People make mistakes and a lot of times way worse than speeding, man.   We don‚Äôt need a thousand closeted resistors to come out about how evil of a person he was for not abiding by the speed limit and admittedly being stupid by running a red light and how he probably would‚Äôve murdered hundreds if he was still alive. It wasn‚Äôt minor but it isn‚Äôt this major family murder that you all talk as if it was. You can‚Äôt go off what if‚Äôs that hard, if you could we could be talking about ‚ÄúWhat if Alex Caruso is a major drug lord because he was arrested for weed and that‚Äôs pretty bad‚Äù. Yeah like it‚Äôs possible that could‚Äôve happened or could be the case but it‚Äôs not what we know so we aren‚Äôt talking about it. And I‚Äôm aware there are much better examples I could be drawing but the point is: you don‚Äôt need to tarnish someone on the basis of a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario.  No one in the thread came out claiming he was innocent or claiming he didn‚Äôt make a mistake. But people did come with the understanding that he‚Äôs human, a majority of people who drive go over the speed limit at some point, and at the end of the day it‚Äôs not the worst mistake to be made. Like another dude said, he just wasn‚Äôt able to come back from his. Everyone makes mistakes and especially when giving the chance and his is by far not the worst mistake a person has or will make in the NBA or anywhere else in life. He just didn‚Äôt live."
Alex Caruso bitches
Another Alex Caruso!
"We need to keep in mind that because of Kuzma's poison pill status this trade can't be executed until August 6. On top of that, the Lakers and everyone else are prohibited from even talking to Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker until free agency opens (see the Bucks-Kings disaster from last year). Given all that I think it's a good bet that this is not the final form of this trade (we already saw Washington move that pick, that will probably just be included in this trade). We could see Buddy Hield still get traded to the Lakers with any of those free agents the Lakers have being signed and traded elsewhere, or we could see something else. We shouldn't be thinking about it like this deal is done and now what are they going to do. Westbrook is gonna be on the Lakers, but the other stuff could very much still be in flux."
Wait we‚Äôre getting a second Alex Caruso?
Why would it be the end of the Alex Caruso era if we can pay him? This guy is talking out of his ass
"I want to point out what the absolute max the Lakers can pay some of these guys would be:  * Wes Matthews - $4,347,600 (using non Bird rights)  * Markieff Morris - $10 million (using early Bird rights)  * Andre Drummond - $5.9 million (using MLE)  * Ben McLemore - vet minimum  * Dennis Schroder - 5 year max starting at 30% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Alex Caruso - 5 year max starting at 25% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Talen Horton-Tucker - full MLE (Arenas limited restricted free agent using early Bird rights)  These guys won't all get the max the Lakers can pay them, of course, but this is how they can fill out the rest of their roster even if they have LeBron, AD and Westbrook."
"Why would the Lakers do this trade? To have ""drive and kick"" players you have to actually have someone to kick it to. That person should not be... *checks notes* Alex Caruso."
Alex Caruso Russell Westbrook and LeBron James will carry the shooting for LA
Dennis Schroder or even Alex Caruso is better for that.
Alex Caruso
*Alex Caruso nods*  A OK
"It's a little delusional.  JTA is great, pure hustle, and very smart. He's like a less good Alex Caruso. Nico Mannion was literally unplayable outside of garbage time or due to injury. Bazemore is okay. He's a mediocre 8th man off the bench. Damion Lee is Tyrese Gibson/Roman Pearce from Fast &amp; Furious. He's not very good, but he's here cause he's family.  Our bench is not great. Unless you count Looney or Oubre (assuming we force Wiseman to start with Klay/Curry/Wiggins/Dray). Looney is a godsend, any team would be lucky to have him. But he's not anywhere close to a star. Oubre is an athletic headless chicken with hops"
"1994 Finals - 5.6 ppg  1995 Finals - 7.5 ppg  Alex Caruso in 2040: ""I should have been a Top3 pick in my draft"""
Would you not want to add Alex Caruso here? He's better than these guys and he was on a cheap contract last year. I'd say that with how he's been negotiating his contracts he could potentially go to another contender for cheap but that's just my gut feeling.  Great write up otherwise.

"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivaca Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Alex Caruso üî•"
"If you has asked a more absurd question, like, '*Would  Alex Caruso would be as good as Jerry West if dropped into the 60's?'*, about half the sub would be in agreement. But because it's Jordan and 80's/90's basketball you are going to get shit on.  Despite the predictable response, this is a legitimate question. Comparing players against different levels of competition is hard - comparing players from different eras is nearly impossible. You would need a scout to really analyze their film to even take a shot at it."
Alex caruso
I didn't bring it up.  Here was the conversation:   &gt;He would never pass a drug test   &gt;It's okay Alex Caruso wont either  That person above me who brought up Caruso is making a joke about him getting busted with weed like a month ago.
"The first time I saw Alex Caruso play I thought ""That dude looks like someone who is very obviously selling heroin at the train station while thinking they're inconspicuous. """

"You can say that about every player LeBron‚Äôs ever played with. AD, Wade, Bosh.   Except Lakers Legend Alex Caruso."
Lonzo and Alex Caruso are going to be scary backcourt when both are out there at the same time.
"So someone said how getting role players in exchange for Simmons would be wasting Embiid's prime. You responded by saying that Caruso, as an example, was at one point viewed as a role player. So you think trading Simmons for Alex Caruso would be a good idea and a way to not waste Embiid's prime? In general you're also just making a lot of typos and not fully fleshing out what you're trying to say. Maybe you have a good point, but it's incredibly unclear."
"Alex Caruso, and rightly so."
Alex Caruso for life
"They have developed players though, they just didn't have time to see it through because of injuries + Lebron/AD forcing a trade greatly accelerating the timeline.  BI went from legitimately looking like a bust to averaging 20/6/3 the second half of his final year. Julius put up one of his most efficient years ever (16/8 in 27 minutes). Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, and Alex Caruso all became solid rotation players. Other players like DLo and Lonzo just kept getting sidelined by injuries.  Not to mention the Lakers developing two of the rawest prospects ever in Kobe and Andrew Bynum."
"Fr, have one tier with all NBA players in it. At least then, guys like MJ/Kareem/LBJ can be in the same convo as Alex Caruso."
"Have you been watching the NBA recently? It's pretty clear that Alex Caruso is the best bald player the Bulls have ever had. The second best is a tie between Jordan and Scottie Pippen, if he was bald, according to Scottie Pippen."
You mean Alex Caruso
"Yup you‚Äôre absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
Brian Scalabrine and Alex Caruso top 1
"I love how other fans are butthurt thinking that it‚Äôs just about ‚Äúbuying other players.‚Äù   It‚Äôs so much more than that.   The Lakers‚Äô most beloved superstar of the last three decades was a drafted player. Sure, they didn‚Äôt directly drafted them. But they targeted him as ‚Äútheir guy‚Äù and arranged for his acquisition through a draft swap.   Any team can just buy superstars. And doing that isn‚Äôt always the answer. Simply buying Kyrie or Westbrook leads you nowhere. Still, if you have cap space, you can approach any available player and say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs fuck loads of money.‚Äù Does being in a big market help? Sure. But New York and Chicago are big markets. They‚Äôve sucked mostly my entire life. Boston is a big market. They have 1 championship in I think the post-Reagan era. The Bay Area is a big market, and the Warriors sucked until 6-7 years ago. Plenty of other big markets stink or have dry spells. Point is, a team has to sell more than just location and market. You have to be a well run organization, have good ownership, a good coach, a good bench, good role players. That‚Äôs how you really attract players. Being in LA or NY is just the icing on the cake if all things are equal.   If it‚Äôs as easy as just buying players, then why did the Lakers suck for 5 years with prime Kobe, and suck again for another 6 years between Kobe and LeBron? Failing to attract any superstars despite just being able to buy superstars? It‚Äôs because the team was poorly managed. And couldn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbuy superstars.‚Äù They tried. But their players were awful. And nobody wanted to play for them.   Also, the Lakers‚Äô other best stars recently have been acquired through trades. Shaq and Gasol. You can‚Äôt make big trades if you don‚Äôt have assets. Which means that you need to draft desirable talent and develop them so that other teams will want them. Accrue draft picks that other teams want. Still have to be a well run organization to pull off a trade to give you the chance to sign the big superstar.   Lastly, the Lakers recent championship teams, besides being led largely by a guy drafted by the organization, and obviously stars like Shaq and Gasol, that‚Äôs still not enough to win. Players like Derrick Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Trevor Ariza, old Rondo, Alex Caruso, etc. were all critical to those championship teams. Literally would not have been won without them. And they are the products of good drafting and good scouting and good management who targets these guys on the market and in the draft.   The Lakers aren‚Äôt good because they‚Äôre in LA or rich. They‚Äôre good because they‚Äôve largely been an extremely well run organization.   Like the Warriors are now. And like the Bucks are now. You don‚Äôt have to be a flashy team with big money in a big city to win. You can be San Antonio, or Milwaukee, and run a damn good team that players want to play for. The Milwaukee team is stacked. And that‚Äôs because they drafted well, developed well, and put together a team that other players wanted to play for.   Do you really think that New Orleans and Charlotte and Minnesota have been bad just because they‚Äôre smaller markets? Never mind that they also have money to ‚Äújust buy stars‚Äù, they also completely squander the stars that they do get gifted through the draft. They hinder their teams with bad coaching hires. They blow opportunities by reaching for guys in the draft or overpaying average players. What has happened in Milwaukee and Golden State could be done by Minnesota. Or New Orleans. Or Charlotte. They‚Äôre not capped by geography or money. They‚Äôre capped by bad or cheap ownership.   The idea isn‚Äôt that you **have** to be LA to get stars. The idea is to **not** be New Orleans and botch literally every move you make after having Davis and Zion fall in your lap. The team is run like shit. It‚Äôs not a money or stars or location problem. It‚Äôs an organization problem. And there are awful organizations all over the league. In all sports. The Pittsburgh Steelers play in a pretty damn small market, with shit weather, in a random city. And yet they win year after year. Same goes for the St Louis Cardinals. Same goes for San Antonio for 20 years. You can find examples in any sport.   If New Orleans had built a good team around Davis and the team went on to win 60 games per year and attracted neutral fans with a fun brand and competed for titles every year, they‚Äôd attract quality players. Just like Milwaukee has.   And you could say the same for any scrub franchise around the league.   Nine times out of ten, a team is shit because they have bad ownership, a bad GM, and bad scouting. Not because they‚Äôre in a small market. That‚Äôs just an excuse to overlook the fact that an organization is run by clowns who use the small market teardrops to try to excuse their awful draft picks, their crippling free agent contracts, their rubbish coaching hires, and their subpar scouting.   Yeah, the Lakers have money to buy superstars. But they need to be well managed to begin with to attract them. When that‚Äôs not the case, the Lakers spent 6 years whiffing on literally every free agent that walked through their doors. If they were lucky to get a meeting at all. It doesn‚Äôt matter what market you‚Äôre in, how big your TV deals are, how large your fan base is‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre not a well run organization to begin with, you have no chance.   So it‚Äôs a lot more than just ‚Äúbuying superstars.‚Äù It‚Äôs only a truth that fans of shit teams hate hearing."
Alex Caruso must have ptsd from that shit
You have to remember that Alex Caruso is on the team
Alex Caruso
"It‚Äôs really up to Frank Vogel. I think those end of second and fourth quarter rotations he rolls out can help the Lakers overcome and survive Westbrook‚Äôs wild and inefficient play. I like Rondo, but they should‚Äôve went for a younger backup PG who could offer them something on defense ‚Ä¶.. like Alex Caruso."
Lakers didn‚Äôt wanna pay him lmao now they‚Äôre seeing the consequences. Caruso &gt; THT. Fuckin FO didn‚Äôt wanna trade THT for big booty. Lowry-Alex guard rotation woulda been nice
"their team might actually have gotten a lot worse by losing PJ tucker  he's not a big scoring guy but he's just so impactful in so many other ways on the court  maybe he's more important to winning than anyone thinks, even if he's not as flashy as giannis or khris  they lost their alex caruso or gary payton II style dude who just wants to fight on defense all game and be a ballhawk"
"i think alex caruso did time in a texas jail, he's pretty tough"
Bulls GOAT is either Brian Scalabrine or Alex Caruso. Bulls Melo a distant second. Smh.
Qwhite interesting that almost all the top comments I've seen so far are defending a super dangerous cheap shot like this.  Can't imagine what it would have been like had Trezl done that to Alex Caruso in the same situation
Vooch? - you're forgetting that Alex Caruso will be an all-star this season
Ok I like Alex Caruso but I looked on twitter and holy shit he's picked up some really racist fans.
Knicks on a Sunday  We do not look interested in playing in Sundays and I think the next Sunday game is against the Bulls. Alex Caruso is dropping 56 on us.
"Alex ""not a robot"" Caruso."
"It depends on if the robotic players can get close enough to a charging station. A bout a third of the players are synthetic today, either based off soviet tech like sabonis or various elements from Northrop Grumman. Fleshjob players can get antsy, time travelers just think it‚Äôs funny. So the only human player left, Alex Caruso, is a small sample size. Great question."
That‚Äôs where all the problems lie. They chose THT over Kyle Lowry and Alex Caruso. No pressure THT but he better win MIP or something lol.
"Heat lakers and raptors are the best at getting unknown talent I feel like, maybe throw the warriors in there too. I think it‚Äôs super underrated part of competing is getting undiscovered dudes that will fit your system, cuz u can pay them very little and they will be very productive for the price at least on their first contract, ie; Alex Caruso, FVV, Boucher, DRob"
"What everyone fails to remember is that had they done the Lowry trade, the only guards on the roster would‚Äôve been Kyle Lowry and Alex Caruso. You‚Äôre not winning a Championship with only 2 guards.   P.S. I was not a fan of the RW trade, would‚Äôve much rather had Buddy Heidl and kept KCP instead of trading for Russ."
Alex Caruso a beast man. Also like how Lonzo has evolved.
Westbrick for Alex Caruso
I remember when he was averaging 27 points and 6.8 assists on like over 60% true shooting and didn't get all star because guys like Alex Caruso were ahead of him in fan vote and the coaches always refuse to pick him. Even though he was a top vote getter by players every year.

Alex Caruso would politely disagree
"I guess you don‚Äôt understand how the salary cap works. The Lakers were not hard capped this off-season meaning there was not a strict budget on their cap situation. Also they had full bird rights to Alex Caruso. Meaning they could pay him whatever contract they wanted to, and it doesn‚Äôt affect the ability to sign other players to the roster. But because of luxury tax reasons they chose not to offer him the same money as Chicago did. They chose the cheap way out, because they didn‚Äôt want to the pay the luxury tax associated with his contract. And even if they didn‚Äôt want Caruso they could have pursued a sign and trade that could‚Äôve resulted in assets coming back in a deal, but they mismanaged the deal. Now they have nothing in exchange for Caruso, when they very easily could have signed him back."

I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."

Why are we playing tall Alex Caruso this much?
"This bulls team is just a combination of players that are not proven outside of the regular season and their 3 best players ultimately will need the ball in their hands down the stretch in order to be effective. Zach Lavigne has never even been on a winning team his whole career so I think the assumption that he‚Äôll take the leap, while possible, makes the bulls an easy team to sleep on. People citing defensive metrics and whatever forget the fact that it‚Äôs only 6 games into the season, yeah they came out hot but down the stretch of the season when injuries pile up and more teams get their schemes in order, I don‚Äôt see the bulls making that much noise. Lonzo ball and Alex Caruso are not enough together to anchor a defense, and I don‚Äôt know how the bulls will ever hope to stop someone like giannis or Joel embiid. So yeah, I think everyone‚Äôs high on the bulls because they started 4-0, I‚Äôll be more interested in evaluating them once they drop a couple of games and face adversity to see how they‚Äôre responding."
"&gt;The difference between Caruso and Reaves is Caruso would have been out injured in three of their six games   &gt;   &gt;I feel like Reaves is holding back.
