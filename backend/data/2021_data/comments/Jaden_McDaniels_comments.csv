"I believe they do. ANT, KAT, DLo, and Jaden McDaniels are the future of this organization. Couple that with Beasley, a proven 20 PPG scorer who can either be a lethal 6th man or a trade piece for an athletic defensively sound rim protector, and Leandro Bolmaro, our third first rounder this last year who shows promise, and you have something there. Not to mention Finch has show real promise as a savvy X’s and O’s guy who’s got a good coaching background and a capacity for leadership."
Why don’t we admit it’s too close and give it to someone else. Someone totally random. Why don’t we just give it to that Jaden Mcdaniels guy
"i was taking mainly the best 2 players because if i start nickel and diming every injury you got the fact that beasley has missed over 30 games now, and its much easier to see the impact when you stay looking at the top of the team's pecking order. I can argue that ""of the games jaden mcdaniels missed we probably win 2 more with him there"" but thats not nearly as arguable or important as ""the team plays better with their 2 best players healthy""       Like i said before, i have 0 problem with Lamelo and think if he stayed healthy and stayed consistent or even improved somewhat he'd have it locked up, i just take exception with the ""efficiency"" and ""contributes to winning more"" arguments since the game tape of edwards directly contradicts them"
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"Who is he replacing on this list: Ball, Edwards, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, Saddiq Bey, Quickley, Okoro, Bane, Cole Anthony, Campazzo, Stewart, Jaden McDaniels, Wiseman. He’s gotta be better than 4 people to make it"
"All offense no defense? Aren't they 25th in offense?  Looking into it I guess they are 11th post AS break, that's pretty solid. Lots of shootouts.  Big fan of Jaden McDaniels so far though, dude has all the tools to become an elite defender. And I love watching Jarred Vanderbilt on defense too -- if only he was able to hit more than... \*checks*... one three in his entire career holy shit"
They aren’t wrong either lol it’s just been terrible decisions after terrible decisions. Just this last decade they had a bright future then flip died and they gave thibs the job and he traded half their future for a rental in Jimmy and then Jimmy tanks his value and trashes the franchise on his way out and they don’t get proper value for what he was worth. In the end it kind of worked out because they were able to turn Jimmy into Roco who turned into Beasley Juancho and Jaden mcdaniels who’s looking very promising and they ended up getting Anthony Edwards. This might be the beginning of something new for the Timberwolves
1: Anthony Edwards 2: Naz Reid 3: Jaden McDaniels   ...then burn the list
It's Jaden over DLo as an asset.  30/30 teams would take McDaniels on a rookie deal.  Can't say the same about DLo contract.
All of the teams in your top 5 would rather have Jaden McDaniels.
"It really is absurd.  Starting with the 2016 class, wroten, thybulle, Isaiah Stewart, jaden mcdaniels, jalen nowell, Markell fultz, marquese chriss..."
"We are already the youngest team in the league, and have promising players on the roster already. Having a big 3 of Kat, Dlo, and Edward's is a great core to move forward with. Throw in guys like Beasley, McDaniels, Naz Reid, and potentially a Mobley in the draft and were cooking. Rebuilding the right way takes time, and with our play recently on the court, you cant say the Timberwolves are an easy win right now. I'm looking forward to next year with the improvement of Edward's and Jaden."
"Put some respect on Jaden McDaniels my man, he’s one of the best defenders in the class and already becoming one of the better defenders in the league. KOC was hyping him as a top 30 defender just last week."
TIL: Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people
Jaden McDaniels 1 through 5
Jaden McDaniels
All this applies to Jaden McDaniels as well.
Jaden mcdaniels
"I’m sorry, Jaden McDaniels is unbeatable"
Jaden McDaniels and Josh Okogie have been very nice in that role.
That settles it. Jaden Mcdaniels ROTY
Jaden McDaniels should 100% be on that list. 36.7% from 3 on just over 3 attempts a game and is by far our best defensive player.
My guy Jaden McDaniels about to be on this list once we go undefeated next year
Here's a couple ok rosters  &amp;#x200B;  JM  PG - Ja Morant  SG - Jamaal Murray  SF - Jalen McDaniels  PF - Jaden McDaniels  C   - Javale McGee  &amp;#x200B;  DG  PG - Darius Garland  SF - Danny Green  SF - Danilo Galinari  PF - Draymond Green  C -  Daniel Gafford
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
Jaden McDaniels is the steal of the draft. Idc what anybody else says. Only one you could argue with is Saddiq Bey
"that's a lot of money and value for a bench piece. Probably best to trade him for a great PF.  If everything works out the ideal starting lineup is:  D'Lo, Ant, Jaden McDaniels, PF, KAT.  Tho keeping him could work too if there isn't equivalent value for the PF"
Jaden McDaniels 2025
Jaden McDaniels for 2025
"Two Jaden McDaniels, one starting and one off the bench and we're a playoff team."
Jaden McDaniels is going to be a star in this league. Mark my words.  No hyperbole. No cap. STAR.
Jaden McDaniels but in the 2nd half
...Jaden mcdaniels
JADEN MCDANIELS IS AN AMAZING DEFENDER AND I LOVE HIM
"Jaden ""Kevin Durant"" McDaniels"
JADEN MCDANIELS
There arent many for us. I guess the Vandolorian for Jarred Vanderbilt.  And then we have The Big Mac for Jaden McDaniels because JMac was taken
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."
"Jarred Vanderbilt and Jaden Mcdaniels those two got a lot to improve. I just don't know why your defense sucks. But I'm sure next season you will be in the playoffs.  Towns,Edwards,Rubio,Russel and Beasley wow"
What about “timberwolves’ small forward Jaden Mcdaniels has a great defensive prowess” ?
Jaden mcdaniels looks like he could be really really really good
"As a husky fan I can add to this - the huskies were coming off a surprising NCAA tournament appearance the season prior and despite losing Matisse Thybulle among others from that team, they were bringing in arguably their greatest freshman class ever highlighted by Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels, and expectations were high.  They ended up having no chemistry whatsoever the whole season and while Isaiah Stewart put up numbers (he was first team freshman all Pac 12) the huskies finished 5-13 in the conference.  Despite averaging 17 and 8 as a freshman, I think there was a realization amongst scouts that he probably wasn’t gonna be the type of mercurial talent to carry a college let alone nba level team to success as the best player, which I would honestly agree with.  What he can be though is an extremely valuable part of an nba roster that could easily start on a playoff caliber team."
Maybe something with the Washington program because Jaden McDaniels stock fell a ton as well
"Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, and Jaden McDaniels are three guys who are regular staples of the rotation now that really only got their run because of injuries (Naz probably would've gotten some regardless, but the other 2 only got some because of injury/absences), and have kind of proven to us how disposable some of these middle of the rotation guys (Juancho, Layman, Vanderbilt, Culver) will be in the offseason"
"I don’t know about the whole NBA, but on the Timberwolves it’s Jaden McDaniels.  After a slow rookie start, he shot .383 from 3 with a .600 TS%.  He was the best defensive player on our team, and that’s saying something with Josh Okogie.     He was a top 5 rookie post all star and is going to be a 3&amp;D menace for the next 15 years and people are acting like he’s a nothing bench prospect.  Every Wolves fan has him pencilled in as our long term starter without any hesitation."
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
"Most Wolves fans are realistic that there's no Simmons deal straight up. It will need to be a three team deal, where we send Beasley to Philly,  future assets +/- young prospects like Jaden McDaniels or Naz Reid to the third team, and the third team sends another good player to Philly.   The raptors, sending Lowry to Philly via sign and trade, is the most realistic possibility.   Philly gets an all star level point guard and another high level movement shooter to put around Embiid, Toronto gets assets for Lowry (who may be leaving either way), and Wolves get Simmons."
"1. Beasley is not in jail  2. Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are both really good players on rookie contracts, both are guys who can be in the rotation of a championship winning team (McDaniels is honestly good enough to start on a championship team)  3. The team has every pick besides the one this year. Considering you can offer picks up until 2028 right now, the team could offer a max of 4 unprotected first round picks and three pick swaps right now (although that'd be a massive, massive overpay for Ben lol)"
you forgot jaden mcdaniels
"I and most Timberwolves fans are expecting a big jump next season. If they're not at least competing for the 10 seed, I'll be disappointed.   When KAT and DLo were finally healthy post ASB, they were above .500 (I don't remember the exact record). They finished the season 7-5, with two wins against the Jazz and one against the Warriors. Ant averaged 27-5-5 on 40% 3pt shooting the last month of the season, KAT looked as good as ever, and DLo looked muuuuuch better after his surgery.   If they stay healthy, I really see no reason they can't go .500 on the season. And if Ant and/or Jaden McDaniels take a big step forward, that could elevate them even further."
Lakers:  Russell Westbrook/Klay Thompson/James Harden/Kawhi Leonard/DeMar DeRozan  Clippers:  Dejounte Murray/Kevin Porter Jr./Zach LaVine/Joe Harris/Jaden McDaniels
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."
Jaden mcdaniels doesnt have the hype nor is he playing at the level of a consensus number one pick tho.   Obviously chet will more than likely be a plus defender. Whether or not he can use his frame to dominate the same way he does in high school is another question.
"i think i heard this rationale about jaden mcdaniels last year after we drafted him.   ""too skinny, is just gonna get pushed around""  All he does is come in and be a high level impact defender from his first game in the nba."
Oh yes I'll take one Jaden McDaniels pls
"I know the Ben Simmons rumours have been non-stop, but what do you think a fair trade package would be?  I reckon Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Ricky Rubio, 2022 2nd (via either 76ers or Nuggets) and 2023 lottery protected 1st would be more than reasonable. Philly get their pass first point guard, a scoring wing and a combo of prospects and picks.  Starting line-up of Towns, Simmons, Okogie/Culver, Edwards and Russell is pretty decent and a low seed playoff squad for sure."
"&gt;What do you think they're depth chart is right now? For me it would be: Towns/Reid Vanderbilt/Juancho/McDaniels Beasley/McDaniels/Culver Edwards/Russell/Beasley Rubio/Russell  * C: KAT/Naz/Vanderbilt  * PF: Vanderbilt/Jaden McDaniels  * SF: Jaden McDaniels/ Okogie / Culver  * SG: Anthony Edwards / Beasley / Nowell  * PG: D'Lo / Rubio / Bolmaro  As the roster is now probably this.   &gt;I'd be pretty keen to either get off Russell (more than Beasley or Rubio), but I'm not sure he's destined to be a starter in Minnesota  Won't happen because of KAT and the optics of trading him now."
"lmfao you’re writing off injuries completely because they lost one game to a team with injuries? guess the utah jazz were shit then since they lost all 3 games to the wolves.   kat and dlo played like 5 games together out of a possible half a season after the wolves traded for dlo. kat then had to deal with another long term injury this season, as did dlo, and kat also lost 6 family members to covid. you think the wolves were in a position to perform at their best when one of their best two players are constantly hurt and even when their best player was healthy, was struggling with grief and depression? he even said he wasn’t focusing on basketball at all. also love how you cherrypicked the ant+kat/ant+dlo minutes because ant was actually healthy all season. can’t do that with dlo+kat, their two best players, so you had to pick someone else.   a healthy wolves team can make quite a bit of noise next year. dlo, ant, kat, beasley, jaden mcdaniels, naz reid, rubio are all quality rotation players and the first six all have room and time to grow, plus they have a competent coach and gm for the first time in ages. actually watch them play next year, you’ll be surprised"
"There were a lot of issues and that was definitely the biggest one. Next year, it’s time to show up or trade everyone but Ant and Jaden McDaniels."
Jaden McDaniels (hopefully the Timberchickens will trade him to a team who will develop him)
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
May I introduce to you one Jaden McDaniels
"Saddiq Bey. No Homer either. He’s going to be a 20 ppg scorer easily at some point. Has one of the best three balls in the league. Also, has defensive potential.   Other two picks are Poku and Isaiah Stewart. Jaden McDaniels could interesting down the road too.   Last year’s draft was good man.  Don’t feel slighted if I didn’t list your rookie here. I like Quickley, Maxey, Hampton too. Just a deep all around class."
Big fan of Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels. McDaniels in particular has a lot of skills that could keep him in the league for a long time
Jaden McDaniels
"&gt; Snyder joined most of the Jazz’s front office in being frustrated by the selection of Udoka Azubuike with the team’s first-round pick in 2020.   Anyone know who the Jazz wanted instead? The players picked after him were Jaden McDaniels, Malachi Flynn, &amp; Desmond Bane. Xavier Tillman in the 2nd round would have been nice next to Gobert or as a small-ball center, as well."
Pretty much because we dont HAVE a decent PF. Jaden McDaniels is more a 3 which leaves Juancho and Vanderbilt at the 4 at the moment
Jaden McDaniels.
jaden mcdaniels underrated
"Maybe Beasely, Rubio, Jaden McDaniels and picks ?  What those picks are would be the question mark to be negotiated over."
PG: Simmons  SG: DLO  SF: ANT Man  PF: Jaden McDaniels  C: KAT
"I’d take him on the Wolves as long as it doesn’t involve KAT, Ant, or Jaden McDaniels. We have plenty of offense, but we need some defense."
"I think the Wolves absolutely would. We need a 4. We also dont need him to score for us. Our play this year has seen all defence no offence from Vanderbilt and Jaden McDaniels at the 4.  And if we manage to trade Rubio, Beasley and a protected pick for Simmons we can slide McDaniels to the 3"
Jaden McDaniels you just don't know it yet
Jaden McDaniels please? Thanks
"That pick already happened, it was Jaden McDaniels."
Jaden McDaniels had a great 2nd half to the season too. So the question is.... why wasn't that Washington team better? I don't watch Pac10 at all to know...
"So the third team is Facu, Peyton Pritchard, Cole Anthony, Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, pretty much"
Jaden Mcdaniels robbed unironically
Man jaden mcdaniels was so good dude. I'm not overestimating when I say he was legit locking up guys like luka and harden. And he was hitting shots too
Definitely up there. I’m a homer but I’ll throw the wolves out there as well; Ant could be a star and Jaden McDaniels is looking like a good 3 and D guy at least. We still have Bolmaro coming over from Barcelona too.
"Wouldn't give up KAT, Ant, or Jaden McDaniels for him.   After that, sure I guess."
Jaden McDaniels will be a high end 3&amp;D combo forward and the type to make an ASG as an injury replacement.
"We keep:  * KAT * Anthony Edwards * DLo * Jaden McDaniels * Malik Beasley * Naz Reid * Rubio * Juancho  Honestly, any 2 of Rubio, Juancho, Vando, and Okogie can be kept, I just chose these 2 out of price."
"There are quite a few Seattle area guys in the league.  George Karl helped create the high level AAU scene in the early 90s, and the area has been creating NBA guys regularly ever since.  Murray, Zach Lavine, Avery Bradley, Kevin Porter, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden McDaniels."
"Jaden McDaniels, already the best defender in his 2020 draft and his instincts are unmatched. This guy was ranked as a Top 10 Prospect in his 2019 HS Class.   I really believe he could have a chance to just explode onto the seen as one of the most elite 2-Way players in the league."
"You forgot Jaden McDaniels, Leandro Bolmaro, and our savior who will lead us to the promised land, Naz Reid."
"Excluding the Knicks... I'd say Dillon Brooks, Shai, Jaden McDaniels"
Jaden McDaniels has been considered the steal of the 2020 draft
To be fair Jaden McDaniels is p solid / good
"Leandro Balmaro, jaden mcdaniels, and anthony edwards will form the next super team in the west"
Patrick Williams is like Jaden McDaniels. Which is okay expect one went fourth and the other went twenty eight.
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
Jaden McDaniels is playing but I wonder if Anthony Edwards will? I don't think he's going to get much benefit from playing against rookies and G league guys.
Here's my top 5 protected when taking contracts into consideration.  1. Karl Anthony Towns  2. Anthony Edwards  3. D'Angelo Russell  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Malik Beasley
This man thinks we wouldn't protect jaden mcdaniels
Jaden and Jalen mcdaniels are gonna be defensive forces for a while
"Jaden McDaniels probably the least represented rookie in the league and he puts up some really solid numbers sometimes.   ""PF Jaden McDaniels: vs Pelicans - 20 pts, 4 reb, 2 stl, 3 blk, 8/9 fg, 4/5 3pt in 26 minutes""  He's got a bright future on defense and offense."
"Indiana may be without Brogdon, Sumner, and Aaron Holiday--three strong guards with different skillsets. If they do play, they may be rusty with the time off. Charlotte will be without a Martin, but Jaden McDaniels is a solid defensive wing who won't be asked to do much more than contest shots and rebound.   Without Myles Turner, the Indiana defense is absolute dog doo-doo. This game will be close. Sabonis is too much for PJ Washington, and if PJ isn't making Sabonis work on the defensive end, Sabonis could be in for a big game. The Hornets enter this game on a losing slide, but they've been playing teams better than the Pacers. I expect the Hornets to win this game. If they don't, Caris LeVert or Sabonis shoot over 60% and Charlotte turns the ball over too much."
"This is a horrible list and I can tell u haven't watched most of these rookies. Like wtf is Jaden McDaniels doing at #6 like he is a pretty good defender, but in no way is he the 6th best rookie."
I’d appreciate a little more love for Jaden mcdaniels
"I watched all of his games in Timberwolves uniform. Culver does not possess even one good NBA quality. He cannot shoot (even FT), cannot consistently finish through contact, not a good playmaker, may be decent (??) cutter. His defense is fine but not something extraordinary. About success in tanking teams - despite being one of the worst teams last 2 seasons Timberwolves never tanked. Started last season 10-7 and tried to win games after Dlo trade, this season everyone was injured (chance for Culver to step up) and eventually the team started to play well with Culver out of rotation.  Edit: Culver has had tons of chances. We tried him as primary PG, SG next to ball handler, SF, he even played 4. He was a starter, bench player, everyone. Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels and even Jaylen Nowell somehow used their chances and became consistent rotational players. Culver is literally the worst player in Timberwolves right now."
"I apologize, but who's your third &amp; fourth big? Ed Davis? Juancho? Jaden McDaniels? I just couldn't see putting KAT/Naz + two of the above three over any of the groups listed (although maybe I'm a casual)"
"I think the Wolves would match up decently against the Mavs, seems like Jaden McDaniels frustrates Luka. Porzingis and Towns cancel each other out. Other than the Mavs and Jazz I don't see the Wolves beating the others unless Ant makes a huge leap next year."
"Just learned there's a Jaden McDaniels and a Jalen McDaniels  I was like ""wasn't this mf cooking the Wizards in the 1st half earlier today???"" even got similar hair lol"
"It doesn't make Minny look good, but the element of luck for you to land him.  He was supposedly not interested in Minnesota, and he didn't try out with us.  Jonny Flynn had a great Tournament run (also remember we had an insanely incompetent GM in David Kahn, who was someone who wanted to make a splash, and thought Rubio was that splash).    We also had our GM/Coach DIE on us shortly after drafting KAT.  Who knows what Flip could have done with Wiggins/LaVine/Towns  Absolutely agree with you on the last part.  How can we as a fan base trust anything any management does after something like that, though!  We've been pretty lucky with Rosas gnabbing Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro in this years draft.  I truly think we as a roster currently constructed without those players would have been doomed.  Now we got to make sure we build with these 3 at the forefront.  I am a Minny fan that doesn't think KAT is a first option yet, and probably will never be."
The audacity to throw Naz Reid in there over Jaden McDaniels
"&gt;You might not know it given the Minnesota Timberwolves' thirst for potentially available power forwards, but Jaden McDaniels is pretty darn good.  The Wolves are looking for Power Forwards because McDaniels is (likely) going to be the starting Small Forward."
"Detroit rookies were playing great for their draft pick number. Saddiq Bey as the 19th pick had the same amount of triples per game as Luka and Lillard in their rookie years with better percentage and more attempts (crazy when the season was shorter). And Isaiah Stewart as the 16th pick was the rookie who had more rebounds and blocks and it's not even close - Stew had 86 blocks, while Jaden McDaniels had 60 as the second rookie with most blocks; and he had 453 rebounds while the second best rebounder Jae'Sean Tate had 374.  Not knowing these guys doesn't make you a casual, but you're definitely not invested on how the rookies are doing. It's not even your fault because regarding rookies the media only cared about Lamelo and don't give a shit about Detroit."
Let the jazz throw in Joe Ingles and get Jaden McDaniels+ in return
sga donovan rj jaden mcdaniels mitchell robinson
Except for Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels.
"What is the wolves best package for another star?   Bev, Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Okogie?   Who does that get that the Sixers want? And then the wolves roster is shallow as fuck it just doesn’t make sense to me"
I read it as Jaden McDaniels and was really confused for a sec
Bro jaden mcdaniels
Jaden McDaniels got snubbed
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
"Even KAT has more than half his three’s classified as uncontested. For guys like Lopez and Embiid it’s under 1/4 threes that are being contested. You’re right I didn’t think about cross-matching but even if you put your 4 in the corner that leaves Zion with single coverage against a center in the paint which is a quickness mismatch and would result in a bucket more than 62% of the time.   I’m saying if nobody is coming out to contest KAT half the time already when they’ve got Jaden McDaniels in the paint, they’re going to leave him open much much more often if Zion is in the paint. That will result in good offense 100% but solely in terms of spacing I really don’t think there’s more than a few centers in the league that would create a significant increase in open looks/single coverage for Zion in the paint. Certainly not ones that NOLA could trade for."
"Add Patrick Beverly and Tauren Prince that when mixed with ANT +(DLO, KAT, and Jaden McDaniels) creates a talented mix of offense, spacing and defense.. depending on lineup (plus Okogie, Vanderbilt, and Knight who are high energy D guys too)"
Culver is more of a 3 tbf. But he was behind Okogie and then Jaden McDaniels/Ant Edwards
Na his defence is still fine. And he can playmake a bit. But he was a black hole on offence.  At the end of the day he was completely redundant to us when Josh Okogie and to an extent Jarred Vanderbilt do the exact same things as Culver but better. We couldnt have 4 bench guys all incapable of scoring. And thats why Jaden McDaniels and Jaylen Nowell both got chances ahead of him
"&gt;Philadelphia gets:  &gt;Anthony Edwards &gt;Malik Beasley &gt;Jaden McDaniels  This has to be trolling, right? Nobody is this dumb."
I’m not even a twolves fan. But jaden mcdaniels has a special place in my heart.
I don't think this is the kind of stuff you're looking for but....  KAT isn't the tallest player on the Wolves. (According to one of our reporters). It's Jaden McDaniels.
Ant and Jaden McDaniels would like a word
Atleast you guys have jaden McDaniels.
"No team hits on all their picks. Rosas drafted Culver, Jaylen Nowell, ANT, Leandro Balmaro, and Jaden McDaniels. picked up Naz Reid as a rookie FA signing. Only 1 of those players looks like a wasted pick so far. Jaden is out playing his draft position and ANT is everything that could be expected of a #1 pick."
Jaden McDaniels is a very good defender and Josh Okogie is pretty good outside of they they don’t have any defenders KAT the last couple years has improved and after their coaching change KAT was guarding the perimeter more and looked pretty good but still wouldn’t trust him to be an above average defender
"I really couldn’t care less about Cade, Mobley or Green I’m most excited to watch Bones (hopefully he gets pt) and Jalen Suggs  A couple guys from the 2020 draft are Tre Jones and Jaden McDaniels"
You'd really give up Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels like that?

"Just to prove exactly how stupid you are being right now, I searched through literally every NBA team sub for their top Simmons related post in the last month.  Here are my findings:   Mavs - Ben Simmons is a disaster  Den - all comments talked about how it made no sense to trade for him  GSW - lol no  Rox - laughing at Morey and Philly fans  LAC - might be interested if they could get him for 2nd rounders  LAL - at least Westbrook isn’t as bad a shooter as Simmons  Mem - literally haven’t talked about him in the last 30 days  Timberwolves - he wouldn’t be worth Jaden Mcdaniels  Pels - for some reason they have a crusade going on against Bill Simmons which confused the results, but most people agreed Ben Simmons would ruin their team  OKC - pretty much just memeing him for being a socialite  PHO - lol no  POR - thinks the Sixers are insane, both for thinking they could move Simmons for a haul and for thinking they could trade him for Lillard  Kings - they want him. 1 for 13 so far  Spurs - already turned down a Simmons trade because Morey went full crackhead on them  Jazz - literally have not discussed Simmons in the last month  Hawks - memeing Daryl Morey for being insane  Celtics - meme about Simmons being useless  Nets - have not discussed him in the last month  Hornets - have not discussed him in the last month  Bulls - asking price too high, not worth moving Lavine  Cavs - not worth their pick this year (who is now Mobley)  Det - maybe if some other team bites on Simmons, they could pick up some assets as the third team.  No interest on getting Simmons themselves  Pacers - laughing at Philly imploding  Heat - laughing at the idea of moving Butler for Ben  Bucks - no interest, and they’re mad that Simmons was picked as All-NBA over Middleton  Knicks - laughing at the fact that Sixers gave a max contract to Simmons  Magic - no trade discussion for the last month  Sixers - somehow the same meme that the Celtics sub had of Simmons being useless.  Geez.   Raptors - again the same meme of Simmons being useless.   Wizards - they’re interested.  2 for 30.   So hats off to the Wizards and Kings, but literally every other team in the NBA *including the fucking Sixers* are laughing at the very notion of paying Simmons 30 million dollars to miss easy buckets.    He has no trade value."
Jaden Mcdaniels will be an allstar
Jalen and Jaden McDaniels
JADEN MCDANIELS IS KD BUT BETTER AT D
Jaden mcdaniels is sooooooo goooooood
"Jaden McDaniels. A legit 6'10"" wing who can already hit open threes and play great D. He's shown some flashes of creativity as well."
"As a wolves fan all I hear Ant Ant Ant. Give me Fucking Jaden McDaniels, this kid has as much upside as anyone from this his draft class"
Jaden McDaniels
I truly believe in Keldon Johnson.  I a little bit believe in Jaden McDaniels
Jaden McDaniels
Ngl. I enjoyed jaden mcdaniels game. I only found about him because of 2k 😂. But I started to watch his highlights and I can definitely see what you guys are talking about.
Jaden McDaniels will become a serious shutdown defender in this league.
Jaden McDaniels. Let him bulk up a little and tighten his handle.
"Jaden mcdaniels is a future allstar, and Ant will be an allstar this season"
"Charlotte has Jalen McDaniels on the roster, brother of Jaden"
"Charlotte has Jalen McDaniels on the main roster, brother of Minnesota's Jaden McDaniels"
Anthony Edwards for MVP and MIP. Jaden McDaniels for DPOY.  No bias
"“Attitude problems” always have GMs skiddish. KPJ, Jaden McDaniels, JJ, etc, all get drafted much later than they should’ve, mainly because GMs don’t just draft for the best likely outcome, but also to keep their own jobs."
I have always liked Jaden McDaniels game. Thought he was too slept on in the draft. Great pickup
"I'd definitely be willing to part ways with DLo, but I don't think that's what KAT wants since they're buds. But he's also friends with Simmons, so who knows.  I think the only offer we would make is Beasley, Jaden McDaniels (who looks very promising as a good 3&amp;D),  whoever else + picks.  I don't think it's enough, unless we get a 3rd team involved. Which is why nothing has happened."
"Jaden McDaniels, learn his name."
"Jaden McDaniels is going to establish himself as one of the more coveted 3 and D players in the league this season. Wolves making it to the playoffs with help from his improvement, Edwards taking a big step up with efficiency and leadership, Balmaro being more useful than most expect, and Taurean Prince fitting in as a bench 3 point sniper to go along with Malik"
"In one half, this dude called Jaden McDaniels, Patrick. He called him Jaden Daniels. He said he was trying to get in the rotation (already a starter). He said Jaden was a third year player who was undrafted out of Holy Cross, (he’s a second year player who was drafted 28th out of Washington).  Ya they’re just summer league dudes but it’s pathetic."
"Pistons PR official twitter posted a random Jaden McDaniels gif  Twolves fans, are you ready for RODNEY MCGRUDER TAKEOVER???????!!"
Jaden mcdaniels is extremely good
Jaden McDaniels no bias
"Or Jaden McDaniels. Dude put the absolute clamps on Williams for the Bulls last game, has been one of the best defenders in summer league while also being the best player on the Wolves 2-0 team and he wasn't mentioned once. Doesn't really surprise me though. Dude should've gotten 1st team all rookie last year and didn't even make 2nd team."
Jaden and jalen mcdaniels. Juancho and willy hernangomez.
Jaden Mcdaniels would go top 7 in a redraft easily.
Summer league Jaden mcdaniels = kd with better defense
"This is the problem. The Wolves aren’t willing to give up much of what it would take. I think Jaden McDaniels has a ton of value around the league, but the Wolves value him even more. It would probably be an offer of Beasley, Layman, Vanderbilt and a couple picks. The Sixers have their sights set sky high which is making it super tough to see anything lining up between these teams. And if the Sixers sights stay this high, it’s hard to imagine anything happening. Feels like we’re trending towards a Harden/Butler-like situation more than a Kobe one."
Kelly Olynyk IF they start him Kevin Porter and KJ Martin Oshae Brissett Jaden McDaniels Nic Claxton Tyrese Haliburton and Chimezu Metu Devin Vassell  Nickeil Walker Alexander Robert Williams
Here is what I'd be willing to give up but idk about other Wolves fans. I'd give up:  Malik Beasley Jaden Mcdaniels Juancho Hernangomez 2 first round picks.  That would be the highest I'd probably go.
"Jaden Mcdaniels, firsts (Not sure if Minnesota has them to trade, but they'd have to in this scenario). Jaden looks like a stud"
"Minnesota is not giving up KAT or Ant in any deal for at least 2 more seasons. It only works if Portland is ready to go in a full on rebuild with picks. The ""stars"" of the deal for Portland would be Jaden McDaniels and probably Leandro Bolmaro, then probably Malik Beasley and Juancho and whatever else to make the numbers work. From there, they'd get a metric ton of picks and I'm sure they could demand one of the better prospects from the 76ers as well. The team giving away the best player almost never wins, unfortunately."
"The assets from the Wolves would be picks and Jaden McDaniels I think, not DLo"
Jaden McDaniels
"&gt; Jaden McDaniels is the one big bright spot from the last year of mediocrity.  Hmm, I remember another pretty big (almost ROTY sized) bright spot last year"
"Jaden McDaniels is the one big bright spot from the last year of mediocrity. The emergence of Nowell is nice too, I really liked him when he first got drafted and he's made huge strides since then"
"This is the market that holds the record for the most tickets sold in a single season. Yes, the stadium we played in was massive but I still don't know how many cities would be that engaged to sell THAT many tickets even for a first season.   When we are good, we instantly shoot up to about 15th-20th in attendance, even without a playoff guarantee (see the Butler year).   Minnesota loves basketball. We just had 9,000+ people come attend an in-person practice with Jaden McDaniels being the best player."
"Dame to Philly, a shit ton of picks from MN to Portland, picks and some combo of Maxey/Milton/Thybulle to Portland, Simmons to MN? Throw in Jaden McDaniels to Portland if need be. Am I wrong for thinking that's a pretty solid deal for all parties? It's always a shitty situation to have to trade a star like Dame, but getting a king's ransom of picks might be the best route if they have to trade him."
"Had a great year in Phx. Building to something really great in the bubble. Traded for Chris Paul.  The year before that he was finding his place with the Jazz. Started his Ricky Rubio Foundation there. Was replaced by Mike Conley.  Getting replaced by older vets while you're in your prime and looking to be a vital part of a team has to be doing things to your head. Ricky is all about mental health and head space. He obviously wasn't in the right place when he came back to Minny. By the time he settled in, it was clear that the Wolves weren't looking for a playoff spot and focused on building younger talent like Ant and Jaden McDaniels. So that's what Ricky's role came to be. He was shooting much better during the 2nd half of the season. Ant had been speaking highly of him as a vet."
"I remember that run fondly, he also outdueled giannis toward the end of the year. The thing with that sixers team though, we had ersan and Dario. Those are the kinda bigs that work with Simmons. I think twolves are the best fit for him because Kat is such a good shooter and Ben could really cover kats shortcomings on D. I don’t know what going but I’d be trying to do a Ben for dLo and jaden mcdaniels based deal."
Good to know. If he does end up on the move I’d take him with open arms. As I originally said I don’t know if there’s a better fit than next to KAT and lord knows the Wolves need to start winning. I hope if the opportunity comes Rosas puts together a competitive offer.   He’s also alluded to being willing to move a guy like Jaden McDaniels if it meant getting back a premium player.
Jaden mcdaniels
Jaden McDaniels is gonna be running our offense and asked to be more of a creator on offense.  I think hes got alot of potential at it and happy to see it.  Last year he was almost exclusively used in catch and shoot because we prioritized Ants development (the right choice obviously)  so im excited to see Jaden get to develop that aspect of his game.
Isn't Jaden McDaniels a 4 and one of the best defensive players on your team?
Oh I love Jaden Mcdaniels he was definitely one of the biggest steals of the draft. His 3&amp;d potential is through the roof
Thats probably fair value on our end for simmons but i just don't think Minnesota can trade both as we would have so little spacing for either simmons or Ant to do their work.  Minnesotas path to getting simmons has always been with a third team getting a bunch of picks and swaps and players like Jaden Mcdaniels and Naz Reid and other young non anthony edwards players going to the third team who are trading you guys the vets you want and Beasley probably also going to Philly which just isn't happening at the current moment.
They get Jaden mcdaniels and a shot w culver!
"DeAnthony Melton, Thad Young(he's probably too good for this title), Cameron Johnson, Jaden McDaniels, Reggie Bullock"
Isn't that Jaden McDaniels or are you all running him at the 3?
Big Mac for Jaden McDaniels. Because we already have Jordan McLaughlin on the roster who we refered to as JMac already. So Jaden became Big Mag and Jordan Lil Mac.
"&gt;Why did you trade for him in the first place exactly?   To mentor Anthony Edwards and have a high quality backup PG, he was also part of the Jaden McDaniels trade which was very valuable.   Rosas also wanted to keep his money on the books for one more year since James Johnson was an expiring."
Realistically a shit ton of picks and Beasley/culver/other wing guy we traded Ricky for. That's basically all we got. Maybe Jaden McDaniels too actually.
Likely because they asked for Jaden McDaniels or picks. Not because we didnt want Kuzma
I can probably agree with that tbh. I’m not saying McDaniels is some far superior player to Kuzma but fit and cap hit wise I’d rather stick with Jaden.
Gallo is much better than Lauri.   Jaden McDaniels would play over Lauri if both are with the Bulls.
"He said he's looking, but what we got right now... Taurean Prince is a smallball 4, Jaden McDaniels is a smallball 4, ect."
Jaden McDaniels is a promising weak side rim protector too.
"RJ Barrett. Jaden McDaniels.   Anthony Edwards will be a legitimate all star and the Wolves will fight for a play-in where nobody wants to play them.   Also not star, but as a role player Aaron Nesmith is going to surprise a lot of people. Think Danny Green esque role player."
Jaden McDaniels
Jaden McDaniels is primed to be that next 3nD guy people always talk.
Jaden McDaniels bout to be Brandon Ingram next season
Our rook Jaden McDaniels comp has been Issac and he has looked super promising so there's a lot of hope he's our 3/4 of the future.
I believe we got Jaden McDaniels out of that deal. So from that perspective it was well worth jt
Ben Simmons for Jaden McDaniels who says no
How do you feel about  Rubio + Jaden McDaniels for Danilo + Huerter or Reddish
"I’m a wolves fan as well, so I’m fully aware. It’s just that Okogie’s offense is so bad, he’s too much of a liability to play big minutes. Beasley is a great shooter, but a weak defender. Nowell can score, but isn’t much of a defender either. With D’Lo and Ant being sub-par defenders, they need somebody to balance the lineup. KCP fits that role better than any of those guys. (That said, it’s possible Jaden McDaniels starts at the 3 this year)"
So many weird things in this tweet   He capitalized “Big Superior”   He put a “:” before Jaden McDaniels when he didn’t  have to   Then I guess he kinda used the colon right to end the tweet but its still weird to me
&gt;I think the Wolves are much better off trying to develop Jaden McDaniels tbh   You really think we were gonna give up Jaden for Kyle fucking Kuzma? lmao  Also Kuz is a PF and Jaden is a natural SF so they don't overlap.
"I agree. I honestly think Jaden McDaniels is a future DPOY. Having that level of a defender on a team with KAT and D'Lo is incredibly important. Plus he can shoot the three, which means you can actually use him in a modern offense unlike most defensive minded players."
I think the Wolves are much better off trying to develop Jaden McDaniels tbh
how much do you think Jaden McDaniels is valued in the market? prob not enough to move the needle in this case but i feel like he's shown some flashes
Jaden McDaniels.
"Lakers, Jazz, Nuggets, Suns, Clippers.    I might be a homer but if Minnesota stays healthy they should be contending for a 7 or 8 seed this yr. When KAT and DLO have played together they have done well. And Ant is going to be a beast if he stays on track. I think with DLO, Ant, Kat and Jaden McDaniels we are sitting okay. If we can somehow land Ben Simmons without giving up that core we should absolutely be a lock for the playoffs."
This is Jaden McDaniels erasure.
"""Tell me you know without telling me blah blah blah""  Ben Simmons is worth more than Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels. Feel free to be the GM tho, you guys would be super content with going 23-49 every year."
"Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a few picks. One of the few offers out there."
"No way we can offer Shake Milton, he’s completely untouchable.  Wolves fans get what I’m talking about with Jaden McDaniels.  When a young guy scores over 7 ppg, you can’t give that up in any circumstance"
"Malik Beasley,Jaden McDaniels,Pat Bev and 2-3 1sts."
Absolutely. Especially if they end up keeping Jaden McDaniels.  I think it would actually take more draft assets than that.
"If there is a trade, the package would most likely be something like  Ben Simmons to Timberwolves  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, and either Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince, and 2-3 first round picks (with some initial protections) to Sixers  Salaries match. No way Sixers do this unless they are desperate. I don’t think Sixers are that desperate. I think they are actually hopeful to give Maxes/Thybulle/Reed some of Simmons playing time to see how they do, even if he sits out."
Bruh Jaden McDaniels is a quality starter.
1. Suggs  2. Fourier  3. Pokusevski  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Khem Birtch
Jaden McDaniels. I've seen plenty of Sixers fans mock the idea of getting Jaden or dismissing him as some 5-6 ppg player but as a rookie he showed that he was a quality 3&amp;D wing who could hit open 3's and had the length to guard anyone (not the muscle though). It's up to him if he can bulk up and live up to his potential though but definitely an Ariza type player.
Jaden McDaniels is just a prospect but Vanderbilt is an up and comer...I'd have to disagree lol
"No Jaden McDaniels slander allowed. He's unironically an incredible value player for a young guy.  You can have your beef with Ant, KAT, even DLo. We don't take McDaniels slander here."
I'll try for real: your starting PF is Jaden McDaniels
"Starting 5: Jokic, Jerami Grant Middleton, Smart, Steph. Bench: Ingles, Patty Mills, Seth Curry, Caruso, Marcus Morris, Naz Reid, PJ Tucker, Jaden McDaniels"
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
TWolves' Jaden McDaniels
"Talen Horton Tucker, Jaden McDaniels, or Jaren Jackson Jr."
"If Jaden McDaniels isn’t involved, then count me in"
"If the best trade offer on the table is Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels, then yes lol. It's all background noise because there's nothing else happening. Once the season starts, if he's still here and the Sixers start the season fine, it will be pushed to the backburner."
lol yeah because I'm sure Embiid would be over the moon if Morey traded Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden Mcdaniels.
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
Yeah but trading away our biggest trade asset at rock bottom value because we're afraid of a holdout is the quickest way to become mediocre. We're better on the court with Simmons than with anything that was offered for him. So let him hold out but don't trade him for Wiggins or Jaden Mcdaniels.
"Jaden McDaniels not from my team but I gotta bring him up. Probably Jordan Poole feom us, he showed a ton of improvement over the year"
"Anthony edwards, Jaden mcdaniels.  Timberwolves circa 2020."
Jaden McDaniels and Anthony Edwards
"I hope we don't get him. We gave up our draft pick last year to get rid of a max player who didn't give a shit. Please don't get another one.  Also, I like Jaden McDaniels and think he could be really good. I don't like DLo actually but at least he is a good shooter. Simmons refuses to shoot, why why why why why no no no no no. Although I want Edwards shooting any big shots, so maybe a DLo (or DLol) swap would be ok.  I also didn't want them to pick Ant so ok I'm wrong often."
"&gt;The main packages that exist are a D'lo package that the 76ers are lukewarm on or a Jaden McDaniels,Malik Beasley + filler + picks although Gersson Rosas is reluctant to move D'lo. He believes the 2nd offer is a lot more enticing because those picks could be used later down the line to trade for Dame or Beal, since GM's saw this year how valuable unprotected Minnesota picks are.  If the Wolves get Simmons without giving up any of their best players those picks won't be nearly as valuable."
"They are close, and that's likely why Minnesota will need a third team who really loves Jaden McDaniels if they want to add Simmons if the reports are true.  More likely though is that they miss out on Simmons entirely if they really won't part with D-Lo. And that's where it becomes stupid from an asset management perspective.    Edwards being untouchable makes sense. Beyond that, if you take the reports at face value (which, again, i do not, Gerson doesn't strike me as a moron), this reeks of same ol' Minnesota"
"I think this trade makes sense, but tell why this trade DOESN’T make sense.  MN gets: Simmons Philly gets: Siakim Toronto gets: Jaden McDaniels, Beverly, Prince, 3 MN first rounders.  Rationale: Philly gets an all star level player who plays good defense and is an improved shooter to replace Simmons. Toronto commits to a rebuild rather than being stuck in no man’s land. They get a nice young piece in McDaniels, a lot of draft picks that could be valuable. And they replace Siakim’s monstrous contract with ~$30 million in expiring contracts. Minnesota mortgages their future but improves a lot in the present and has a potent starting lineup of DLo, Beasley, Ant, Simmons, KAT."
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
"&gt;I don't think they're incompetent, because I view the reports as posturing, not as fact. But yes, they're incompetent if they're considering Jaden McDaniels as too good to include in the package, or if they turn down D-Lo for Simmons.   You are aware there is a particular reason they traded for D'lo in the first place? Roster construction is not all about how many ppp this guy creates or what his TS% is..."
"I don't think they're incompetent, because I view the reports as posturing, not as fact. But yes, they're incompetent if they're considering Jaden McDaniels as too good to include in the package, or if they turn down D-Lo for Simmons."
&gt;What do you mean so? thats clear character issues and lowers his value whether you like it or not.  Ironic considering the same shit is lowering Ben's value.  &gt;Lmao 6th man on a wcf team is meaningless. He cant even stay on the court and hes not good. His value is a mid 2nd rounder and you know it. If he was worth anything you wouldnt have got him for what you traded.  Look at Booker's or Mitchell's FG % when guarded by Bev and not. His only bad series was against Dallas because Luka is the size of a SF and Bev couldn't do anything against him.   &gt;Do you know anything about my team? If ya do care to explain why we'd give a shit about a 2nd year player like McDaniels while we are trying to contend with our MVP candidate? Or why we'd want your picks that will suck when you win 40+ games with Ben?  The goal is to accumulate assets and ship them off the moment another star becomes available because you are not trading for one atm. I'm very well aware of the needs and wants of the 76ers.  And again Jaden is a very good defender and a decent spot up shooter and he's on a rookie contract. He's a player that is needed on every championship contender and there lies his value. But you don't know anything about him beyond what bbref tells you.
"Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and Jaden McDaniels are worthless?   Okay chief ✌"
&gt;They are peak delusion right now. They've won 42 games the last 2 seasons combined but apparently half their roster is untouchable.   Delusion? I just said that its harder to get Jaden McDaniels from us than Malik Beasley and if you have a problem with that send an email to the Minnesota Timberwolves and not argue with me since they are the ones who decided that not me.
Lmfao is there seriously both a Jalen McDaniels and a Jaden McDaniels in the league?
"The most realistic to me for the Wolves requires a 3rd team. I think the Wizards makes sense, with it going:  Simmons to Minnesota  Beal to Philadelphia  Patrick Beverly (sorry for the 1000000th trade), Taurean Prince, Jaden McDaniels, and two 1sts to Washington.   I could also see Washington getting a 1st out of Philly to get it done. Beverly and Prince are expiring contracts so they get cap flexibility going forward.  McDaniels looks like he could develop into a very good player, probably not an all star, but one of those guys that you love starting for you under a cheap contract for 3 years. They also get 2 or 3 extra firsts, and Minnesota firsts hit different.   I'd be interested to get the perspective of a Wizards fan because from the outside your team looks like a prime candidate to blow it up and see what can happen in a few years."
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"Malik Beasley,Pat Bev,Jaden McDaniels and 2 lightly protected 1sts."
"Minus defender? So you personally watched Jaden McDaniels play defense a good amount and came to that conclusion that he is a bad defender? He's insanely long, athletic, has quick feet, switchable, has good hands and a good defensive awareness. I really don't see how you think he is a bad defender. Defense is a lot more about scheme, matchups etc so the defensive rating of course is going to be poor bc the TWolves as a whole had a defensive rating of 114.5, 27th in the league."
Jaden McDaniels exists.
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
Minnesota: Beasley bev Jaden McDaniels 2 unprotected first round picks
"No, they wouldn’t. The rumors are that the Timberwolves are offering draft picks, Malik Beasley ($14 M), Jaden McDaniels ($2 M), Naz Reid ($1.7 M), and one of Patrick Beverley ($14.3 M) or Taureen Prince ($13 M). Those contracts combined match Simmons’s contract of $33 M.   Neither of those trades can be completed today though, so we don’t know if the 76ers would accept that offer. Taureen Prince can’t be traded till September 27th and Patrick Beverly can’t be traded till October. As a result, we won’t see any deal accepted until then at the earliest."
Jaden McDaniels lowkey
I’m gonna high jack your comment to put forth a hot take trade proposal:  Minnesota gets: Ben Simmons  Philly gets: Cam Reddish Bogdon  Beasley 2025 first Pick swaps  ATL gets: Jaden McDaniels 2023 first  2027 first Pat Bev  Idk this actually looks bad lol
"Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and it's a done deal. No additional picks.  Big 3 of KAT, DLo and Ben looks $p00ky"
Jaden mcdaniels &gt; jrue holidays D.
"Damn sixers about to end up with Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Jaden McDaniels and like 3 firsts"
I was equally if not more excited about Jaden McDaniels last year than I was about Ant. I honestly don't want this trade to happen. I watched those playoffs last year. I saw that bunny ass pass by Simmons under the hoop and all the free throw clunks. Pulling one of your max contract guys off the floor in crunch time because he can't shoot a free throw? Nah no thanks.
"&gt; Detroit: Jaden Mcdaniels, Taurean Prince, Danny Green  Bruh"
"It’s all about matching, Ben Simmons leaving is a given and they’re not gonna get an equal return that’s already known. But for example let’s say next year a star requests a trade and the team wants to kickstart its rebuild   Philly has 3 first round picks from Minnesota, young assets in Jaden Mcdaniels, maxey, and thybull, and expiring contracts they can toss in or maybe even get off Tobias’s contract as the money filler. Who can outbid Philly with a package of 4-5 frps, young stars, and expiring contracts? If dame or Beal leave they’re not retooling they’re going for a rebuild, no other team can match what Philly could offer to pair a star with Embiid"
It's funny to see people thinking Jaden McDaniels is a scrub. Dude would be the centerpiece the Wolves offer. He's better than Beasley.
It seems recently we have done well. You could add Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley to that as well. Now if we could somehow run a league average defense that would be cool.
"Yes, I rather go for Timberwolves   We would get assets for a trade like Jaden McDaniels and a few picks"
If only it was Jaden McDaniels instead
"Timberwolves flip their backup PG/ SG duo for the perfect PF fit next to KAT and D'Lo  Blazers fix their backcourt issue and introduce size. Instead of a starting line-up of Dame/ CJ/ Powell they now run Dame/ Powell/ Jerami Grant and they also get a sixth man combo guard off the bench in Malik Beasley.  Sixers snag CJ who is a much better fit next to Embiid, they also snag a backup PF in Jaden McDaniels who should improve on his respectable rookie numbers, and they also get a future 1st from Minnesota that they can flip for a vet at the trade deadline to shore up any gaps they have.  Pistons get two first round picks for Jerami Grant who doesn't really fit their timeline."
76ers also get wolves 2nd   Timberwolves get Myles Turner  Indiana gets Malik Beasely or Jaden McDaniels
"Sixers get: Bev, Beasley and Dejountae Murray  Twolves get: Simmons  Spurs get: Maxey, Jaden McDaniels, Okogie  Maybe add some picks and swaps from Twolves.   The money works, Sixers improve upon the guard rotation and get rid of Simmons. Twolves get Simmons in a win-now move. Spurs get young assets and maybe some picks in return for their biggest asset."
"Someone else mentioned that the Sixers should package Tyrese Maxey and Simmons in a three team trade involving the Timberwolves.   Third Team Receives: Maxey, Timberwolves 2022 FRP, Timberwolves 2026 FRP, Jaden McDaniels, and Two Timberwolves FRP Swaps.   Timberwolves Receive: Ben Simmons  76ers Receive: Third Team star player.   I'm not sure which team makes up that third trading partner. Wizards (Beal) or Trailblazers (Lillard). I don't know, man."
"Yeah, I get why people are saying the Kings as a landing spot for Simmons, but that's pretty much the only package that might get it done (aside from ones including Fox, but that should obviously be a nonstarter for the Kings), and it leaves the Kings with essentially no shooters. Don't see it happening without a third team involved.  Maybe there's a framework to be had around Hield and Beverley, with the Wolves getting Simmons and the Kings getting Jaden McDaniels (who would be a great fit for a young team that needs defense) and salary filler? I dunno, the Sixers definitely want more than that (plus picks) for Simmons, but I feel like there's something there."
"I'll start,  Philly:  Malik Beasley   Wolves 1st 2024  Collin Sexton  Ricky Rubio  Cavaliers:  Jaden McDaniels  Patrick Beverley   Philly 1st 2022  Wolves 1st 2022  Minnesota  Ben Simmons"
"The trade would likely be Beasley, Beverly, jaden mcdaniels and picks"
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
"If Jaden McDaniels was on the Lakers, he’d be talked about like OG was during the peak of his value, IMO."
Enjoy Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels
"&gt;Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts.  LOL"
"jaden mcdaniels, naz reid"
"Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts."
"Philly won’t get any player they want, they’re better off getting assets they can use in a future trade for a star asking out. I don’t think kings are giving up fox, warriors fit with draymond and Ben is kinda sus especially considering they have interesting rookies and giving up Wiggins who has been a great defender and can actually shoot seems like a waste of assets for them, clippers have no legit assets outside of PG and kawhi, literally no picks, lakers have no contracts to match Ben. Minnesota makes the most sense fit wise and Jaden Mcdaniels is still a great trade chip on top of the picks"
"This is what the article said  ""The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers.""  It never said they offered all 3"
"&gt; The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers.  Jesus that's way to much for Simmons. Guy can't fucking shoot. Not worth those three."
"""The Timberwolves have been motivated to find a deal for Simmons but would likely require a third team given their asset pool of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and D’Angelo Russell might not entice the 76ers""  Am I the only one who doesn't think this is a bad package? Obviously doesn't make them better as a Dame would but that it's not that bad"
Nope Beasley for sure and the wolves would hate to do it but prolly include Jaden McDaniels
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
Must've been having a good night. Jaden McDaniels is a bum
Jaden McDaniels
He’s a few years away. Had the pleasure of watching Jaden McDaniels absolutely lock him down at SL. Every possession he’d run around screens to get switched of Jaden.   He’s got a lot of tools but he needs to learn how to keep dribbling in traffic and he has to play through contact better.
Jaden McDaniels Brandon Ingram KD
I mean yea they are interested in fleecing philly. Why wouldn’t they? But no trade is gonna happen between these two teams philly wants someone that will help them win now or a package that will help them trade for someone who can help them win now. While the twolves don’t want to give up any of their actual valuable pieces in dlo or ant and instead want to offer something like Malik Beasley(who just got out of jail I should add) and Jaden McDaniels(cool 3 and D prospect but nothing crazy to be fair) and a couple of first which if they get Ben shouldn’t even be that good. Trade makes 0 sense for philly so it will never happen they’d be better off taking Cj and a pick or so from Portland.
"I think it depends on how this year goes honestly. If we only win 30-35 games this year it might be time to consider resetting and building around Edwards/Jaden McDaniels.   A boatload of value for KAT could help us start off right and maybe in a year or two be where the grizzlies are currently with room to grow  Of course if Ant looks bad this year then I dunno, blow it up and relocate to the moon?"
KAT  Ant  Jaden McDaniels  Malik Beasley  Naz Reid
Jaden McDaniels
"to an extent, Jaden McDaniels, he's known for having a bit of a toxic streak on the court (Called James Wiseman ""sewer trash"" during a high school game, got T'd up a ton in college), meanwhile he's very soft spoken and shy during interviews, ending some of his summer league ones with ""thanks, have a nice day,"" prompting aww's from the broadcast team"
"If we’re considering players 25 and younger, I think the Wolves could be a part of the conversation. Not saying they are THE best young core, but KAT (25), DLo (25), Beasley (24), Ant (20), Jaden McDaniels (20), Naz Reid (21) is a pretty nice core. Two all-stars, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA, a potential future all-NBA player (Ant), a future all-defensive player (Jaden), and an offensively versatile backup center that could probably be a starter on a handful of other teams."
Jaden McDaniels is part of the core. He’s a good defender. I think you’d be surprised if you checked him out
Anthony Edwards  Jaden McDaniels  Naz Reid  McKinley Wright  Patrick Beverly
Jaden McDaniels. Probably our best defender and shows flashes of offensive ability. Hope to see him and Ant together in Minnesota for a long time.
"If Sixers want to win in Embiid's window, they shouldn't look for 3 1sts. Two solid role players ie Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels is what they need.  The Big 3 of DLo, KAT and Ben looks solid. Three all-stars at the age of 25, sheesh. The wolves are gonna be a problem in the West for years to come"
Jaden McDaniels effect
Bucks have no center and it’s showing…also how the hell did Kat get out-rebounded by Jaden McDaniels and Jarred Vanderbilt? Sad.
There’s a jaden and a Jalen mcdaniels
Uh isn’t it Jaden McDaniels?
Jaden McDaniels is going to be a top 5 defender in the league after this year.
"Yeah, but I feel like it's the same discussion all the ""interested teams"" fans are having.   We should trade for him, *if we can get a great deal.*  The other problem the Sixers are going to run into is what constitutes a *great deal* is going to change night-to-night for a lot of teams. Jaden McDaniels is a great example. All summer, Wolves fans were ready to throw him in a deal, but he played incredible defense in the first two games of the season and now they're a bit more hesitant. Front offices are having the exact same conversations every day now."
If getting rid of D.lo and a few protected picks or Jaden McDaniels gets me Simmons I do it in a heartbeat. No team is getting far with D.lo at PG
"Right this second?   1. Trade him to the Timberwolves for picks, Beasley, Prince and Okogie or Jaden McDaniels before the TWolves go on a win streak and don't want to trade anybody.   2. Trade him to the Cavs for picks, Sexton and John Wall (KLove goes to the Rockets to get bought out).   Since those are probably the only options still available to the 76ers and there is a risk of Ben's value going down even more."
God damn Jaden McDaniels had 4 steals and 2 blocks? Looking like prime AK-47 out there.
"WEST:  Golden State Utah Phoenix Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers Denver  Dallas Minnesota  EAST:  Milwaukee Atlanta Brooklyn Miami Philadelphia New York Chicago Boston  WCF: LAL v DAL ECF: MIL v BKN NBAF: BKN v LAL, LAL wins in 7/LBJ Finals MVP  MVP: Stephen Curry DPOY: Jaden McDaniels ROY: Evan Mobley 6Man: Andre Drummond MIP: Anthony Edwards COY: Nate McMillan"
"Where did this narrative come from. Apparently cuz we don’t want Marvin Bagley and buddy hield or Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels, that we will only settle for dame and beal. You know there is a massive number of players between those players skill levels. Players like Colin sexton for example"
Thank you for being logical and not just looking at it from the “we hate Philly lense” that everyone in this subreddit loves using. They think we should trade Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden Mcdaniels or Marvin Bagley and buddy Hield. Both trades which add almost nothing to our team. Curry is basically a cheaper hield and they probably can’t co exist. We don’t need role players. We have a good bench filled with good role players and good role players surrounding Embiid and Harris. All we are doing in those trades is very slightly upgrading those young role players and pushing them out. People think we would be better off trading him for peanuts than keeping him
"Sorry that the Sixers don’t want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That’s definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn’t taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he’s an good young prospect but his ceiling isn’t that high and we have Tobias Harris and George’s Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
Timberwolves are at 3 and they didn’t include McDaniels? Love Josh and Vando but Jaden is the Starter and the future. Also Naz Reid.
I think you mean Scottie Pippen is Jaden McDaniels 2.0
Jaden Mcdaniels is literally Scottie Pippen 2.0
KAT/Ant/DLo gonna get the headlines. But Jaden McDaniels and Josh Okogie where great on defense.  Rockets might need to go pick up a vet PG. They needed someone that could handle the rock and run the offense.
Not for Simmons. I'd rather be the 3rd team to receive assets from Minny or something. Give us Jaden McDaniels
Jaden McDaniels 5x5?
I'm not gonna sit here and allow this Jaden McDaniels slander to occur
"u/EuroStep0 wasn’t very polite, but his honestly sentiment is somewhat understandable. Especially since 76ers fans have been shit on all off-season. However, if you honestly just wanted some outside opinions about a Westbrook for Simmons trade idea, then I’m willing to expand on EuroStep’s response a bit:   The biggest issue with the trade proposal is that the 76ers would never accept Westbrook for Simmons. Morey is being a bit delusional with his trade offers, but not to the degree that he should be willing to take a bad contract back for him. The proposed Minnesota deal of Malik Beasley (good, cheap shooter), Jaden McDaniels (young player with a lot of potential), Patrick Beverly (vet with tons of playoff experience), and picks (Timberwolves draft picks are more valuable than Lakers picks) for Simmons is honestly much better for the 6ers. Westbrook may be a bigger name than any of those guys, but that deal would give the 6ers assets to target a true star later. Plus, the Lakers can’t even add a ton of picks to the deal, cause they dealt them all away for Davis.   Even disregarding the huge loss by the Sixers, how would this even help the Lakers that much? They’d obviously be better since Simmons is much better than Westbrook, but the fit is still terrible. Simmons is arguably the only PG in the league who’s a worse shooter than Westbrook. Seeing as shooting is the Lakers biggest issue, adding Simmons isn’t gonna move the needle too much. If you want to imagine impossible trades, why not imagine ones involving players that fix the Lakers issues, like Kyrie for Westbrook?"
And Jaden McDaniels
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
"thanks for the downvote, yeah i think the player (out of those you named) that spends the most time driving to the rim and creating contact with misplaced defenders in the restricted area deserves more free throws than those players who attempt to score from everywhere  he causes car crashes in the paint. he's not pump faking 3s and leaning, he's not playing red light green light with a defender behind him, he's slashing to the rim, finishing through contact and reaping the benefits  does jimmy butler **hunt** for fouls? yeah. that's not a secret. does jimmy butler **bait** for fouls? no. you remembered a particular, specific instance from a random regular season game where jaden mcdaniels was given a foul against jimmy and expect **anyone** to take your argument seriously? say you hate that he plunged y'all back into the lottery and go"
Jaden McDaniels being the PF we can use would be monumental to the team.
jaden mcdaniels or caruso   who better
Jalen and Jaden McDaniels on different teams tho
"Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro vs some guy, who y’all got?"
Bro thats 4 max contracts lol.  The bench is going to be utter trash .  Jaden Mcdaniels and a bunch of scrubs we pick up off the street basically
"One's opinion of Jaden McDaniels proves two things: (1) that you actually watch Timberwolves games and (2) that you're not a casual.   You sir, are invited to the cookout"
"Jaden McDaniels is just so good. legitimately would go top 8 in a redraft. I wish we drafted him  great defender, efficient on offense what more could you want"
"I think Darius Garland is gonna go from a promising young PG to all-star level  Jaden McDaniels will be really good too, he'll end up being like a early days Paul George-lite type of player"
"Jaden McDaniels, I thought he shouldve been an All-Rookie team member.  He is a legit 3nD lanky forward and that type of player is rare to find nowadays.  If he adds some shot creation to his game he can be a longer PG type player."
"Jaden McDaniels, its rare these days to find a legit long 3 and D wing and thats already his floor being a good nba player.  If he can develop some shot creation in the future to his arsenal, thats a future star 2-way player"
"I mean if Jaden mcdaniels and Anthony edwards don't live up to their defensive potential then I agree.  But the idea when you draft guys though is that they will, and then you go from there"
I'd rather be a 3rd team in a Simmons to Minny trade and get Jaden McDaniels. Barnes/OG/Siakam/McDaniels/Precious would be insane
"Bigs tend to not have that same “floor raising” potential that an elite guard would have. Sorry, I don’t like using the “floor/ceiling raiser” term but I think it does apply here. Also has to do with just horrible player management and draft picks outside of those bigs.  Although 2020 seemed like a smash so far for Minny... Ant looks amazing and then I really like Jaden McDaniels too. Hopefully they turn it around. I’m a Celtics fan, But I do live in Iowa so I would still like the Wolves to be good."
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
You say that but jaden McDaniels might be the steal of last years draft at 28
Jaden lacks the ball handling and shot creation ability to be something akin to Tatum. McDaniels is more in the 3&amp;D role.
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
"In 14 games without simmons maxey had 14 ppg in 24 mpg with 50/37/87 as starter he had 18/4/4. Are you saying about efficiency when jaden mcdaniels is 6""8 and only shoots open layups or open 3s while maxey is a 6""2 pg who tries a lot of shot off dribble. Post all star maxey had 8 ppg in 14 mpg with 57 TS, jaden mcdaniels never scored over 20 points while maxey had multiple 30 point games"
"I'd have to imagine Wolves still are willing to offer Beasley, McDaniels, Prince or Bev and two unprotected firsts, that is hardly nothing.   Definitely not the value he would've gotten a year ago, or two years ago, but its probably only going to go down from here on out.   Ideally, the Sixers would've done this all behind closed doors, but they didn't and hindsight is 20/20.   The Wolves, seemingly, want Simmons the most and have one of the better offers on the table, but they also have two timelines going on right now. They have the Ant/Jaden timeline and the Kat/D'lo timeline. If they start out hot, like 10-5 in the first 15 games, (which seems unlikely), then the Wolves offer might be going down and they may not want to include Jaden, and Jaden is the real prize in that deal.   If the Wolves are healthy and suck and start out 5-15 the thought process could definitely shift towards trading Beasley, D'lo and Kat to buy into the Ant and Jaden timeline. This means they wouldn't be in the market for Simmons at all.   So, Wolves being too good or too bad could mean them no longer wanting Simmons or their offer changing substantially. Meanwhile, Simmons is sitting and either not showing up or faking an injury to not play, his value would only be slowly going down.   I suppose if I were Morey I would try to get RoCo and CJ from the Blazers and go all-in on the next two years, and hope to flip Thybulle down the line. But at this point Jaden is the better defender between him and RoCo, and has more promise on a cheaper contract.   If Morey does go with the Wolves offer, Beasley would feast next to Embiid, sure he sucks on defense, but he is an elite high volume 3-pt shooter and on a good contract, assuming he stays out of prison. Beasley is the type of guy who could shoot his way into an all-star game, even while being average or below average at pretty much everything else.  Embiid, Jaden and Thybulle would have to cover for his defensive lapses though.   Jaden could slide next to Harris as a 3/4 option, his numbers dont really reflect his impact, he's been very impressive so far, and within a year could be packaged with the Wolves picks and Thybulle for a star to pair with Embiid. Jaden's value should increase. He's like 6'10 and 195 lbs or something, but is above average on man and team defense, can guard the perimeter and in the post with above average rim protection. He also has a pretty decent 3-pt shot and has been working on his handles.   Plus they would get either Pat Bev or Taurean Prince, and Bev would fit what they needed a lot more.   If Morey goes with the Blazers, those guys will just be losing value over their contracts as both are getting up there in age. If he goes with the Wolves offer he'll have to work to improve value of guys to then flip for someone around Embiid's age, or someone like Beal.   I wonder if the Blazers would offer CJ and Anfernee Simons with RoCo, and a pick? That'd probably get me to slide more towards the Blazers offer, but everything i've heard is they won't offer RoCo.   Either way, didn't get Harden, so that is what all this will be compared to. Would've been a great combo, Harden and Embiid."
A lot of rebuilding teams would willing take a wolves pick and/or Jaden McDaniels for a strong role player/starter that a contending team like Philly needs. It's trickier finding one that has a piece that Philly actually wants that works within the salary ranges of this trade.
His prime will wasted if the sixers best  asset and 2nd best player is traded for fuckin garbages like beasley and jaden mcdaniels
"Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and Markelle Fultz  Magic get: Patrick Beverley and Jaylen Nowell  I am not even going to pretend I’ve watched half these players and just matched money for “lol Fultz back to 76ers”  Who even would win this trade?"
Depends on how you perceive the value of Minnesota picks and Jaden McDaniels.
"Yes i am sure and thinking otherwise is stupid. Why are you not sure of that when its widely publicized the Wolves want him bad and the offer thats continually floated is malik beasley, pat bev, jaden mcdaniels and 2 1sts?"
Did anyone realize Minnesota had 4 players average at least 19 PPG last season? And that's without whatever Jaden McDaniels grows into. Hope they can find some defense!
The amount of people on this sub chomping at the bit to trade Simmons for Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels is staggering
Na 6'10. Jaden McDaniels is the same height as him at SF
"Because out of all the contenders Lillard would be interested in joining the Sixers have the biggest package to put together as they have more picks than most other contending teams and can attach young players like Maxey and Thybulle as well.  Even if you don’t like Simmons, you could flip him to a 3rd team and send 7 picks, Jaden McDaniels and Philly’s young players to Portland"
"Patrick Beverley, Taurean Prince, a couple filler players, 2022 MIN 1st (unprot), 2024 MIN 1st (minimal protection), and either 2026 MIN 1st or Jaden McDaniels. Maybe throw in an additional pick swap in the distant future. It probably becomes a bigger trade that moves a pick or two for some immediate help to Philly."
"We actually have a very good bench. Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Beverley, McLaughlin, Vando. We're a lot better for bench players than people realize because they don't follow the team and don't know the players other than numbers that don't tell the whole picture.  As far as KAT being heralded as better than Embiid or Jokic...I think that was from earlier years when they were at the same level. I don't know many Wolves fans who'd say that now. I think his POTENTIAL is as good as theirs. But he has to get there. We were playing 500 ball for the last 20 games and we were still heavily injured. We've had horrendous luck on health the last few years. I think with Ant slowly becoming the man and a better coaching scheme we have a chance. But old thoughts and perceptions die hard. Also, we will have new owners starting next year so it stands to reason that things will change. For better or for worse? Who knows."
2016 - Ingram becomes Jaylen Brown  2017 - Ball becomes Tatum  2018- Wagner becomes Chamet   2019 - Hunter becomes Garland but we traded him for AD  2020 - Jaden McDaniels becomes Malachi Flynn
I think the Timberwolves can make the playoffs if they healthy  Dlo and KAT is a pretty good duo and they had above a 500 record when they played together (small sample size tho)  Ant looked like a star scorer in the 2nd half of the season and seems poised to take another jump  Beasley is a nice 20 ppg scorer and excellent shooter  Jaden McDaniels has alot of potential and is an excellent fit with KAT
Jaden McDaniels will ball this year on defense.
"Jaden McDaniels on our Wolves is 6'10 185, catching up."

Ant is questionable for our game on Wednesday with flu like symptoms. This is after Vanderbilt and Jaden McDaniels missed the Monday game against the Pacers with flu like symptoms.  I believe the entire Wolves team is vaccinated fwiw.
Vando and McDaniels have been slowly improving on offense (Jaden more so) but I agree with your points
"Also a slew of quality role players.  Deni, Patrick Williams, Maxey, Saddiq Bey, Bane, Beef Stew, Jaden McDaniels, Okoro, Cole Anthony etc.... it was an above draft at the end of the day."
Yup second in the NBA. Right after his teammate Jaden McDaniels.
Jaden McDaniels
Jaden “””Kawhi “”Bobby “psycho T” Portis”” Leonard””” McDaniels
"jaden ""kawhi"" mcdaniels"
Jaden McDaniels literally looks like a psychopath all game. 0 emotion at all times.  He was known for just keeping a straight face and talking too much shit in high school. He called James Wiseman sewer trash for an entire game. But he never complains or talks.
"I guess that’s what having a Jaden McDaniels will for you lol. But it’s glad to see KAT finally playing good defense, he was a Defensive Achor at Kentucky."
Very interesting to see how close some brothers are on this graph -Jaden and Jalen McDaniels and Cody and Caleb Martin.
Jaden McDaniels could be probably a good 3 and D player for a while
Jaden McDaniels also playing much better off the bench.
Jaden McDaniels vs. Marvin Bagley  The battle of the supposed headliners of a Ben Simmons trade!
"Great point, appreciate the thoughtful response! It would probably help to define what throwing away Joel's prime means. To me it means losing your chance to compete for a title with this roster, which they had to some extent with Ben playing. They lose that by Ben sitting. They also lose that by trading him for Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley or the other rumored scraps that have been offered.   The question is: do they have a higher chance of improving the roster to a point where it could compete again by holding out and hoping the offers for Ben improve or trading him for a shit package now and then trying to use those and other assets to try and improve the roster? My money is on the former."
"three teamer:  PHI gets Lillard  MIN gets Simmons  POR gets MIN 2022 1st, 2024 1st, 2023 PHI 1st, 2027 PHI 1st, swap rights for a couple future MIN and PHI 1sts, Jaden McDaniels, Tyrese Maxey, and expirings from MIN  imo the Sixers should have traded Simmons for whatever MIN was offering during the offseason (my best guess is 2 1sts,  a swap, McDaniels, and expirings Bev/Prince, and then can just wave their war chest of assets for whatever star guards eventually hit the market (Lillard, Beal, or whoever)"
you're right how will the sixers ever find a package better than malik beasley and jaden mcdaniels oh no they're ruined...
That offer was unrealistic in the first place.  Jaden McDaniels is untouchable
Malik Beasley and Jaden McDaniels.

Jaden McDaniels      In earnest I'd want Cole more but Hali is really good
Looking back on this is hilarious. Jaden McDaniels and Malik Beasley.
"Firsts mean little here because they are trying to contend. Who were the good players? Jaden McDaniels and Beasley? Neither of them have shown me anything this year   From a neutral perspective he looks pretty unhappy, bad body language.. comments on the team losing and liking the tweet of #freekat are all signs of someone being unhappy lol."
"Would Indiana consider a package built around DLo for Myles Turner? Could look something like:  **Minnesota trades:** D'Angelo Russell, Jaden McDaniels and 2024 FRP.  **Indiana trades:** Myles Turner, TJ McConnell and Jeremy Lamb.  It gives Minnesota their stretch 5 and a point guard who will simply *facilitate*, while allowing Indiana to move Brogdon to the 2 and have a pure PG in DLo. Also gives them a solid option at the 4 next to Sabonis in McDaniels.  **Minnesota:** McConnell/Beverley, Beasley, Edwards, KAT, Turner with Beverley/McConnell, Lamb, Okogie, Vando and Reid off the bench.  **Indiana:** DLo, Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis with Duarte, Holiday, Craig, McDaniels and Goga off the bench."
"Makes our frontcourt even weaker than it is, and KAT is the higher ceiling player. Without KAT our starting frontcourt is Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels."
How has the “untouchable” jaden mcdaniels been this season so far?
"It's 2021, the NBA has been dominated by forwards for the last decade, and the forwards on that roster are Jaden McDaniels (pretty good defensively, but ultra raw on offense), Jarred Vanderbilt (great rebounder, has some talent, but a bench guy), Josh Okogie (really a guard, can defend, is abysmal on offense),Taurean Prince (is in the NBA because for some reasons NBA teams always assume a guy with dreads plays good defense) and Jake Layman (is in the NBA because he's white so people assume he's a shooter)  You don't win in the NBA with 0 quality forwards"
I always confuse Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels
This is the Jaden McDaniels I remember from UW
Banged his knee against Jaden McDaniels
"Bring back Kevin Love, obviously.  All we'll ask for is Jaden McDaniels and an unprotected first :)"
jaden mcdaniels is fucking awful and watching him play basketball hurts my eyes. its like watching a new born deer try to walk.
"Dude this whole “KAT can’t lead” is such a bullshit narrative  No, he can’t. Does that matter? Not really. The issue is the rest of the roster sucks they are depending upon Jaden McDaniels, Jared Vanderbilt, and Josh Okogie to make shots for them  KAT can’t just make those guys hit their shots. He’s got a shit team around him"
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
Well there you have it Jaden Mcdaniels MVP
Known Dunker Jaden McDaniels
"yes youre missing everything good he did lmfao. jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick. naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too. okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win. he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick. he overpaid juancho a little bit (but $7 mil a year is certainly not horrible), but then flipped him and culver for beverly, which significantly improves guard depth, experience, and defence to replace rubio while giving up two players who barely belong in the league and no picks.   rubio trade was bad, yes. dlo in minnesota is significantly better than wiggins was in minnesota, and theres a very good chance kat wouldve already demanded a trade if dlo wasnt there. it was worth it just for keeping kat happy if nothing else.   youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no. the wolves just have had horrible injury luck the last two years, that’s no fault of the GMs and its really stupid to judge him on that."
Jaden Mcdaniels and Anthony Edwards in their primes together will be monstrous
Kuzma is averaging more rebounds a game than Embiid.  Gary Trent Jr is leading the league in steals per game and is 2nd in deflections  Jaden McDaniels has the same amount of fouls as he does points
"horrible take lmfao he was the best wolves gm in years. wasn’t incredible but he consistently made solid moves, the rubio trade and culver pick were really the only questionable ones, and he only took culver bc he expected the cavs to take culver, not garland. ill die on the hill of the dlo trade being not a bad trade even if it wasnt great, and pickups like naz reid, malik beasley, jaden mcdaniels, and others show he has a great eye for talent"
"Missed most of this game because I had to go do something, when I left I honestly didn’t think we’d win, when I got back we were comfortably winning. From what I gathered it was a combination of a favourable whistle and the Wolves being the Wolves. So not a great W but I’ll take it. I did see that apparently Jaden McDaniels fouled out in 12 minutes of play time. I’m interested to know if they were mostly legit fouls or were they ticky tacky?"
Whatever it takes for Wolves fans to stop acting like Jaden McDaniels is an untouchable asset worthy of an all star in a trade.  Dude makes Matisse Thybulle look like an offensively capable player and fouls out in 10 minutes
Naz Reid catching strays and I won't stand for it! Thanks for having his back. D'angelo Russell is poop though. Jaden McDaniels is a project.
You mean “untouchable” Jaden McDaniels?
"kat on the suns would be unreal, i would try n snag jaden mcdaniels tool"
Chris Boucher for Jaden McDaniels who says no? ^^^^^^^^/s
"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
Our defense was fine through 3 quarters. We were on pace to hold them below 100 after 3 quarters.   What hurt us was:  1) Our best defender Jaden McDaniels fouling out very early. Wagner went off in the 4th once McDaniels went out.  2) DLo getting hurt. Having to run a very undersized JMac out there for big minutes in crunch time just didn't work. Which is why the Magic's guards went off on us.  3) Naz Reid getting destroyed (and injured) by Mo Bamba. Still pissed that wasn't a flagrant foul. Fucking ridiculous.  4) The Ref's were so incredibly one sided for basically 3/4th's of the game. At one point the Magic had like 15 FT's to the Wolves 2.  5) Our offense is a mess. I think that's really the biggest problem. They need to figure that out before anything else.
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
yeah tbh ben simmons prolly isn't even worth jaden mcdaniels like jordan mclaughlin and a 2028 second is prolly the limit with this much talent on the wolves roster
"Might be a homer for you lol   Check my flair I think Jaden Mcdaniels could’ve gone #5 also, also listed Cole Anthony and Desmond Bane too."
Desmond bane  Cole Anthony  Jaden Mcdaniels   Could all be picked at 5
Miles and Mikael Bridges…  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels…  Franz and Moritz Wagner….  Shit’s getting confusing.
one jaden mcdaniels pls
"As a wolves fans watching B.I. Knock down clutch jumpers with Jaden Mcdaniels playing the best 1v1 D you could ask for to secure the win this week against us, I disagree."
"How does Isaiah Stewart look this year? He played at my college and he looked good but really limited and basic, but I couldn’t tell if it was the coaching and role he was in. When he got picked 16th or whatever it was I was incredibly surprised, I was expecting him to go much later.   How is he doing? Jaden McDaniels is playing far better than he did in the year at UW so I’m wondering if Stewart is having a similar season."
"1. Injuries, this team played fully healthy in the first two games of the season but KAT's injury really derailed their season as a whole. We still don't know if the core of KAT, D'Lo, Edwards and Beasley is actually good because we have only seen them play for two games.  2. Coaching, Ryan Saunders probably made his gameplan around KAT and after he was injured he didn't have second plan. Hence D'Lo tried to carry this team but he failed miserably as only good teammate he had was Malik Beasley. (Anthony Edwards was pretty bad and inefficient.) He tried to implement a gameplan that obviously did not work, and he was fired after going 7-24. But in the great news, Chris Finch looks like he is a pretty great coach, at least after the ASB. The teams record is 6-10 after the All-Star Break and Edwards and KAT looks like completely different players. We knew what KAT was capable of but Edwards came in as a surprise as he is averaging 25 PPG with %54 TS after the all-star break.  3. While a trio of KAT, Edwards and D'Lo looks really good on the paper, basketball is a team sport at the end. Even if you score 60+ PPG as a trio every game, if your teammates are bad, you're not going to win the game. While they have great pieces like Jaden McDaniels, Malik Beasley and Naz Reid to an extent, other players are not helping. Jarrett Culver looks like he is a bust without confidence, Okogie is an offensive liability and Rubio, while his playmaking is still pretty good, he shoots %38 from the field. And the bad thing is I really don't know if they could fix this. We don't have a lot of trade pieces as our first round pick and second round picks were traded and I don't know if free agents would want to come to a team that is the worst team in the NBA.  4. KAT, Edwards and D'Lo are good, but their defense is really bad. To be fair, KAT and Edwards improved a little bit on that front, but they are still pretty bad. KAT improved his pick and roll defense and Ant gets a steal here and there but they just allowed 141 to an Indiana team that didn't have Sabonis, Turner or Brogdon. They are pretty [self-aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mmi27z/anthony_edwards_coach_cant_come_on_the_floor_he/) about their defensive problems and Edwards at least shows effort on that front but they still need to learn how to do team defense. We'll see if they will fix these problems in the off-season I guess."
"This is the other McDaniels bro, not Jaden."
"Nothing to add here, but I just want to say that I noticed Jalen and Jaden McDaniels have the exact same “run.”"
TIL there is a Jalen McDaniels and a Jaden McDaniels
"I love ant. Absolutely love him and think he’ll be a really good player. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t more confident in jaden McDaniels development, dude looks fantastic and seems like he’s got a good feel for the game"
Jaden McDaniels robbed
Saddiq Bey is probably the most underrated rookie this season. Jaden McDaniels has been amazing for the Wolves. Okeke has been a nice piece for the Magic. Tate has been just really solid recently too
Jaden mcdaniels is looking like a steal for the 28th pick
"I’ll give you the Wolves example.   Jaden McDaniels is already the best defender on our team, shooting .379 from 3 (Bey is shooting .381), and the entire Wolves board would take him over Bey.    Who’s the “easily a top 5 rookie” between them?  I’ll take my guy and you’ll take yours, as it should be.  There’s probably 5 or 6 other rookies who can make a case after the obvious top 3.   I’m just letting you know he’s “arguably top 5” not “easily top 5”."
"TIL Gladly = Thank God.  &gt;“We told Jaden [McDaniels] try not to let [Julius] Randle catch the ball, we’re gonna make somebody else beat us,” Edwards said. “Gladly, R.J. Barrett caught it, and if he would’ve made the shot we would’ve lived with it. I mean, because that’s who we wanted taking the shot. We didn’t want anybody else taking it.”  You should know the meanings of words before you use them."
Genuine question: Adding Schröder helps in comparison to Danny Green and Jaden McDaniels? I haven’t watched many Laker games this year.
Jaden McDaniels.  /closes app
"Having a PG who can't shoot and relies on a playmaking as his primary offensive value on a team with a bunch of non shooters (or offensive players in general) is also a recipe for losing.    I would agree with you if we were actually a competent offensive team without KAT but we're 27th on offense despite being KAT having a on/off of +10 when he's on the court (100% derived from his offensive value obviously) so when he's off court our offense is by far the worse in the NBA.    Like I don't think you realize how much anti synergy this roster has with Simmons especially when both D'lo and Beasly can't stay on the court.  Simmons is gonna play significant minutes with Edwards (31 3fg%), Rubio (29 3fg%), and Okogie (23.2 3fg%).  Jaden McDaniels and McLaughlin are decentish three point shooters but they're not good enough to commend that much respect.  With Simmons out there the lane is gonna be so clogged that the team can't even see the rim.  I don't see how this team is gonna get any sort of respectable offense going.    Yea the defense is going to be obviously better but this roster is still filled with enough negative defenders that decent teams can still found ways to exploit.  Overall it's just trading offense for defense so I really don't see how Simmons for KAT makes a difference especially not enough to make the playoffs."
"You can leave off Culver, but add Jaden McDaniels.  He's going to be a great role player, imo."
"I think Jaden can be a pretty good 4. He just needs to get a little bigger like Jerami Grant did. He's 6'10 too his going to be find at the 4. I hope you guys get Cade he would perfect for you guys. A lineup of Cade, Beasley, Ant, McDaniels and Kat is really fun."
A shot blocking PF and then Jaden McDaniels as the shot blocking 3 would definitely help.
Jaden McDaniels is so damn good. he fucking air balled as I was typing go damn it
Jaden McDaniels didn't stand there and let Embiid lean on him?  That's a foul.
"Twolves fans really liked him in the preseason and were baffled when he got cut. It's worked out for us with Jaden Mcdaniels getting his shot now, but dang."
1. KAT  2. D'lo  3. Beasley  4. Rubio  5. Ant  6. Jaden McDaniels  7. Naz Reid  8. Jaylen Nowell  9. Josh Okogie?
"Especially when you consider that he had arguably the best game of his rookie season literally this past Monday lol. Like it's perfectly fine to talk about legitimate criticisms, but people are way too trigger happy with labeling 19-year old rookies as busts. Some rookies, like Jaden McDaniels and Chuma Okeke, have started showing promise out of nowhere within the past week itself despite being completely unknown to 99% of this sub until now."
Jaden and Jalen mcdaniels
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
The fact that they have a coach who is just willing to run Jaden McDaniels out there for 36 minutes is an extremely positive sign for the future. He looks like he is immediately slotting into the “steal of the draft” spot.
Rosas. Turned RoCo into Beasley and the Nets pick which he turned into Bolmaro and Jaden McDaniels. Found Jordan McLaughlin and Naz Reid in the scrapyard.   The only blemish on his tenure was heading into this season without a real PF and drafting Culver.
That sounds like a job for Jaden McDaniels
"Patrick is definetly one of the most underrated rookies, dont know about him being the most underrated when Jaden McDaniels looks like a future all defense and isnt getting top 10 rookie recognition"
Jaden mcdaniels
Who the hell is Jaden McDaniels
"&gt;Yeah I was kind of cringing at them trying to trade for Gordon or Collins  Why? Gordon would be the perfect fit on this team and Collins isn't actually a terrible defender.  &gt;I think that’s the last thing they need lol. They need to be pursuing more defensive wings besides just McDaniels, especially on a team with KAT and D’Lo (Ant too right now, but he projects to be a better defender at least, but so did KAT...)  Our team is full of defensive wings (Josh Okogie,Jaden,Culver) what we need is a honest to God PF."
Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels exist.
Jaden Mcdaniels
Jaden McDaniels carried the team back and then Ant took over late in the fourth.
He is at his best not shooting 3s and just going into attack mode.   Jaden Mcdaniels is the one I think has every other team salivating for though. Made Julius Randle take tough mid rangers in the crunch and even denied him catching the ball which led to a possession where he didn't touch it at all
Don’t disrespect Jaden McDaniels
Jaden McDaniels is going to be one of the best players in this class
Jaden mcdaniels should be getting more credit. He really locks up the best players in the league while being great offensively
"definitely, though if they get Cade and get on that type of promising timeline, I like Jaden McDaniels in that role for them. KAT requires that kind of archetype, but also gives you the flexibility for that player not to be an impactful shooter"
"Jaden Mcdaniels has been on another level recently, not sure why he isn’t even top 10"
DLo has negative trade value though. And hold your horses about building around Jaden McDaniels lol
Not right away but down the line id think so. If KAT and dlo ever get traded using those pieces to build around Ant/Cade/Jaden mcdaniels would be pretty cool
Lakers literally have no answer for jaden mcdaniels
They're all scared of Jaden McDaniels
"But choose to bandwagon the Minneapolis Lakers flair...  Compared to the mess the roster was in when he got here Rosas has done an excellent job and the only glaring mistakes were heading into the season with no starting PF and drafting Culver in 2019 (he can still pan out but its unlikely and he made up for that mistake with Jaylen Nowell,Naz Reid,Jordan McLaughlin and Jaden McDaniels).   Another thing you can blame on him was Ryan but Glenn clearly chose the signing there."
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"For those who don't know who he is. He is the brother of Jalen from the Hornets. He was a top 5 high school prospect who had a rough year at Washington before falling to 28.  He's a skinny 3/4 hybrid that was seen as a project that would take about 3 years.  Due to poor performances from all of the PF's on our roster as well as dudes filling in at the 4 (Okogie, Layman, Juancho) both Vanderbilt and McDaniels ended up being forced into rotation.  Jaden has been an absolute revelation for us. He's a fearless defender that loves to get a block and is a decent scorer putting up a career high against New Orleans.  He has been the brightest of bright sparks this season alongside Malik Beasley. Some of our beat reporters like Britt Robson even believe that he will be better than Anthony Edwards, whilst that is unlikely, the sky is the limit for Jaden"
Jaden McDaniels this season
"Stanley Johnson sucks but he isn't next level, do-everything wrong-and-then-some terrible like Baynes  Edit: This post made me realize that Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people and some confusion I've had during the season now makes a lot more sense"
John Collins to Minnesota for something centered around Malik Beasely and Jaden Mcdaniels  Harrison Barnes to Boston for Romeo Langford and a first  George Hill to the Clippers for Lou Williams and Detroit seconds
Jaden McDaniels
Jaden mcdaniels
I laughed hard at Jaden Mcdaniels’ one because it was so low quality
"We traded 25 and 28, which were Immanuel Quickley and Jaden McDaniels"
"I am a huge Jaden McDaniels fan, I have been even before the draft but DPOY and comparing him to Issac who is a defensive savant is overstating it quite a bit to my eye"
Jaylen Nowell and Jaden McDaniels 48 points on 19-22 shooting lmao. We’re coming for that 12 seed 😎😎😎
"Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Nowell are the next NBA big 3"
how bad is the pelicans defense to let jaylen nowell and jaden mcdaniels score 48 on 19-22 shooting
Jaden McDaniels will go top 10 in a redraft this time next year.
Don't sleep on my Wolves' Jaden McDaniels!
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."
"Jaden McDaniels.  None of us expected him to get playing time this year behind Juancho, Vanderbilt, Layman and Okogie but he's forced Juancho, Layman and Okogie out of the rotation.  He's not doing anything crazy as a project rookie but he gravitates to the ball for swats. His stats aren't crazy because again he's a rookie coming off the bench but he's averaging a block a game, with 2 or 3 when he gets in a rhythm and has a very good 3 ball from the corner.  I don't think anyone can predict what he'll become but he has worlds of potential"
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"Jaden McDaniels is pretty underrated imo, he’s been better than I anticipated, but he still gets no buzz even though he’s a rookie."
"I think this draft class is gonna produce a lot of good pros. I think people seem to equate draft that has stars as automatically ""good"".  Ball, Edwards, Wiseman, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, Jaden Mcdaniels all look really good to me long term. I know I'm missing some but I'm a wolves fan so most of the games I watch are those.  Ive watched a lot of Edwards play and he does things that most guys can't. Better shot selection and playmaking will come in time.  His defense will get better as he matures. He has star potential."
"Michael Beasley, Jaden McDaniels sure as hell aren't ""ass"".  Kat's missed most of the season and now DLo is out. I don't know how good that team is when healthy, but they're sure as hell not gunning for the top pick bad."
Free Jaden Mcdaniels!
"I like the cut of your jib seasplash.   Get to know Jaden McDaniels too, he’s looking like he could be a steal at 28."
Can’t believe I got laughed off Reddit for saying I’d rather have Jaden mcdaniels over poku...I at least thought it’d be relatively close
"Anthony Edwards: Bad, but with flashes of brilliance. Shows a variety of offensive skills that just need refinement. Super lost and unfocused on defense, specifically off ball and screens. Has been playing more consistent since starting, up until these last two games.  Jaden McDaniels: Defense has been great. Man to man and shot blocking. Can hit the corner 3 well. Potentially a high end 3&amp;D guy."
"Jaden McDaniels hasn't done anything outstanding, but what he is doing he's doing well with shotblocking and corner 3's  Anthony Edwards is inconsistent, but you can tell he will be a fantastic 2 way player for years to come"
Edwards has been ok shown flashes Jaden mcdaniels is a good shot blocker and decent 3 point shooter
Jaden mcdaniels is the better version of pascal siakam
So Jaden McDaniels?
I know he’s not on here but I think jaden McDaniels comparison is Jonathan Isaac
"I'm trying to reconcile my thoughts on Saunders as a coach.  There are some obvious flaws in timeout usage, lineup combinations, etc. that have undoubtedly lost us a few games this season.  But we also have *so many* young players that are outperforming expectations this season.    Everybody thought Anthony Edwards was extremely raw and would need time to develop (which he didn't get because of the covid changes), but he has gotten so much better so quickly.  Jaden McDaniels was picked at 28 and was recently listed as the 10th best rookie so far.  Naz Reid has taken his offensive game to the next level in year 2, so now he's a threat to pickup 20 off the bench in any game and has upped his rebounding.  I'm sure it's possible that happens despite him, but it doesn't seem fair to give him all the blame and none of the credit."
"I'll get downvoted, but I think its wrong to expect parity between organizations and individuals. I think its also wrong to expect parity between individuals and individuals.    Fans are generally fans of teams and not individual athletes. So fans are right to be biased in favor of teams. If the Timberwolves have the opportunity to trade Jaden McDaniels for Lebron, of course the team should take the opportunities even if the players would be unhappy.    I also believe the more talented players are and should be granted more privileges than scrubs/role players. If LeBron wants to trade Lonzo, Ingram, and others for Anthony Davis, yeah, the Lakers should take that opportunit as well even if the players are unhappy.    I have no problem with with James Harden did to get out of Houston. I think he did everything in his power to better his situation and I would have done the same. But I also don't have a problem with Houston fans clowning on James Harden as well."
Shoutout Jaden mcdaniels!
"Fair enough. Certainly no debate on Saunders and Culver. I think the jury is out on the DLo and Edwards stuff until the team gets healthy and all plays together so we’ll see although you could absolutely be right regardless. On the other hand, some things Rosas has done well so far has been grabbing Beasley and Vanderbilt from Denver, signing undrafted Naz Reid and drafting Jaden McDaniels at 28 who have both been impressive."
You forgot jaden mcdaniels
"You're probably right, it's more like ""Jaden McDaniels stopped Pascal (more effectively than anyone else on the Wolves has been able to in similar situations)"". I just wanted to call out our rookie."
"Dude had a good game but this is not a ""Jaden McDaniels Stop"""
JADEN MCDANIELS IS THE TRUTH BABY!
Jaden McDaniels is a god
Ball and Ball backed up by Martin and Martin?  get Jaden McDaniels to Charlotte please
Bro you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Those Rubio &amp; McLaughlin lineups are 🔥🔥🔥  And why not pull out Jaden Mcdaniels for... Josh Okogie?? Sure why not!
"Where do the Ball brothers rank among active NBA brothers?  I got em 2nd  1. Steph and Seth 2. Lamelo and Lonzo 3. Giannis and Kostas (or Thanasis) 4. Jrue and Justin (or Aaron) 5. Brook and Robin 6. Marcus and Markieff (yeah I know that's disrespectful, but they're slacking this year) 7. Cody and Caleb 8. Jalen and Jaden (yeah the McDaniels are worse than the Martins)"
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
Jarred Vanderbilt and Jaden McDaniels
"Even worse, they traded Robert Covington for Jaden McDaniels and Ricky Rubio and traded Dario Saric to move up 5 slots in the draft to pick Jarrett Culver"
Why is jaden Mcdaniels not starting at the 4?
"&gt;Jaden McDaniels is a legit, big time -- I mean, look at the lift. He wasn't known as a defensive player in high school... as a McDonald's All American, but then -- he -- and really  terrific commentary"
Jaden McDaniels DPOY
God Jaden Mcdaniels is such a beast.
They're brothers? This whole time I thought Jaden McDaniels was on the Hornets I was so confused when I saw these articles of him having breakout games for the t-wolves. I thought he got traded somehow.
Jalen and Jaden mcdaniels? Jalen plays for the hornets and Jaden for the Wolves
RIP Jaden McDaniels welcome to the world Jaden Harris
Alaa then proceeds to rename Jaden McDaniels to Jaden Harris
"Tyler Bey and Jaden McDaniels  Tyler's going to be catching Luka lobs all day once he cracks the rotation, and Jaden is too much of a longboi to fail"
"Yo, what? Naz’s defense has actually been pretty good this year. He struggles a bit with size since he’s only like 6’9”, but he’s been a better defender this year than KAT’s been in his career.   Wiseman didn’t even really score on him much (aside from some of those 3s). He did more of his work against Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels (whom he outweighs by like 50 pounds)."
Anyone have numbers on how many blocks Jaden McDaniels had in the last coupla games he played ? 👏🏼👏🏼
That guy has to post a video of him shaving his beard.  But I'm thankful to Jaden McDaniels for my free Arby's sandwhich.
"[Jaden McDaniels three-points locks the Arby's sandwhich for Wolves fans !](https://streamable.com/29sntn)  Thanks, Jaden !"
Wolves has 9 blocks with 3 blocks coming from Jaden McDaniels. That's pretty nice.
[Good defense leads to a slam by Jaden McDaniels !](https://streamable.com/z5ji7i)
Why was I under the impression that jaden McDaniels was on the hornets???? Who’s the other rookie that the hornets got?
Is it really his fault the Wolves lack a 4 besides Juancho and Jaden McDaniels?
"&gt; The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired guard Dennis Schröder from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Danny Green and the draft rights to Jaden McDaniels, it was announced by Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka.  ...  &gt; Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey announced today that the team has acquired Danny Green, Terrance Ferguson and Vincent Poirier (pour-ee-ay) from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Al Horford, a 2025 protected first-round pick and the draft rights to Théo Maledon (No. 34 selection in 2020 NBA Draft) and Vasilije Micić (No. 52 selection in 2014 NBA Draft).   You guys got off Horford's albatross of a contract, but Green looks hella washed now. How are Ferguson and Poirier?"
"Funny, for the Wolves I would protect Jaden McDaniels over Juancho"
For sure. Now you have Ant Edwards and Jaden McDaniels. You're basically back at the starting line again with Wiggins and Lavine
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
If I had to make a guess they probably tried to fleece the wolves for Jaden McDaniels
