No no I did see him drop 45 on my high school though he was 1 grade ahead of me and I know a couple kids who laid him out on the football field his freshman year. On a side not I did also see tre Mann play as well when he was playing a game in tampa

Hawks Realistic offseason  * Sign and trade John Collins for pretty much anything * Extend Trae if he doesn't want to wait to make an all-NBA team and get the rookie supermax * Draft Tre Mann as a backup point guard * Hold out hope for the 2022 FA class and that Hunter and Okongwu can develop into top 40 players
he’s higher on my board than most but i think Tre Mann will be a steal
"Yep, suspect for sure. Tre Mann is 6'4.25"", with a 6'4 wingspan (3 inches shorter than Keon's) and still has an 8'2.5"" reach. How is he the same height, with a much shorter wingspan, but still a taller reach.  Gotta say tho, Ayo Dosunmu is the most suspicious lol. 6'5 with a 6'10.25"" wingspan but an 8'0.5"" reach? C'mon now."
Tre Mann will be a steal
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
Tre Mann is coming in the draft this year for the Mann memes. Frees up Terance to go full Star Wars.
"If there's a good time to give a free award, this was it. Congrats to the Clippers, especially those who were there during last year's playoff collapse. And to Tre Mann, who stepped up big time.   On the flip side, Donovan certainly didn't disappoint, but while I've heavily defended Rudy this playoffs, and still think that majority of the breakdowns were Ingles not rotating, there were quite a few miscues in the last 5 mins in the 4th that were absolutely Gobert's fault. Missed rotations, and failing to stem the drive earlier until Reggie and PG had gotten way too deep in the paint."
"Ok but that’s the way you should view it because that’s why the deal was made lmao. Also, read the next messages we sent to each other and I explained why While I like some of the prospects in that range none other than Tre Mann make me sad enough to give up that pick if it meant getting off Kemba’s deal"
"Naw I’m familiar with the class. It’s a great class but it’s top heavy. Realistically at 16, the guys in that range who we were gonna be looking at was Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Jackson, Tre Mann and Like Corey Kispert. Good prospects sure, but outside of like Mann I’m not upset about not being able to get any of those guys or more guys in that range if it meant getting off Kemba’s deal"
"Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15OA with the expectation that he would be a good 3+D in the NBA. Certainly no one expected him to be a top-5 NBA player but everyone expected him to be a defensive stalwart, especially once San Antonio drafted him.  Anyway, that's all to say that I absolutely agree with you on these things being teachable but that's why I'm suggesting it's a lazy comparison. He's got the size of Kawhi and is probably more athletic, but not much else is remotely comparable.  Any one of these prospects could flip a switch and develop BBIQ and defensive acumen. Will they? Likely not. But maybe they will. Even so, I'm not sitting here saying Jalen Johnson or Tre Mann or whoever else is going to be Kawhi Leonard because they have similar height.  I'm sure Kuminga will be a good to great talent. But I feel like the Kawhi comparisons are just sports writers pandering to GSW fans for off-season clicks."
"One of Deuce McBride, Tre Mann or Bones Hyland from this years draft class. Just gonna throw that out there nice and early"
"Hi! OKC fan here! I love giddey but no way hes better than Kuminga. I love Tre Mann but hes not better than Sengun, kai jones, jalen johnson. We really messed up. now we wait for Zion to request a trade"
"Tbh there is just a lot of good guards, i wasn’t really a Tre Mann fan but all of grimes/hyland/jaygup/Thomas seem like good picks imo"
"I'll answer as a fan of the Thunder.  1. I'm guessing they tried to trade up and were unsuccessful. Who knows what offer they gave Cleveland that they refused. #6 and 3, 5, 7 FRP's?, we will never know. This draft had a very potent (hype-wise) top 4, and they proved unable to breach it. 2. Presti didn't have Sengun high on his board apparently. Rumor is he would've taken Tre Mann at 16, so the move was easy to make on his end. Also, Presti swings for the fences in the teens, and it hasn't worked out in the past. He could have taken Brandon Clarke over Bazely, Quickley over Poku, Oubre over Cam Payne, OG over Terrance Ferguson, etc. Each of those players are good roleplayers. 3. Sengun has looked great in two Summer League games. Summer. League. In 4 months he will be regularly targeted in PnR and switches. Then this sub can start making judgements. I liked him at 16, but I don't run the largest scouting team in the NBA. 4. His philosophy for a rebuild is literally here: [https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward) . The goal is a championship, not the playoffs, and the NBA is the hardest league in the world to do this in. Championships are won by a top 7 player either paired with another top 20 player or surrounded with top 50 players and high level role players. GSW surrounded Steph with one of the greatest shooters of all time (Klay), one of the highest IQ players of all time (Draymond), Iggy, Livingston, and eventually KD (broke the NBA, not applicable in reality). 5. This was the first draft of the Thunder rebuild with a goal of a championship, not the playoffs. His goal is multiple star players, so he is looking at 2+ years of drafting. If Giddey is that player, great. If he's not, try again. If Shai is unhappy eventually, he will get traded, probably to a destination in his top 3 landing spots. Then they will swing again for another star player through draft or trade. That's how it will go. 6. The draft picks are for trades. Sure, trade ups happen, but the easiest way to get an All-Star caliber player in the modern NBA is trading for an unhappy one. The price is 5-7 first round picks/swaps and good young players. That may be Shai, Giddey, or another pick that looks promising. One star is available every year or two and the Thunder will be interested in most of them I'm guessing. Whether the player wants to play here will be a question as well, I understand, but a lot of young players grew up loving the Westbrook/Durant or Westbrook/PG Thunder, so they won't get discounted as easily as Sacramento or other franchises like that. 7. Houston's young players look great. Let's say Green, Christopher, and Sengun pan out and the equivalent of Dame, CJ, and Nurkic (this is a ceiling outcome for Green and Christopher, and a moderate+ outcome for Sengun). Where does that get you? If your cap is clear and you have assets, you could build a nice team around them and if they stay healthy you have a shot at a conference finals. But this is a big bridge to cross and I would recommend pumping the brakes on an assumption like this after 2 Summer League games. 8. Saying a rebuild is done in one season...I think that's only true if you hit on a top 7 player. Even if it's done, it is hard to build around talented players like that. See Dallas, New Orleans and Cleveland before Lebron left the first time.  9. In conclusion, time will tell. The NBA is a luck game and I'll trust the guy that didn't get us a championship but brought a lot of success last decade for us. I will question his picks and decisions, but I'm just a guy reading subreddits and watching scout videos on YouTube."
"You are being too harsh. I'll address your talking points in the order you presented them.  First of all, it takes two to tango with the draft slots. As many fans would LOVE to believe it takes just a compelling offer, the reality is much more nuanced. Almost every front office is enamored with their favorite prospects even in an ""average"" draft and won't be swayed as easily as you'd think. Few want to trade down, unless they are facing severe financial restrictions or are very, very, current Utah Jazz/LA Clippers-like confident in their core rotation. There are different levels of trust between various NBA front offices. It's also entirely possible that Presti's front office didn't see the '21 draft as THE draft to go all-in or at least halfway all-in with all the picks. They might prefer '22 or '23, since last season was their Year One of rebuilding. Also, they owe a lottery-protected pick to the Hawks from the Melo-Schroeder trade and they were dangerously close to being a play-in team before SGA got legitimately hurt.  Why did Presti trade Sengün? Because the average outcome of the 16th pick is pretty damn bad and you very rarely, if ever, get these kind of offers during draft day. Also, if you dive in juuust a bit deeper than the average fan to these picks - there are minimal chances that these Detroit and Washington picks don't convey. Especially the Detroit one, but you can place a good wager on the Wizards pick as well, if Beal stays in place or leaves in one year. There's also the fact that the picks are protected year-by-year, which gives OKC huge leverage with the Pistons and Wizards. In order to make moves for their team and using future picks, they probably have to negotiate with OKC to remove restrictions on their picks. That's semi-advanced CBA stuff that the average fan almost never considers, but something to keep in mind.  Now, shortening the rebuild. That's usually a somewhat terrible idea, especially after Year One. If you want to shorten it after Year Two or Three, fine. But after Year One and Draft One, you don't have enough young enticing first-round prospects to make significant moves down the line. After Year Two, you have 3-4 first-round players and that makes dealing so much easier, considering how valued the first-round rookie contracts are in the league by 23-25ish clubs.  We also have to reserve some judgment with Summer League. There ain't more than 3-5 legitimate defensive big men out there who are honestly NBA-ready. Sengün played with grown-up men last year and it's only natural he would feast, playing with late teenagers who are mostly coming out of the NCAA. We need to see what he will do against bigs, who are actually big and strong enough to deter him. His height and average wingspan might become a problem on the next level, even if his feel for the game is awesome. I'm not saying they will be a problem, but they might be.   Also, let's reserve a couple of years of judgment to OKC's own players, mostly Giddey and Tre Mann. Giddey is one of the youngest players in the draft and didn't have the chance to demonstrate himself in the summer league due to his unfortunate ankle injury. But 6'7-6'9 jumbo guard-wings can be very valuable in their own right, if they develop nicely. And 6'5 guard Tre Mann has maybe the sweetest 3-pt shot, which is ever-valuable in this league. But we need to give both of these guys at least two seasons to judge them somewhat correctly. The same applies to Sengün, of course."
Funny because Tre Mann was our first draftee from College since Sabonis. Presti has favoured non college guys for a while now but somehow didn't like Sengun
Tre Mann is listed as 6'5 and looks like a kid on TV. Would be hilarious if Cade just looks big because of the hair or something
"Kind of unfair to consider the specific player this late in the draft. We have no idea if Presti would have taken Sengun. Plenty of other teams weren't interested before Houston. If Sengun is a star, then every team that passed in that range fucked up, not just OKC.   Presti probably wanted Tre Mann and got him two picks later anyway."
So no one gonna talk about Tre Mann cooking?
Summer League check. Tre Mann road to Trae Young all going according to plan
"But they got giddey,shai,maledon and tre Mann wouldn’t okc just be better letting them 4 play?"
"With Tre Mann, Bazley, Theo, and Ty Jerome on the bench I like our young core a lot."
OKC has 9 players 22 or younger.  Giddey 18  Poku 19  Tre Mann 20  Theo 20  Hall 20  Bazley 21  Dort 22  Wiggins 22  JRE 20
"And Theo, Ty, Poku , Kemba and Tre Mann"
Tre Mann - went Suns -&gt; Miami -&gt; Philadelphia -&gt; Clippers -&gt; OKC
"$34 million a season for Ayton? No, he’s not worth that. Not even close. You can throw Tre Mann or Jrue Holiday on him in the paint and they give him trouble.   He’s good when he’s open.. but so was Luc Longley."
I loved the Tre Mann pick. Not big on their pick #6
Don’t forget Tre Mann
"Im happy with bazley, theo maledon and pokusevski 😁 Im also high on giddey and tre mann, (JRE not so much)"
"I don't think Giddey was a bad pick. He was taken earlier than he was projected to go (Presti has a bad habit of reaching and getting bad value for his pick) but GSW wanted him, and Minnesota traded up to get him. Worst thing was trading the highly rated Sengun, an 18 year old Turkish league MVP to Houston. Houston is a team Presti needs to be bad in the future. In return he got 2 HEAVILY protected (for many years) 1st round picks, which even if they convey, which isn't a given, will probably be in much weaker drafts at worse positions. Sengun would go in the lottery most years and would slot in nicely alongside SGA and Giddey. Very unlikely OKC gets 2 players that would equal his talent, or that they will be useful enough in trades to offset not drafting him, or even 1 of the other very talented players left at the time. Presti reached for Tre Mann as well who he likely coulda traded back and got later, typical Presti. He's quite frustrating on draft nights, he's great at trades but he's been a poor drafter for a decade."
Rumor was that we wanted Trey Murphy and Tre Mann. We didn’t get either so instead of reaching for Grimes and McBride at 19 and 21 they traded back and got future assets while still getting their guys
If you’re not happy you can give us Tre Mann.   Pls  That’s one of the 2 guys the Knicks were targeting
"Presti basically said that they were picking Tre Mann, rockets offered the two picks for 16 and they knew Tre Mann was still going to be there at 18, so they made the trade.   For whatever reason Presti and OKC weren't high on Sengun or the other players still on the board other than Mann."
OKC and not even because of Giddy the two other picks I very much like. Tre Mann and the turkish center
"tre mann, rip"
"I'd be pretty mad if I went into this draft basically capable of doing anything and came away with Josh Giddey, Tre Mann and two protection black hole picks in drafts likely less deep than this one."
I think you’re confused. He’s off the board and now we can’t take him! Or Kai Jones! Or Tre Mann! This could not be going any better
"Tre Mann, nice shot"
Tre MANN &gt; Trae YOUNG?
I'm happy with Zhaire and Tre Mann for Mikal :)
"Tre ""The Manntis"" Mann"
A NBA player named Micheal Carter Williams.. that have 3 name in one person..them there Tre Mann
"Tre Mann could have been taken in round 2, OKC jumped the gun here."
Terrence Mann vs Tre Mann next season..there can only be one
man they really got tre mann simping for this white woman as his special moment at the draft cmon cuhhhh
Yall throw on ABC. Tre Mann is spitting raps
Tre Mann sounds like a perfect name for a 3&amp;D hero!
Tre “Florida” Mann
Look at Tre Mann
Terrence Mann and Tre Mann related at all?
I want Tre Mann.   Imagine how much we'll save on Jersey stitching alone.
tre mann i guess?
I really like Tre Mann on the rockets
You mean they weren’t getting Tre Mann at 1?  Congrats to Detroit
Tre Mann will be the best point guard in this draft
"jalen johnson won’t fall that far, i like sharife cooper or tre mann on the rockets though"
"Tre Mann, Jaden Springer, Jalen Johnson (if he falls that far) would be good at that 24 spot."
Tre Mann is GM pick as well
"I like Bones Hyland, Josh Primo, Tre Mann, JT Thor and Aaron Henry"
Josh Primo will be Caris Levert level of impact   Tre Mann will be an all star level player    Bones Hyland is going to be at least a 15 ppg scorer in the league. I genuinely think you take him top 20 and wouldn’t be mad at anyone in the back half of the lotto   Jeremiah Robinson Earl will slip and be such an immediate impact people will be like how could we let another villanova guy slip.   I agree with your Santi Aldama pick but I’m going to one up it and say Sandro Mamukelishvili is going to be an impact offensive player off the bench immediately. The guy is an NBA player hands down. He’s Bobby Portis with slightly more playmaking flare
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"

Similarities between Terrance Mann and Tre Mann:  Terrance Mann: Michael Jordan with better hair.   Tre man: ???
"There is a clear top 4, but I'm impressed by the players even projected down in the 20s. Not as stars obviously, but potential high quality role players and so on.   People have mocked players like Thor, Tre Mann to the rockets at 23 and 24, and I would usually expect those guys to be high number lottery picks."
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"Last year definitely looks to be a great draft class, but I think the overall level of players in this years draft is better than last years. You have players like Tre Mann, Ziaire Williams, and Jared Butler mocked in the twenties right now. I guess we'll find out in a couple of years."
No Sharife Cooper or Tre Mann?
"John Wall when healthy was a top 3 PG  Fans and sometimes teams overrate the hell out of assets.   Example if you’re a middling or average team that can trade for an allstar or allstar level player that will more than likely make you way better you should do it. That random 1st round pick you’re holding so dearly onto will likely never be as good as the player you’re trading for, and if you’re trading for a GOOD player you shouldn’t have to worry about the pick being incredibly high. For example the bulls basically trade Wendell Carter, Otto Porter Jr, a first round pick that will likely never be an allstar,  and Franz Wagner who will likely never be an allstar for Vucevic and they should and would do it again.   Another example could be that Heat pick from a few years ago. Teams thought they hit a gold mine with that one Heat pick and what did that turn into? 18th pick Tre Mann right?"
Tre Mann will come off the bench too and see some minutes.
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn’t trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
"Led his team to the ECF as the best player while PG was ass in the playoffs and choked against the Nuggets. First NBA player to drop 50 pt game in reg szn, play in, and the playoffs, and also scored 60 pts and won while being down 32 against the Spurs. Took one game off of the Nets by scoring 50 pts and going against KD’s 39 and Harden’s 41 without his second best player in JB. PG redeemed himself in this year’s playoffs but u can’t deny that Reggie Jackson and Tre Mann were huge factors in winning some of the games for the clippers. Also didn’t PG choke in game 2 against the Suns by missing crucial fts. Meanwhile Tatum is 2nd in clutch/4th quarter scoring behind KD in this year’s playoffs. Tatum has shown up for big games and is way more consistent than PG."
OKC has a couple. Not because they suck but just cause they’re taking minutes from guys like Tre Mann &amp; Poku
"I like lonzo and BI and deandre hunter more than shai, so I don't agree but that was also a very generous return for george  The picks are not going to be lottery picks since they are miami and LAC first rounders for the next few years, in the 20-30 range unless one of those two teams falls off hard.    One of them already conveyed into tre mann at 18th overall in 2021  I would say those trades are probably equivalent in value so calling it market value or even above market value seems reasonable.  If you traded embiid you could expect to get a return similar to one of those hauls"
"I like Giddey at #6 a lot and I’ve grown to be a big fan of Tre Mann at #18.  But yeah, I’ve been complaining about not using or trading #16 for Trey Murphy all summer.   I think Giddey is a player you can build around—not as a star, but as a starter who fills up the stat sheet and plays winning basketball. I think you build around your core with shooters and front court finishers, of which we currently have neither."
Honestly feeling like I’d rather have seen Tre Mann with the ball in his hands there and Poku playing off ball
"Luka alone probably has more equity than the entirety of a team like the Magic or Thunder's ""young core"". Do you think any front office would trade Luka for all of SGA, Poku, Dort, Tre Mann, Josh Giddey, and Darius Bazley combined?"
Get used to seeing Tre Mann drain stepback 3s. Shit is smooth
Tre Mann not going nuclear against bam.
"That pick ended up as Thunder’s 18th overall in June, PG Tre Mann out of Florida. Pick traded five times over five years. Miami&gt;Phoenix&gt;Phila&gt;LA Clips&gt;OKC.   That’s a great PG man if he ends up making a ton of 3s, _Tre Mann_"
"You need to recheck your notes, because that's not what Philly got for Bridges. [Bridges was traded for Zhaire Smith and the pick that became Tre Mann.](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1009967477114195968?t=a6T7cXqlMKRnlG2POrUyqw&amp;s=19) Smith was subsequently [traded for Tony Bradley.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1330621750661566466?t=pLzD4eq61J_tXxw4if0k6w&amp;s=19) So that's what Philly got for Bridges: Mann and Bradley."
I think Tre Mann will outperform his contract value on his rookie contract. He’ll end up a sharpshooter eventually.
"I know Embiid forced Kawhi to rainbow that shot, but part of me wonders if Ben's would have been able to stay closer on it if Embiid didn't basically get in his way.     An alternate timeline where we fire Brett and trade Ben for a huge haul to find the 3rd guy to go with Jimmy and Embiid is the one where we are true contenders for 4-5 years.   Wouldn't have even needed to trade for Tobi, which cost us 2 1sts(Saddiq Bey, Tre Mann) plus Shamet in that scenario.   add those extra picks to the war chest, plus Ben's return and it's like a process level amount of picks only you have two of the top 15 guys in the league locked in long term to start with."
Tre Mann blows butt. Still not sure why we drafted him
"I mean we're not too optimistic picking recently at the 20s area (TFerg, Bazley) and our late teens (Poku, Tre Mann) have potential but still need a lot of work  Maybe we draft well in the top 10, maybe 30s and 50s area"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
"so far he’s proven to be purely a product of his environment, and is just a unique player mold      in 19-20 he had rookie-justifiable shooting #s, because okc’s 3 guard lineup set him up and he got lucky from deep      in 20-21 his shooting dropped but he got more counting stats as he became a regular starter      so far this season his shooting has dropped again and his counting stats have dropped.      theoretically: Baze should be an awesome transition player as a finisher or handler, a guy who can shoot modestly from deep and attack close outs. he should overwhelm smaller players with wingspan and size and overwhelm larger players with speed and ball handling and burst      in actuality: every Baze dribble is a mistake, and half of his 3’s have absolutely no prayer. he also is not a good finisher and sometimes is tentative about attempting to finish through contact, so basically on offense he doesn’t do anything useful now. on defense he is still often lost when brought into space.   some positives are that he seems to be a genuinely good rebounder, and is a great out-of-area shot blocker and in general is solid on defense in a simpler assignment.      OKC already has a backlog of players not getting minutes (Tre Mann, Aaron Wiggins, Théo Maledon, to a lesser extent JRE) with a ton of picks coming in down the road. unfortunately they will be forced to start punting super early on more developmental picks"
I like Tre Mann a lot
Tre Mann just put up 30 in the G League
"For the Thunder, JRE has looked super solid. Ready to be a great role player from day one.   Tre Mann hasn’t played much yet, but when he has, I’ve been so freaking impressed.  His ability to create separation either pulling up or at the rim is absolutely elite."
"I liked Tre Mann coming in to this draft, curious to see him if/when he gets a little more extended run. That OKC team grits it out, but sorely need some guys who bring something more than hustle on offense."
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
"Beautiful thing about the G League is that almost nobody watches the shit except for the most hardcore of hardcore fan or the most CASUAL of fan who just wanna entertain their kids for a few hours. If he goes down there and beasts it's expected. If he shits the bed he can easily play it off as recovering from injury. Once again, the barely-NBA ""I'm taking my kid outta the house"" fan won't care and the most hardcore fan will just type up their 1000 word essay on here about his footwork with a limited number of people paying attention as he's not on the main roster with that footwork.   It's smart for all 1st round picks recovering from injury or an obvious project to go down to the G. Thunder wise Poku did it and now Tre Mann is doing it. It's one of the rare times you get to be ""the man"".   If Wiseman was a 2nd round pick.....he wouldn't be so ""wise"" and he'd be scratching and clawing to stay on that roster"
