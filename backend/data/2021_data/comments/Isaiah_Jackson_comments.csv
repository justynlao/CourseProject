"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."

"Nope. They made Sign&amp;Trade to send Wood to the Rockets and got from them the 16th Pick (Isaiah Stewart) and Ariza  DETAILS The Rockets by trading Covington to Portland got Ariza+16th Pick+2021 Protected 1st.  Detroit then made a 3-team trade with Dallas and OKC. The Pistons got Delon Wright (Dallas), the Mavs got James Johnson (OKC), the Thunder got Ariza (Detroit) and Justin Jackson (Dallas)"
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that’s not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I’m perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can’t let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It’s early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that’s completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala’s three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don’t want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that’s just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn’t really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
"Absolutely not lol. The Pistons are a team that competes very hard. They are just so young and untalented. After grant and Wright, they are heavily relying on DSJ, Josh Jackson, Saben Lee, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart. 2 of those guys were busts and the other 3 are rookies. And that’s after losing Blake to a buy out and Rose to a trade. No coach is winning with a roster like that.   Compare that with their neighbors in the standings like the Magic, Timberwolves, Kings, Pelicans, Wizards, Rockets, etc who in my opinion who have much more talented rosters but are performing worse based on their expectations."
"I don't know how effective Marshall had been before but Wroten at least never got back to what he had been pre-injury. I was saying that they never fully recovered. TJ *was* better than them when they played that season. Hell, even Isaiah Canaan was better. That's why they were cut but he stuck around.  McConnell stepped over a lot of guys to become the starter. People forget how forgettable he looked in that first summer league. Hinkie signed Pierre Jackson and Scottie Wilbekin in July and it wasn't until September that TJ got a contract and invited to training camp. I bet he was getting worried. I know I was."
"Yup. Totally the defense. The supporting cast of Isaiah Canaan, Mike James, Ryan Anderson, Jimmer Fredette, Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson, Brandon Knight, and Elie Okobo all did what they could. Earl Watson and Igor Kokoskov coached their tails off... but Book's defense was just too bad 😔"

“ROTY contender Saddiq Bey”   “Absolute stud Isaiah Stewart”  “Josh Jackson has been incredible”
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
"Isaiah Jackson out of Kentucky I truly believe is gonna be one of those guys that a week before the draft, he's suddenly getting mocked top 10.   Dude is going to turn some heads once one-on-one workouts start, and some team with the need for a legit big man will reach for him. He's arguably the 2nd best ""true"" big man in the draft, and has insane defensive potential with insane athleticism."
"Eh, it’s not rude to say that about a team that basically nobody other than devoted fans keeps track of. Well, for one Saddiq Bey is easily one of the top-5 rookies in this year’s draft class and is arguably the second best three point shooter in it after Haliburton, so that’s something pretty much every Pistons fan is excited about. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty exciting to watch for us as well because of his defensive-minded and aggressive style of play, which is pretty much the definition of Pistons basketball, he also shown flashes of outside shooting which would make him a really nice building block moving forward, oh and he’s 19 years old so he’ll have plenty of time to develop here. Hayes doesn’t look like much just yet, but he’s also nineteen, is already a decent playmaker, has good size and plenty of potential. We also have a bunch of young players who have a good chance to help the team in long term, like Diallo, Saben Lee and Josh Jackson(who is a Detroit native and has been playing his heart out for us) and a bunch of cheap guys that we took a flyer on who try their best to prove their worth as NBA players(DSJ, Cook, Okafor, also Josh Jackson is in this category as well), never mind Grant proving himself as an All-Star candidate level of player. Also for the first time since 2003 we have a good chance of getting a high pick in the next draft which already looks quite promising. Obviously it’s not the same as having Sexland and Allen as far as young cores and concerned, but Garland and Sexton weren’t exactly spectacular their first year either, were they? So yeah, for the first time in forever Pistons have a clear direction and a definitive young group of players to build with and it’s quite nice to watch for the franchise that’s been suffering through mediocrity for the last 13 years. We’re in a rebuild right now, but I’d argue watching this team has been the most fun I’ve had as a Pistons fan since what feels like forever."
"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"

"Isaiah Jackson is gonna be a dude that rockets up draft boards as we get closer to the draft and teams start individual workouts IMO.  He's arguably maybe the 3rd best ""true"" big man in the draft, and the dude is ungodly athletic and has the talent to be a top tier shot blocker/defender.

"After watching him all year, I just don't understand how you take BJ Boston at all. Sure the argument is always raw is okay, that can be refined... but he's not just raw, he bad. Lays so, so many bricks and misses layups regularly.  I like Isaiah Jackson more but his strengths have been pretty phased out of the game. Strikes me as a thinner Montrezl Harrell, could build muscle as a pro."

"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven’t seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I’m not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we’ve played a lot better than our record so I’m optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"

I think this is right.  Sharife Cooper is going to be a late 1st round pick because he’s an undersized PG who can’t shoot.  Those are big issues to making him a lottery pick.  Sengun and Isaiah Jackson will both likely he lottery picks as well.
"I mean, we have *50M* to spend this year, the problem is that I can't see us using them all, not the other way lmao. Money are our last problem atm.   If Samanic finally shows out, yeah. I would love an hybrid PF/C to develop and maybe already get minutes off the bench. I'm thinking about Isaiah Jackson or Alperen Sengun, but even Usman Garuba or Kai Jones are viable options."

"If we drop down to 10 or lower, we're defs taking a project big man. This draft is filled with them, Kai Jones might still be around there or maybe Isaiah Jackson"
"I will maintain to the day I die that anyone who had Booker as an empty stats guy in 2019 is a joke and should not be listened to about anything NBA.   He put up 27/5/7 on 62% True Shooting with a rotating cast of starters, featuring such stars as: TJ Warren, De'Anthony Melton, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Elie Okobo, Isaiah Cannon, Tyler Johnson, and Kelly Oubre; each of those guys all started more than 10 games that season. Outside of Booker the only other consistent starters were a Rookie Ayton and Rookie Mikal. Warren and Oubre are probably the only two on that list who had any business being on an NBA team.  Booker saw the most double and triple teams out of anyone in the league and was cooking them with ease. Scoring that much, that efficiently is made so much harder when you have no other players on your team."
"Isaiah Jackson to the Hornets? We'll see.   They need to move from Zeller &amp; Biyombo that's for sure.  I don't even remember why Zeller was the 4th Pick from the beginning, but it's amazing to me how being a lottery pick guarantees that you have a 7-8 year career in the league at least. How that guy has been in Charlotte this whole time while more talented bigs like Mason Plumlee have bounced around from team to team is beyond me."

"So yeah, this is based on who i think will go higher, not who I think is better. I don’t think Mitchell is a lottery talent, but so many mocks I’ve seen have him as high as 6, I think he goes in the lottery, for better or for worse.  Another one is Isaiah Jackson vs Sengun.  I like Sengun better, but knowing Charlotte’s affinity for going for high profile college guys (plus the Kentucky pedigree) that I think they go Jackson.  Jalen Johnson vs Franz Wagner vs Corey Kispert also has me unsure where they are going to go.  Jalen clearly has the most upside but I really don’t know how much his “diva” antics at Duke will push him down. The opposite for Kispert - I think his defense is really sus, but his box score numbers might be super attractive to a higher lottery team to grab him"

Who do you think Presti would choose? I have a feeling he’s super into Isaiah Jackson with your other pick
"Damn, that's actually a much worse than it looks initially when you reexamine draft... when Kawhi, Klay, Butler, Kemba and Vucevic were still on the board. Hell even Tobias Harris or Isaiah Thomas. That was actually a great draft, a ton of role players that could contribute to championship level teams - the Morris twins, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, Bogdanovic. The odds were actually in your favour that year to get something worthwhile. Sorry that sucks."
Knicks taking both the UK guys? Isaiah Jackson and BJ Boston. More Wildcats on the Knicks roster is fine by me. Jackson is a beast on the boards.
"Post-lotto mock draft.

"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
"Larry Hughes, Shaquille Harrisson, Stephen Jackson,  Charles Oakley, Moses Brown, Isaiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Nikola Vucevic, Bob Cousy, Scottie Barnes, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Jackson..."

Mann and Jackson was going down there like it was Isaiah Thomas down there protecting the rim
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
Kai Jones probably doesn’t make it to 16. Isaiah Jackson I could see and he has a lot of upside.
"Naw I’m familiar with the class. It’s a great class but it’s top heavy. Realistically at 16, the guys in that range who we were gonna be looking at was Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Jackson, Tre Mann and Like Corey Kispert. Good prospects sure, but outside of like Mann I’m not upset about not being able to get any of those guys or more guys in that range if it meant getting off Kemba’s deal"
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
"Fantastic. What a bitch move, Aaron holiday is definitely better than Isaiah Jackson"

"Only 1 Holiday (Justin), Aaron was traded to WAS to acquire Isaiah Jackson in the draft."
"The 2018-19 Phoenix Suns if you removed DBook, Mikal, and Ayton.   Trevor Ariza  Tyler Johnson  Isaiah Canaan  Josh Jackson  Jamal Crawford  Ryan Anderson  Elie Okobo  Dragan Bender   with sharpshooters Troy Daniels and Jimmer Fredette"
Isaiah Thomas should still be in the league &amp; Mark Jackson should have a head coaching job somewhere.
"Houston:  De'Aaron Fox  Stephen Jackson  Jimmy Butler  Emeka Okafor  De'Andre Jordan  We also have Justice Winslow, Kelly Oubre, Justin Jackson (Who all played for the Houston Hoops with Fox), TJ Ford, Gerald Green, Carsen Edwards, Quintin Grimes, Joe/Jacob/Michael Young, Jonthan Simmons   Dallas: *where l was born  Marcus Smart  Grant Hill  Julius Randle  Chris Bosh  LaMarcus Aldrige   Also CJ Miles, Isaiah Austin, and some young guys like Cade Cunningham, and RJ Hampton"
Nooooo I wanted to watch Isaiah Jackson
Isaiah Jackson ROY
idk why everyone's out here acting like Nerlens isn't the biggest reason their defense was what it was last year. Isaiah Jackson got drafted in the first because people think he can be Nerlens. dudes a really solid and athletic rim protector. he's not just good in 2K
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
How did this include Indiana? They already traded Holiday and a pick or something for Isaiah Jackson.
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
"I think the pick that went from Washington to Indiana (which became Isaiah Jackson) was originally from the Lakers this year, and went to Washington as part of the Westbrook deal."
Through the Wizards. The Pacers got pick 22 (Isaiah Jackson) in exchange for Aaron Holiday and pick 31 (Isaiah Todd).
"From a brief look at the depth chart, feels like you guys need more of an actual passer rather than. ascorer? Like Rondo vs. Reggie Jackson, George Hill vs. Isaiah Thomas... someone to set the table is what I mean."
I definitely like your young guys from the draft in Chris Duarte who is a nice large guard and Isaiah Jackson who can translate into a pretty good defender in the front court. Hopefully Warren comes back healthy too

No we already traded Pick #22 Isiah Jackson to Indiana for #31 Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday.
Jackson has already been traded to Indiana for Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday so this trade can’t happen.
"i think the idea is something like kings get kuzma and the new rookie isaiah jackson and 2 future seconds wizards get dennis schroder, montrezl harrel via s&amp;t and kcp lakers get russ and buddy.  at least thats how it would go down if we were to expand this deal   kings getting back kuzma, a fresh center who RIMRUNS and would be a good fit with fox, and 2 future 2nds is a good reasonable haul for buddy in my opinion"
Kings would get Isaiah Todd not Isaiah Jackson. Was “traded” 22 to Indiana for Isaiah Todd and Aaron Holiday.
isaiah jackson is a pacer - he was taken with the 22nd pick but then traded (by the zards) for aaron holiday and the 31st
Isaiah Jackson is a Pacer I believe
So is the deal official?  Which team does Isaiah Jackson currently belong to?
Isaiah Jackson was traded to the Pacers no? So this would have to be a 4 team deal.
Isaiah Jackson is on the Pacers. How would him being sent to SAC happen?
Isaiah Jackson was already traded to the Pacers for Aaron Holiday. The deal for Hield was supposed to be just Harrell and Kuz.
"I’m thinking they alter the trade into a three team deal where the following happens:  • Russ &amp; Hield go to LA ($66M incoming — $57M outgoing but keeps them under the tax)  • Schroeder, Bagley &amp; KCP go to Washington (~$44M incoming; ~$44M outgoing)  • Kuzma, Harrell &amp; Isaiah Jackson get moved to Sacramento (~$24M incoming; ~$33M outgoing [more space for Holmes])  I don’t like it but as a Kings fan I don’t hate it either"

Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
"Isaiah Jackson makes a lot of sense for either Sacramento or Washington, honestly."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
im mad the pacers didnt. not mad about the isaiah jackson trade though
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
"Isaiah ""Action"" Jackson"
"So Lakers drafted Isaiah Jackson for the Wizards, who then trade the pick to Indiana for Aaron Holiday. Got it."
Silver: we have a trade.... Lakers.....  me: oh shit what did we do again  the right of Isaiah Jackson to Pacers via Wizard  me: psh
Didn't Indiana just trade 4 seconds for 31?  So those and Aaron holiday for Isaiah Jackson?
"Isaiah Jackson looks like Kawhi's father.   They need a PG but Beal, KCP, Kuz, Rui, Bertans, Jackson, RoLo is a nice group. Maybe Deni can be the PG?"
Isaiah Jackson
Isaiah Jackson looking like movie star Khris Middleton
Lakers legend Isaiah Jackson
Wizards trading Isaiah Jackson to Pacers...
Isaiah Jackson for the wizards please
Should have taken Isaiah Jackson.
Please Isaiah Jackson!!!
"I'm super tired so I'm going to stop watching and start reading the picks on CBS. Here's my reaction in advance to Isaiah Jackson and Sharife Cooper getting drafted: ""oh shit [XYZ Team] got themselves a fucking star"""
Sharife is still on the board but New York has Kentucky roots so I’m going Isaiah Jackson for them
"I am begging us not to take Isaiah Jackson we already have a rim protector and they’re not hard to find in FA.   If we’re looking for a defensive center, Garuba has to be the guy. The best defender in the draft imo and has a different, unique skillset from the guys we currently have"
LaMelo's Spire teammate Isaiah Jackson?
Kinda hope the Kings stretch for Isaiah Jackson. That dude's gonna be a fucking STUD
Isaiah Jackson looks like 2chainz
My takes for this draft: Sharife Cooper and Isaiah Jackson are going to be the sleeper steals of this class. They're fucking great
" Chris Webber &lt; Isaiah Rider, Terry Dehere, Sam Cassell   No _________________________________ Elton Brand &lt;&lt; Jonathan Bender, Corey Maggette, Andrei Kirilenko  Maybe ______________________________________  Andrew Bogut &lt; Raymond Felton, Sean May, Luther Head  Eh ____________________________________  Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson  What the fuck are you smoking?"
"1993: Chris Webber &lt; Isaiah Rider, Terry Dehere, Sam Cassell  2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West   2010: John Wall &lt; Demarcus Cousins, Ed Davis, Damion James  2011: Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson  2018: Deandre Ayton &lt;&lt; Trae Young, Jerome Robinson, Anfernee Simons   I'm not sure at all about those"
"Agreed. I'll be very surprised if he slips past the lottery, he should absolutely be valued. All of the big men are great in this class, but Jackson is one of the best in my eyes. Reminds me of a fellow Isaiah that's on the Pistons, tbh"
This is a pretty tame take but Isaiah Jackson has the potential to be one of the best players in this draft with the right team and development. A big like him that has a silky mid-range shot and can hit reverse layups with all defensive upside is rare to come by.
This would be pretty huge for the Lakers  If they can grab Isaiah Jackson or Jared Butler  at 22 it would be amazing for them
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
"I definitely expect Kai Jones to go to No. 11 at Charlotte. And that's a lot higher than people thought he would go about a month ago. Isaiah Jackson continues to be linked to the Knicks.   I think there's a real belief among NBA personnel that Barnes can go #4, but yes, it could certainly be Suggs."
"The Knicks are surely trying to trade up, but it doesn't sound like they have any juice to move. Isaiah Jackson continues to be the loudest name rumored to NY."
"1) Is there anyone in this draft that you think/have heard rumbling about, that might go a lot higher than they're currently mocked to be picked, or anyone you think could have an unexplainable drop?   -------------------------------  2) Kai Jones and Isaiah Jackson seem to be two of the most polarizing players in this draft, with mock drafts having them anywhere from a borderline top 10 pick to sometimes even the 2nd round (more so regarding Isaiah Jackson). Any thoughts on them as prospects, and where you think they finally end up getting picked?   ---------------------------------  3) Scottie Barnes has seemingly exploded in media hype over the past week, with reports yesterday even saying Toronto could potentially pick him at #4. Is this just typical draft week over sensationalized hype to stir up discussion? Or is there truly something there?"
"Star: Suggs Bust: Kuminga, Keon. Isaiah Jackson Steal: McBride, Cooper"
"Isaiah Jackson goes in the lottery or even at #10, everyone absolutely fucking rags on the pick and laughs at the team that takes him since a lot of sites have him mocked anywhere from lottery to 2nd round, and he ends up being on one of the All-Rookie teams."
"If they trade down to 16-20 it’s very likely one of Jones, Sengun or Garuba will be there, and if not there’s Isaiah Jackson. If they get another pick in the 18-21 range they can potentially get a shooter too like one of Kispert/Duarte/Murphy"
Somewhat but I think Dort would defend the best player then you draft Barnes as a 2way guy and Isaiah Jackson to anchor the defense.
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11. Alperen Sengun (Charlotte Hornets) 12. Keon Johnson (San Antonio Spurs)  13. Davion Mitchell (Indiana Pacers)  14. Chris Duarte (Golden State Warriors)  15. Corey Kispert (Washington Wizards) 16. Trey Murphy (Oklahoma City Thunder)  17. Cameron Thomas (New Orleans Pelicans) 18. Jalen Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder)  19. Kai Jones (New York Knicks)  20. Jaden Springer (Atlanta Hawks) 21. Ziaire Williams (New York Knicks) 22. Jared Butler (Los Angeles Lakers) 23. Isaiah Jackson (Houston Rockets) 24. Sharife Cooper (Houston Rockets) 25. Tre Mann (Los Angeles Clippers) 26. Joshua Primo (Denver Nuggets) 27. Miles McBride (Brooklyn Nets) 28. Quentin Grimes (Philadelphia 76ers) 29. Day'Ron Sharpe (Phoenix Suns) 30. Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
"Some fanbase is gonna be fucking pissed when they take Isaiah Jackson in the lottery, lol.   Dude's been mocked anywhere from #12 to like early 2nd round it seems."
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
"Fuck it, Isaiah Jackson at 10 for the Grizzlies."
KPJ is a better playmaker than scorer. I think Green is the scorer that the Rockets need  They can snag Isaiah Jackson with 23/24

Your Isaiah Jackson prediction reminds me of what happened with Isaiah Stewart
"Isaiah Jackson ends up going mid-lottery and people will laugh at the pick cause most sites have him projected as a late 1st rounder or even a 2nd rounder depending on when you last looked, while some sites have him as high as like #12.    He goes in the lottery, shows himself to be the 2nd best ""true"" big man in the draft, and establishes himself as a defensive stud in the league.   ------------------------  Kai Jones' stock is gonna keep on plummeting next week and people will act like he might be available at the end of the 1st, before he's drafted in the lottery."
"if they drafted Isaiah Jackson at 10 over Jalen Smith, Beef Stew might have swung the championship lmao"
"I know it just asked for top 3, but:  Oscar Robertson  Nate Archibald  Mike Bibby  Jason Williams  After that I don't have a definitive ranking because it depends on if it's only the time they played for that team, of career regardless of duration with team.  Honorable Mentions:  Isaiah Thomas, Spud Webb, Bobby Jackson"
"Not as good as anyone else who's an NBA TV personality probably. Good rotation player but not the same level on the court as the rest, but he has a pretty excellent TV personality.   Shaq, Chuck, Mchale, Garnett, Magic, Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Chris Webber, Isaiah Thomas, Mark Jackson, Bill Walton, Richard Jefferson, honestly I can't think of any (national) NBA TV personality he was better than. Maybe Scalabrine and Kendrick Perkins lol"

"He got a future first round pick, a 2021 first round pick (Isaiah Jackson), a couple of seconds, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Montrezl Harrell (on an expiring contract). It may not be a massive haul but it’s a pretty damn good one for one of the worst contracts in sports."

Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
"The whole ""but he's old"" thing was so dumb. Even if he gets no better, he's already one of the best players on the team. And he'll clearly get better as he plays/practices more with/against pros. We have an issue with getting young players with potential, building them up, and then having them leave in their prime for other teams. Duarte will be on a rookie deal during his prime. It's awesome.   As far as the ""high risk, high reward"" picks, we also made one of those. We took a super raw, young prospect with elite athleticism with our other first round pick (Isaiah Jackson). So it's not like we went with a ""safe bet"" and we're ""scared to take risks."" We took the best guy available and then took a risk with a later pick.   I'm super high on Duarte and his ability to hit shots, even contested, both off the catch and the dribble. He looks like a top 5 defender on our team already, too."
Chris Duarte will be ROY and Isaiah Jackson will be the steal of the draft. Think I'm being biased? Well I am. Blow me.
"In a few years, Isaiah Jackson"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"1. Outside of the top few picks, he was the surest thing in the lottery, and he isn't done growing. His story is amazing. Works out with a pro. Immigrates to the U.S. Community College baller. Oregon stud. He is exactly the type of player coaches love.  2. The Pacers are always a win-now team. The market, and the hope for a trip to the playoffs, drives the team. In this draft, Isaiah Jackson is the gamble, high upside pick, and Duarte is the wing who is NBA ready with room still to grow. He's looked good in summer league, good in pre-season, and he will look good in the regular season.   Essentially the FO is always serving two masters: winning now while also trying to uncover a mid-first stud or 2nd round gem with an extra pick."

"Not OP, but I think we did both! Duarte is good now, but doesn't have a superstar ceiling, and we got Isaiah Jackson at #21 who's 18 and has a very high ceiling as a two way big with Bam Adebayo vibes."
"Carlisle's praise of Isaiah Jackson, who is 19, has been glowing, to put it lightly. I think he will play as well."
"If you look at Indiana’s final 12 games, their offense scored over 120 points 7 times and 115 2 times with many borderline NBA players playing often with most of their starters (including Turner) injured for good at that point  In those games Sabonis averaged 22/15/11 with unreal efficiency playing at center  Sure they fired their coach soon after but I think the pacers have a ton of potential offensively and can sort of become like Denver with Sabonis at center.   Brogdon is more of a combo guard like Murray, Levert and Warren can play similar roles like Barton and MPJ. Oshae and Craig can play the 4, let Goga/Isaiah Jackson be the backup 5 when Sabonis is out of the game   When Sabonis is out, just play McConnell off the bench"
"Chris Duarte might be a player Philly likes because of his 3&amp;D ability, as well as being able to play right away. Also, Isaiah Jackson might have some appeal to Philly to use in a trade later on…"
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"Derozan is only making the Hall if he plays long enough to accumulate enough points.  It would be a technicality and controversial.  Lowry is unlikely to make it unless the Heat win a title with him.  HoF's in their prime he beat in the East working backwards...Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Mutumbo, Webber in Washington in year 4 (clearly not as good as his Sacramento days so he can be ignored), Shaq in Orlando year 4 (again not as good as Lakers Shaq still much better than any player Lebron faced in the East), Patrick Ewing, Dominique Wilkins, Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, and Charles Barkley on the Sixers.  Many of these guys he beat multiple times.  He never beat the Celtics in the playoffs.  He lost twice and then was on opposite sides of the bracket going forward.  He lost to them with Bird, McHale, Parrish, Bill Walton, and Dennis Johnson in his 2nd and 3rd year.  Bill Laimbeer might make it.  Mark Jackson will eventually make it based on his stats.  Neither are all time greats, but they would be the equivalent of a Lowry or Derozan making the Hall."

"they just need to relocate at this point. they've been doing shit like this ever since lebron was drafted. they let boozer walk away for nothing while being a rfa. they signed larry hughes over ray allen or michael redd. didn't want to trade jj hickson for prime amare stoudemire or iguodala. didn't want to trade kevin love for paul george in 2018 or they could have traded kyrie for middleton and bledsoe instead of getting isaiah thomas and  a bunch of make a wish kids. not to mention drafting luke jackson infront of josh smith and kevin martin. drafted dajaun wagner over amare stoudemire and caron butler. also drafting dasagna diop over joe johnson, zach randolph, richard jefferson and gilbert arenas. traded jamal crawford for chis mihm. drafting anthony bennett. the whole franchise is a joke"

Pacer's future hall of famer Isaiah Jackson.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Okobo, Rookie and 2nd year versions of Josh Jackson, Chriss and Bender with the corpse of Tyson Chandler out there.  The team was disgusting, if not for Book we'd have been competing for the worst record in league history."
"Isaiah just lost it and fired a 5 lb. plate at Lebron. He missed way high and hit veteran center Trey Lyles in the back of the head. He had no idea what hit him. Isaiah actually felt pretty bad about it; Jerami Grant thought it was hysterical. Lyles was out cold and we had no idea what to do. Corey [Joseph], Saddiq, and Josh Jackson carried him to a massage table and laid him face down so anyone who saw him would just think he was waiting to get a massage. I had about 20 or 25 extra headbands in my locker so I just started wrapping those around Trey’s head to try to stop the bleeding."
"The Pacers are currently 5 games under .500 and they just upgraded bald coaches from Bjorkgren to Carlisle. I'm curious to see if the franchise finally decides to blow it up, turning him into a tank commander/development guy, and trade Sabonis, Turner and/or Brogdon for picks + young players. Their remaining schedule is the 9th hardest (as far as opponent W/L goes), [per tankathon.](http://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength)  They pretty much only have their own assets as far as picks go after 2023, and they have a couple seconds in the immediate. As far as contracts go, they only have Brogdon, Sabonis, and McConnell signed through the '23-'24 season, as well as their rookies, Chris Duarte and Isaiah Jackson.  So yeah, Pacers... whatcha gonna do?"
"Suns - it's honestly McGee, although Ayton and Bridges can be close. Pistons - Hami Diallo, even though he doesn't get much playing time. Thunder - Dort lately, but Bazley has the hops no one other on the team has. Wizards - I'd guess Trez, because of his intensity. Cavs - Allen right now, but Mobley can take the crown. Pacers - Isaiah Jackson?? It can't be Kelan Martin or Brogdon, right? Spurs  - Keldon Johnson and it ain't particularly close, even though Lonnie Walker might argue so. Kings - Richaun Holmes. He is a bowling ball. But Harrison Barnes can surprise you with the hops every now and then. Fox can do some mean dunks. Mavs - DFS."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"The current starting lineup:  Cade Cunningham   Killian Hayes (or Diallo/Jackson for some)  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Isaiah Stewart  It’s just they can’t hit a thing so far this year, and Casey is up to his usual fuckery"
"Good: Bey, Cunningham playing great, CoJo barely playing.  Bad: Jeremi fucking Grant, Hayes, Isaiah missing a lot of wide open layups, zero effort on D and Josh Jackson.  On to next!  Fuck Casey for benching Diallo, trying to ""teach him a lesson""."
"Isaiah Thomas is just such a contrarian fuck for no reason, this quote will only appeal to people who don't remember phil jackson calling out shaq or kobe from those laker team, but any quick search on your own time and you can find the headlines, he's just a joke of a human"
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
That of could be Isaiah Jackson in a year or two. I think the idea of trading up for him is that he could be paired with either sabonis or turner.
"Hall of Fame Tough Guys:  * Charles Oakley (The Goat)  * Ron Artest (peaceful until you trigger him)  * Isaiah Thomas... hate him or love him (i stopped caring), but he was the head of the Bad Boy Pistons for a reason.  Also:  * Stephen Jackson (Cap Jack doesn't fucking play)  * Z-Bo (reformed toward the end, but Zach was NOT someone you would fuck with. If Gasol and Conly were the brains of Grit &amp; Grind; Zach was the muscle; watch the exchange between him and Perk during a game)  * Speaking of, Kendrick Perkins - he may be an idiot on TV, but you also kind of didn't want to fuck with Perk on the court."
"Jesus, the whole Santa Clause BS needs to be retired. It's time to update the event that generalizes the whole Philly fanbase. Pick from below:  1. Not going to games at Shibe Park because they didn't like how ""the area was changing.""  2.Destroying Shibe Park.  3. The insane amount of racism Dick Allen experienced from Philly fans while playing for the Phillies.   4.Annoying the hell out of Mike Schmidt who called them "" an uncontrollable mob scene.""  5. Booing Michael Irvin while he was on the ground almost paralyzed.   6. Throwing batteries at JD Drew  7. Throwing up on a cop and her daughter.   8. Fans coming to the defense of Mikey Miss (radio host) who mocked Victor Cruz's career ending injury.  9. The Flyers fan who had ""the black guy"" on the back of his jersey instead of Simmonds.   9. Fans rooting and defending a dude who raped and murdered dogs.  10. Rooting for racist-ass Riley Cooper, yelling ""Cooooooooop!!!"" after every touchdown he scored (which wasn't that many).  11. Screaming for Desean Jackson to get out of town when he was ""supposedly in a gang."" (he was not).  12. Defending the same player when he came out as a fascist. (which he most definitely is).  13. Throwing shit during Ed Snider's Memorial night.   14. Sending death threats to Jake Diekman, Trent Thornton, and Jadevon Clowney.  15. Giving the middle finger and yelling ""fuck you, fuck"" to Isaiah Thomas in hopes of getting a free frosty.   16. Eagles fans yelling racist shit to Mike Scott.  17. Eagles fans punching horses.  18. Eagles fans burning down their city after the Super Bowl.  19. An Eagles fan microwaved his girlfriend's dog after losing to the Saints.   20. Throwing shit on Russell Westbrook.  21. Eagles fan murdering a Giants fan just a few months ago outside of Pat's steaks, arguing over which team was worse.  22. Getting in countless fights with the opposing team.  23. Getting in countless fights with each other.  24. And just yesterday throwing shit at the friendliest guy in bball--Kemba Walker.   25. Oh yeah, they also had a freaking jail at the bottom of Veterans Stadium.   Does that answer your question?  PS: All mostly off the top of my head. I could go on but I feel 25 is the perfect number to end at."
