Jarrett Allen revenge
In what universe do you think Nets fans dont miss Jarrett Allen? one of the popular posts on the subreddit right now is a snowman recreation of the fro
It's weird that Nets fans don't miss Jarrett Allen
"Bickerstaff simplify the game for Sexton just get buckets and surround him with Jarrett Allen, Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, and Issac Okoro play on ball &amp; help defense, set screens, and make extra passes."
Jarrett Allen as a rim protector is finally getting some respect on his name his absence is huge and the Cavs have enjoyed him so far
"Yes, I read the article.   I think you are grossly overestimating what a casual fan cares about. No casual fan gives a damn about DeMarre Carroll vs. Jarrett Allen or Chris Chiozza vs. Landry Shamet. Those might as well be computer generated names for all they know.  It's about atmosphere, stars and nostalgia."
Scary to think how much better Harden would've made Jarrett Allen

"I think that when they get deeper in the playoffs, the more their porous defense will be exposed and if they don‚Äôt get a rim protecting big they are screwed agains teams like the Sixers and Bucks in a 7 game series  Losing Jarrett Allen was huge for them and made them one of the worst defensive teams in the league   The Harden trade made me think of the expression ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one ball‚Äù   I suspect they‚Äôll be out by the Eastern Conference Finals"
"Jarrett Allen, Derrick rose, buddy hield, JJJ, and D-Lo over John Collins?"
Nets could use a guy like Jarrett Allen right about now
"Jarrett allen only played 24 mins in that hawks game , that's ridiculous  Diallo went off for 25 and shai went off for 31 in that thunder game, you just have to take the L on that one, but that isn't jarret's fault   Jarrett Allen has a high rebounding rate, a very high block rate, and players shoot a lower percentage at the rim, these are usually indicators of a good to great defensive center  I don't think anyone is saying that the nets are doomed, most people would agree that they are still a lock for the ECF, the only issue is that KD and Kyrie have been injured for most or all of the last three years, can you really count on them being available for 40 mins a game for rest of the year and the playoffs   And let's not pretend that the last good nets win wasn't against the bucks lol  They lost twice to Cleveland , beat the hobbled heat twice, beat an ok atlanta team, and then beat okc and the wiz , this next six game stretch will show us where they're at for sure"
"Dude I‚Äôve watched every game, we were in desperate need of a playmaker.   We were at .500 with Jarrett Caris KD Kyrie. We went from looking indestructible to completely lost after Dinwiddie went down.   We gave up 141 to the Hawks and 129 to the Thunder (one of the worst offenses in the league) With Jarrett Allen. He‚Äôs a great center but not irreplaceable. Javale won‚Äôt fix our problems but neither was Jarrett.   It‚Äôs hilarious to me that all of these people are saying this. We‚Äôre still second in the East and have gone 6-2 in games with Harden. 7-3 since trading Allen. We‚Äôve looked really really good with Harden."
What are you talking about?   I never said anything about Allen being a play maker. I‚Äôm saying we didn‚Äôt have any play making and now we do because we have James Harden.   I don‚Äôt know what to tell you if you really think Jarrett Allen and Caris are better than Harden? It‚Äôs ignorant.   Even Javale if we can get him in the buyout will bring our defense up far beyond where it is. It‚Äôs not that hard to find a big. There‚Äôs no replacing what James Harden brings to the table.
"He's been killing it all year! Lol you are the one who only has a one game example of him not having a good game   The defense was sub par because defense is a team stat, jarrett has been holding his own   Asking jarrett allen to be a playmaker is wild , that's not even his role or skillset, there's only like four centers in the entire league that are actually good playmakers anyway lol  Bottom line, jarrett is better than DJ and DJ is going to cost y'all a lot of close games"
"It‚Äôs obvious Jarrett Allen is the better fit for Cleveland and fans want him over Drummond, whats the possible landing spot for Drummond? There have been reports from some less than reliable sources that he‚Äôll be traded soon, possibly a buyout?  Not too much info on it"

The OKC thunder put up 129 on us with Jarrett Allen starting. He started about half of the games up until the trade.
Oladipo would be interesting on the nets however he is not close to as good as Harden and even if he is slightly better than Levert giving up Allen and a handful of picks is with it if it means getting another top 10 players to pair with Durant and Kyrie. Jarrett Allen is good but what he does can be replaced at a lower level by Jordan and by free agents like Dedmon or Vonleh who have had solid seasons within the past two seasons. Now that they have more depth with Shumpert and should look to pick up RHJ and MKG for more depth then a lot of their problems will go away. Another big thing other than depth is that Nash is not an amazing coach and does not stagger his star minutes as much as he should. Oladipo would be interesting on the Nets and would be a slight upgrade over Levert but is not worth the value of a James Harden player.
Jarrett Allen holy shit
I had no idea Jarrett Allen was going to be this good. Damn....
"Jarrett Allen, he totally dominated tonight. He Should clearly be the Cavs starter"
"Damn, I feel bad for the Nets for trading him..... well that feeling didn't last long. Go Jarrett Allen!"
The difference between Jarrett Allen and Drummond is literally night and day. holy shit i don't ever want andre to start
Jarrett Allen was so good. Cavs have a really nice young core. This offseason it would be good if they can get one more nice young player.
Jarrett Allen
"I'm a huge Jarrett Allen fan, how could anyone not be"
I would rather trade Harrell for like Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring myself to hit him
A little late to post! But here it is for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-11) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (5-14) ---|---   D. Garland | D. Russell  C. Sexton  |   Malik Beasley Isaac Okoro |    Josh Okogie T. Prince |  A. Edwards  Jarrett Allen |   Ed Davis  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-10) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (4-14) ---|---   L. Nance  (OUT) |    K. Towns (OUT) M. Dellavedova (OUT) |    J. Culver  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |        A. Drummond  (OUT)|
Jarrett allen would be great with them   hah!
"All those guys are clearly better defensively. I forgot to add Bam Adebayo, who is also clearly better. If you wanna add centres who are debatable with Drummond, you can add: Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka and Nerlens Noel. Some ppl may say Jokic and KAT are also similar defensively compared to Drummond. I think you're overrating his defensive impact based on the counting stats."
the Ghost of Jarrett Allen.
"Jarrett Allen about to get paid and Houston didn't want to do the paying. Makes sense for Houston, but I don't see how they couldn't get better than a Bucks pick from somebody for him."
"[I went a bit crazy, been a busy 2 hours.](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02N2tXNE0FYAGbv8NJXDyVgI4k79w%3A1612163749013&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=2319&amp;bih=1164&amp;ei=pKoXYJSaO536z7sPxaePmAk&amp;q=jarrett+allen+nets&amp;oq=jarrett+allen+nets&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBAgAEBg6BQgAELEDOggIABCxAxCDAVDkBViTF2DfF2gAcAB4AIABhwKIAYEXkgEGMC4xNS4ymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&amp;sclient=img&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU_M78kcjuAhUd_XMBHcXTA5MQ4dUDCAc&amp;uact=5)"
"Yeah, if they don't bring in some defensive help, a serious rim-protecting big man.... they traded that away in Jarrett Allen.. You don't pass up opportunities to get players as good as Harden... They upped their overall talent for sure, but the roster makes less sense, their D needs help."
Can you imagine Jarrett Allen in a Nets jersey? Oh boy ü•¥
They need a defensive center big time. Maybe someone like a Jarrett Allen
They lost Jarrett Allen.   Harden replaces LeVert. Prince and Kurucs are trashcans
"Defense honestly wasn't that bad when Jarrett Allen was on the team.  Overall they ranked 11th I think before the trade, and that was with Jarrett Allen not getting as many minutes as he should have over the first few games.  Yeah it's a small sample, but it was the same thing 2 seasons ago and last season. There weren't really any other plus defenders on the roster, but Jarrett Allen was that good of an anchor."
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokiƒá - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
"""Either way you're gonna be in a highlight"" - Jarrett Allen"
"I'd take the first option, since Jarrett Allen is that type of player."
"I'm a Jarrett Allen fan, although I think he'll get overpaid since he's really just a rim runner who can catch a lob on offense. I think someone like Noel for example can go a long way for super cheap, I'd like yall to get him at the deadline personally."
I‚Äôm praying for Jarrett Allen in the off-season.. we‚Äôd be a perennial playoff team for years to come.
They'll trade Jarrett Allen for it
But...but Reddit told me that Jarrett Allen gives the Nets a better chance of winning an NBA championship than James harden does.
"The dunk on Jarrett Allen and going at him, juxtaposed to him swimming on the floor minutes later....love him.    Could be be my next Starks?"
Pretty sure outside of this last game Gobert has absolutely teabagged Jarrett Allen and the nets going back at least two years  You must not watch your own teams games
Yeah Jarrett Allen killed us more than anybody when we played Brooklyn  Of course KD was out and they didn't have Harden yet...
"Also:   -2 four point plays, one got ruled not a foul but we count it  -Swam on the court  -Dunked on Jarrett Allen   -Hit a buzzer beater 3 to end the 3rd quarter  -Had 12.5x the points of starting point guard and Knicks legend Elfrid Payton"
"Jarrett Allen, I think people sleep on how good of an all-round centre he is"
Yeah Sixers are gonna be in trouble if they run into Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen in the playoffs
embiid isnt nearly as bad of a matchup as people are making him out to be for us. DJ can guard embiid decently well. Its big men who are spacers and guarding the pnr where DJ is ass. Since philly doesnt run traditional pnr that makes it a lot easier for DJ.   Embiid has beaten us traditionally because hes destroyed jarrett allen who was terrible at guarding him.  And you really think the sixers are gonna sweep the nets?
Shout out Jarrett allen
I love Jarrett Allen but this is why I don‚Äôt put much thought into RAPTOR
"Of course but plenty of guys like gobert, draymond, jarrett allen, and many others will take that chance to at least try to make a play. Even Bron used to like his block on Tiago Splitter in the finals almost 10 years ago"
"I miss when he would yell, ‚ÄúJarrett Allen!‚Äù"
"Hilarious how al the KD Kyrie Harden haters are in denial about Drummond joining the Nets.  When in reality this deal was done the day they traded for Harden, or you believe that Milwaukee first round pick is a good return for Jarrett Allen üòÇ"
I wouldnt be surprised if Drummond himself wants to go to the Nets and be big part of team that wins couple of rings.  Also i kinda believe that Nets and Cavs had under the table deal about Drummond buyout.  Cavs got gifted Jarrett Allen for Milwaukee first round pick...
We really missed out on some great Ian Eagle calls by not keeping Jarrett Allen. The Beard to The Fro would've been legendary
Yeah they got Jarrett Allen they don't need Javale anymore he'd be good on the Nets
"Trade Kyrie for Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and picks so the franchise can have a future."
"I'm assuming they have 0 intention of re-signing Drummond.   Jarrett Allen is a free agent too and he need to get paid. They aren't going to give big long-term contracts to two centers.   As an expiring contract making as much as he does (hard to match salary unless you take on future money), it's going to be hard to get anything of real value for him."
"Jarrett Allen, maybe someday in the future."
"Feel like the Cavs are in a good position right now to make the playoffs with how well they've been playing, and he is apart of their current success. So that could be why they're keeping him.  If they wanted to trade him I feel like they should be in talks with the Celtics or the Nets as they're teams who would benefit the most by having him, so the Cavs could get something good for Drummond from them. I'd imagine the Cavs will be fine going forward with Jarrett Allen starting. Maybe Portland hits up Cleveland about Drummond since Nurkic and Collins are both out currently.  Whatever happens, Cavs are in a pretty good place whether they trade Drummond or not."
"10 month ago he was a old school big pretending to be a modern one with just one exceptional skill - rebounding. Then he decided buy into his role and to play defence to secure the bag and turns out, he's quite good at what he's supposed to do.   Make no mistakes he is not a star by any margin, but in a team like Celtics or Brooklyn he can make a real difference within his limits. Rim protection, rebounding, can catch a lob, good passing skills. Especially Celtics can cover his perimeter defence, and play him against elit bigs. He can fit into their trade exception sweeten with some picks, i think.   If he doesn't dribble, and trusted with creating his own shoot, then there is plenty of contenders who will go after him. If Cavs get a pick or two, it's a good trade which will also mean more time for Jarrett Allen."
"Joe Harris, Dinwiddie for pennies. Caris LeVert for Thad Young. Jarrett Allen for Bojan Bogdanovic.  He built a solid core with no lottery picks. Only lottery pick was D'Lo thru the Mozgov dump which worked out great.   So just saying the Nets did nothing and got 3 superstars is a pretty weak take."
Teams already have plenty of tape on Jarrett Allen so he is already in that overpay territory for his next contract.   Allen has been the Nets starting Center for 3yrs. Before he was traded he was back to starting over DeAndre Jordan. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs this unknown product like Mo Bamba.    He‚Äôs a proven 11pts 10reb player at this stage of his career and could develop a jumper but the Nets didn‚Äôt prioritize the midrange. They were more interested in Lobs and Blocks. He had a midrange shot in college.   Allen has said over the summer he wants a Clint Capela 5yr/$90m at minimum and that‚Äôs when the Nets hit a snag in negotiations to re sign.
Do the Cavs think they're going to keep Jarrett Allen? And..are they going to keep Jarrett Allen?  Speaking as a Bulls fan who had my eye on him
Players will give up a few mil DeMarcus cousins coulda taken like a 2 year $11 mil offer after he mistakenly turned down a $40 mil offer from NOP. But giving up big totals rarely happens. David west gave up like $10 mil to go to San Antonio in 2016 that‚Äôs about as much as you‚Äôll ever see and that one is rare   The issue is what incentive does Cleveland have to save a few mil just go dump AD. Especially if they stay relatively competent and are in competition for the play in tournament by late March. Jarrett Allen doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù more playing time people largely know what he is and so do the Cavs it‚Äôs why they traded for him
Jarrett Allen
"They already got something from us. His name is Jarrett Allen. I really don‚Äôt believe the Cavs just ‚Äúfell‚Äù into that trade for harden like some people believe. I also don‚Äôt think Nets would trade our center to the Cavs, only to come back to the Cavs a week later looking for a centerü§£ there must have been a behind the doors convo between the two front offices"
Jarrett Allen. Myles Turner. Larry Nance Jr.
"Saves money.   Would you rather pay him 29 million for a full year or reach an agreement where it's 20 million with an early buyout?  Also, the sooner that Drummond gets bought out is the sooner that Jarrett Allen gets in the starting lineup."
"Jarrett Allen or Myles Turner would fix a lot of our problems at the (starting) centre position. Yes, I know neither of these trades can or will happen."
Jarrett Allen
"I‚Äôm a representative of my own opinion. It has nothing to do with the Nets doing bad. It helps my point, but they undeniably suck. They have no rebounding. They have no replacement centers, just Deandre Jordan. Oh and whose fault is that? Who did they trade Jarrett Allen off for?   I‚Äôll continue to believe they‚Äôll lose even if they place well in the regular season too. They‚Äôll die down in the playoffs and when their team‚Äôs ability to succeed is really tested. I‚Äôll continue believing that even if they place first in the East and Harden wins MVP."
"Did he have the Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, Lavert, etc core when he was there? If so, that core was severely undervalued. And the Nets just traded them away..."
Even more so with Jarrett Allen. The young core of Cleveland is balling
Trust me he's better than the Nets backup center right now. He brings in energy and isn't afraid to block anyone's shot even if he might get postered much like Jarrett Allen. He'll at minimum be aggressive and contest shots unlike Jordan who doesn't try.
We had Jarrett Allen then.
The Nets really traded Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert for a bigger bearded Ricky Rubio
Going from Jarrett Allen to Reggie Perry is just so sad
Yo who is that #2 on the Heat? He looks like the lovechild of Jarrett Allen and Kyrie.
gabe Vincent looking like a smol Jarrett Allen
The Nets could use a guy like Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen :(
"Yeah I agree for sure, I just don‚Äôt think the nets were guaranteed the title with levert and Jarrett Allen. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying, the team needed work then and I‚Äôm definitely sure the new team needs work too."
Agreed. They give up defense and rebounding for.. more iso?? Such a stupid trade and if they somehow beat the Celtics or the other top ECF teams they're gonna get buried by the Lakers.  Big 3 gonna average 45 mins per game in a 7 game series against a team that runs 10 deep and can shoot and rebound and play defense better. I wish it just stayed Kyrie KD with Jarrett Allen and LeVert.
What if they trade for Joe Harris to add scoring and maybe a center to put less pressure on giannis. Jarrett Allen?
Not enough people were talking about Jarrett Allen during the trade discussion. That‚Äôs the real get.
Kyrie and Dinwiddie for Jarrett Allen?
"Of course, the Nets gave prime Sexton Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Lakers are literally drawing dead against the Cavs"
The Nets could use someone like Jarrett Allen

They could sure use a guy like Jarrett Allen or Taurean Prince
"Jarrett Allen is a monster but imagine Embiid, Jokic, AD against this Nets team üò¨üò¨"
"It's worrying that it looks like none of the three can really afford to sit any games. This game was decided by rebounds and freethrows - Nets need to do better than a 50-29 total REBs margin if they want to consistently win games. Also 27 Cav points from FTs versus 15 for the Nets. Watching the first half it just looked like Harden couldn't get to the line like he usually does, while at the other end of the floor Jarrett Allen was having his way in the paint.   It's really hard to tell how much of this is the Nets struggling versus the Cavs rolling - I really like the Allen pick up for the Cavs, and Sexton is coming into his own. Garland looked pretty shakey at points out there but I imagine some of that is just rust which he'll shake off. One thing's for sure though - people saying that Nets games would be must-see basketball because of their insane offence and lack of defence were right! I'll take 'enjoying Nets Cavs games' for things I didn't expect to be saying in 2021."
"&gt; John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.    We won't be able to S&amp;T for John Collins because we're going to be way too close to the apron to execute the deal. Right now we have something like $10 million under the projected apron with 11 guys on the roster.    As far as the rest of those guys go, I'm not sure any of those guys put us over the top either, so going by that standard those trades don't really do much for us. Not to mention why would someone like Randle be available?   &gt; the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.   I mean the Celtics would have Smart, Barnes, Timelord, Pritchard, whoever was left between Romeo/Langford, and after the draft probably our full cadre of picks. That's not all that far off what the basis was to put together a similar deal to what the Nets put together for Harden.    It's all dependent on what the Kings asking price is for Barnes, but barring something completely unreasonable he could very easily be a nice incremental upgrade for the team."
"After this season, the Celtics won't be hard-capped anymore so they can use the full amount of the TPE, so it does grant them a bit more flexibility.  Players I'd target in the summer that might not be available now and that I'd like to have instead of Barnes:  John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.  Using the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.  Also Harden really only wanted to go to Brooklyn so the bidding was limited, there's no guarantee that the next star player that demands a trade says ""Boston or bust"" (hasn't happened yet so seems unlikely.   The Kings are going to ask for multiple picks for Barnes, they want to compete this year and it's a ""he's worth more to us than he is to you"" scenario."
It had little to do with Jarrett Allen leaving. It's mostly due to James Harden being on the team who knows how to get him his looks
"Seems more like DJ was pouting not being THE center on the Nets with Jarrett Allen still there. Seems dumb but players have huge egos and can let this type of thing bother them, like Andre Drummond now with Jarrett Allen. For BG it's not his attitude or effort it's his physical limitations now."
"Difference is that the Nets had all their firsts and players who can match salary. Only Clippers who can be used to match salary are Morris + one of Lou/PatBev and PatBev + Lou + literally the entire bench. Outside of Lou, neither Bev nor Morris nor most of the bench are on expiring contracts. Considering how Lou has said he‚Äôd retire if he was traded, and none of the Clippers bench guys are worth anything (unlike Levert or Jarrett Allen), I‚Äôm not sure how this happens. 76ers or Heat can make a better offer in terms of expiring contracts, young players, and, in the 76ers case, draft capital."
Jarrett Allen took his soul
You're forgetting this rather obscure player named James Harden who was also included in the Jarrett Allen trade
"I genuinely can't get myself to dislike Cavs, especially since they got Jarrett Allen. I'll pretty much always root for teams with young cores like that because it reminds me of the Dubs"
Its like they need Jarrett Allen LOL.
"Jarrett Allen is a perfect example. He has gotten dunked on a bunch of times, but he's also made some amazing blocks. He always goes for the defensive play and doesn't care if he gets put on a poster."
Then tell jarrett allen to never block a shot cuz there's always a injury risk.
"There's some times where guys get absolutely dunked on that isn't ""was helping in the paint because option 1 failed"" and those can be fair times to poke at the defender. [This is a good example of James Johnson playing really poor defense as a rookie and getting wrecked for it.](https://youtu.be/60Sdo6tz5Yg) Otherwise, yeah, it's often bullshit. Love guys like Jarrett Allen for always trying."
"Jarrett Allen has this same mindset and I loved him for it. Had some amazing blocks (Lebron James, Blake Griffin, Giannis) and has been postered plenty of times (John Collins, Marquese Chriss)."
Agreed. Jarrett Allen is going to get paid 20 million because he never makes a business decision
 He got that Jarrett Allen mentality
Watched Jarrett Allen dive to the ground around 4 pacers to get a jump ball and win it. (Even though it led straight into a Sexton or Garland brick)  Nothing but respect for Hustle plays.
"Love the Rashard story. Glad to hear that he's a great guy. He's someone that I feel that would kill it in today's NBA but isn't mentioned often enough.   Anyway, that's an interesting insight. But to your point, I think someone like AD would have similar impact to Gobert if he played a smaller role on offense and is free to roam. Jarrett Allen might be a bit of a stretch but I see your point. Do you feel that Gobert chases rebounds or blocks?"
"First of all, back in '04-'05, Rashard and his wife used to shop at the grocery store I worked at in high school (Fairwood area of Kent). They are such amazingly nice people.  Anyway, I really think what you have with Gobert is what happens when any athletic 7 footer has the opportunity to prowl for defensive opportunities. If you put Jarrett Allen in his spot, or even Anthony Davis, would you get similar defensive results? (subpar 1 on 1 matchups against elite offensive bigs, and a brick wall against everyone under 7 feet). I think Rudy is a stat-grabber on defense. The defensive version of a guy who puts up 40 shots a game, instead of playing within an offense."
"Plus Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were both draft picks in the 20+ range, which don't exactly have a very high success rate, and they ended up being the centerpiece of a James Harden deal. Marks did a crazy good job turning minimal resources into this team."

"Steph will do it with points, 3s, 2s and FTs /s  On the real, Giannis, Jokic, Jarrett Allen, Simmons, and Russ would be most likely but it will probably someone nobody expects like TJ McConnell tonight"
"Yeah, it's just amazing to me how well he does it. Like I said, I'm happy to admit I was wrong. I was very low on the team after the Harden trade. I really miss Jarrett Allen and I figured DJ as our only real center was a deathblow.  It's been awesome to see it all work out otherwise. Hoping for the team to continue to grow and mesh. Claxton is fun as hell."
Do you mean Jarrett Allen?
"Landry Shamet's dogshit play that couldnt net us a first rounder when going for Harden is the reason Jarrett Allen isnt on this team, and I hate him for it"
"I really don't like this award.  it always goes to guys who make a big trade and the team wins.  I wouldn't be surprised if  Sean marks wins it but what did he really do this year besides trade for harden?  one trade shouldn't be the barometer and IMO, his moves in other years were better to judge him on.  drafting levert and Jarrett Allen.  finding dinwiddie and Joe Harris.  trading for DLo.  trading for demarre Carroll AND 1st rd picks.  for where the nets were, those moves setup kyrie and KD.  I firmly believe that 95% of the GMs would have screwed that up royally in the same situation"
So what are the Rockets going to do if the 2026 maybe becomes like a number 1 pick? Use that and draft someone who maybe becomes as good as Ben Simmons?  EDIT: They also seemed to have valued a Bucks pick over getting Jarrett Allen. They're just overvaluing them.
"I hated how Harden played in Houston. Because I misjudge him as a greedy player. But damn he proved me wrong. Dude is better surrounded by better players. He's more effective as playmaker than a scorer. Having Kyrie and KD(soon) scoring for him, just unleash his playmaking. Not to mention he has the likes of Joe Harris and DJ(still a lob target) to feed. If only Nets was able to hold on to Jarrett Allen..."
Imagine trading James Harden and not getting at least Ben Simmons back. Then imagine trading James Harden and not getting Jarrett Allen either. That trade still confuses tf out of me
A set of twins for Jarrett Allen. Who says no
52% is an amazing percentage for the level of shots Embiid attempts.  He isn‚Äôt a center like Jarrett Allen who is basically only shooting from &lt;3 feet
I hope Jarrett Allen. Someone give the Fro 100 million!
Jarrett Allen
"Embid would for lack of a better word molest Jarrett Allen. I'm a fan of him but pure strength is his biggest weakness (throwback to Charlotte Dwight giving him a 30/30 game). Plus Tobias Harris is the Sixers second option on offense, not Simmons (also Levert probably still misses time because of his kidney)."
LeBron currently has a worse PER than Jarrett Allen and Clint Capela. That tells you all you need to know about this stat.
"I mean, if that‚Äôs what you want, that‚Äôs what you want. I personally don‚Äôt fault you for it, but you‚Äôre getting downvoted because most would disagree with that mentality.   Believe me, I love Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen, and D-Lo and Brook Lopez before them but if the Nets‚Äô best chance of winning is with them on other teams, then so be it. There‚Äôs nothing stopping me from rooting for the old crew while they‚Äôre on other teams."
"Jarrett Allen was traded for Milwaukee's pick next year.  Don't have to be a fortune teller to know that pick isn't gonna be any good.  I honestly thought they got a Pacers pick for turning LeVert into Oladipo too, that was the other mediocre pick I was thinking about, but no they just downgraded for free lol.  Allen + LeVert and the Nets picks would have been fine, but turning those guys into Oladipo and super late first is baaaaad."
"We must view basketball through much different lenses then. Some examples of bigs that I believe guard switches well are Gobert, Bam, Jarrett Allen, Al Horford, DeAndre Ayton."
stop it.  Why would we even want Simmons when we are in a rebuild.  If we get Simmons we would be forced to build a team around him and we ain‚Äôt ready for all that rn  Biggest mistake from the trade was not keeping Jarrett Allen
Bro u joking right. Jarrett Allen is only good off the bench as a 6th man point guard. He‚Äôs great defensively and his playmaking skills are better than tiger woods but when he starts he plays like Tom Brady
"Dinwiddie made a statement before that he's the second most talented player on this team, after KD. He also said Jarrett Allen is going to be an All-Star."
How is Clarkson for Exum a massive dud when we got Jarrett Allen out of it?
We have Jarrett Allen. I‚Äôm good.
Jarrett Allen???
How was it a mistake to trade Jarrett Allen when it resulted in Harden?  We can sit here and nitpick the nuances of the trade but I‚Äôm just glad the FO didn‚Äôt miss out on Harden due to greed
Jarrett Allen can‚Äôt shoot my mans
PG: JaVale McGee  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Larry Nance Jr  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Andre Drummond
No. Also why tf would you play Jarrett Allen at shooting guard even in this lineup
Jarrett Allen! Fuck yeah!
"Yes.  But it's ok to pay Jarrett Allen.  So the Rockets got a pick, off loaded Prince's deal.  But if Allen signs a 4 year, 75M deal, is he still worth 1 pick?    vs If Prince signed a 4 year, 75M deal, he is a negative asset then.  &amp;#x200B;  Like Joe Harris before this season was making 30M/3, he is now at 75M/4 year.  Is he not someone others would try to acquire even though his salary almost doubled?"
I love this years Cavs team! The guards are all quick as hell and Jarrett Allen is a UNIT. I wish K Love gave them more big they could fuck around and go to the 2nd round.
We gave the cavs a steal in Jarrett Allen. It was only fair to get one back.
Can‚Äôt forget about Jarrett Allen for the cavs
A top 55 protected second rounder  I genuinely believe the Rockets got first dibs because we had just dealt with Cleveland on Jarrett Allen
Definitely a mistake to trade Jarrett Allen tho. God it was unbelievable people thought trading for Harden was anything other than a massive homerun.
"Caris gonna come back and average at least 18+ too.  The baby Nets are all incredible role players/borderline stars.  Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, Caris, Joe Harris, D' Lo are all good building blocks."
I really like going on r/bostonceltics and r/lakers after they lose a game. usually celtics fans have been more salty. r/raptors is also pretty chill and r/nets always shows love to Jarrett Allen so I like checking them out too. the jazz sub has also been amazing for obvious reasons

Jarrett Allen stans rejoice!  Alfrodo sauce is back on the menu.
Cavs won today too so not all is terrible. Jarrett Allen is a beast
Jarrett Allen is what Andre Drummond was supposed to be
They really got Jarrett Allen and Taurean prince for Dante Exum. Unbelievable
"We don't have our own picks. Going for the playoffs and developing young talent is a good goal and promotes a winning culture. Jarrett Allen would have used money, but who else are we using that money on right now? And he's still young and improving, we don't know how good he could be. We can't really bet on our protections to save us from losing our picks, if we're just tanking."
Jarrett Allen
So glad we passed up on Jarrett Allen so we could grab Dante Exum.
"So the Cavs took on Taurean Prince‚Äôs deal which expires next year, thats why they got Allen and sent the Rockets a pick.  Thing is Prince is really not a bad contract.  Its another year around 13M.  They could had dealt one of their picks for someone to take on his deal if they didnt want it.  So IMO they essentially opted for 4 picks, 4 swaps and Olapido   vs 2 picks, Jarrett Allen, 4 swaps and Olapido   or vs 3 picks, Allen, 4 swaps, Olapido and paying Prince for 1.5 seasons."
everyday i curse shamshit for not being good enough that we had to include Jarrett Allen to get James Harden
Jarrett Allen in his last 4 games has now gone 34/42 from the field lmfao   oh and he‚Äôs also averaging 22/14 and 3 blocks
Literally looked like a play Giannis would do. Thank you so much @Nets!! We love Jarrett Allen üòçüòçüòç
All advanced metrics abound with anomalies.  Montrezl and Jarrett Allen are 13th and 14th in the league in win shares.  De'Aaron fox is 140.  *You can't treat any one metric as gospel.*
"Quinn Cook, Jared Dudley, Westbrook, Dennis Schr≈çder, Jarrett Allen"
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. Don‚Äôt forget a lot of our earlier losses were due to lack of chemistry and not knowing how to play defense yet.   Without Harden we‚Äôd still have Jarrett Allen, Tauren Prince, and sad to say but Levert would have been playing. No way we go on this 7 game run but we also would have won a handful of the games we lost (like the Cavs games most likely lol)"

"So Jarrett Allen and Joe Ingles are #1&amp;2 in the league this year at about 70% &amp; this ‚Äúobjectively ‚Äú means they are more efficient scorers than let‚Äôs say  Lebron who is at #82 &amp; at 59.1%.  Or Blake Griffin who is ranked #188th &amp; at 49.1%. That‚Äôs objective in deciding who‚Äôs more efficient at scoring?   So if it‚Äôs ‚Äúobjective‚Äù then its the same measure as FT% where Chris Paul &amp; KAT are #1&amp;2 at 97.2% &amp; 94.6% The 82nd ranked player is Luguentz Dort at 74.7% How about even the 110th ranked since I can‚Äôt even look up the 188th quickly enough, Marvin Bagley at 54.5%. That‚Äôs the same equivalent?   Somehow we change a measure of efficiency by just adding up nonsense &amp; averaging out and giving it a lie for a name.  It‚Äôs not ‚Äútrue shooting‚Äù it‚Äôs FALSE shooting.   GTFO!! with what ever idiot taught people this trash.  People who watch and follow the game forever &amp; know what it‚Äôs about would never even look at TS% as a real stat.   It‚Äôs another nonsensical advanced statistic that doesn‚Äôt measure anything just some stupid number we can add to try to act like baseball advanced statistics."
"A lot of those lanky boys do against embiid, it tool jarrett allen a few years to be able to hold up against him"
"Players doing things they love doing outside basketball:  LeBron (and like 1/5 of the rest of the league) can sit around and sip wine  Beer shot-gunning contest with (injured) Meyers Leonard  Talk about their tattoos and what they mean to them  Bring in PJ Tucker as a guest to discuss sneakers  Bring in Jarrett Allen to get his take on NASA and building PCs  Have Oladipo come on to sing a bit (and I guess Lonzo, too)  We could get a fun pre-recorded video feature of the Inside the NBA crew hanging around San Antonio  Live record podcasts (Redick, Duncan Robinson, etc.)  Set up a 5v5 in 2k with each player playing as themselves"
Jarrett Allen will end that streak soon enough...

Ignoring the effects these would have on the other teams:       To become favorites? Jokic/Embiid/KAT/AD \| CP3/Steph Curry       To be real contenders? Bam/Vucevic/Sabonis |  Lowry/DeAaron Fox/LaMelo       To be fringe contenders? Jarrett Allen/John Collins
Couldn‚Äôt they have gotten Ben Simmons? I think that would have been a better deal in addition to sending Harden to his reportedly preferred destination. The Nets deal would have been really good if they didn‚Äôt immediately trade Jarrett Allen in my opinion
"DLo, Joe Harris, Levert, Rondae, Jarrett Allen.  6th man Dinwiddie"
I just have nightmares of Jarrett Allen being happier somewhere else :(
Underrated but my man Jarrett Allen is about to get a monster deal. I would bet a small sum of money that he gets paid the most out of these guys - and he's the most worth it. 20+ on a long deal
Exactly. They just wanted Jarrett Allen and Prince to feel welcomed with their new team so they let them win.
Blazers and now the Cavs.   Love Dame and for years my uncle would get my brother and I courtside seats to one blazers game a season so it's hard not to like then. And the Cavs have Jarrett Allen so like come on
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn‚Äôt fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the ‚Äúwe‚Äôve gotta make the playoffs!‚Äù mentality, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"
my favorite double first is jarrett allen
"Hmmm do the raptors have any young exciting players that are already performing well but also have huge upside? Maybe a big man they can pair with Sexton, possibly even around the same age as Sexton? Also definitely need his bird rights so they can resign him and because Cleveland isn‚Äôt a huge free agent destination, it would help if the player isn‚Äôt the type who needs to be in a big market exciting city, I know this doesn‚Äôt exist in the nba but like a kinda nerdy personality is ideal. Oh and just to drive the point home he needs to have amazing hair.   Because that‚Äôs definitely what the Cavs need. If the raptors have someone just like that maybe that would be enough to trade for Jarrett Allen."

You could say this now about Jarrett Allen. He doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about being in posters

Jarrett Allen being an often victim of posters because he won't give up on defense made me respect him a whole lot
Jarrett Allen is one of my favorite players because he jumps with everybody. I can‚Äôt stand players who are to scared.
This the Jarrett Allen mentality
That‚Äôs why I like Baynes and Jarrett Allen so much they‚Äôve been postered heaps of times but they still go up and try and block it.
"Here's my improbable scenario based on your comment.  So once my nets get their picks back in 5 years, we sign a michael jordan level talent on a 1st round pick. Win 2-3 championships now from 2021 -2023 to make kd, kyrie, harden happy before one or two of them get another payday somewhere else once the contracts expire and we can't pay. (Claxton keeps improving and gets to DPOY level and we gotta pay him). Get someone else in their prime maybe Jarrett Allen or DLo for flavor. Keep Harris on a slight discount longer term contract as he ages into his 30s but can still shoot. He buys a house a brooklyn raises kids and wants to stay here. Reach 2nd round in playoffs but not quite over the hump.  Then when the big 3 suck on their new team as older dudes in late 30s and get bought out, we bring back the old band in 2027."
Jarrett Allen Nets jersey üò•
"So you think KD and Kyrie joined the Nets because of cap space alone and that's it? Jared Dudley spoke at length at how well he was treated by the Nets and how they have a one of a kind staff. KD said going to the Nets was an extremely easy decision because of how they performed last year and the fact his personal surgeon who did his Achilles is on the Nets staff   The Nets went from having no draft picks in 2016, to a playoff birth in 2018. Do you think that doesn't have value?   The Nets without Harden are still easy favorites coming out of the east because of how well they drafted and developed Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen Joe Harris, Claxton and Dinwiddie"
"I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúfrom nothing.‚Äù  The Nets clearly have the advantage of being Kyrie‚Äôs boyhood team, being from New York City, and not being owned by James Dolan.    But Marks did build something.  He scooped up LeVert who was the 20 pick and picked Jarrett Allen at 22.  If those late first round picks don‚Äôt work out they don‚Äôt have the pieces to get Indy and Cleveland involved to make the Harden trade happen.  He picks up Joe Harris, who looked like a bust but is now nearly 50% from 3.  And the Nets wouldn‚Äôt be in first place without guys like Nick Claxton and Bruce Brown.  Marks has been lucky, but he‚Äôs been adept at playing the hands he was dealt."
"i haven't seen enough from jarrett allen, but i would say confidently everybody else ahead of him probably has a better case right now. 17 on 15 shots per game is nothing to write home about. maybe he can improve, but he's a very inefficient scorer who only does that and rebounds good for his position."
Jarrett Allen more promising than him tho
Jarrett allen and lonzo? Are you serious? That's just beyond disrespectful to rj people really have no clue
"he's probably not underrated at this point, but Jarrett Allen is very exciting to watch"
No. He‚Äôs not even better than Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen or Collins just based on ceiling
Id definitely roll the dice with Wiseman over Jarrett Allen
"The only one you can negotiate right now is Jarrett Allen. The rest are clearly significantly better right now and for the foreseeable future.   Allen's a very good player, but Wiseman could become a better player if he hits that ceiling we expected from him."
"Yep, reallllly fucked us. I care less about the 26 pick but Zach Collins killed us.  But we didn't have 20 and 15 we just had 10 through a trade with SAC  Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, OG, shit even Jarrett Allen."
I‚Äôd put him above Jarrett Allen and Sexton personally

Jarrett Allen for the anime fro
Jarrett Allen is looking to get paid and I doubt Fertitta would want to pay for that contract.
You gotta consider the cost too though. We need a big over another wing. That cap allocation can be served better on Jarrett Allen vs Oubre.  I'd put a big over a wing on our needs list any day. We can draft a wing too. We can't draft a big that we can slot in that will be ready
Yeah I‚Äôll give them at least that. Jarrett Allen was solid and so is Dinwiddie. I just get bothered hearing LA/NY teams (with the exception of the Knicks) talk about how bad a job Danny has done while disregarding our injury luck and their history of getting superstars in Free Agency.
He played an important role for both the Jazz and the Cavs!  ^helped the Jazz get Clarkson and the Cavs get Jarrett Allen
Ask Nets fans (from a Center position perspective) how they felt about going from Jarrett Allen to starting DeAndre Jordan.
"&gt;Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT. So that's already a lot of names considering that 6/7 centers make the all-star teams, if that.  Robinson doesn't play defense consistently and Adams doesn't provide help defense consistently.  Of the rest you mentioned they are all ""all star level"".  Which just proves my point."
"Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT."
"I mean that's what happens when you get an MVP caliber player for Jarrett Allen and picks. The Nets becoming the favorites to come out of the East was so painfully obvious to me, yet half this sub was convinced that they couldn't make it work. They're the most stacked team since the '17 Warriors, even better if you're strictly speaking in terms of talent."
"I agree, there's a reason a big man hasn't won an MVP for over a decade and the one who could win it this season plays way more like a guard than any other big ever.   I think general priority for high draft picks should be elite offensive engines e.g. Lebron, Steph, Jokic &gt; versatile wings e.g. Klay, PG13 &gt; versatile big men e.g. Draymond, Bam, Sabonis &gt; Specialists/role players e.g. Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen.  Obviously, not many players enter the NBA as rookies at near all-star levels like Luka, but to barely be playable even with low minutes against bad teams as a 2nd overall pick is unacceptable in my opinion.  Wiseman has a shot at maybe being a versatile big man with a few seasons of development, but it's nothing concrete and taking him 2nd overall feels like a mistake to me especially as we could've traded down and maybe gotten ourselves a decent player in the off-season."
"To give context to the other answers, restricted free agency was created to help teams retain their young talent.  For example, Lonzo Ball will be one of the premier restricted free agents this offseason, as his rookie contract is expiring. The New Orleans Pelicans aren't at risk of him leaving though, since they can retain him by matching whatever offer he gets.  In some cases, teams will even trade for the player in order to acquire their restricted free agency status. We saw an example of this with Jarrett Allen, where the Cleveland Cavaliers wanted him as their long-term C and didn't wanna risk gambling for him in free agency. Instead of waiting for the offseason to try and sign him (and risk his team matching their offer), they gave up a 1st round pick to trade for him. Now they're guaranteed to retain him, as they can match whatever offer he gets in free agency."
"Right now no, Jarrett Allen is objectively much better than Wiseman. Potential maybe but even that‚Äôs no a given."
"Late first.  He‚Äôs about as valuable as Jarrett Allen and that was his selling price, so I think Wiseman would net a similar return"
The Nets have a reason to lie to Dinwiddie but they‚Äôve also been upfront with players concerning trades. Marks informed Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert that they might get traded before the Harden deal and that isn‚Äôt the outlier example
Jarrett Allen
Cavs knew they got Jarrett Allen for peanuts so they gave the Rockets the KPJ care package to make them feel less bad.
Still can't believe they traded jarrett Allen and Levert for nothing.
"They have a strong correlation, but they're not the same thing. Take a look at the [league leaders in TS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) as an example. Do you think that Joe Ingles, Ivica Zubac, Richaun Holmes, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris are elite scorers? No, they're good in a more limited role. If they needed to shoot as much as someone like Embiid their efficiency would likely crater. Being an elite scorer requires being efficient at a high volume. So yes, they're related, but they're not the same thing."
And then Cleveland turns around and somehow turns Exum into Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince lol
"The turnaround Mark's has done is phenomenal. He built a great base and culture with the shittiest hand. Finding and developing Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Levert, Jarrett Allen, and now Claxton. Plus bringing bad contracts in or facilitating trades for picks. They had no right being a playoff team so quickly after the failed KG trade. Then it helped KD and Kyrie wanted to team up and chose a good location that had the room. Rest is history and good luck"
"&gt; Cleveland wanted to fully evaluate and develop their young stud Jarrett Allen and see how he fits with their young core. If they‚Äôre going to pay him $100 million this summer, they want to see him for 40 minutes a night.  We were doing this whether we bought him out or not. He was already not with the team before we bought him out. The only reason we bought him out was to earn some good will with other potential free agents, it had nothing to do with making his minutes available because they already were, and nothing to do with saving money because we really didn't save anything meaningful."
Jarrett Allen &amp; Marcus Morris
"Let‚Äôs summarize.  1) Due to the need for matching salaries, It‚Äôs quite hard to trade for veterans on expiring $25-40M contracts like Drummond, LMA, and Blake were on. Not only is it hard to match salaries, but league execs/and the nephews of r/nba didn‚Äôt even think these players were all that good apparently. Niko Mirotic/Luke Kennard cost 4 second rounders. Fournier was an expiring this year and was able to yield *TWO* 2nd round picks.   Meanwhile, Drummond was available last year with another year of team control and was only able to yield a single 2nd round pick, and none this year. If he‚Äôs so useful, and so impactful to possibly swing an nba championship, then why didn‚Äôt a cap space/play in level team trade for him before the deadline?...(crickets) Exactly.  2) The teams that bought these players out did so because it was in THEIR OWN BEST interests. It was not an act of charity.  Cleveland wanted to fully evaluate and develop their young stud Jarrett Allen and see how he fits with their young core. If they‚Äôre going to pay him $100 million this summer, they want to see him for 40 minutes a night.  LMA had lost his starting spot and the Spurs were an also ran/first round cannon fodder and LMA has never been very far in the playoffs.  Blake was a low efficiency chucker who was taking up developmental minutes. Even worse, he was definitely going to be on the team next year for another $40 million.  3)The players were so desperate to play for a contending team, that they made quite large concessions.  Drummond lost the bird rights that he could have retained by getting traded to another over the cap team. That would have increased the number of potential teams that could sign him to a big contract this summer.  LMA forfeited over $8 million in salary which helped the Spurs to dodge the luxury tax this season. That will be an issue for them as they start to pay to retain this young core and avoided an early repeater tax issue which could potentially prematurely kill their current team build.  Blake forfeited some $10 million this year *PLUS* his player option for $40 million next year which is probably $25-30 million over his  market value this summer.  It‚Äôs honestly hard to see the amount of whining in r/nba and the National media about washed up veterans who will probably be the 8th/9th most impactful player on the nets postseason success and Drummond, a player who for years has been dumped on as a guy who ‚Äúcontributes nothing to winning‚Äù but magically transforms into Kareem when he puts on a Lakers uniform.  Let‚Äôs not forget the players union angle echoed by JJ Reddicks comments about the Pelicans front office. Why can‚Äôt veterans with 10-15 years in the league and entering free agency decide where THEY want to play? Is it not enough that players can‚Äôt hit unrestricted free agency until they‚Äôre practically 7-8 years into the league even though most careers end before that date? Now they have to go to Memphis when they get cut because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fwair (include tears) that NY:LA gets them? Were these buyout vets going to sign with NY/LA 2-3 years ago when these teams were dumpster fires? No. So obviously the on court stuff matters more than the ‚Äúboo hoo big market‚Äù angle that‚Äôs getting pushed by the media.  Would you be happy with your corporate job if they tried to restrict your freedom of movement after you‚Äôve been with them for 10-15 years?  Whining about washed big men in a perimeter oriented league is honestly a pathetic hill for people to die on."
IMO he‚Äôs much more talented than Jarrett Allen. If he adds strength and his post defense catches up to his perimeter defense I truly think he‚Äôll be a special player.
Jarrett Allen is 22.. how is he still not young?
Yeah you‚Äôre right I remember Jarrett Allen had some monster games but the only thing I really remembered was when sexton went off so I wasn‚Äôt sure  Wasn‚Äôt really the same harden tho cause he was still fat and getting used to the system he wasn‚Äôt shooting at all when he first got there he was super passive   Gonna be really cool and scary to see kd come back now that the team is clicking
"&gt;Even if we had included Maxey, Houston would've still taken the Brooklyn package  Source?  &gt;Once they saw the amount of draft picks they were offered they took it  Philly could have offered 3 firsts, 1 less than they got from the Brooklyn package. Also they probably could have flipped Thybulle to a contender for another first or a couple seconds like they did with Jarrett Allen."
Claxton has to get bigger. He reminds me of Jarrett Allen when he was a younging. Allen Needed to get bigger and have better control of the low post.   But Claxton? My man can shoot a jumper. And he can play post better than Jordan. Future is bright for the kid.     ^I ^miss ^you ^Jarrett ^Allen.
I mean yes but I feel like it was on the low because we helped the Cavs get Jarrett Allen
"Shit the Rockets could have got Jarrett Allen as well who's a young fringe All Star calibre centre  Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Caris Levert is a pretty decent core. The Rockets really didn't look too bad when Christian Wood was healthy, a handful of pieces away from being in the Western playoff bubble tier which is a much better position than where they're at now imo."
Jarrett Allen
"Why are we *only* re-drafting the lottery? Why is pick 19, John Collins (5th in VORP) ineligible for your redraft? Why is pick 22, Jarrett Allen (4th in VORP) ineligible?   Lauri is #6 on this list, but 12th in the class."
"Still think Jarrett Allen was a much better option at center than Jordan, Claxton, and now Aldridge."
"It's absolutely about the money when Tilman is broke and Simmons has $160 million locked in over the next five years.   Even in the trade they did make, Houston took back an expiring contract instead of Levert on very reasonable money for the next two seasons, and took a late-20s draft pick in 2022 rather than Jarrett Allen, who is up for a contract this summer."
[Jarrett Allen fans who wanted this to happen since day one](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/359/cover4.jpg)
"couldn't he have just received Caris LaVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen.  Jarrett Allen is a franchise cornerstone center for a team to build around. Between him and Caris those two could've easily netted them a SGA type player or a whole bunch of picks. Jarrett Allen is going to be so valuable as a RFA, so many teams will throw him money. The entire deal with Cleveland and Indiana to land Oladipo was so stupid, did Tillman really think that Oladipo was going to have value as a star coming off an injury? I guess he loves picking up injured former stars considering he has John Wall (which is now looking like an absolute savior for DC that we got rid of him)"
"They had Lavert, Jarrett Allen, and could have had Dinwiddie if they wanted. They just chose not to want any of those 3. Crazy."
"Yeah, if the goal is to just be a bad team but not spend money, you don‚Äôt want Jarrett Allen"
Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen?
"Everyone will think it's nuts, except for all the Rockets fans responding to my comments defending Fertita's aversion to paying Jarrett Allen next season lol"
"Any team in the league except Fertita's team would jump at the chance the pay Jarrett Allen. Christian Wood and Jarret Allen are not mutually exclusive. They would fit pretty well together. Jarrett covers up Christian's mediocre-to-bad defense, and Christian stretches the floor as a big."
"Late firsts from contenders, best case scenario, turn into Jarrett Allen or Caris Levert both guys that got moved for Harden and end up on the rockets"
"I honestly forgot who Harden was traded for.   Jarrett Allen? No he‚Äôs on Cleveland. Caris Levert? No, Pacers.   So who the hell did the Rockets get?"
"Personally, if I was a GM, I'd offer Jarrett Allen $101."
It‚Äôs cause he didn‚Äôt wanna pay him in the offseason. Tillman is the worst owner or top 2 with Dolan. And I might prefer Dolan just cause Dolan will likely pay up to keep a competitive team. Tillman is so cheap he won‚Äôt go into the tax for a team that took the goat team to 7 games and would rather have a late first over Jarrett Allen to duck the tax.
Jarrett Allen was arguably the most valuable asset in the trade after Harden and Tilman just said ‚Äúnah‚Äù.
"I think it‚Äôs pretty clear the 2 max slots were for the star players. Caris Levert, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen are very enticing surrounding pieces for 2 stars though. But go on trying to exaggerate things and delude yourself more"
Yes the Oladipo pickup was stupid. Tillman is a cheap ass who preferred an expiring over a decent young guy in levert cause he didn‚Äôt wanna pay him. We can say that now. Just having Jarrett Allen would‚Äôve been better too than a late first.
"It still blows my mind that when the Rockets traded Harden to the Nets, the *Cavs* somehow got Jarrett Allen out of it. Legitimately one of the best front office moves I've seen in years and years."
"Decent pick return, those picks could possibly even turn into someone as good as Ben Simmons, Jarrett Allen, or Caris LeVert!"
They could've had Jarrett Allen but they choose 1st round pick instead of him
"man if they had three almost-twins that came as part of the trade with these slightly fucked up versions of their own names, that'd be the best package. Jared Allen would probably be less athletic than Jarrett but Springer Dinwiddie might have Zach Lavine hops compared to Spencer. lmao I take that package over a bunch of question mark firsts and Olynyk and Bradley"
"Ben would have been much better than what they ended up with, but Ben will never be a first option on a contender. A guy who can‚Äôt consistently score can‚Äôt be a first option on a championship team, no matter how good their defense or playmaking is.   Tilman probably thought he‚Äôll pull a Presti and just acquire as many picks as possible. Didn‚Äôt want Ben‚Äôs contract either probably, that‚Äôs why he took a Bucks pick instead of Jarrett Allen too who‚Äôll get paid in the summer. He‚Äôs just a cheap fucker and an awful owner. Not that I complain, I‚Äôm pretty happy with the outcome of that trade."
"If you watched Cavs games early this season (which ... let's admit, most of us didn't), he actually looked real nice defensively, made some serious strides from his defense in Detroit. He only really started phoning it in after the Jarrett Allen trade."
"Hey man, they also didn't get Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, or Nicolas Claxton"
amazing how they somehow had this exact same problem with jarrett allen
yes for jarrett allen and osman
"Drummond also said ""This is how ***I*** eat"" in regards to those rebounds! Wow, not selfish at all!  Congrats to the Cavs for upgrading their center position. Hold on tight to Jarrett Allen."
"he rebuild the nets without having any type of asset after the trade with boston.  he brought in guys who got cut from other organizations (dinwiddie, harris) and let them develop and made a ton of moves so he could draft levert, jarrett allen and claxton."
"Man I hate stuff like this. Put your name on it. Like you wouldn‚Äôt be complaining if Drummond or Aldridge picked your team. Players have a right once they are bought out or a free agent to choose their own team. Just like the team has a right to sit a player they are looking to get value for (see Blake, Drummond and Aldridge) even though they are healthy.  So in the case of Drummond, he was asked to not play so the cavs could find a trade partner and get value for him while allowing Jarrett Allen to develop. They didn‚Äôt find a trade partner for him, so is Drummond just supposed to sit the rest of the season when healthy? Blake, LA and AD all made their choices, they didn‚Äôt have to go there."

"Think DeAndre Jordan, Jarrett Allen, Tyson Chandler etc. Imagine if Dwight would have run the rim like crazy"
"Which is why I was happy when Giannis decided to re-sign with the Bucks even though we had their 2022 1st round (before trading it for Jarrett Allen), I'm tired of small market teams repeatedly getting screwed over."
"It‚Äôs also the way the fucked up the trade with the Nets that is laughable, like you could‚Äôve at least had LeVert + Jarrett Allen + shitty picks, instead you got Olynyk + shitty picks."
He averages 3.5 a game at 46%.  Jarrett Allen averages 2 at 80%.  They both make 1.6 putbacks a game. Volume matters.
If only they still had Jarrett Allen
"&gt; Even the Harden trade was all future draft picks that got that deal done, not assets built up over last few years      Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were 100% built up by the team, what are you talking about dude"
"Jarrett Allen is a restricted Free Agent, so show him the Benjamin so Cavs can't counteroffer."
"I think Sean Marks recruited him via 7 first rounders, Jarrett Allen, and Caris LeVert. Nephews are pretending like KD had a direct line to fertitta"
People crap on the Harden trade but I do believe that Cleveland had a hush-deal with Houston for Porter Jr because of Jarrett Allen.
De facto trade was Jarrett Allen for KPJ
People here are underrating the pick haul. The rockets could end up with a Tatum-Jaylen Brown type young core that they can build around for 10 years on the back end as KD-Harden are retired or washed vets (they‚Äôre already in their late primes and the picks convey until 2027).  Houston messed up with the oladipo portion of the trade because he was an expiring. All to flex and say they got an ‚Äúall-star‚Äù. There was no reason to spin off Jarrett Allen and Lavert when Allen is a young stud on a restricted contract and Lavert is cost controlled.
"Yeah so they ended up giving THE best package that appealed most to the Rockets. Opinion at the time was that they gave up so many picks and depth plus 2 good young players in LeVert and Jarrett Allen too.   So the Nets should be penalized for offering everything to the Rockets and getting Harden, but Miami and Philly shouldn‚Äôt be criticized for not offering the best package when they had a better potential package?"
"It doesn‚Äôt even ‚Äòguarantee‚Äô a championship.  I would still take a Healthy Lakers.  Sure, that‚Äôs not a given but neither is a healthy Durant.  Griffin has shown he‚Äôs not totally washed but he‚Äôs still pretty washed.  Who‚Äôs to say Aldridge isn‚Äôt as washed?  I‚Äôve been a nets fan my whole life.  I‚Äôve seen games at the meadowlands, prudential and now Barclays.  I‚Äôve seen a player write ‚Äòtrade me‚Äô on his sneakers, ‚Äòwhoop-de-damn-do,‚Äô make the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô number 1 draft pick but in the historical worst draft, then go to two finals in a row in order to get blown the fuck out and finally see a trade that allowed a division rival get two perennial all-stars for one playoff series win.    Would I like to see a championship with Levert and Jarrett Allen?  Fuck yes - but stars win in this league.  More stars equals a better chance to win.  Being hated means relevance.  I‚Äôll take it."
Yeah it‚Äôs all easy for Marks now but most GMs wouldn‚Äôt have dragged the Nets out of the cellar with the hand he was dealt. Joe Harris and Dinwiddie were literally thrown away by bad teams who needed talent badly but he turned them into great pieces. Even Claxton right now is making it easy to not miss Jarrett Allen and he got him in the second round.
"He drafted really well and made strong moves to get the Nets to be a playoff team before Kyrie and KD came. Both say they wouldn‚Äôt have come to the Nets if the Nets hadn‚Äôt already been showing good signs of turning it around before. Lifting the worst roster in the league with no lottery picks for the foreseeable future into a low-end playoff team is not that easy.   LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Claxton considering where they were taken was great, getting DLo to make him a contributor to a playoff squad and getting scraps thrown away by other teams and turning them into legit players like Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.   Yeah you can say his job is easy right now (and it is) but that‚Äôs disregarding all the great work he put in to get this franchise to this point."
"I liked the team when it was just Kyrie and KD. Jarrett Allen was a tremendous asset along with LeVert, but ig if the trade saved his life then I would rather it did happen."

"They got a #1 overall and a #3 overall pick and hit on both of them. they just havent done anything with the rest of the roster. Meanwhile everyone is shitting on the nets for getting lucky meanwhile marks has consistently pulled good players out of thin air. He drafted caris levert and jarrett allen with mid to late first rounders. He developed harris and dinwiddie off the scrap heap.

And now they're saying [it's Jarrett Allen](https://twitter.com/BraydenBallin/status/1372241037171777553?s=20)
He boomed me - Jarrett Allen
LeVert and Jarrett Allen ü•≤
As in we had to give up two of our best players to get him (Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen) so naturally Harden‚Äôs role in the team becomes even more central and critical.
Jarrett Allen is the best player in the NBA
Even at the time when news broke people were in complete disbelief at how one-sided it was for the Pacers. Thank god it also potentially saved LeVert's life.  Jarrett Allen to Cleveland also shocked people into disbelief with how one-sided it was for the Cavs.  The Nets/Harden trade sure spread its wealth.
"Jarrett Allen fasho, mans a cool ass nerd"
"Embiid will always be a dick in my mind for punking Jarrett Allen in the 2019 playoffs and Ben Simmons looks like the Mona Lisa.  Can't lie though, you're uniforms are pretty fly"
"That‚Äôs not a pretty great team IMO. That‚Äôs a decent playoff team probably but with glaring offensive weaknesses. FVV, Siakam, Trent, all struggle to score efficiently when their volume increases. OG is efficient but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ready for first option type shot volume.  Honestly, we could use some lottery luck to get one of the top 5 guys, then try to splash cash at a guy like Jarrett Allen, or even try and make a trade for another center like Sabonis. Birch is awesome, but ideally a role player. Him and Boucher together off the bench would be awesome"
Height: Sexton - already crazy athletic and a good shooter.   Skills: Larry Nance - he has developed his shooting the last few years and he‚Äôs absolutely terrifying when his 3s start falling  Athleticism: Jarrett Allen - DPOY
"Skill boost: Jarrett Allen becomes a sharp shooter and he can take guys off the bounce when they start to close out and he‚Äôs an all star   Athleticism boost: Garland. He‚Äôs a hair short, but he‚Äôs already one of the most talented guards in the league, but getting him to explode to the rim and finish over guys would make him a 30 point scorer damn near   Height: Young Bull is now 6‚Äô5 and he‚Äôs pretty much young Dwayne Wade if he‚Äôs that tall. not a single person in the league can stay in front of him and he will get to the rim"
Verejao and Jarrett Allen shared the floor together in case anyone was wondering if Cavs actually want to win games
Question for Cavs fans: do you run any PnR plays for Jarrett Allen? Kind of like how we utilize Powell on offense.   The guy is an absolute menace for opposing teams on alley-oops and drives on defense. That should translate to the same awareness around the rim on offense too I would think but I didn't see any of that in our two games against ya.

Jarrett Allen being on the list over him was pretty weird
Jokic/Giannis/Embiid/AD/KAT/Bam/ Gobert/Vooch   are all objectively better.  There is no universe in which Jarrett Allen is a top 5 center in this league
Jarrett Allen is a top five center in the league. Caris LeVert was a great playmaker/ facilitator on this team which is something we lack without Harden on the floor. Stop.
You gave up Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. Every other ‚Äúvaluable asset‚Äù you gave up wasn‚Äôt actually helping you win games this year. That‚Äôs not nothing but it‚Äôs not a lot.
"It's been a hectic year, I started hating the Nets when they traded away Jarrett Allen, now the Nets are in the 3rd seed. Hopefully they claim the 2nd seed so the Wizards can face them. The story alone will make the series a must watch."

"I could see the Cavs going for him. They need help on the wing and Kelly's young enough to grow with their young guys. Maybe we could swing Jarrett Allen somehow. Kelly, Wiseman, Warrirors 1st for Allen, Osman, Nance?"
"He was pretty good with the Cavs at the beginning of the year. Still had frustrating moments, but he was playing really good defense. Really fell off after Jarrett Allen showed up."
"How many do.  Detroit has Stewart who has proven to be an intriguing prospect and certainly flashes potential as a starting caliber big.  OKC has Moses Brown and his rebounding is a huge weapon.  We have WCJ with his versatile defense and rim running.  Houston has Christian a wood.  Minny has Towns.  Cleveland has Jarrett Allen in restricted free agency.  Every lottery team has a center prospect that they want to either develop or has proven to be capable of playing 25 minutes a night as a starter.  Most teams downsize anyway so it‚Äôs not like they need a big man for 35 minutes as their first,second or third option.  I‚Äôd rather pay all of those guys 10 million a year going forward than eventually having to give Evan Mobley his rookie extension if he isn‚Äôt going to be able to be the best player on a championship team.  If he can be that guy than frankly he should be the clear cut number one pick because Superstar big men are extremely valuable but starting centers or lower tier all star centers are frankly found everywhere in the league.  A team can sign Richaun Holmes and probably get a decent starting center who can switch and run the pick and roll.  Star guards and wings are steal way more valuable for championship teams these days."
"It should, when they got one of those three players by trading away Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen.  It's not like we got James Harden for free."
"actually, jarrett allen changed the plans when he came to the cavs tbh"

"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
They 100% should have found a way to keep Jarrett Allen as well
"Do you think the Nets would be better if instead of not having Harden, they had Jarrett Allen, Taueran Prince, Rodions Kurucs, Caris Lavert, and several first round draft picks and swaps?"

Lol pretty sure everyone was saying lakers was gonna get beat by the nuggets and rockets. And pretty sure the clippers were viewed as the favorites by most fans and media. Lakers looked rusty after the COVID break and everything was in doubt.  This year would have been more competitive. The nets got Kyrie and Durant back with pretty serious team with Jarrett Allen and caris levers. Clippers got better and more balanced. Nuggets and jazz also got a lot better.   Definitely not as bad as when harden joined the nets
I think Jarrett Allen would have been great for the nets if they kept him. Don‚Äôt @me
"Lmao take Harden out and who you have in? Jarrett Allen, Terrence Prince, and Caris Levert. Those are 3 players that give distribution to rebounding, scoring, and some much needed defensive bodies as well.  The current Nets now lost to the Bucks back to back by a collective 9 pts. I'm not going to even bring up Spender D if he was healthy.  Now I wouldn't say Pre Harden Nets would be guaranteed for a finals appearance but they sure as hell have as good chance and would be my favorite (flair aside)  That being said I'm happy af that we have Harden"
took our gm and still wont do anything in the post season. your point guard has less range than jarrett allen.
"It was Kd who went after James my guy! And if you don‚Äôt know we had Jarrett Allen, claxton and DJ playing the front court and Dinwiddie or Caris levert coming of the bench to lead the second unit! We would have been fine."
thank god this nets team doesn't have jarrett allen anymore.
"They literally got rid of the young core, they traded away all the players that made the Nets special sans joe Harris. This is basketball gentrification, it wouldn‚Äôt sit right with me to see the knicks trade Randle, RJ and Mitch for Kawhi, Dame and Lavine. I‚Äôm not saying that would happen anyways but that‚Äôs basically what the Nets did, they traded their identity and culture for the business move of having star appeal. KD and Kyrie didn‚Äôt choose the Nets because they had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen, they chose them because they had cap space and were willing to also sign their friend deandre Jordan. They literally fired their head coach, the person who sets the tone for a teams work ethic and culture, to appease KD and Kyrie. This was the gentrification of a grass roots team that beat the odds, just to sell more jerseys to Midwest transplant Brooklyn hipsters."
Jarrett Allen has definitely been better for the Cavs
"In honor of my boy, please do something with Jarrett Allen. &lt;3"
Do you really like Jarrett Allen would be treated differently by cops compared to Kevin Love???? /s
KD and Kyrie would still win the East if they keep Caris and Jarrett Allen. They might even be able to win it if Harden was out until the Finals.
"that was with jarrett allen, caris levert, and spencer dinwiddie in the picture.  I dont think the nets can win it all without Harden. The record this season without Harden is painfully average. I do think they can win it without Kyrie though. Harden and Durant would be enough"
"Also, if they didn‚Äôt have Harden, they would still have Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert. Nets would absolutely be title contenders without Harden."
"BREAKING: Jarrett Allen disses Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame, Lake Erie."
"Garland is definitely not better. Jarrett Allen maybe, but his value is more on the defensive end so it's not relevant to Sexton's passing."
"Jarrett Allen is more impactful than sexton to a playoff team right now, and garland is the better long term prospect."
jarrett allen is their best player by a long shot.
Garland and Jarrett Allen are both better

I see what you're saying.  But if Jarrett Allen threepeats I'm still gonna stan him
Claxton guarding Embiid would look like 2019 Jarrett Allen 2.0
He's the best defender on the Nets by far. Imo he's better than Jarrett Allen
2021  -	Kevin love 24 minutes played on average and has only played 20 games this season (!) -	Jarrett Allen almost 30 minutes played and 54 games this season.  Kevin has glass bones and paper skin. He wouldn‚Äôt survive in the playoffs past the first round
"I guess if they're really lacking in rim protection. I just think smart, veteran  basketball + a really stretchy pf is being underrated really badly.   Kevin Love enables a team to play 4 out, makes transition offense so much better, and is just a smart player. I value this more than Jarrett Allen 2021 but ill concede theres probably a place Jarrett Allen is more valuable"
This is untrue. Jarrett Allen can contribute more than Kevin love to a playoff team

He there to help Jarrett Allen with his hair game
I don't care who gets DPOY but I have a problem with calling him a great 1v1 defender when Jarrett Allen has his career high against him.
Cleveland wanted to have Jarrett Allen develop so I don‚Äôt think they wanted him anyway
Did you see what Jarrett Allen did to him earlier this season? Or how CP3 clearly doesn't respects Rudy's defense? Or how AD has multiple 40 points games against Rudy?
"If Booker turns into a megastar and they replace Paul with another star down the road, you can find a good defensive center for so much cheaper than a max though.  Like Lowe says it is near impossible to juggle 4 huge contracts unless you have an owner willing to go nuts in the tax.  Jarrett Allen, Mitch Robinson, clint Capella were late picks who contributed on cheap rookie deals. Nerlens Noel a d dwight howard are bouncing around the league on small deals. Nets replaced Allen with Claxton on another rookie deal.  If you have elite perimeter players, finding a big to just guard the rim and set picks is super cheap if you have the right system and scouting department in place.  Edit: I'm also not comparing Ayton as a complete player to those guys, just saying if you give Ayton a max he better be one of the best defenders in the league while being elite on offense or it isn't worth it, because you could get one or the other for 5 million"
If he plays over Jarrett Allen we will know the true purpose of the signing.
Jarrett Allen with muscles?
"Jarrett Allen's deal this summer will probably set the benchmark for Ayton's extension. If Allen gets anything in the 20-25 million range, Ayton is for sure getting the max"
Should've kept Jarrett Allen
"Imagine if they had competent management that could've paired him with great young guys like, I don't know, Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen."
imagine if they had jarrett allen and caris levert to this team too
Andrew Nicholson. And that guy was taken on as salary filler when the nets traded bogdanovic to the wizards for the pick that became Jarrett Allen. His deal was 6 million and crabbes was 18 and they were the same length so it almost ended up being like we got crabbe for 12. He still sucked but yeah
Cavs don't get Jarrett Allen without the sneaky KPJ trade
"Oh ok, so Jarrett Allen &gt; KPJ yeah I‚Äôll take it"
In order to get Jarrett Allen and not make it a 4 way trade we let KPJ go. Don‚Äôt ask questions this conspiracy theory is how I cope
The rumor thats been floating around Rockets twitter is that kpj was an unspoken part of the Jarrett Allen deal.
yeah this had to be an extension of the jarrett allen trade cause this dude was clearly worth more than the MAYBE 56-60th pick even with his behavioral issues
Cavs felt bad about getting Jarrett Allen for free so they gifted Harden Jr. to them
I think he's viewing KPJ as part of an under-the-table deal for Harden. It's why we gave up Jarrett Allen for a single late first. Could've been more clear though.
"He's likely referring to the Nets trade. By including the Cavs and giving them Jarrett Allen, there's a possibility the Rockets got Porter Jr. for peanuts because of an under the table deal."
This was a different trade than the Jarrett Allen trade
Top 55 protected 2nd round pick and indirectly Jarrett Allen
for nets I think Jarrett Allen back in 2018
We gave them Jarrett Allen for free as well so it works out kind of

"Okay. But those guys named are 3rd, 5th, and 7th in FTA per game.  Jokic is 35th.  Right ahead of Jarrett Allen."
Jarrett Allen with an outside shot üî•üî•
Would have been nice if they have Jarrett Allen and Levert to tinker with.
JARRETT ALLEN FOR HIS FRO!
"You clearly have no idea on how difficult the game is for big men who are asked to rim protect and play off ball. ""Just run and jump, shoot it occasionally, how hard can it be?"" NBA players aren't stupid, and you can't just overpower everyone with your physical tools. Draymond is a great defender, yes, but defense has way more nuances than just jumping higher or moving faster than the attacker. It's about reading and predicting what the offense wants to do, and being able to react and appear at the right place at the right time consistently. You're asking a high school kid who's used to just swat everything that comes his way, to suddenly be able to make sound rotations over and over again against NBA level offense. Also, the Warriors offense was never designed to let big men get easy looks, I don't know where the hell you pulled that impression from. The ""easy looks"" you're talking about are for off ball cutters and good rollers, which Wiseman is neither, because he's never had to be. Being the roller against NBA defenses is a tricky skill that emphasizes a lot on timing, and in the past Wiseman didn't have to care about timing, because he could just score on guys even if they cut him off or contested. He's also not a shooting threat yet, so it's not surprising. The only reason you're feeling disappointed is because you never bothered to think about his circumstances and just read all his upside and overblown rhetoric about him being ""THE NEXT AD"" bullshit from ESPN. You keep saying he's bad, but never had the second thought of actually examining the reasons why. Basketball is not a on paper sport. Actually watch games and know context before you make judgements. Wiseman has it quite rough, and it's a common trend for young big men of his type. I think you're also kind of overestimating this year's talent pool. Wiseman is #2 in this draft, but he's probably #7 or #8 in 2021, kinda like Jaxson Hayes, who btw is a comparable typing to Wiseman. Maybe do some film watching and watch, say, how Jarrett Allen plays compared to Wiseman, the defensive and off ball skills difference between them is not something you just learn in a summer transitioning from no live games to the NBA."
"De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Jarrett Allen are kinda weebs, they at least know about this place"

"I agree with you tbh.. Sure he's athletic but nothing seems out of the ordinary (and the footage that do seem unreal are pretty low quality or are in very biased angles) just look at JaVale McGee or Mitchell Robinson highlights and come back to this. sure Wilt was ahead of his time in size and athleticism which let him dominate weaker opponents, but the quality of the NBA has gotten so much better. Not even joking but if we hypothetically teleported average players like JaVale, Mitchell Robinson, Hassan Whiteside, Jarrett Allen, or Drummond back to the 60's, all of these guys would be another Wilt, so I don't get the argument why people would pick him over modern day superstars who are way ahead in nutrition, training, and skill (unless you hypothesize that Wilt grows up again with modern day training which is asking too much)"
"In short, he‚Äôs a baller and I like him better than Jarrett Allen."
"I can't really comment on any of this 'cause I don't get to watch Barrett play, but I can tell ya about Garland and why this dude thinks it's a reasonable take. He's got a silky-smooth handle and outstanding vision and a three pointer that is holding it's accuracy on volume despite high degree of difficulty. Essentially everything you want from an offensive fulcrum and he's even racking up steals lately. His season stats aren't entirely pretty, but the last 15 or so games since he was given the green light he's been a 20/7 guy on strong efficiency while leading the offense. Take tonight for example. Cavs are gonna lose, but he put up 28/4/9/1 on 45/50/100 splits while feeding Jarrett Allen for 27 points and being a +4 in 34 minutes played.  The point of all of this is to say not only is he an offensive fulcrum, but there's evidence to suggest he can be a winning offensive fulcrum. Seeing as his defense is tolerable, I'd say that's a fair argument for top 3 despite Barrett's team success. Garland doesn't have an all-nba talent taking weight off of his shoulders on offense, so 1-1 I don't think it's a fair comp for either of them honestly. Garland's stats are inflated relative to Barrett and Barrett's success is inflated relative to Garland."
How can this team win without Jarrett Allen
Kind of like nobody wanted to join Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen
"Oh for sure, I didn‚Äôt mean that he wasn‚Äôt a great shot blocker- I just meant that Allen is more athletic and has a stronger presence/rep as a shot blocker right now. He is also much younger, so there is room to grow. Nurk is an exceptional talent and both him and Jarrett bring different skillsets to their respective teams, which is why I had disagreed with your comparison since they are not the same type of player"
idk im pretty sure giving jarrett allen to the cavs got us KPJ for free pretty much
"Excuse me sir, we are about to pay Jarrett Allen 100 mil so that‚Äôs already taken care of lol"
"There is no indication that the GM preferred Philly's offer over what we got from Brooklyn. Simmons (who wouldn't re-sign in Houston) and a couple protected swaps vs 7 or 8 unprotected pics, caris levert, jarrett allen and taurean prince. Pretty easy call in my opinion"
"&gt; People on here legit thought he was going to be a huge, game changing pickup for the Lakers  That was never the narrative on here, at alllll. People had been talking about how Drummond was shit and had a shit attitude since the Cavs got Jarrett Allen and Drummond was sulking on the bench and shit  He was referred to as an empty stats guy who plays selfish low IQ basketball. He wasn‚Äôt hyped up the way you‚Äôre saying"

Jarrett Allen
"LeBron, Curry, KD, Harden, AD, Dame, Kawhi, Zion, Kyrie, Bam, Jimmy, Trae, Tatum, Beal, Jarrett Allen I guess? Couldn't think of a third big."
Zion plays nothing like Jarrett Allen or Montrezl Harrell though
Yeah but it seems like it helps the non shooting big men. Guys like Harrell/Jarrett Allen are high in those stats despite not being that great of players
If I wasn't following Jarrett Allen I wouldn't have known it was E3. Middle of the playoffs and this man is tweeting about BOTW2
"Not having taurean prince helps you win. Levert missed more games than Harden. You‚Äôre basically saying Jarrett Allen makes up for the loss of Harden. Claxton and Allen provide many of the same things and personally I prefer Claxton because he is better switching onto perimeter players, but he never cracks the rotation if JA stays. Plus the Nets were not the clear favorites then, so good chance they don‚Äôt get Blake either. I would prefer Blake Claxton and harden to Allen Levert and prince lol"
"the USA is so thin at center Drummond and Howard are realistic. After Bam it gets real thin. What Jarrett Allen?  Bam, Jerami Grant, maybe Allen, or throwback to Horward and hope he can give you 8 games of play.  The USA should honestly just take some long leapers for bigs.  Because you can't get any offense out of any of them anyway.  I would guess do you have enough bodies and fouls to match up with Gobert, The Joker,"
Kinda like what the Cavs did to get Jarrett Allen
"That was the year Jarrett Allen was blocking all the biggest stars in the league, right?"
Bruh it‚Äôs a miracle the Nets were winning without Harden who‚Äôs arguably their most important (not best before you come at me) player due to his playmaking  Taking away Kyrie too is just plain unfair. He doesn‚Äôt even have Caris LeVert or Jarrett Allen to lean on anymore
"Appreciate the kind words, coming back from that Boston trade and the 12-70 season, through blowing up our most fun team in a generation to get superstars, only for those superstars to get injured in the playoffs... it sucks man. Losing DLo and Levert and Jarrett Allen really hurt to do but felt it would all be worth it to win a championship. But now if we don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll have felt like a waste. Miss those guys, we need to win a ring for them.  Honest question as a life-long Nets fan, are you sure there‚Äôs a lot of bandwagon fans? Idk I guess I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve seen a lot over in our sub but I could be wrong, I suppose how would I even know"
Jarrett Allen. Dude is gonna get paid like Al Horford.
haven't watched cavs games this year (and this is slightly unrelated) but is it just me or am i seeing jarrett allen wearing the same kyrie 3s every game?
"high risk/high reward describes basically every championship ever.  most all evidence from nba history shows that trying to use depth to beat star power is a fantastic way to lose in the playoffs.  teams without lots of star power have a terrible track record of winning it all.  injuries happen, but tons of teams have had stars and health and racked up rings.  no one is avoiding superstars in the future because an injury might happen.   even then, does anyone think kevin durant + jarrett allen is winning the title?"
If he still had Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen I would agree with you but not with this roster
"Seriously. People were treating the Nets as a super team even after Harden went down.  Remember the Nets went .500 last year, and don‚Äôt have Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen, LeVert, and now Kyrie and Harden. No one should be expected to win with all those injuries."
"Well say the Nets didn't trade for Harden and ended up in the same spot.   That means we still lost Dinwiddie to injury in our third game, and have Kyrie with a hobbled ankle. So are Caris LaVert (who was out midseason with a cancerous tumor) and Jarrett Allen making the difference against a healthy Giannis/Middleton/Holiday?"
"If you think a team with KD, Caris LeVert, and Jarrett Allen alone would defeat the Bucks I have a number of bridges to sell you"
"I think they should draft Moses moody, a great 3&amp;D prospect, trade Bagley for picks, try and sign Jarrett Allen but if they can‚Äôt resign Holmes and go for Makeennen or Collins   If they could sign Allen I see them as a very formidable young core with improved defense   G Fox  G Halliburton  F Moody DRAFT F James Johnson FA  C Allen FA  6th Man: Buddy Heild  If u can‚Äôt sign Allen go for a John Collins or markennen or try and resign Richaun Holmes"
Enes Kanter  Jarrett Allen  Nikola Vucevic  Taj Gibson
"Lakers fans: Sure, give us Sexton, Garland, Jarrett Allen, Isaac Okoro, Larry Nance and a few FRPs and we will give you THT and Caruso"
Maybe the nerd trio of the Lopez twins and Jarrett Allen
"Exactly, I'm a life long Nets fan since 2004. I've been dying for a meaningful playoff run, but this ain't it. Technically my team are title favorites/contenders, but they're not my team; it's just a core of mercenary superstars that just happened to pick my team. This team is not the Nets, it's just the hollow shell that Kyrie, KD, and Harden chose to play under. Whenever I express this I get downvoted and told that I'll forget about all that once they win, but that's just not true. When operating under these circumstances there is no team culture or team identity, there is literally nothing but the name that identifies the team as the Brooklyn Nets. Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Nenad Krstic, Brook Lopez, Caris Levert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen, and others in the same vein meant something to the identity of the Nets. They may not have all joined the team in the same way, but they put roots down in the organization and tried to build something meaningful. A key component of the joy of winning a championship as a fan is building up to the point where your team can win it all. If the Nets win it all, I won't look at them and say the Nets finally won a title, I'll just say Kyrie, KD, and Harden won a title and that won't mean shit to me."
"&gt; According to data supplied to The Athletic by NBA Advanced Stats, guards rolled hard to the rim only 15.7 percent of the time after setting a ball screen. On average, centers did so 55.7 percent of the time. Brown dove to the basket 219 times on the 326 screens he set, good for a whopping 67.2 percent. By comparison, Jarrett Allen finished the season at 66.2 percent playing for Brooklyn and Cleveland.   &gt; ...  &gt; As a result, after having a grand total of one scoring attempt as a screener in his first two seasons, Brown has used 74 possessions in that fashion across the regular season and playoffs, per Synergy Sports. The majority of those have come on rolls to the rim, on which Brown has averaged just over 1.2 points per chance. That figure is about average for a big man, which sounds unimpressive until one remembers that Brown is a 6‚Äô4 shooting guard diving as effectively as the average big.  From [this](https://theathletic.com/2641221/2021/06/09/how-bruce-browns-mastery-of-the-short-pick-and-roll-has-made-him-the-nets-and-the-nbas-most-surprising-guard/) piece, written yesterday."
Lebron should come to the Cavs. Totally no bias in that.  Who needs AD when you can have Jarrett Allen
Put like Jarrett Allen or Miles Turner at center. Their D would be absolutely fine
"The nets did what you‚Äôre supposed to do: built a young core with intelligent drafting and trading to get guys like jarrett allen, dinwiddie, dlo, levert, and harris. They created enough cap space to sign two max contracts due to expiring contracts and rookie deals. They then signed two big free agents. Exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do as a GM.   Sure, they got lucky with harden wanting out of HOU. But they also had those young players who served as assets in the deal- levert, allen, etc. But harden is out right now, so everything we‚Äôre seeking against the bucks right now is the result of good drafting, smart trading, and good FA pursuit, not some nefarious superteam nonsense."
Look out for Jarrett Allen
"You‚Äôre so right. I‚Äôm such an idiot for thinking KD, Kyrie, and Harden would go to the 2nd biggest basketball city in the NBA just because it‚Äôs New York. They obviously just love Kenny Atkinson and that young core of Russell, LaVert, Crabbe, Graham, and Jarrett Allen‚Ä¶ oh wait those guys aren‚Äôt on the team anymore. It‚Äôs almost like KD and Kyrie just went and built their own team in the city they liked and even selected their own coach."
"Here‚Äôs the issue, I‚Äôd 100% agree with you that this was the correct move, if it wasn‚Äôt the case that they worked very hard to not acquire any young players in the trade.  More specifically, there‚Äôs zero reason to trade LeVert for Oladipo unless the Owner demanded a competitive team on the floor.  They also basically traded away Jarrett Allen for the 26th pick in the draft next year.  The trade could very well work out, but it‚Äôs undeniable that the Rockets shot themselves in the leg when they convinced themselves that a 2022 Bucks first rounder and Oladipo was more valuable that Allen and LeVert, just because Oladipo technically fit the ‚Äúall star‚Äù demand."
"This year he finally got to cash in on all the assets he brought in (Levert, Jarrett Allen and would of been Dinwiddie too if he didn‚Äôt get injured) harden wouldn‚Äôt be a net if marks didn‚Äôt make it possible. Also trading for shamet, also signing Jeff green and Blake griffin add on to his case"
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"Well when you‚Äôre the GM you take on the the risk and reward when you sign a player. I don‚Äôt think the problem is Ainge being complacent or looking at offers to move him. I think that Ainge failed to communicate with either Kemba or his agent that a trade was a possibility and that he would actively look at offers. When Sean Marks traded Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince he made it clear to each of those guys that a trade was possible so they wouldn‚Äôt be blindsided when they saw their names in rumors or when ultimately they had to move their entire lives and families to another city. Ainge isn‚Äôt a bad person for that."
"I mean why not, a 6'6"" and under only team! (maybe Jarrett Allen is the 1 allowed exception, but limited minutes)  Anyone claiming this would be worse than the current version of the Cavs?  People might actually tune in to a Cavs game if they embrace the NANO BALL"
"Drummond? What about Kat, brook lopez, Myles turner or Jarrett Allen? Also you have Tatum twice and if you‚Äôre actually trying to pick positions I really think pg and kawhi playing pf is a little out there. Not a huge deal but for sure there are better centers than Drummond  Edit: forgot Zion as well although obviously he‚Äôs more of a pf"
"Jarrett Allen is really fast too. You don't get to see it much in the pros, but when will you look up his highlights from when he played at Texas it was next level."
You don't even remember Jarrett Allen
Yeah but he elbowed Jarrett Allen in the face!!!
Jarrett Allen ain‚Äôt stopping those guys. We could‚Äôve maybe got a Capella but it wouldn‚Äôt be a guarantee. Look at the Mavs bigs.
"Nets lost all their picks to Celtics. Mark's made great moves to draft or trade for solid young players and grow them - DLo, Levert, Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen. Turned an abysmal outlook into a playoff team and enticed KD and Kyrie."
"The narrative has shifted dramatically. We went from ""Nets have no defense, Bucks in 6"" to ""they're a super team even without Harden""  Even though currently this is the same team that started the season 9-8 plus a Blake who has one good game every 4-5 and minus Jarrett Allen/Caris Levert, apparently Joe Harris is now the factor that really makes them a super team."
Because the Suns fail to acquire a good center??   Jarrett Allen was basically given away for a 2nd rounder.
Blake was unplayable in the Boston series. I'd take Jarrett Allen and LeVert
"Difference is AD and LeBron are a lot better than Kyrie, and an even bigger difference is how the Nets traded away two very good players in LeVert and Jarrett Allen for Harden, and don't have them playing now."
"it absolutely is, Jarrett Allen would make this team absurd with his rim protection and rebounding  the Nets were still playing Deandre Jordan heavy minutes at the start of the season, which is one of the biggest reasons the team kinda got off to a slow start. An Allen+Claxton rotation at center is a nightmare defensively on top of all the scoring the Nets have"
"Yup. No one thought the Nets were a superteam at the start of the year. Without Harden the Nets team is actually worse, they'd have LeVert and Jarrett Allen. They were seen as a contender but definitely not a superteam."
"Imagine Jarrett Allen and LeVert for these two games, not being condescending btw, it would really be nice to watch"
"Jarrett Allen, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Dwight, the Lopezes, etc."
"Bucks could have had 4 picks, 4 swaps, Caris Levert, and Jarrett Allen smh"
By adding Blake and Mike James for Jarrett Allen and LeVert? Yeah absolutely not.
Did the nets have to trade for harden they could have had levert and Jarrett Allen as well as the picks they gave away which would've been enough i reckon after watching this team play right now
Jarrett Allen died for this
"Guards: Steph, Dame, Booker, Beal, Kyrie, Trae, Lavine  Wings: KD, Kawhi, Zion, Jimmy  Bigs: Christian Wood, Bam, Draymond, Jarrett Allen  Keep the fools who were on the fIBA team off the olympic team roster and take into account of things such as a guy like Harden probably won't play"
"Jarrett Allen is a solid defender and rebounder. If it was my team I would only consider defense first big men. If Turner isn't available I would be looking at Jarrett Allen, Isaiah Stewart, Robert Williams, and Nerlens Noel."
The US could go with Christian Wood or Jarrett Allen
maybe even try jarrett allen?
"Mavs need a strong defensive anchor that adds value off ball with Luka's usage rate.  Jarrett Allen, Capela, Gobert, Myles Turner would be attractive targets to pursue."
Larry nance + Jarrett Allen + 1st round pick for Cj.
"Larry nance, Jarrett Allen and a frp pick swap for Cj mccollum."
"Can‚Äôt discredit the front office for the great moves as well.  On our end, Sean Marks turned turd into gold then cashed in. For example, DLo flourished with us then traded for Durant. We also have lost so many draft picks and other great talent like Jarrett Allen.  Ain‚Äôt nobody was coming to BK until we turned around our culture since that debacle with Pierce and Garnett. ü§£"
"Jarrett Allen could thrive in Portland with Dame and new coach. Would probably need to send more to get cj, though"
Jarrett Allen üëÄ
I'm pretty confused too. Even _with_ Harden people thought the loss of Jarrett Allen would hold this team back lol
Without Harden? How??  Nobody said that before the Harden trade and we lost Caris and Jarrett Allen since then
Imagine if they had Levert and Jarrett Allen
"I love Jarrett Allen.  However, I think he may not get better than what he is now, which is a very good rim protector who can finish sometimes.  Claxton gives a little more perimeter defensive flexibility but not quite the rim protection.  Also not as strong so his rim-running isn‚Äôt as effective.  However, he seems to have a higher ceiling than allen."
damn i'm waiting for jarrett allen to suit up then
Imagine Luka with Capela or Jarrett allen
"Lopez, Capella, Ayton, Valanciunas, Vucevic, Adebayo, Gobert, Jokic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, and Myles Turner are all better."
I feel ya.  Jarrett Allen is my GOAT because of his fro and he's just so adorable in this Brooklyn Barbershop.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWETPpeEvwE
"Harden was literally traded for Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, 3 1sts and 4 swaps. Lakers can't do it straight up but in a 3-4 team trade"
"Caris Levert,Jarrett Allen,Taurean Prince,Rodion Kurucs 3 unprotected first round picks and 4 draft swaps"
"It's probably comparable to the Jrue trade, I don't think Bledsoe and Hill had much value, but Harden got them LeVert and Jarrett Allen on top of all the picks."
That was a weird game during the Jazz bad start to the season where Jarrett Allen played like a superstar. Both teams are very different now so I wouldnt use that as a big reference
"Shoulda just stayed on the Cavs.  LeBron plus the current Cavs core would be a pretty good team, Sexton and Garland can both create their own shot and Jarrett Allen is a better center than Andre Drummond (that's why the Cavs dropped him for JA).  You could even have dumped KLove for AD since they resigned Love after LeBron left."
As trash as that trade was at least the Nets were able to provide Jarrett Allen who's better than anyone the Lakers could provide. No one values any of those players you listed. Blazers would rather let him walk than take those players on.
"I hope Cuban can get him guys like Bogdan, Ingles, Clarkson, And Chandler/capela-like guys (hell, give Luka Gafford or Holmes or maybe even Jarrett Allen although that‚Äôs impossible)who can either:  1.	Hold down the D while Luka is resting and prevent the other team from having a run  2.	get buckets consistently and playmake to either close the gap when Luka rests or stretch the lead."
Jarrett Allen
"Alright, I wanted to say this for a long time, I think these players will shape the coming era by being the best or second best or third best player in a good playoff caliber team - KAT, Booker, Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Murray, Siakam, Fultz, Lonzo, Tatum, Fox, Mitchell, Bam,  Jarrett Allen, (Kuzma), Ayton, Luka, Trae, SGA, MPJ, Zion, Ja, Barrett, Herro, Poole, KPJ, Edwards, Wiseman, Lamelo, Haliburton.  What do y'all think?   (PS - I apologize for missing / including some players)"
"If any of these qualify, I‚Äôll take em on the Raptors:  Haliburton, Jarrett Allen, Deandre Hunter"
Jarrett Allen
"Jarrett Allen, I‚Äôm still miffed we didn‚Äôt try harder to grab him from Houston"
"Jarrett Allen seems to be the same way. But our fans 1) want to see him be more aggressive offensively, and 2) don't want him to get paid."
"You gotta ask why did they choose Brooklyn. It's not like Brooklyn was a popping free agent destination before these guys, despite being a NYC team. Being in NYC definitely helps, but I'd bet that if Chicago had a ton of cap space, they couldn't lure two guys like Brooklyn did.   The FO did a great job convincing players that this is a place they could win. They were creative in building a playoff team with a bad hand (no picks, lacking talent to start with) and they actually built a solid team culture. The playoff run with DLo, Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen definitely helped with that. Now they reap the benefits of their good work."
Ben is as good of a shooter as guys like Jakob Poeltl and Jarrett Allen
"I'm biased, but I'm with you. Management since Sean Marks and Joe Tsai took over has been top notch, even ignoring free agents wanting to play in NYC.  First off, they drafted Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert back-to-back years in the 20s, traded for players like D'lo and Bruce Brown without giving up assets, signed and developed Dinwiddie and Harris when they were almost out of the league. The reason the Nets had enough draft picks to trade for Harden and the Heat didn't was that the Heat had signed a lot of bad contracts and had to dump assets, something the Nets really never had to do (they did this with Crabbe, but that was only when they knew they were getting Kyrie/KD).  Do they have the advantage of being in NYC? Hell yeah they do. But the Nets had a pathetic reputation a few years after moving to Brooklyn. That only changed when management did."
duncan robinson/jarrett allen
"Everybody saying NY is a FA attraction, which it's true. But you still gotta be good and respectable ( ex: knicks the past 20 years). Sean Marks inherited a plethora of problems, he really deserves credit in turning this team around. Built a culture and caught the attention of KD/Kyrie. Then with late first rounders, drafted and developed talent in Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen. Then flipped those 2, with a bunch of draft picks, for James Harden. Wouldn't have seen this coming 3 years ago, but then again, anything can happen"
"There‚Äôs nothing NY‚Äôs FO could‚Äôve done is my point. Even if the Knicks had Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen, the two stars didn‚Äôt want to play for Dolan. The good role players are icing on the cake but let‚Äôs not act like that was some major factor, they wanted to play together and in NY just not under Dolan which left 1 team."
"the thing is the other teams had to give up the farm for harden, but the nets didn‚Äôt, they gave up jarrett allen and caris levert plus some picks and swaps, the other teams‚Äô rumored deals included young all stars like ben simmons and jaylen brown"
"Celtics fans love to pretend KD and Kyrie just chilled one day and said ‚ÄúBrooklyn‚Äù and that Sean Marks, Kenny Atkinson, DLO, Jarrett Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie were never born."
"It‚Äôs ok - Sean turned the franchise around with an absolute dire situation.   Not many want to give the guy credit (d‚Äôlo, Levert, dinwiddie, harris, Jarrett Allen) but go off."
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll leave. I was curious where he *could* go though, cause I hate the Lakers (not a LeBron fan either tbh) and it‚Äôd be funny.  -	Mav‚Äôs would be the best option, they‚Äôve got cap space, a good coach, shooters, and a young star. He runs the risk of being called a snake since the Mav‚Äôs beat his old Miami team.  -	Miami has cap space too, and he could frame it as a ‚Äúreturning to his roots‚Äù kinda situation. I‚Äôm not sure how much better their roster is than the Lakers though.  -	Knicks have max cap space and need a playmaker. NY would also be good for his advertisement and investment potential -	Portland might be the best option legacy wise. They‚Äôve never won a title and even non Blazer fans want Dame to win one. Dame would also be the perfect compliment to current LeBron.  -	The Cavs wouldn‚Äôt be the worst option in the world. They‚Äôve got a bad record, so it wouldn‚Äôt look like he was just aiming for a ‚Äúhardest road‚Äù situation. Despite this, the team is reasonably built to be a good fit for LeBron. SexLand can definitely make shots at the very least, and Larry Nance Jr and Jarrett Allen are good defenders. They‚Äôd need to dump salary though either by packaging Love with good draft picks or trading a combination of Taurean Prince, Larry Nance Jr, and Cedi Osman.  -	The Pelicans would be a hilarious option, and might be my favorite option. They‚Äôve got two young start already in Zion and Ingram, and could potential keep Lonzo too. They‚Äôve also got a ton of picks to facilitate trades and clear cap with.  -	The Raptors would be an out of left field option. LeBron may view it as a good way to boost his international brand.   How I‚Äôd rank them:  1.	Of all these options, the Mav‚Äôs seem like the clear cut winner. They‚Äôd probably need to find a way to dump Porzingis though, so that they can re-sign Hardaway Jr and have room for LeBron, but that seems do-able.  2.	The biggest knock on Portland is I don‚Äôt know enough about their Cap Space situation to know if they could manage to sign him. I‚Äôd imagine that it wouldn‚Äôt cost a ton to find a way to offload CJ‚Äôs cap space though. Dame would be the best possible fit next to old LeBron of almost anyone in the league though. It‚Äôd also look the best for his legacy since the Blazers have never won and Dame is universally liked. The other big negative is their porous defense.   3.	The Knicks wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a good fit if he wants a guaranteed ring. However, it would look decent for his legacy. The team would be decent around LeBron if they could re-sign Rose too. Rose, Barrett, LeBron, Randle, Robinson is a decent lineup especial when you figure they‚Äôve got all they‚Äôre picks available to find other pieces.  4.	The Pelicans would be hilarious but could turn really deadly, really quickly. Especially since the Lakers picks the Pelicans own become prized trade capital id LeBron just decides up up and walk. Ingram plus lotto picks could probably net them Beal or LaVine which couldproduce a Lonzo, Beal/LaVine, LeBron, Zion, Hayes lineup which could be very deadly."
&gt;so did the Nets  We're just pretending Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert aren't good players now?
People really swear the nets with Tauren prince and Jarrett allen are some super serious 65 win team it‚Äôs crazy
"And what‚Äôs the argument for trading Jarrett Allen for a late, late first round pick? Or flipping Levert for Oladpio? I think we can be honest that the trade wasn‚Äôt a slam dunk for them at the very least"
Best player availble would be Trae or Ja... but we need bigs so probably somebody like Jarrett Allen
"I watched all of Evan Mobley's games and the comparison I saw was Gobert/Capela/Jarrett Allen with some ability to switch onto smaller guards. He is going to be an elite rim protector and he has great mobility. However his offensive game is still quite raw and needs improvement. He has no real post game or counter moves nor does he have the strength to play bully ball. He's athletic enough to be a good lob threat and a better passer than some of those guys and has shown some ability to hit jumpers, but he isn't quite a stretch big yet. There's a lot to like about him and I love the guy because he played for my school but I've never quite been sold on him as a franchise changing prospect"
"We've made the best pick available three drafts in a row and now we're getting Mobley.  We got Jarrett Allen for free.   Larry Nance is one of the most valuable assets in the league and we got him for Isaiah Thomas and a pick that turned into Moritz Wagner (we also got Clarkson in that trade; he was traded for two seconds and Dante Exum, our main contribution to the Allen trade).  Everyone loves to dunk on the Cavs but we're recovering much more quickly than other rebuilding teams.  If Love didn't suck we'd probably be looking at playoffs next year."
"They have Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland and a high pick. They also seem poised to get some good players or picks back from Sexton. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre building a contender necessarily, but I do think they could build a playoff team fairly easily."
"They had shitloads of draft picks, the Lakers do not. The only picks the Lakers have are the 22nd pick in this year's draft and the 2027 pick. That's it. Brooklyn traded three 1st round picks and 4 pick swaps for Harden along with Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Rodions Kurucs."

"I think it's a tossup honestly. I wouldn't be shocked if he gives them through the All-Star Break, and then assesses his future with the team. I just don't see him staying on this team if they make zero moves.  What sucks for the Blazers is that if Oshley could draft this wouldn't be an issue. They had the 15th, 20th and 26th pick in 2017 and managed to come out of the draft without a single player as good as Kyle Kuzma, who went 27th that draft. Could have had Jarrett Allen, John Collins and Kuzma."
"Game ready meaning someone that's been working out and has kept their conditioning up.  The season just ended for a lot of people and there's players that are already resting or don't start ramping up work until it gets closer to the beginning of the season. As an example, let's say that they asked Jarrett Allen but he may have gotten some shots up but has mostly been relaxing. It's an injury risk to ask them to ramp up in 10 days to be in playing condition."
Give us Jarrett Allen!
Yeah I can see that. McGee is still good in spurts tho and they need a big body that just wants to slap the ball off the rim. I've been trying to find an article where it says Jarrett Allen declined Team USA but all I'm finding is that he was a finalist and not selected. Maybe he is declining now after not being selected originally.
Surprised no Jarrett Allen
"He can only do those things for 15 minutes max. I would prefer like, well, lots of other guys to McGee in this situation. Jarrett Allen, for one."
"The Cavs are schizophrenic on their big men, they want Mobley but traded for Jarrett Allen, and this season had Kevin Love, Jarrett Allen and Andre Drummond on the team. Team's big positions are volatile."
Jarrett Allen?
I also said Jarrett Allen. Give me literally anyone of those options because they‚Äôre almost surely better than Javale McGee
Replace them with a pure PG and a big man. How is Trae not on this team? Jarrett Allen?
or Myles Turner? hell or even Jarrett Allen? make it make sense
"Jarrett Allen has been riding pine behind inferior centers  his entire career  (This is not to say Allen should have been selected, but he should have been selected over McGee)"
"Keldon Johnson I understand, having a 3&amp;D guy is always useful.  But Javale ? Like I hope it just means every decent center from Jarrett Allen, to Dan Gafford said no."
Add Jarrett Allen
Cavs r actually fun team with Jarrett Allen as their star now !
Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley would be great replacements unless DeAndre Ayton switches to team America
"Star players have some leverage, but they don't have all of the power.  The Blazers will definitely accommodate Lillard and only trade him to a contender and/or big market, but I don't think he'll necessarily be able to choose a single team and say ""I'm going there"".    The Nets also had better young players than the Knicks.  Jarrett Allen and Caris Lavert (who I know were both sent to IND for Oladipo) are both better than Barrett or Toppin. I also think there's a chance the Nets picks (and they gave up 3 first rounders and 4 pick swaps) at the end of the trade could be valuable.  Durant and Harden will both be 32 in 21-22.  Durant, Harden, and Irving are also all UFA in 2023, and they don't seem to be the type of players to stay in one place for very long near the end of their careers.    The Rockets have control of the Nets draft picks until basically 2027.  There's a chance that the Rockets end up getting a ton of value out of the deal.  I'm not sure a Knicks trade would have that same upside since Randle, who just turned 26, will likely sign a max deal to keep him with the Knicks for the foreseeable future. I also think, with it being the offseason, there will be a lot more options for the Blazers than the Rockets had during the season."
"At 10 they could have picked Donovan Mitchell or Bam, at 15 they could have taken John Collins, at 20 they could have taken Jarrett Allen or OG.  Fuck they could have gotten Kuzma at 26, at least he's still in the league.  Also could have just traded 15, 20, 26, and CJ for Paul George, that's absolutely a better looking package than Oladipo and Sabonis at that time.  Instead they got one player who has almost never played in Zach Collins and another that's already out of the league in Caleb Swanigan."
What value are you gaining by having both those guys out there? Why would you pay Jarrett Allen $18M per year when Mobley projects to do everything he does and more?  Just doesn't make sense from a basketball perspective. You'd want to have Mobley as your 5 and then surround him with shooting. There aren't any elite teams that run lineups with two bigs like that for a reason. It isn't an optimal lineup.
"Get fucking Dwight Howard, Jarrett Allen and whatever best 7 footer In"
"We had tons of assets and got nothing from them  We had 3 firsts in one of the best drafts in recent years and came out with swanigan and Zach Collins. Could've had John Collins, OG anunoby, Jarrett Allen, etc.   Or flipped those assets and future picks for a star"
"Zion and Trae Young should be the replacements. Maybe Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen should be considered as well because the US needs a traditional big. Some random teams like the Czech Republic will just jam 2 seven footers into the paint, so Brook Lopez would be a guy that could offer good rim protection."
"Passing on Evan Mobley because of some Jarrett Allen would be hilarious but I‚Äôm here for it, bring me Mobley."
"If that‚Äôs the package then I hope we give up all our picks this year besides our lottery pick (16,18,34,36,55) and like 4 or five more future picks and just say fuck the tank.  I think a lineup of Dame, SGA, Dort, Scottie, and FA Center X (Jarrett Allen, Nerlens Noel??) could be solid.  Consolidate our picks further next summer for the next unhappy star that comes around"
"Sexton would be a nice replacement for Beal's spot now that he's out, imo, idk why that dude gets hate but he could do well in a similar role as Beal. He's a walking bucket, great shooter and great off-ball.   MPJ, John Collins, and JJJ would be good good replacements for Jerami Grant now that he's out. I'd also take any of those guys over Kevin Love right now.  I'm assuming you forgot Ja, but he's another great young PG who could play instead of Trae if he were to be injured or not play. Maybe not the same level of playmaker Trae is, but he's still a good passer and altogether dynamic player.  IMO, I think Team USA could've definitely used a classic 7 footer type center to matchup size if needed over Kevin Love, and Jarrett Allen is probably the best USA product to fit that mold right now. Bam is good but he's more of a skilled small ball 5 and hybrid 4, fits a different profile. Draymond as well, he's a point forward PF ideally."
"He would be eligible in 2024 if he wanted to play for USA, which I think he might. By 2024 the #5 position should be wide open for either him, Jarrett Allen, or even Wiseman if he gets put in the right situation and plays to his potential. More or less his job to lose."
"USA's talent pool for bigs is actually kinda shallow especially at true center. Best prospect available now is probably Jarrett Allen, and in the future Ayton should be eligible if he wants to play for Team USA."
Nets fan so I'm prolly biased but they need Jarrett Allen
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
"Bruh pick an actual point guard that is a willing passed or a center that can rebound and make tips. Preference for solid defence too. So lamelo or lonzo, Fox, TJ McConnell... hell for centers you could get one of the Lopez brothers or even Dwight. Maybe Jarrett Allen changed his mind.   But of course let's just get another shooter..."
Jarrett Allen
"john collins, myles turner or jarrett allen, kinda rough"
"I think its stupid to have had four players who do the same thing, Lavine,Booker, Middleton, Holiday and leave playmakers off the team like Ja, Trae,  and even worse Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner and KAT??  Truly moronic."
Truly it comes down to Jarrett Allen vs Trae Young and I personally think that Trae Young would be a perfect fit.
"What in the world do Celtics want with Jarrett Allen?  Rob Williams is going to be a better player across the board, and they just took in Horford too. I mean sure you take Allen if he‚Äôs cheap but he won‚Äôt be."
"Lauri to the Hornets is fun! I also love Frank as a minimum guy on the Warriors, I think he could thrive there off the bench as a spark plug on D.   Josh Hart would be a great glue guy on a contender like the Clippers or Lakers maybe or even Jazz   John Collins on the Hawks is the move but if not him on Dallas would be crazyyy   Lonzo would be cool on the Bulls  Jarrett Allen is likely staying in Cleveland"
"John Collins- Hawks, they‚Äôll likely match whatever, and it‚Äôs better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he‚Äôs in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that‚Äôs even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I‚Äôll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"Bump up Garland for playmaking, kick Love off the team and replace him with Jarrett Allen"
Nah we need a center. Gimmie Jarrett Allen.
"Jimmy Butler has made more field goals than free throws in his career, unlike HarFlop.   When the NBA adds their new rules on foul baiting the Nets should trade him back for Levert and Jarrett Allen if they want to win."
Jarrett Allen?
I‚Äôm hoping for a big‚Äî maybe Mobley or Jarrett Allen
"This is strange, I've never seen this take from bucks fans before that Brook is a good rebounder. Having watched him all the way back since Brooklyn, it has been a known weakness of his and he would box out and tip to his teammates because he wasn't confident in securing them for himself. There wasn't a player on the nets that you would prefer to box out for as a seven footer, the safest option is always to secure it yourself as a center.  I am not calling Brook Lopez bad! My favourite players all have areas of the game where they aren't perfect! LeBron is a top 2 all time player and he can't hit free throws, that's just the truth; Fred VanVleet cannot finish at the rim, that's true. All I am saying is that Jarrett Allen is better at catching basketballs out of the air."
Jarrett Allen maybe? Hell even Lamelo would be a better fit than another pure shooter
Lemme get uhhhh Robert Williams or Jarrett Allen
"the logical names are injured right now I believe. Time Lord, Myles Turner and Mitchell Robinson are on the shelf unfortunately. Jarrett Allen might be available, but either the Cavs pick up his qualifying offer or he goes into RFA."

All great rim protector get dunked on. To get the blocks you have to stepup. That why I have more respect for Jarrett Allen than a lot of centers who don't contest as much
Get Jarrett Allen on the team
"A good team to keep an eye on is the Cavs, and some good players to watch are Sexton, Garland, Okoro, and Jarrett Allen"
Jarrett Allen
"I think he‚Äôs talking more about the D‚ÄôLo version of the Nets vs signing KD and Kyrie as Free Agents.   Sean Marks creating a Playoff team in Brooklyn is what lured Free Agents.    Even if the Nets didn‚Äôt get Kyrie and Durant I fully believe that the Nets would still be in that 5-8 seed range even without the Play In stuff they added.   Sean Marks flipped Thad Young to the Pacers for a 1st that became Caris LeVert and Pacers owe Nets their 2nd round pick  this year as part of it.   Traded Bojan Bogdanovic to the Wizards at the deadline for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen. Had to take on Andrew Nicholson‚Äôs $ that was later traded for Allen Crabbe.   Traded away Brook Lopez to the Lakers and got back D‚ÄôLo for taking on Mozgov‚Äôs terrible contract.    Even though Marks did make a boneheaded move in taking on Allen Crabbe‚Äôs contract without getting ‚ÄúDraft Capital‚Äù when Portland didn‚Äôt want to pay him anymore. He was still able to dump Andrew Nicholson‚Äôs contract to help mitigate the $ since Crabbe was a solid player for the Nets before his knee gave out. Just overpaid because of the massive 2016 Cap bump.   Sean Marks with no control over Brooklyns picks created the Nets core of D‚ÄôLo, LeVert, and Allen out of Thad Young, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Brook Lopez. That‚Äôs a pretty solid return considering Wizards let Bojan walk after a few months, Lakers let Lopez walk to chase ‚ÄúStars‚Äù, and Thad Young left Indiana for Chicago.   Not to mention hitting on Dinwiddie and Harris who were in the scrap heap."
We traded Bojan for the pick that became Jarrett Allen
"honestly I think that point is overrated, we saw great ball movement today. Obviously its not going to be at the level of coordination as a squad thats been playing together for years and years, but it was definitely very fluid today, after the hiccups for the first two games. I'm more worried about the defense than anything else, the small sizing and switching was killing them in many situations. they need more height and strength down low. Bam is not enough, wish they had brought on turner or jarrett allen."
Jarrett Allen should be on this team
"Mines is almost identical.   PG: Steph &amp; CP3 is spot on. I have Lonzo in place of lowry for a taller, defensive guard.   SG: I have Klay as a starter, whille Harden will be the 6th man for the offensive firepower, and Jrue.  SF:  Lebron/Durant &amp; Kawhi is spot on. I have Mikal bridges instead of PG as the slasher and dirty work guy. I had PG initially in my mind first though,  PF: I have exactly the same  C: The same besides Jarrett Allen. i had Brook Lopez to space the floor if needed."
"I know OP said 15, but I'm picking 12 because that's what we actually send to the Olympics/FIBA events.  Starters: Steph Klay KD LeBron AD  Bench: Kyrie Harden Butler Kawhi Tatum Draymond Bam  And since that's basically the 2016 Rio roster with a few minor changes, here's one for Paris 2024 just for fun.  Starters: Trae Booker Jaylen Brown Tatum AD  Bench: Ja Fox Spida Ingram Zion Bam ...and the wild card. I'm fairly certain that Ayton still has the option to apply for a US passport and play for Team USA (if he chooses). In that case he becomes the starter over an aging AD. Otherwise that last spot could go to MPJ if they need a stretch big to play next to Zion, Jarrett Allen for another rim protector, or maybe even John Collins."
Jarrett Allen would be a good choice
Jarrett Allen declined
"Who do you think they should have extended an invite to?  Brook and Turner were awful last go-around.  I think Towns and Jarrett Allen declined. I wouldn‚Äôt argue with having Brook in Love‚Äôs place, but that‚Äôs an end of bench guy.  What credible, rotation big was available?  If you look across the NBA, almost all the high-quality bigs are from other countries.  Capella, Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Vuc, Zubac, Nurkic, Valanciunas, Sabonis, even starters like Adams and Poeltl.  Who does that leave?  The bigs from yesterday (Jordan, Howard) are close to washed."
"I mean, there are plenty of energy bigs who can do the ""block shot, get rebound, set screen, get out of the way"" thing. Basically just do a B-/C+ Tyson Chandler impression. Personally I think it would have been funny to send Time Lord to Tokyo, just to see what might happen.  We ought to consider that Colangelo/Krzyzewski/Popovich/whoever else is responsible for these selections communicated some kind of strategic intention or preference when they invited Love. They aren't just picking names out of a hat, there's *some* reason for that decision, however much we all disagree with it. The only plausible basketball reasons I could come up with were shooting, and a history with USA Basketball. That's why I keyed in on Myles Turner, who might be the only player who fits the profile and is eligible to represent the United States.  It really illustrates what a crazy situation this is. More broadly, we're living through this renaissance of skilled big men, you almost can't turn on an NBA game without seeing a seven-footer doing something borderline superhuman, and *NONE* of them are American/eligible to play for Team USA. (Kevin Durant doesn't count, he's 6'13"".) Instead we've got folks in this thread making full-throated endorsements for Jarrett Allen, Mason Plumlee, Brook and Robin(?) Lopez... Jarrett Allen will never in his life be even a tiny fraction of the player that Embiid, Jokic, or Gobert are. Shit, Nic Vucevic would dominate just about every American big.  Maybe it's a good thing though. Up to this point Team USA has really only been capable of doing one of two things: steamrolling everyone, or flaming out in a colossal disappointment. This is one of several major indicators that moving forward, international basketball competition might actually be a fair fight."
They dont want to pay him and have convinced themselves paying Jarrett Allen is a good idea instead.
"Not sure if Turner is healthy yet, but someone like Jarrett Allen would give the coach a very useful alternative look. There‚Äôs no defensive 3 in the key, so parking a rim protector under the basket is sometimes a good idea. Also, defensive goaltending rules are less restrictive - if a ball bounces off the rim it can be swatted off (think Kawhi‚Äôs shot vs Sixers in 2019 ‚Äî that could have been swatted away)."
What about Jarrett Allen?
"Myles Turner is recovering from partial plantar plate tear. Probably better that he sits out and lets that heal. I would have liked to see either Jarrett Allen or Brook Lopez in there, JA because he does all the little things (hard screens, boxes out, fights for boards, rim protects) and Lopez for the spacing and rim protection. It's weird to have Bam and Draymond be the primary (and only) real centers."
"People think Jarrett Allen is the winter soldier lmfao they don‚Äôt understand what an egregious overpay it would be to get him for 20 million.   You would the think the Khem Birch saga (6‚Äô9 buyout C signs with us and averages 12/8 with a block per game) would teach people that we don‚Äôt need to spend that much to get a productive 7 footer for 20 mins a night. Baynes was historically awful but he was the exception, not the rule."
"I think some people were clamoring for Jarrett Allen to be invited (over Kevin Love), which is perfectly reasonable. He might have made a positive contribution, especially against certain teams with good centers (France/Spain chief among them)."
Jarrett Allen
I was really hoping they'd take Jarrett Allen
They need another quality big man too. Jarrett Allen would've been nice
Can they still work on replacing the lineup? They need to take out at least lavine and k love for Myles turner and Jarrett Allen? Or even get a super hustle guy like pj tucker or Marcus smart.
A Christian Wood or Jarrett Allen option would give the coaches something totally different to work with.  I hate this roster construction.
"They need role players, I doubt that guys like Jae Crowder and Jarrett Allen even got invites. The whole roster of scorers thing only works when it‚Äôs the best guys in the league."
Who constructed this roster? How many score first guards do you need? I would genuinely take Jarrett Allen on this team over any guard besides Lillard.
Jarrett Allen should have been on the team as a rim protector
I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true and I doubt GMs think that way.  And the Raptors definitely aren‚Äôt winning a chip by adding Jarrett Allen or Holmes to their core for $20m.  Might as well take a risk with Simmons
Jarrett Allen no cap
Jarrett Allen is +3600 to win DPOY in 2022 while Capela is +4000 to win.
"? Lakers gave up 2 former 2nd picks, one who turned into an all-star immediately after, and one who just got a $90 million contract after being labelled as a ""bust,"" and the 4th pick for 1 year of Anthony Davis (not counting the extension) who was being labelled as injury-prone.     The Rockets didn't even get Levert or Jarrett Allen because they're that incompetent while the Nets get 3 guaranteed years of Harden. Too many franchises nowadays overvalue 1st round picks and swaps that don't materialize into anything good. But the real reason is that the Rockets owner is just shitty and cheap    I'd rather have a prime KD and Kyrie than a 34 year old Lebron who has been injured 2 of the 3 seasons with us."

"yeah wtf, I remember there was a post on here around two years ago about how lebron had only had like 10 or 11 dunk attempts blocked in his entire *career* to that point. (I think it was right after he got absolutely REKT by jarrett allen that one time lol)"
"Well if he can stay healthy and play 30-35 minutes a game he‚Äôs better than Jarrett Allen, so I would imagine a lot of teams."
If he stays healthy he's getting what Jarrett Allen got.

Guess if he only plays in limited minutes he always looked Mitchell Robinson - Jarrett Allen tier to me
"I honestly have no idea  Strike that, it definitely isnt. Jarrett Allen is the same age and just signed a 5/$100M."
"&gt;On Nov. 14‚Äîtwo months before the trade was officially announced‚Äîearly talks between Houston and Brooklyn included Harden for Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen. The picks weren't finalized at that point, but a verbal agreement was made, according to sources close to Harden and Durant. (A Nets spokesperson denies a verbal agreement was made at that time.) Harden and Durant believed the deal was done and celebrated the occasion together.  &gt;By Nov. 17, news of the potential deal had spread across the league. Harden and Durant thought it would be finalized on Nov. 22, when trades could officially be announced. But Rockets management changed its tune. Harden, Durant and the Nets had underestimated the Rockets' capacity to posture for a better deal.  &gt;""Houston was being difficult,"" a front-office executive familiar with the Rockets' negotiating tactics at the time told Bleacher Report.  Ah yes I'm sure Harden and KD celebrated the trade based off of nothing. Fuck outta here"
"you‚Äôre taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton‚Äôs age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn‚Äôt do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than SextonüòÇ he‚Äôs passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you‚Äôre talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton‚Äôs entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
"Idiotic trades all around.  Especially when the ""rumors"" are now that Cavs are working on an extension with Sexton.   not to be confused with the ""rumors"" before the draft that they were trading him, but this was before we picked up Mobley, which makes all the trade talk about trading our #1 scorer and best player on the team moot.  ""Evan Dammarell of Fear the Sword and WKYC Channel 3 is reporting that the Cavaliers have put extending Sexton as a plan back on the table.

"They have the bones of a similar team structure, both Jarrett Allen and Kai Jones are pretty good pieces."
"Give me current Carmelo, current Jarrett Allen, and current Buddy Heild and that‚Äôs a chip."
"Nets fan here -   I'd take any Elite Rim Protector with Rebounding/Box Out ability    OR  A Elite 3 and D wing  &amp;#x200B;  Myles Turner, Capella or my old friend ""The Fro"" Jarrett Allen for option #1  &amp;#x200B;  OR  &amp;#x200B;  An Elite 3 and D wing Dorian Finey Smith for option #2"

Jarrett Allen a few years before too.
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
"He was #50 in his class and was playing behind first round picks pretty much every year.  Texas has mismanaged a lot of their program, but their development of bigs is not where they struggle.   Past 5 years:  Kai Jones #51 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 19th pick  Jericho Sims #50 prospect in class -&gt; 2nd round, 58th pick  Jaxson Hayes -&gt; #102 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 8th pick  Mo Bamba -&gt; #3 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 6th pick  Jarrett Allen -&gt; #17 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 22nd pick  Myles Turner -&gt; #6 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 11th pick"
Jarrett Allen was definitely overpaid. Both Lonzo and Allen can be bad contracts dont worry. Overpaying role players is one of the hallmarks of bad teams and why bad teams stay bad.
"It was actually 80 million and here‚Äôs a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It‚Äôs honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing‚Ä¶  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who‚Äôs your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
"u/MidnightLightss was obviously talking about rookie contract stars Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen of the BKN Nets, obviously! /s"
"Norman Powell, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Randle, Jarrett Allen, Hield, Norman Powell, etc you gotta overpay your key rotation guys a lot of the time, even if they're not your traditional superstars / All-Stars."
Jarrett Allen about to sneak his way to top 10 this season üí™
People said you‚Äôd be getting elite rim protection out the gates when you draft Mobley but that‚Äôs just not true.  Mobley is 7‚Äô0 but he does not really play like a big man yet. He‚Äôs more of a SF/PF playing center rn. He‚Äôll need reps  I still think he‚Äôs gonna be an all star down the line but he‚Äôs gonna be a project. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if he had a worse rookie season than Wiseman. He‚Äôs just so raw on offense.  I honestly think he got drafted to the team with the worst fit (Cavs paid Jarrett Allen a 5 year max)
"I'd also point out that the Cavs front office believes they may have added a franchise player in Mobley, and assuming he starts ahead of Love, will have four recent lottery picks alongside the recently re-signed Jarrett Allen at tip off."
Jarrett Allen really shouldn‚Äôt effect any future plans
The block on Jarrett Allen
Aside from Nets and Cavs fans I don‚Äôt really hear that much buzz about Jarrett Allen but he‚Äôs got talent. The kid‚Äôs bound to be an all-star
"I‚Äôd love to see those stats because the restricted area isn‚Äôt much more than 3 feet from the basket and he averaged 5.1 fga from there, more than 93% of the players in the league. In order, here are the fga per game of all the players in the op:  * Giannis - 9 * Lebron - 6.4 * Butler - 5.8 * Jokic - 5.4 * Dame - 5.4 * AD - 4.8 * Harden - 4.8 * Embiid - 4.7 * Kyrie - 4.7 * Doncic - 4.3 * Steph - 4.3 * Booker - 4.1 * Kawhi - 3.7 * Trae - 3.3 * KD - 2.8  He also shot 68.1%. The only non-centers who shot at least as well on 5 plus fga per game from the restricted area are Giannis, Sabonis, Lebron, Fox, and Wood. Gobert, Ayton, Harrell, Jokic, Bam, and Jarrett Allen are others if you include centers."

"You used a flawed espn stat to suggest he was a well enough defender but I'm the one looking that the scraps of their coverage...  You attack me using the assumption that I was using his block numbers to suggest he wasn't a good defender but go on to use steal numbers...  The rebound rate I frankly don't care about  The suggestion that the pacers purposely funnelling players to turner in the paint makes him a worse rim protector than jokic is a new one. Turner contested the most shots 6ft or closer and held opponents to an incredibly low fg%.  The nuggets are 27th in pace on nba.com and bbref. I'd love to see their shots at the rim normalized for pace. And of the 28.2 shots at the rim, jokic contested 7.6 of them and gave up a 63.5% conversion rate. And tying it with the paragraph above, nuggets happen to give up the highest fg% within 6ft in the league and the pacers are 6th best. Now, clearly both numbers aren't solely a reflection of jokic and turner, but since they both contest the most shots within 6ft for their respective teams, they play a major part  Among the players who defended as many as 4 shots from 15 onward, jokic has the 6th worst frequency. Players like sabonis gobert and turner are below him because, much like jokic, their teams know those players arent great switch/perimeter defenders. Decrease it to 3.5 shots and he's 10th worst frequency with new names including embiid capela and Jarrett allen below him. And outside of sabonis, jokic doesn't have anywhere near the rim protection of any of these non-switching players  He happens to be middle of the pack among this group in dfg% against when looking at 4 shots or more."

"what happens when he meets Jarrett ""I will block anyone"" Allen"
This might disappoint some fans who would like things to move faster than that.  But Jarrett Allen is honest in his outlook.  There's no need to get your hopes up only to have fans disappointed later.
now I'm imagining the giant that is Jarrett Allen struggling with lubing his switches for his custom mech.
Jarrett Allen too. Someone on Reddit said that they had a conversation with Allen about mechanical keyboards and how Allen excited seemed about them
"Idk, in 2 years we are the 5th seed? That doesn‚Äôt seem awful. Jarrett Allen will be our oldest starter this year. The team is as young as it‚Äôs been."
"Jarrett Allen, what a guy. Glad I got his jersey in Brooklyn"
"Damn Jarrett Allen probably isn‚Äôt who you‚Äôd want for a hype man lmao  ‚ÄúYo if you just workout, eat clean, no booze, get a fresh haircut, you might definitely probably will get that girl you don‚Äôt really like to call you back one day or something‚Äù"
"Paul george at the three for the skinnies, slide KD to the four, Jarrett Allen or Porzingis at the five and you‚Äôve got a game!"
"Some people speculate we got KPJ due to goodwill (or directly, under the table) from the multi-team trades that got Jarrett Allen to the Cavs for cheap, which could make sense"
Jarrett Allen because I still love my large son
"You can‚Äôt just decide to spend more money on players in free agency. There‚Äôs a big gap between the (soft) salary cap and the tax line. The only way to spend a significant amount on taxes is if you‚Äôre re-signing your players to big contracts using their bird rights. Most teams don‚Äôt have players that are good enough to be worth spending into the luxury tax for.   Cleveland could max out a backcourt of Darius Garland and Collin Sexton. That plus Jarrett Allen and the rest of the team would put them into the tax, and it would also be a terrible basketball move because once you‚Äôre in the tax you can‚Äôt easily improve the team and that team isn‚Äôt even necessarily a playoff team"
And Jarrett Allen is only 23 ü§ë
"I think what people mean when they say centers are cheap, is that they are cheap relative to some of the contracts we see signed, rather than you can sign a guy on a minimum to start for you and be good in the playoffs.  To use your examples, Jarrett Allen signed for 20m/y and Noel signed for 10m/y. Does Jarrett Allen have double the impact that Noel does?   That said, I think this  &gt; pluck any bargain-bin guy for the minimum and that'll automatically shore up your rotation at the 5-spot.  Is still true as well honestly. The guys who you mentioned as vet mins ARE shoring up center depth. They might not be able to play in every series due to matchups, but against the right team they can be super valuable. If they are your number 1 option at C, you are probably screwed, but as a situational weapon they can win you a series by being an X-Factor."
"It's not just Hayes, he is way too high on too many guys who bust, he loved Frank Ntilikina and Mo Bamba too. It's a bad track record. Tjarks to me has consistently been better.   I also listened to his free agency podcast and he said that he liked the DeRozan, Jarrett Allen, and fucking Zack Collins contracts. I don't think I can disagree more with someone's view of what were good contracts in this off-season.   His analysis is just not that in depth. It's simplistic and lacks nuance. He repeats the same advice for literally every guard star in the NBA, in that he always says the next step for Dame, Harden, Trae, LaVine, Booker, and Beal is to play off the ball and cut like Steph Curry, neglecting the fact that Dame and Harden are too old to change their games like that and that NBA superstars love having the ball in their hands, not running around off the ball hoping to get the ball back from an inferior teammate. You're not going to turn Dame into an off the ball player at this stage in his career, it's just not going to happen. (How's he going to do that on the Blazers anyway?)"
We had Jarrett Allen playing in the summer league after he started every game for us lol
"I think the Cavs will be a pleasant surprise.   - Jarrett Allen bout to have monster year n make Brooklyn regret doggin him out  - they got tons of young talent wth sexton, okoro, garland, mobley,   - solid depth with dude like osman, rubio and Dean Wade could b good plus Nance who may be one of the best bench players in the league   - pretty chill coach in bickerstaff  - and who knows, Kevin Love may have a resurrection   Go Cavs!!!!"
"It sounds worse when you only criticize the Sixers players and just bring up the good points about the Warriors.  Simmons can always be rerouted to a third team for additional picks.  There‚Äôs just nothing compelling to me about a Wiseman despite him being a high draft pick, he projects as nothing more than a Jarrett Allen player"
"how about jarrett allen and collin sexton for Siakim? sure it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for Toronto, but my team wins so i‚Äôm gonna go post this in the toronto sub"
What about 4 picks and 3 swaps?  I‚Äôm being facetious but we heard this exact same discussion around how Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen were just role players and thus not enough for a star like Harden and yet that‚Äôs exactly what ended up happening
Do you feel better the same or worse about the pairing with Jarrett Allen?
Jarrett Allen is not Nikola Jokic
JARRETT ALLEN. Warriors need a big.
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
I remember when Jarrett Allen was in summer league a couple years ago and had opposing teams fans upset too lol
It's been hit or miss recently.  Jarrett Allen and Mo Bamba
Jarrett Allen doesn't become dead weight. He is a tradeable asset and unless something major happens will be for quite a while
"Washington's offseason 2016 moves was an extreme blunder that should be talked about as much as draft busts. The moves they made that summe, and the next summer, left them stuck, well before Wall's supermax kicked in.   *Quick run down (after being paid dust by KD, and, missing out on signing Al Horford):   Signed Scott Brooks at $35M/5yr, making him one of the highest paid coaches at the time. Also, hired another former coach of KD to the staff. Frank Vogel was hired twice during the span of that deal, first by division rival, Orlando Magic.  Signed Ian Mahinmi at $64M/4yr, making him a higher paid player than then-starting C, Marcin Gortat. Mahinmi was also turning 30, while coming off a severe injury that kept him out for a heavy majority of the subsequent season.   (*Horford was also about that age, but, also significantly better than Mahinmi).  Signed Jason Smith at $16M/3yr, adding another 30+ year old C to the mix. In that first season with Washington, he averaged less than 15 minutes per game, for the first time in 5 years.  Signed Andrew Nicholson at $26M/4yr, after being a benchwarmer for a poor Orlando Magic team. Theoretically, he could shoot, but, he couldn't play, resulting in Washington trading away a first round pick (who became Jarrett Allen) to the Nets, for Bojan Bogdanovic. Nicholson was then traded to the Trailblazers (for Allen Crabbe), who stretched his contract.   In 2017, Washington signed Otto Porter at $106M/4yr, making him the highest paid player on the team, two years before Wall's supermax kicked in (Wall signed his new deal that summer). It also resulted in Bogdanovic leaving, meaning the first round pick they traded was for a rental of Bogdanovic.  None of those players were tradable for a roster upgrade, besides possibly Otto Porter (seemed like inking Porter's deal put a time clock on Kelly Oubre's time in Washington). Otto was a highly useful player, but, that contract was a brutal amongst everything else. And, for about 3 years, Washington was reduced to signing players to vet minimum deals (or, splitting the taxpayer MLE) so the team was stuck in place, while surrounding EC opponents built rosters with depth."
"I dunno, KD probably doesn't play next Olympics and without him this team could've easily lost. US don't have a lot of elite big men either other than Bam and Zion and they're both undersized. Maybe Wiseman, JJJ or Jarrett Allen improve drastically by next Olympics but it's a weakness other countries are strong at."
"In 2024 we'll have choices like Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, Kai Jones (just drafted), Myles Turner, etc.  sorry i think you might be able to find my bias lmao"
"Oh wow completly forgot that the pick would've been in OKC. Makes it even better, even if I'm one of the 1% here who think the Rockets took the right deal.  I guess a lot of people here would've rather build around Simmons and John Wall or have the right to pay Jarrett Allen 20 millions per year"
Jarrett Allen would be a huge player for the US
"Jarrett Allen, mason plumlee, Myles turner???None of these guys were available???"
jarrett allen shoulda been here already honestly.  why we getting javale over jarrett allen?
Why didn‚Äôt Jarrett Allen just play this year wtf is this roster tbh
"We gotta develop Jarrett Allen, James Wiseman, Evan Mobley, etc. we need some good bigs next Olympics"
Would Jarrett Allen have been better than Bam matchup wise for team USA?
Jarrett Allen did absolutely dominate Gobert this year
Jarrett Allen should've been on this team
Well yes but I think perhaps the point is Jarrett Allen ain't really close to that. He's a league average center.
"I mean, it makes sense.  They missed out on Jarrett Allen and Richaun Holmes, so who exactly are they going to sign via free agency with that cap space?  I guess Lauri wouldn't be a bad choice as a backup center but he's looking for a payday and I believe the Hornets were in talks to sign him, and they have more cap space than we do currently should it come to a bidding war.  Better to wait and flip him closer to the trade deadline for a future second or the like when some team is looking for a veteran prescience on their team.  As long as he's healthy, it should be too difficult."
No one is building around Jarrett allen
Jarrett Allen 5/100 isn‚Äôt a dumb move tho like at all
Damn Cavs really gotta save to get a Jarrett Allen level guy
"Damn saving up for Jarrett Allen huh  Hey, no judgement, you pay up for the best, and Allen certainly has the leagues best frow"
I'd trade him  ...for Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen
Switched to CJ because he's American.  How about  - Porter Jr. for knockdown 3s and solid rebounding  - Jarrett Allen for post play  - Marcus Smart off the bench for defense and hustle
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
"Yeah 20 mil is solid starter territory now. To put that into context, this season THJ, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson, Evan Fournier, and Norm Powell are making in the ballpark of $20 mil a year now. I would have FVV over all those contracts."
The cavs front office signed Jarrett Allen for 25m per year. That‚Äôs a testament to how bad they were and still are
"our ‚Äúfew other pieces‚Äù are Jarrett ‚Äúthe Fro‚Äù Allen and Evan Mobley. Hence, Sexland and Frobley"
"PG: Darius Garland/ KPJ SG: SGA SF: Cade Cunningham  PF: Jerami Grant C: Jonathan Isaac or Jarrett Allen  Being hopeful here that Cade is as advertised and what Isaac showed before getting hurt is real. I think this lineup is good enough for at least a second round appearance assuming they don‚Äôt run into 76ers, Bucks, or Nets.   Coaching is the real difference maker here"
Jarrett Allen is so much better than Wendell Carter.
Ray Allen/Tony Allen/Jarrett Allen or Ray Allen/Tony Allen/Smailagic Al(l)en
"Wow did not see this coming. Really thought they‚Äôd be moving on.  25m per seems high but with players like Jarrett Allen getting 20m per, duncan Robinson at 18per, he‚Äôs fair market and this is just the new normal for above average, solid role players"
I‚Äôm a Cavs fan and I don‚Äôt get why he couldn‚Äôt just accept that Jarrett Allen his role better than him. Terrible teammate.
Jarrett Allen
"to avoid something like that, I'd love to see the 4th-10th teams getting a variable ""mid tier exception"" type of contract. It would take a bunch of stipulations, but: 1 year deals, ranging from $6m to $15m with the amount increasing as you go back in the standings. Must sign a player who did not finish the season on the roster and has never received a max contract, no S&amp;T (nonwaivable trade clauses built in).  For example, the Lakers, finishing 6th could have signed Kendrick Nunn to a 1 year, $10 mill deal. Raptors could've floated Jarrett Allen a $15m contract for finishing 12th. May need to adjust amounts based on draft position and have something so these players can become part of the core later rather than just being one and done mercenaries.  IMO this would help players ring chase at an earlier age, especially if they underperformed on their rookie deals or were USDA/second rounders. Plus it would make free agency more exciting in small markets"
"Lakers traded Lonzo, Ingram, Hart and a lotta picks for AD. Nets traded Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert and a lotta picks for Harden. Sounds like they did the same thing the Celtics did"

"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
PUT SOME RESPECT ON MY MAN JARRETT ALLEN AS WELL PLEASE!
"Jarrett Allen is a center lol they don‚Äôt even play the same position. Secondly, The Hawks are not in the same financial position as the Cavs lol to just shell out whatever. What other big were the cavs going to sign lol? The Hawks still have other key singings to make which is why they are taking their time. Trae just got the super max so now the overall contract value on Collins means more, financial flexibility will be key to their window of winning. Collins is not worth $120M over 4 and if you think so you‚Äôre smoking crack."
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
"Tatum went 3 and would have been 1 without the Philly trade down. Bam, Fox, Mitchell all went in the lottery. All four are varying degrees of franchise cornerstones now. All would have been better choices at 1 or 2. It also had John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Johnathan Isaac... Arguably better picks than Lonzo and definitely better than Fultz. That draft class was pretty solid.  I think it's just that even in really strong draft classes, the predraft consensus at the top is usually wrong."
Jarrett Allen  Afro
"That's the secret reason we've been stockpiling taller players. Tacko Fall, Lauri Markkanen, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen are about to feast."
Do you want Nurk to be your second best player? Would you want Jarrett Allen to be your second best player if you believe that Allen is better than Nurk?
"They really ranked Jarrett Allen above Nurkic, and Mitchell Robinson above Valanciunas."
I hate seeing him in Cleveland Bc it seems like they‚Äôre trying to make him a PF when he‚Äôd play better as a C IMO. Having him and Jarrett Allen in the front court just doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.
"An interesting question to think about would be whether you guys end up grabbing Jarrett Allen and LeVert, and picking up Dinwiddie in the 2016 FA period. A big part of why you guys got KD and Kyrie was because of the young talent you had, including those three."
"It'd probably be similar to the Nets pre-Harden trade minus Jarrett Allen, so still title contenders, but no longer favorites."
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
"Okoro is a monster and if he develops his raw offense, he could easily be an all-star some day. Sexton's offense is really really good and he has all the right attitude. Garland's playmaking is elite for his age and he is really turning into something special.   Mobley hasn't even played, yet, but there's a lot of potential and his style, size, and abilities align with the nba's future.   Jarrett Allen is Jarrett Allen, you know who he is and how valuable he is.   Lauri has the opportunity to turn his career around and get back on his all-star trajectory that he had early on.   And then there's the surprise sleeper, Dean Wade. Dude can actually shoot and play both sides of the floor. With some further development on his defense, some more faith in minutes, he can be a great role player for the future."
Only guys challenging for DPOY next season IMO:   Giannis Gobert Embiid AD  then there‚Äôs a sizeable gap until   Jrue OG  Bam Ayton Jarrett Allen
Poor Jarrett Allen lol
"&gt; I think his stats would look better if he hadn't been forced to the perimeter with Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Love, McGee and Hartenstein all getting minutes last year.      I mean isn't the idea that Zeller will back up Nurkic? Not sure how this really changes anything for him."
"The closest guy to Derrick White I can think of is Marcus Smart. Great defender, takes a lot of charges, one of the best shot blocking guards in the entire league, and can switch on to a decent amount of 3s. Offensively he's pretty good at running pick and rolls and can shoot from outside but isn't great at it. He can play 1 or 2 offensively and I think if he was playing next to an athletic big like Jarrett Allen, his pick and roll game would be great.  If he's healthy this season, he'll probably be the best player on the spurs. Even Pop said he was the most important player on the team like 2 years ago."
"To add to your point I think Larry Nance is a solid starter and a super-sub.  He should work well as a smart, versatile, off-ball threat to run to the rim or launch from deep (36% last year, albeit on low volume).  I think his stats would look better if he hadn't been forced to the perimeter with Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Love, McGee and Hartenstein all getting minutes last year."
Jarrett Allen throws off serious Luigi vibes
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
"Nah, I‚Äôm pretty sure he shot 76% on a stats loophole: Either he dunked the lob or bungled things so badly, it counted as a turnover for the passer.  Ask poor Spencer Dinwiddie, who spent the whole 2019-20 season lofting balls Jarrett Allen (or Javale McGee) could have yammed in his sleep, only to watch DJ not even jump if there was any obstacle in his way. Harden‚Äôs Lebron-level passing made some headway, but he was so openly infuriated at a DJ‚Äôs defensive apathy, his arrival was what finally gave Nash to clout to bench him for good.  He‚Äôll definitely be a less dour bench cheerleader than Gasol though. At least when cameras are on."
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"from bbref:   December 23, 2019: Traded by the Utah Jazz with a 2022 2nd round draft pick and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Jordan Clarkson.

"John Wall at PF next to Jarrett Allen?  He'll blow by most big men.  Won't rebound for shit, but there'll be a C/PF at every other position lol"
Might have to send Kyrie to the Cavs for that to work. Maybe Jarrett Allen could go to BKN for salary?
Uh...Jarrett Allen wasn't paid anywhere near the max lol
give us jarrett allen back please
"Lol I mean there‚Äôs several tiers separating giannis and embiid from KD, he‚Äôs nowhere near them. A guy like Jarrett allen is a better rim defender than KD and he‚Äôs nowhere near embiid and giannis. I swear some people on this sub only talk in 2k terms of 1 on 1 wing defense, it‚Äôs hilarious"
"We know the Cavs were willing to move Sexton, and I think he‚Äôd be a good scorer/ballhandler next to Embiid. Not sure I like the fit of Simmons and Jarrett Allen/Mobley though. Mobley/Allen at the 4 and 5 is worse spacing next to Simmons than Embiid and Harris"
wut? Jarrett Allen was a part of Harden trade.
"I'll go with a recent one : for the life of me, I don't understand how people can say the Harden trade was bad for Houston, like they made a huge mistake not picking up Jarrett Allen (look how he got paid),Levert or Simmons.  They made sure they'd get a high pick, and have now their building block, they made sure they'd be bad for years instead of being mediocre (at best) with veterans"
"I was like maybe 8 yrs old when he retired so I don't remember too much from his career, but I always appreciated his cycle of afro, cornrows, and buzz. Props to Jarrett Allen for keeping the 'fro alive after Ben left."
Love DJ as a person.. but he really seemed oblivious to how bad he was when he played. It was ridiculous that we had to start him over Jarrett Allen to keep the peace.
&gt; I gotta admit I wouldn't want to be a Cavs fan right now.  Sorry but this is a bit rich coming from a Pacers fan. The Cavs future is still pretty bright with the amount of young guys on the team. They should be entertaining this year even if the wins aren't there yet. I still think 30 wins is possible though depending on injuries. I don't want to be stuck in the 7-10 seed every year.  &gt; -Undersized backcourt with an undersized shooting guard looking for more money than Terry Rozier.   I'm assuming you are talking about Sexton here. There is no indication he is asking for the moon in contract negotiations. All speculation right now. And Sexton is better than Rozier anyway.  &gt; -Logjam in the frontcourt with players who can't shoot (and don't tell me that Jarrett Allen can space the floor yet he's averaged 0.1 3PA/game for his career).  Logjam of who? Allen isn't meant to space the floor with his shot. He's a great PnR guy with good hands that plays defense. Mobley and Markkanen can absolutely space the floor. And if Love plays he can too.   &gt; -I honestly have no idea how Lauri fits into this. He's basically a black hole on defense.   Clearly the Cavs are taking a chance here but Markkanen will finally get to play with a true PG and just needs to hit threes which he did well last year.  &gt; -Kevin Love's contract for 2 more seasons; dude has shown no inclination to take a buyout.  Doesn't really matter. The Cavs don't ever get huge names in free agency and don't need the cap space. He can sit on the bench for 2 years or play a few minutes. It doesn't really matter either way.
I gotta admit I wouldn't want to be a Cavs fan right now.  -Undersized backcourt with an undersized shooting guard looking for more money than Terry Rozier. Same case of where he actively needs to be paired with a big playmaker to unlock his full potential.  -Logjam in the frontcourt with players who can't shoot (and don't tell me that Jarrett Allen can space the floor yet he's averaged 0.1 3PA/game for his career).  -I honestly have no idea how Lauri fits into this. He's basically a black hole on defense.   -Kevin Love's contract for 2 more seasons; dude has shown no inclination to take a buyout.
And the Nets lost such a perspective center in Jarrett Allen
"The tweet says he asked to start over Jarrett Allen, who at this point is a significantly better player."
"that list would be way more interesting with a significantly higher volume threshold. idk what its using but zubac, Rolo, Jarrett Allen, etc. shouldn't be on there imo"
It was his demanding that he start over Jarrett Allen that got him cut.
Poor Paul Pierce. He had a lot of takes on Joe Ingles and Jarrett Allen but we never heard them because they were busy talking about the greatest players in the NBA. Damn :(
"i mean, Fultz and Thybulle were the only two who shot over 30% from 3 in conference play and UW without Fultz lost multiple games by 20 or more  Fultz was at 24/5.5/5.5 in conference play   plus there‚Äôs never been a better PnR player at the college level i‚Äôve ever seen. that was the foundation of his game because he could hit that pull-up from the elbow like Kyrie, but his jumper had so much lift he was like a taller donovan mitchell who could also use that screen to launch a 3  he was a better passer than Lonzo (the stats agree) and Fox was his only contemporary imo. Fultz at the u18 FIBA america‚Äôs tourney was the MVP of a team with Trae Young, Jarrett Allen, and Michael Porter Jr.   honestly, i don‚Äôt know what you could want in a point guard if Fultz didn‚Äôt have it"
"And ultimately wound up with Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and nets draft picks which they converted into Victor Oladipo and Cavs 2022 pick and Nets draft picks."
"I feel like the Bulls should be considered a rebuild because 3/5 of their starters were acquired in the last year? And they replaced their coach - this seems like a rebuild to me.   Grizzlies are the definition of a rebuild - got rid of their two franchise players Marc Gasol and Mike Conley in 2019, and have drafted a solid young core which was the 9th seed in 2020 and the 8th seed in 2021. If you get rid of your franchise players and start building around a young star that is the definition of a rebuild - and they‚Äôve had more success than the Cavs in a harder conference.   Thanks for agreeing on the Wolves. Their core has only played like 10 games with the 3 of them.   I look forward to seeing what the Cavs can do, but feel like you have a lot of issues still? Coach got replaced, Love is still useless/looking to get bought out, Jarrett Allen is paid 100m over 5 but your high potential draft pick plays the same position? And Garland and Sexton also kind of do? I think you have nice pieces to trade, your team just needs to make some tough decisions. Ben Simmons would be good on your team tho."
Jarrett Allen looked too cool
I like SexLand. I like Jarrett Allen.   But you can‚Äôt really think that team is going to be better while Embiid is still in his prime. And the 6ers roster construction IMO was almost perfect - if you could switch the starting PG to someone who could space the floor.   I don‚Äôt think the Cavs will be a better team until Embiid falls off.
"Maybe so, lol. Idk Mobley or the other big men besides Jarrett Allen, but aren't they decent shooters and ball handlers?  Also, like... they fucking suck so it's worth a try"
- my boy Jarrett Allen is going to be like an MIP type candidate   - Klay &amp; Steph going to splash it up in golden state and beat the lakers in the playoffs  - Nets going to get knocked out 1st round  - Immanuel Quickley will be 6MOTY candidate
"The two you mentioned + John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Josh Hart, Dillon Brooks, and Monte Morris are the other guys getting significant rotation play"
"It‚Äôs a college game, but this Jarrett Allen dunk. Just absolutely murdered that man  https://youtu.be/EOd4wqmIJp4"
"I think he'll be a great practice player for Westbrook's style of play ***and*** good in the lockerroom on a Dwight Howard level although DJ  should **BE GREAT** when it comes to cloning Rondo's unique skillset concerning young players.   I think the way DJ embraced the move to give his starting C slot to Jarrett Allen then the way DJ committed to teaching Jarrett very well/helped Jarrett get a bag, *is the exact type of teacher or mentor, which the Lakers will need this year* for Monk THT Nunn etc"
"I would have OG, John Collins, jarrett Allen, Kuzma, Derrick white, and Dillon Brooks all on that list. In no particular order but they need to be acknowledged"
"My two favorite nicknames in the league are Slim Reaper for KD, which is AMAZING, but apparently he hates it.  And Big Alfredo for Jarrett Allen.  Shaq and Chuck started calling him that after he said he plays better when he eats a bowl of alfredo before games."
Future Celtics legend Jarrett Allen  That afro is fucken majestic
"Zach Lavine wants respect, so this must automatically mean he hates the Chicago front office, ignoring the entire relationship Zach and the front office have together.  Respect in Zach's case is about being questioned as he recovered from ACL surgery, always being doubted, having to take a low salary due to the perceptions that he could never be a star, working his ass off, becoming an All Star, becoming the 2nd best player on a Gold medal Olympic team, and being paid only 19 million because of the disrespect the prior Bulls office and other GMs around the league gave Zach. Jarrett Allen is earning more than Zach, as one example.  Respect is Zach being recognized for the player he is. Conclusion... Bulls will be paying him max money to stay in Chicago. He is going nowhere else not will he request a trade."
"We traded so much for so little it still pisses me off. Jarrett Allen is a great young piece, Caris LeVert is a great young piece when healthy, going down the list.      At first I was like ""yes, this is how you rebuild.""      Then when it sunk in I was like ""fuckin' Fertita."""
"Probably Jarrett Allen. But only because his contract.  Not his fault Cavs gave it to him though.   Other players are prob Collin Sexton. He‚Äôs a good scorer, but that‚Äôs about it.   Maybe D‚ÄôAngelo Russell. His game hasn‚Äôt really translated to wins."
Jarrett Allen.  I don't dislike him. I don't hate him. I actually kind of like him.   I just wouldn't put my money into him like Cleveland did. I dunno.  The good answers were already taken
"Really? Nets gave up Jarrett Allen, Levert, Taurean Prince, Kurucs, 3 firsts, and 4 first swaps for Harden.  Even if minny matches those picks, Allen and Levert are way better than any player in this package"
My understanding was that the kpj trade was a wink wink deal with the cavs for Jarrett Allen. That's why Houston traded Allen for so little
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Evan Mobley  C: Tacko Fall  Who needs good NBA players when you can just do netball passes to other seven-footers all day lmao
"So they have Markannen, Mobley, Fall, and Jarrett Allen now??? Is that right or did I miss something"
I have the 2021 Bucks in mind for this team makeup  Marcus Smart - 2nd playmaker/Defense  Joe Harris - Spacer  Joe Ingles - Spacer/Playmaker  LeBron  Jarrett Allen - Lob Threat/Boards
No one makes contracts assuming the player is just gonna fall off. Dude changed the hawks defense and led the nba in rebounds. Jarrett Allen got 20 and wasn‚Äôt close to Capela in production.
"$23m is very reasonable for Capela and what he brings to this team. Not only is he a great lob threat with Trae but he's a fantastic interior defender, which is pretty important when you're trying to hide Trae's defense. Jarrett Allen just got 20m on a deal that ends one year later. I know Allen is younger and has plenty of room to grow but Clint is probably better than Allen in each major aspect of their games right now.       Also the cap will go up significantly by the time this deal kicks in even if the league uses cap smoothing. It's likely that 23m in 24/25 could be the equivalent of 15m contract right now."
Jarrett Allen for $20 million/year is a colossal overpay
"Capela is mad underrated. If Jarrett Allen makes 20M/yr, sounds about right having Clint making 23M/yr"
I didn‚Äôt know Jarrett Allen was European‚Ä¶ in America the wins to before the losses
Jarrett Allen is the most wholesome (and Reddit-relatable) player in the NBA by far
"I feel like Cavs are too deep in rebuild mode plus your spacing issues are already pretty terrible, on top of just giving Jarrett Allen $100 million, drafting Mobley, and believing in Okoro. Don't like Simmons fit there much at all."
PG: Evan Mobley   SG: Lauri Markkanen   SF: Kevin Love   PF: Jarrett Allen   C: Tacko Fall
"I like Allen, although they would be a bit undersized:  [Lucius Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenlu01.html)  [Ray Allen ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html)  [Tony Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allento01.html)  [Grayson Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allengr01.html)  [Jarrett Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenja01.html)  Williams is another good one, although it would be a super small lineup:  [Deron Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willide01.html)  [Lou Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willilo02.html)  [Reggie Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willire01.html)  [Gus Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willigu01.html)  [Buck Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willibu01.html)  However the correct answer is obviously Marjanoviƒá."
Arguable. Is he really better than Jarrett Allen or OG? Fox/Mitchell/Tatum/Bam he has no argument over.
"It's not just the centers you listed though. Valanciunas, Nurk, Jokic, Embiid, Ayton, Vucevic all have huge frames. People talk about the traditional big man going away, but big bruisers are actually thriving. Some have just learned to shoot 3s. Meanwhile there are zero above average starting NBA centers that are even within 20lbs of Mobley's weight.  You can see the Cavs already know he can't match up with that kind of player, which is why they gave Jarrett Allen $100m and will make a long-term project of trying to develop Mobley into a PF that can create from the perimeter then switch to a ""death lineup"" C that only has to hold his own against the big guys in short bursts.   It's not that I think Mobley can't gain any weight, or that he processes calories differently. I just think he has a naturally narrow frame and just like being 4 inches shorter with a similar physique is going to give you a lot less weight, so will being 4 inches narrower. And all of his competition will be working hard to add strength, while he starts that process from about 30lbs behind."
Jarrett Allen died for this?

But to a team that draft Mobley and paid Jarrett Allen
"Lauri Marksmanship is a 3pt camper, Jarrett Allen is much more mobile than Vucci, and Mobley really is a fluid athlete.  I don't think the Lauri signing is that bad for them."
"KAT‚Äôs definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there‚Äôs definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don‚Äôt know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who‚Äôs better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That‚Äôs 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I‚Äôd put above him but are debatable"
"Eh people throwing shade at Cleveland but I like what they‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs something called a 2nd unit people.   Have Jarrett anchor starting unit while Mobley anchors 2nd unit.   Garland-Sex-Okoro-Love-Allen  Rubio-Dot-Cedi-Lauri-Mobley   That‚Äôs a damn good squad with lots of rotation creativity. Then when Love leaves, start Lauri."
"Yeah... my guy can‚Äôt play SF, but I love him and Jarrett Allen as a duo"
36 million a year on Lauri and Jarrett Allen when you just drafted Mobley is beyond insane.
"I think it‚Äôs fine. If you presume Lauri plays 32 minutes at PF, Jarrett Allen plays 32 at center, and Evan Mobley splits his time playing 16 at each, then you have 48 minutes of PF and C filled out."
"Wtf are the Cavs doing the past 3-4 years?  1) Instead of gunning for a ship (Just the fucking arguable GOAT is on your team and chose you in free agency) they play it in between, and keep the nets pick. Turns into Sexton, which basically hasn‚Äôt moved any needle whatsoever. Not the worst idea, but I think if you are small market that has a once in a generation player, you needed to gun for it.  2) They resigned KLove that huge contract after Lebron leaves. We all saw the same Kevin love from 2015-18 right? No way? He‚Äôs injury prone, can‚Äôt create his own offense, and can‚Äôt defend a parked car?  3) Jarrett Allen 100 million? What?? A center who can‚Äôt and probably will never create his own offense gets 100 million? Crazy  4) Getting Lauri, when you have Mobley, Love, Allen and maybe Nance still there? What"
"between Mobley, Jarrett Allen and Lauri their total commitment to bigs is insane really  167m (+ whatever Mobley makes in his rookie deal), 2 first round picks and their own #3 pick to three players who are all 4s or 5s"
.....Jarrett Allen.....
"i mean, I kinda wish we paid this much for Lauri over 3/45 for McBuckets. I'd have definitely taken the swing for Lauri at this money. really good pickup for the Cavs especially with Jarrett Allen and Mobley there to make up for his shortcomings."
Jarrett Allen minutes just took a huge hit.
They are for sure trading Jarrett Allen at the trade deadline.
Jarrett Allen sends his regards
"I feel bad man, I love Jarrett Allen."
Jarrett Allen?
Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen or Mitchell Robinson?
"There‚Äôs no way the Wizards are better than the Nets, Bucks, Sixers, Heat, Celtics, Hawks, Knicks, and Bulls. The Hornets and Pacers exist too. Plus, having Jarrett Allen on the roster for a full season could make Cleveland respectable. Toronto is also hungry to return to the playoffs. The Wizards would be lucky to make the play in."
and Jarrett Allen ?
ok he wasnt that bad lol especially two years ago. this year he really fell off a cliff.   He actually was arguably better than jarrett allen for a bit in 19-20.
"They had a team in the old ABA league, the Pittsburgh Pipers, but they weren't brought over to the NBA.  They actually won they very first ABA championship.  Cleveland, then Philly, then NYC are the closest cities with teams, so if you want access to going live, then the Cavaliers, 76ers, Nets, &amp; Knicks are your options, though Pittsburgh sports fans have big rivalries in sports they care about more, like football, hockey, etc. with this cities so I dunno if local fans will frown on those choices.  Out of those 4, the Brooklyn Nets are the biggest immediate championship contender, followed by 76ers.  The Knicks are a big market team with some exciting young talent, they aren't contending yet but I feel like they might fun to watch as a rising team.  The Cavs I know little about except no one seems to have super high expectations for them and they have Jarrett Allen, a former Net who I think is a rising star and will be a big deal, so that could be fun to watch develop."
Collin sexton  Darius garland  Evan Mobley  Jarrett Allen   Okoro or Nance Jr(for the bench)  They can have Love.
"Sexton, garland, okoro, Mobley, nance/Jarrett Allen"
Yeah 58 million is his lost money. He could have easily made 10 mil a year. And it wouldn't be stretch for him to get deal somewhere between Holmes and Jarrett Allen off his rookie deal.
"Also finessed Jarrett Allen for free somehow, that was a quality move."
"Initially thought team 1 is better but after a second glance team 2 is wayyyyyyyy deeper. Jonathan Issac, Jarrett Allen, and Covington off the bench? That can bother team 1‚Äôs 2-4 all game long"
"I like cavs young core of Sexton, Garland, Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, and Okoro"
"Darius Garland - 6'3""  Collin Sexton - 6'1""  Lauri Markkanen - 7'  Evan Mobley - 7'  Jarrett Allen - 6'11""  **Average height: 6'6ish**"
"Fortunately for us, Jarrett Allen has no fear. You can hack him, poster him, whatever ‚Äî he‚Äôll still get up and try to contest."
"He acts like a child, he constantly pouts when things don't go his way. You see it in his play because he becomes less engaged on the court and the effort he plays with shrinks. If Andre could stick to what he's good at then he'd honestly be a much better player. Problem is that he's always thought that he's better than he is. His basketball IQ is nonexistent. The acrobatic layup attempts. Flashy passes. Boneheaded turnovers. You don't need that from your center. If he approached the game like a Jarrett Allen or Clint Capela he wouldn't be on a minimum deal right now."
Nets? Brook Lopez and Jarrett Allen.
Yeah he has so much to his offensive game but he‚Äôs used as a Rim-Runner. I do reckon Jarrett Allen could probably play his role. As a suns fan do you think y‚Äôall should offer him the max even if the plan is just to use him as y‚Äôall are currently?
"I love how preseason people were like ""hmm idk about the fit with him and Jarrett Allen"" and the mad lads on the Cavs bench are playing him at the 3 next to two 7 footers and he's flourishing lmfao.  So much fun to watch."
"""hot take, the sun's should trade Ayton for Jarrett Allen"" was posted literally this morning lmao"
I seem to recall Jarrett Allen spending a fair time on the IR last season too.  If yall are healthy you could be in the running for a playoff spot.
Dont get too high dont get too low. Remember with our best player its going to be rough.  On top of that our match up  vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up. DeAndre defeated us. Jjj and steven adams hurt us. Today we had kevin love evan mobley and Jarrett allen stop us. They stopped jokic. Then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue. Cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure. I hope we can get to 500 by all star break though.
If you‚Äôre in the LA area. Open your chick fil a app before 10:30am and redeem your free chicken sandwich cause Jarrett allen missed 2fts in a row in the fourth.
If you‚Äôre in the LA area. Open your chick fil a app before 10:30am and redeem your free chicken sandwich cause Jarrett allen missed 2fts in a row in the fourth.
I still can't believe that the Cavs got Jarrett Allen because Fertita didn't want to extend him LOL.   Fertita's penny pinching is also the reason we ended up with Caris LeVert instead of Oladipo.
"My Wiz gave up a first round picks for Bojan Bogdanovich to Brooklyn.  At the end of the season, we chose to match Otto Porter‚Äôs Max contract offer from you guessed it‚Ä¶.Brooklyn and not re-sign Bojan who promptly left for Utah.  That 1st Round Draft Pick became Pick 22 in 2017 Draft. Which was Jarrett Allen.  FML Ernie Grunfeld is the worst GM in the history of sports."
"Bro the Harden return for the rockets was pretty good. If you just look at the nets rockets part of the deal. Control of 7 years worth of picks. Picks that will be conveying when 3 guys are on contracts worth 150 million combined with the youngest being 36 and the oldest being 39 when the last pick conveys. That's practically 3 guaranteed lottery selections unless you think KD or Harden will be MVP calibre until 2025 where they are 37 and 36 respectively.  The Rockets also got Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert. Yes they gave up on them the levert for Oladipo was a pretty egregious deal. But for Jarrett Allen they dumped a 3 10 year deal, got a first which they used to get a first and a swap from Tucker (the first being later so when Middleton and Jrue are 32+) and the swap being from a 2nd to a first. Also the deal with cavs let them get KPJ for nothing because he fell out due to Prince and the cavs traded him to rockets because of good will from the Allen trade.   In terms of the pick haul it is pretty legendary. And it meant the rockets now have like 14 firsts over the next 7 years. Second only to the thunder."
Jarrett Allen used to walk home from games in Brooklyn!
"From my Cavs, the main notable ones are:  Jarrett Allen averaging 17 ppg on 84% shooting  Rubio and Garland both averaging 9+ assists  Markkanen with like 30/20 shooting splits"
"I hope he can get right, all non nets fans are finally realizing how good Jarrett Allen can be while a healthy Caris Levert has an even higher ceiling."
warriors problem is interior defence for the most part and can‚Äôt have draymond always play the 5 in regular season. Getting jarrett allen as a rim protecter would be useful
Christian Wood? Nah.   Jarrett Allen? Yes.
Jarrett Allen might be the most postered guy in the league he is always jumping no matter what I respect it immensely
I‚Äôm still recovering from the Jarrett Allen trade so I know how you feel
"""""It happens. I'm a defender. Just like a shot blocker, you're gonna get dunked on a few times,"" Smart said. ""     jarrett allen moment"
Jarrett Allen too. He wins a lot of em but he's been postered a lot and still contests everytime.
"Maybe it's a bias of mine since I still have his elbow to Jarrett Allen as a big playoff memory, but I agree. I know a lot of people defend him by saying he's so big that it's more of being reckless than dirty, but I mean when the recklessness is frequent..."

All of us Nets fans miss Jarrett Allen. And every single one of us want that guy to succeed.  I really hope he ends up leading the Cavs back to the playoffs. Nothing but best wishes to him.
20 mill/yr Jarrett Allen is a much better value than giving Ayton 34 mill/yr
No team should write off Cleveland. They have a young core that can get buckets and a stalwart rim defender in Jarrett Allen. Wouldn't be surprised if they make the play-in this year.
This. that's why Jarrett Allen is the true goat of the modern NBA. Lebron is a beta compared to this gigachad
‚ÄúOhhh Jarrett Allen.. that‚Äôs a man‚Äôs jammm‚Äù. I hope Cavs announcers are doing his dunks justice like Ian Eagle did
Everyone answer is wrong. Jarrett Allen and it isn't even close
"Since everyone boxed in Jarrett Allen as only a rim running center, as if that's all he does and ""can be easily replaced by any big man""   Literally was the entire thread of his contract extension."
bro jarrett allen is unreal
Kevin love just dropped his old man dick on the nuggets forehead. Also Jarrett Allen with a casual 21 and 16
" Jarrett Allen is now 31-37 (83.7%) on the season from the floor with 17 ppg. one of the best interior scorers in the league, and a great switching defender. him and mobley sharing the court can be the future."
Jarrett Allen might be a fucking star.
put jarrett allen in the HOF
"only homie I know who doesn't care about that difference is the true goat of the league, Jarrett Allen. Man gets demolished on posters but does he care? hell no"
That Jarrett Allen one is up there too
Hahaha I basically posted the same thing.  Did you know there‚Äôs no way Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen could ever play together?  Did you know Collin Sexton is a ball hog?
"Smaller market teams deal with this in everything.  Read a scouting report on Evan Mobley and you understand who the guy is, but the average nba fan just sees that he‚Äôs 7ft and Jarrett Allen is 7ft and ‚Äúhow could these guys play together?‚Äù"

Jarrett Allen missed 4 shots what a scrub
Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton getting into an on court argument made it to the top last year. 2 relative no names for casuals on the worst team in the league. You think this one that actually got physical is only a big deal because of hate?
Jarrett Allen puts Plumdog Millionaire on a Fro-ster
"He was great last year. Young players have their ups and downs. The team has to give him every shot of turning it around before giving up on him.   Jarrett Allen was so inconsistent his 3rd year. At one point, DeAndre Jordan was outplaying him (and deserved to start over him). Now, he‚Äôs a very good center"
"Small sample size my ass, Jarrett Allen is MIP!"
"Deandre Jordan. I didn't hate him particularly, but I knew from the jump that he was diminished and I was worried he was gonna make a stink about Jarrett Allen (at the time on the Nets) playing ahead of him. But even though Jordan wasn't great, he was a great professional and never complained publicly to the media or anything. Both Allen then Nic Claxton said he was great about teaching and working with them and helping them improve."
Jarrett Allen murdered Plumlee
"Not in last 10 years (a bit more) but I do think about Portland's possible lineup of KD, Giannis, Dame.  Blazers: Kevin Durant, Damian Lilliard, Giannis Antetokoumpo, (2017: one of 'em? John Collins/OG/Jarrett Allen.)"
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."
"Just going to go with cities with 4 C's for reference.

"Strangely the SexLand + Lauri + Frobley lineup had a +30 net rtg in 10 mins. Replace Sex with Okoro and it was still +1 in 7 mins. The giant lineup worked. Problem was rebounding. Jarrett Allen can‚Äôt have 1 rebound at the half as a center. Another problem was that when one of Frobley was on the bench, we couldn‚Äôt defend, like at all."

"But thats what I mean, I'm sure allen can do whatever to add to his skill set, but ....why? I'm sure he can square up a few times, but I do not see why they're not playing too his talents. You get me? Like the eye test at least tells me they're both one of the better bigs to guard the perimeter, but why have Allen defending at the three point line? Again, I'm sure they can have a passable offense and defense with the two and obviously Mobley is very versatile, but they'd be better at playing at there strengths. What it looks like to me is that because obviously Jarrett has a huge contract and they just signed Lauri, so they have to start them. So rather than having an actual three, they have to go with this BIG lineup, asking at least two of them to play a role that someone on the bench might actually do better, namely defending the perimeter"
"Really fun game.  Takeaways:  Cavs:  - Mobley is a fucking beast. First NBA game and dropping 17/9/6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense? - Jarrett Allen is a force in the paint, and with Mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future. - Cedi Osman giveth and Cedi Osman taketh.  - Darius Garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness. - We're suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation. We're either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers, there's no in between lol  Grizzlies:  - Ja Morant.  - Desmond Bane looked incredible today.  - Melton was on fire, but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter D  - Did I mention Ja Morant?  - Glad to see Ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately.  - JJJ had a rough game offensively, especially inside, but made a huge impact on D. Dude is so good.  All around fun game!"
Jarrett Allen is single-handedly keeping the Cavs in this.
"Still love me some Jarrett Allen, he's so good"
"I don't like Lauri, and I don't think Jarrett Allen is worth his contract, but he's not a bad player. It's just...the whole roster doesn't make a lick of sense."
fuck I miss Jarrett Allen üò¢
"Are you really too dense to understand why having Kyrie's contract on the books but not playing is a huge disadvantage? They could have someone like Jarrett Allen for example otherwise.  This is not some Nets fan only take, open your eyes"
"Scottie Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Montresz Harrell, Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry"
"I love him but I think he is best played as a stretch 4. We need physicality like Dwight, Miles Turner or Jarrett Allen type of Center so we have an answer vs Jokic and Giannis or smthing."
Imagine if the Nets still have Jarrett Allen  Yeah just imagine
Claxton is def not the answer at center I know they wish they could‚Äôve kept Jarrett Allen
Sexton off the bench for them and Jarrett Allen plus a pick is fire for them if they don't value Ayton. Allen is already locked into his contract and maybe you flip Sexton and the pick if you need more.
"Ayton for Jarrett Allen, Sexton and an unprotected pick."
"At a Max contract, you would kind of hope that it wouldn‚Äôt just be ‚Äúmany‚Äù teams who would benefit from him, but basically all. However, that is the thing with Centers, you can only use one at a time and sometimes not even that. Where would you rank Ayton among Center? Sixth behind Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, AD, KAT? How would you compare him the Vucevic or Valencunes? Is he better than Jarrett Allen? I‚Äôm an irrational Nets fan, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade Nic Claxton for him straight up. But that is homer glasses talking."
"7‚Äô5‚Äù Jarrett Allen, 7‚Äô10‚Äù with the hair"
"Lauri, Mobley or JA won‚Äôt have to guard 3s unless they get caught on a switch.    There‚Äôs 96 minutes of playtime between the 4/5 positions.  Lauri has only averaged more than 30mpg once in his career. Jarrett Allen has never averaged 30mpg (though did for his 51 games with the Cavs). Mobley is a rookie.     Doubtful Love gets many minutes. Ed Davis could get minutes when any of the main 3 guys are struggling.   There‚Äôs plenty of minutes to go around for their 3 young bigs &amp; Mobley‚Äôs potential versatility is what could make it work."
It's not an overpay. You see what guys like Jarrett Allen are getting.
1972 Lakers  PG: Damian Lillard (Gail Goodrich)  SG: Paul George (Jerry West)  SF: Tobias Harris (Jim McMillian)  PF: Jarrett Allen (Happy Hairston)  C: Rudy Gobert (1972 (not 1962) Wilt Chamberlain)
Loooool no he is not. That is ludicrous   Jarrett Allen has a much better chance of landing on an All-Defense team than Mobley
"Seriously, people are talking about him like he is Drummond. Last season, he shot:  * 77% from 0-3 * 52% from 3-10 * 48% from 10-16 * 32% from 16-3P (low sample size) * 20% from 3P (very low sample size)  While shooting 77% from the free throw line. If he learns how to draw fouls like most other big men, he will be a problem. His Free Throw Rate (FTr) last season (FTA/FGA) was 25%, Gobert, Embiid, and Jarrett Allen led centers (&gt;5 FGA) with more than 60%. A lot of starting centers are in the 35-45% range. Even Jokic, who notoriously can't draw fouls is at 30%. If Ayton can bump up his FTr up to 35% and his FGA go up closer to his sophomore year (14 FGA), while maintaining his career average 59% FG% and 76% FT%, he can average 20 PPG with elite defense. He can definitely be much more than the one-dimensional player that he is sometimes painted as.   IMO, he could pull at least John Collins money ($125M/5Y). Embiid/Jokic got $148M/5 on their first contracts (2018) or a 25% max, but both were more proven or at least bigger parts of their teams success. The cap has gone up though, so something like $150M/5 would probably be fair, though he may be able to get more with a good contract year. Max extension is a bit of an overpay but you keep your players happy.  [Free Throw Rate Reference](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-centers-2021-highest-free-throw-attempts-per-field-goal-attempts-with-at-least-5-field-goal-attempts-per-game)"
"I don't think it's a bad take. All-Rookie teams are mainly based off of minutes and opportunity. Mobley will be playing next to Jarrett Allen which will clog the lane, while the Sexland duo takes on most of the offensive responsibilities. I think that hurts his offensive opportunities and overall production.  Conversely, Sengun walks into a Rockets team with very few playmakers, while playing next to a stretch big in Wood. He'll get plenty of minutes and opportunities to run the offense, and I think it's just an easier overall situation to walk into and put up numbers."
"Given how Masai and Webster's best work is their excellent trade deals, I wouldn't be surprised if that's their plan and why the off-season didn't see them go after Jarrett Allen or the like."
All this talk about how tall and shit they are when the bottom line is that Ayton is just legit a better basketball player lmao have we really let the narrative shift so much that people think Jarrett Allen is better than Ayton? That's crazy
"Jarrett Allen was measured 6‚Äô9 barefoot at the combine and standing reach of 9‚Äô1.5. Aytons also a lot bigger and stronger.  Ayton actually has special athleticism for his size, it‚Äôs why he went 1st overall in a stacked draft. Allen is a good athlete, not to the level Ayton is though:   And the defensive potential is largely because Ayton is bigger, stronger, and more mobile. Not to mention Ayton has shown signs of growth at a faster rate where Allen started off as a better defender but has stagnated in recent years."
"Did... Did you just say that Ayton is no better than Jarrett Allen?  Jesus. Ayton has been getting better every year, his numbers took a step back this year to accommodate CP3. If CP3 retires today his production will increase, what are you on? He's been more effective increasing his FG% and FT% while lowering his AST to TO ratio. He was a huge part of the Suns beating the Clippers."
"Hmm I don't agree.  Ayton was assisted on 84% of his field goals during the playoffs.  For reference Jarrett Allen has been assisted on ~80% of his field goals over his career, Javale ~68%, and Capela 77%.  Ayton did take about 1 midrange fg a game and shot it well but that is really really far from someone like Embiid who straight up violates defenses.  If Embiid is a 10 and Capela is a 0 Ayton for me is about 2.5"
"He's no better than Jarrett Allen. Once CP3 retires his production will drop off, Suns are making the right move."
"Jarrett Allen DRAPTOR past 3 years(regular season): -2.8, +2.1, +1.7  Deandre Ayton DRAPTOR past 3 years(regular season): -1.7, +3.0, +1.0  Jarrett Allen DLEBRON past 3 years: 1.72, 1.94, .75  Deandre Ayton DLEBRON past 3 years: -0.23, 0.55, 0.55"
Jarrett Allen
"No he isn't, and ""potential"" is arbitrary as fuck. The guy has shown no ability to create his own shot, as far as we've seen, he's purely a guy that operates off of guys like Booker and CP3 setting him up, and Jarrett Allen has the same defensive potential."
Ayton is much better and has way more potential than Jarrett Allen.
He‚Äôs a traditional center who can barely score for himself  Jarrett Allen got 4/100 (which was a bit of an overpay on its own) and Ayton ain‚Äôt much different
"The other thing with Rob is that this year we've got a lot more post defence than we had last year.   That's important because like Jarrett Allen and Myles Turner, Rob gets bullied in the post by bigger C's.   Last year Thompson was our only passable post defender with Theis also struggling.   This year Horford's post defence will be a godsend and actually so will Kanter's (it's the one type of defence he's pretty decent at).  So we should be better suited to hiding Rob's weaknesses and highlighting his strengths."
"I agree $20 Million per year seems like a lot, but I just can‚Äôt see it being any less. Potential is expensive, and $20 Million is just about the going rate for an average starter. I‚Äôm not even basing this on his improved play at the end of the season. I‚Äôm basing it on his overall season stats.   ## Here are some comps from this off-season:   ### Jarrett Allen  Jarrett Allen just got $20 Million per year, and Miles plays a more valuable position, defends better than him, and shoots 40% from 3.   ### Lonzo Ball   Miles matches up pretty well with Lonzo, who also got  $20 Million per year. Lonzo is the better playmaker, but Miles is the more versatile defender and *much* better at finishing around the rim. Miles shot a better percentage from 3, but Lonzo shoots more 3‚Äôs per game, so that‚Äôs a bit of a wash.   ### Duncan Robinson  The deal Robinson signed this off-season averages $18 Million per year. Robinson is obviously a better shooter than Bridges, but Bridges is better at every other NBA skill, and still a good shooter. Bridges is also 4 years younger than Robinson, which is why he‚Äôd get at least $2 more per year.   ### Mikal Bridges  Mikal Bridges just signed a 4 year $90 Million dollar deal (~$22 per year). Miles put up basically the same numbers as Mikal last season. Mikal scored slightly less than a point more than Miles. He did it on a little better efficiency too, but he also has the better supporting cast. They‚Äôre both good defenders, but in my opinion, Miles flashed a little more offensive creation than Mikal. Miles is also 2 years younger than Mikal, which is worth a decent amount.   $20 Million may seem like a lot, but it‚Äôs basically the going rate. NBA fans just aren‚Äôt used to the new Cap numbers yet. What‚Äôs wild is that the cap is gonna explode even more in a few years, when the new TV deal gets negotiated. Being an NBA player is so much more lucrative than being an NFL player since there are only 5 guys on the court at a time."
"Jarrett Allen was talking about building the Cavs to a 4th/5th seed a couple years from now in the off-season, being a competitor isn‚Äôt synonymous with being a dumbass."
"&gt; And for anyone who wants to cry about that metric 9 of the last 10 MVPs led the league in it.  Ironic to pull this out in a thread about cherrypicked stats.  WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It's a box score stat, and MVP voters love box score stats.   It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.   Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in. the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
5/100 for Jarrett Allen  fine deal for Bridges who is already good and could get better
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
imagine the nets trading kyrie and being able to keep 1 of either lavert or jarrett allen last season
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Evan Mobley  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Tacko Fall
The Nets prob would've won last year if they had Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen in place of a gimpy Harden
If only they traded Kyrie for Harden instead of Jarrett Allen who would look insane with those guys.  But still trade LeVert though cause the whole trade potentially saving his life thing.
"He has Jarrett Allen to thank for some of that though. Giannis has missed his partner at the 5 in Brook for the entire season and is still dragging us to a decent defense overall, playing outside his role as well   I will agree Mobley is very very close though. Nothing wrong with that"
I check out Mitch Robinsons stats once in a while because I remember when Knick fans were adamant that he was wayyy better than Jarrett Allen haha
I apologize for my jarrett allen slander.
"I understand that but your debating from the perspective that Jarrett Allen has no case and doesn‚Äôt deserve it. He‚Äôs averaging 16-11-2 on 70% FG%. You really think Bam is having that much of a better season? As I said, you can have a serious discussion about who has had the better season, the fact that the cavs are a playoff team is unbelievable given their schedule and injuries and Allen has been our best player. I can easily see us moving up to the 5-6 spot now that our schedule is loosening up. If Allen maintains his level of play, it will be close between Bam and Allen and I think the games location may play a factor"
"Because why would the coaches takes votes away from someone who might really deserve it just to give some extra votes to Jarrett Allen because he plays where the game is being held. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense buddy. The game is about who‚Äôs been an all-star, not who plays in the host city."
"you can actually see the difference in the way we lost to the cavaliers compared to how the mavericks lost to the cavaliers  against us ricky rubio popped off with like 11 3 pointers because our guards couldn't stick on him at the perimeter  against the mavericks it was markkanen and jarrett allen brutalizing their interior defense having career nights with a layup and lob line, scoring 60 points in the paint.   to contextualize the sacramento kings currently have the worst paint defense in the league and they are giving up 50 points per game in the paint  luka's their point guard, yeah he could be playing better defense but if you need your point guard to fix your abysmal paint defense then that's a big problem"
I really think Jarrett Allen deserves a spot
Pretty sure that was the one where Jarrett Allen was like halfway down the court when they called the violation.  I initially thought they called it on Allen.
Centers suck in the all star game because no one plays defense and everyone shoots 3's.  If Jarrett Allen gets in then the team needs to make sure to close out on all shots and force guys to the basket to allow him to block shots
russ and jarrett allen are for sure getting in if they keep up their current level of play
Jarrett Allen
"Rockets also traded Cavs Jarrett Allen for essentially nothing so its not like there wasn't an amount of reciprocity, could've even been a handshake deal"
"Anybody else love seeing how much motion there is for the Cavs offense? Jarrett Allen moves around so much for a big 7 footer. He's always setting a screen or getting position for a lob or an offensive board. Or running back door. Not a lot of standing around for an ISO. Lauri is looking like an absolute steal, too. It's crazy that before the season started everybody called the Cavs front office one of the worst in basketball. Every single move is working out so far  This game was a lot of fun to watch. Sorry, Mavs fans. Hope you guys can build some deoth and acquire a real second star."

"The Nets had a terrible roster the year they made the Playoffa vs the 76ers so idk how anyone can blame Joe Harris for playing poorly against a team that was a Kawhi bounce away from the Finals.   The Nets literally had a washed up Jared Dudley as their starting PF for that series with a young skinny Jarrett Allen and old Ed Davis as ‚ÄúBigs‚Äù since they were the only 2 players 6‚Äô10‚Äù with nobody 7ft on the roster.   Once the Nets lost Dudley and Davis to injuries their depth was shot and Rodions Kurucs became the new starting PF and backup C with 6‚Äô5‚Äù Treveon Graham as the only other PF.    That roster was terrible outside of D‚ÄôLo, Dinwiddie, and LeVert for Guard Depth. Hell that was the series that Embiid/Simmons were laughing at Jarrett Allen because he was too young and skinny to defend the paint and was only able to block random shots.   Even as bad as that roster was till my death I‚Äôll always believe if Jared Dudley and Ed Davis didn‚Äôt get injured that series was headed to 6 or 7 games."
Jarrett Allen is a future MVP and if you disagree you‚Äôre a bad person.
Jarrett Allen looked like prime Shaq against whatever the hell the Mavs have at C
Jarrett Allen is an All Star and if you disagree you're a bad person.
He showed Jarrett Allen who daddy was
"Jarrett Allen good, upGarlands to the left"
Another clip to the Jarrett Allen all star propaganda pile
I love Jarrett Allen but I like seeing him get postered. Dude gets away with so many fouls.
oh right I forgot lonzo has an afro now too  so whats the all afro team  PG - lonzo  SG - immanuel quickley  SF - aaron gordon  PF - marvin bagley  C - jarrett allen  maybe there are other afros around I dont know of them though
AG is definitely making the all-afro team with jarrett allen

I don‚Äôt think any one realistically thought any of the picks until 2024-2025 really mattered but if Harden has hit a wall and is on a down turn while Kyrie sits out indefinitely then things get interesting a lot sooner.  The Oladipo part of the trade doesn‚Äôt really matter much considering it got us more losses and gave us a better chance of drafting Green and whoever we draft this year. Why do we want to give Jarrett Allen a big deal when we aren‚Äôt ready to compete while he‚Äôs on the deal? We already have that situation with Wood. LaVert doesn‚Äôt meet help us much with KPJ and Green developing at the guards spots.
Jarrett Allen is‚Ä¶ mediocre???  What even is this take lmao
"You‚Äôre right, we could‚Äôve been in a situation to overpaid to have two mediocre players in Jarrett Allen and Caris LaVert who would then ruin our obvious tanking strategy."
or you could've gotten Jarrett Allen/Caris but decided to get Victor Oladipo who you traded away for 2 dudes who aren't even on the team anymore
Jarrett Allen and Nets had already announced they couldn‚Äôt come to an agreement in the offseason wayyy before the Harden trade. He was gone regardless.
"LOL. Ayton‚Äôs volume and efficiency both substantially increased in playoff games cp3 was out or noticeably hurt, but sure go ahead and pretend that CP3 is the reason for his success. Ayton is clear of Jarrett Allen, I can‚Äôt believe anyone would argue otherwise"
Lol get outta here with that. Get Jarrett Allen on a team with the Suns spacing and fed by CP3 and he'd easily match or exceed Auton's offensive stats. Defensively Ayton has the edge but acting like their box score stats are comparable is totally ignoring the reality of their situations.
"Jarrett Allen kind of looks like Sheed, but he's a different player"
There is a reason Ayton‚Äôs career averaged against Jarrett Allen are like 24/14 lol. He‚Äôs better on both ends than Jarrett.
"The main thing people don't appreciate about Ayton is that he can operate at his efficiency even when the defense clamps down harder.  A lot of these bigs people are throwing around in this thread (Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela) are not able to find the efficient, flow of the offense production that Ayton can produce in big games/playoffs when the defense is air tight.  Guy can shoot and finish at a level (or two) above those players."
He welcomed Jarrett Allen to the NBA there. he's not supposed to do that as a 20 year old rookie.
"Just came out of Thai prison, is Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland a better duo than Shaq and Kobe?"
This is my first ever game in person and as far as I‚Äôm concerned Jarrett Allen is the best player to ever touch a basketball
I hear Jarrett Allen is ok
I like DeAndre but he was not good with the Nets last year. I missed Jarrett Allen so much
&gt; physically dominant Scottie Barnes is. He's 20 years old and he's ragdolling grown ass men in the NBA.  I will never get over what he did to Jarrett Allen. That was fucking mental.
For KD and Kyrie the Nets opened up two max slots and didn‚Äôt give up much of anything besides the chance to re-sign D‚ÄôLo to a max. For Harden the two really noteworthy players given up were Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert along with picks and depth.
"DJ must be the most likeable person on earth. Keep in mind this is the same guy that made Kenny Atkinson lose the Net locker room because he played Jarrett Allen more minutes. He's been playing like this for years and somehow has this rep among players that he's still a legit role player.   Funny enough - he drove Harden crazy when he got to the Nets.   He's still a very good rim roller and can really clean up the glass at times - but if you're playing him, you're giving up SO much. The Nets could get away with it last year because our offense was historically great. We had a huge margin for error on defense because we were scoring 125+. The Lakers obviously don't have that luxury."
"Love DJ as a person and as a hype man on the bench, but he‚Äôs just not good. For every lob highlight he had he‚Äôd give up 5x the points with his lazy defense. We‚Äôd always get off to a slow start with him in the starting lineup. It was actually beyond ridiculous that he was starting over Jarrett Allen at one point.. and then even after JA won back the starting role he still had to have reduced minutes because of DJ. I feel like DJ got the start due to his connections, and he is probably getting the start for the Lakers for the same reason"
"Ya know I wouldn't have Jarrett Allen as high as 4, but you do you I guess /s"
"And Jarrett Allen, and Giannis, and Miles Bridges, etc.  There are actually quite a few guys who contest dunks regularly"
Jarrett Allen is pretty notorious for getting dunked on and said he‚Äôd go up every time to try and block it iirc
"Jarrett Allen would play up ro, or above, his new contact."
"jarrett Allen, I used to watch him when he was on the nets and he was amazing at his role. Set amazing screens, effortlessly seemed to get offensive rebounds and all his points seemed to be from his rebounds and P&amp;R. A walking double double."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"Thought the Bulls were instant title contenders. I think they have proven that they can beat anyone on any day. Bulls offense is crazy explosive and Lonzo and Caruso have been huge additions for their backcourt.   I thought Jordan Poole would be the consensus #1 choice for MIP and 6th Man. He isn‚Äôt #1 right now for most improved or 6th man, but he has showed a ton of improvement. He could make a push for 6th man if he moves to the bench when Klay comes back.   I‚Äôm biased as a Nets fan but I really was convinced Jarrett Allen was gonna be great for the Cavs. He‚Äôs just so good defensively and a great athlete. Great rim runner. Would fit on any team in the league."
Wow. For some reason I thought Jarrett Allen was like 26. Dude could legit be an all star caliber player if he keeps getting better.
"??? Not understanding why so many people are putting Maxey up here over guys like Jaren Jackson Jr, RJ Barrett and Jarrett Allen"
"Just because he hasn‚Äôt been mentioned, I think Jarrett Allen has a chance to crack the top 10 by the end of the year‚Ä¶ dude feels like he‚Äôs gonna put up some 30/15/5 (blocks) breakout games this year."
I feel like Jarrett Allen deserves an honorable mention
Flipping Jarrett Allen over his shoulder was worth it too

We just need our sweet prince back and we'll be in solid running for at least a playin spot.  - Dean Wade somehow decided to become prime MJ this half on defense and I'm all for it  - Jarrett Allen is a star.  - Has anyone ever seen Darius Garland and God in the same room?"
2022: Jarrett Allen
Imagine not having Jarrett Allen on your team
Agreed. Still hate embiid for the elbow on Jarrett Allen. https://youtu.be/bETBdsa8Fzg
Jarrett Allen
"This just in: Super-rich owner isn't willing to lose an absolute metric fuckton of money.   Their payroll+luxury tax is already about 280 million this year per SPOTRAC. (Does Kyrie still count? Do they have to pay him half? I'm not sure exactly what the story is there.)  Jarrett Allen at 20 million, just added onto this cap, would cost them 140 million this year additional in salary+tax.  It would get worse with repeater taxes in future years."
"It's crazy to me how so many people initially viewed both Jarrett Allen and John Collins contracts as overpays not too long ago. Both fanbases feel like they scored a pretty good deal at this point in the season though, with both of them having seemingly improved aspects of their game in the off-season."
Jarrett Allen vs DeAndre Jordan who would you rather have on your team
He'll be an All Star soon. Nobody is taking Jarrett Allen before Lonzo lol.
Tell me if this is too biased but I feel that Jarrett allen should be a reserve this year
"Luka ""Got murdered by Jarrett Allen"" Garza Footspeed of a turtle. Yeah poised to be a ""sUpERsTar"""
Would you bet money right now that Jarrett Allen is on the all star team
I think he meant Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen is playing really well and leads the way for the Cavs.
allen? as in jarrett allen? i gotta see it to believe it.
"Jaylen Brown will be an All-Star, as will Gobert and Mitchell. Paul George right now is an all star starter over either laker. Draymond's not an allstar, neither is Valanciunas. Khris middleton will be an all-star. Jarrett Allen will not be an all-star.   &amp;#x200B;  Brogdon, randle KP, wiggins, are not deserving of all-star consideration."
Allen as in Jarrett Allen...? He's not getting in over Middleton or Randle lol
I hope we can get a guy in since we‚Äôre hosting it. We have a bunch of really good guys but no one‚Äôs quite elite yet. If Jarrett Allen has a really great stretch  he could sneak in
"Yeah I heard Jarrett Allen is leading the way. If the Warriors decide to go all in, I want him in my team."
"No, additional good moves like signing the highest percentage three point shooter off the end of Cleveland‚Äôs bench. Or like signing Spencer Dinwiddie, who put up 20 and 7 for us, out of the G League. Or drafting Jarrett Allen in the back of the first round who‚Äôs now on a $100 million contract. See but you purposely ignore those things because they don‚Äôt fit your narrative. Further proving that you‚Äôre arguing in bad faith.   You want to make it seem like the Bucks are some genius front office when I could easily just make the same bad faith argument that they lucked into Giannis in the draft and have been riding his coattails for the last half decade. It‚Äôs not like they knew he was going to be some superstar talent. If you had a higher pick in the draft that year you would have chose someone else.   But at this point it‚Äôs clear you just want to stay mad and discredit teams in bigger markets. You can do that, but don‚Äôt be surprised when people call it out for being bullshit"
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player)who helped him turn it around after that Lakers fiasco)and he admitted our franchise changed his life)  when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD. 5 Nets players from that Kenny Atkinson era combined are have 100+ million a year contracts now.  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn‚Äôt even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago  Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all alone‚Äù when he was with the nets  We went to back to back finals and still don‚Äôt have a big fan base, as you saw the other night with Steph curry and the warriors were in Barclays  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it. You small market teams are  becoming annoying with the big market talk, yes being in New York helps, tell me how that has worked for the Knicks or the nets prior to 2019 when both were in the dumpster or mediocre at best? With maybe one good season the past decade for the Knicks? Both laughing stocks."
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player now only after his stint in Brooklyn) when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and Caris Levert And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn‚Äôt even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago   Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all alone‚Äù when he was with the nets  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it."
"The Advantage of sexton though is he is an efficient scorer, which we don‚Äôt have many of. Garland is a beast and we have a really good team but it‚Äôs because of our team defense primarily. We‚Äôll go through some ugly stretches of offense where we can‚Äôt get anything going and we rely on sextons iso offense. Garland is great but he‚Äôs a true point guard in a sense that he prefers to pass and he doesn‚Äôt shoot as much as he should or could. There‚Äôs points where our offense looks like they score accidentally. Outside of sexton, we can‚Äôt really count on Jarrett Allen, Mobley or even markkenan atm to guarentee us some points. People call him a ball hog, but sometimes we need a guy to take over and just flat out score and we‚Äôre really gonna miss that from him. He‚Äôs also became a greatly improved defender."
"4 of the Cavs starters aren‚Äôt actually starters and were playing the second half of a b2b, coming off a game against the nets. I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into this at all. We didn‚Äôt play bench guys because everyone is injured and the bench WERE the starters. We‚Äôre missing Jarrett Allen, lauri markkanaen, sexton, and Osman. So 3/5 of our starters."
"Cavs - Jarrett Allen, and it‚Äôs not close."
"Kings: Barnes is hella athletic but doesn't dunk very often, pure hops probably Damian Jones  Suns: McGee &amp; Ayton  Mavericks: no real big-time dunkers, but DFS/Kleber can get up, KP too occasionally   Spurs: Lonnie Walker  Pacers: probably Turner/Sabonis  Cavs: Jarrett Allen  Pistons: Hamidou Diallo (2019 dunk champion)  Wizards: Hachimura got some hops, hasn't played this season though. Gafford &amp; Trez?  OKC: Bazley??"
"He wasn't part of the rotation before the deforestation, now he definitely should be in our Jarrett Allen-less lineups. Judging by the 2 game sample size, he'll fit in nicely with Lauri/Mobley or even both at the same time."
"I think the worst case barring major injury is he becomes an overpaid spot up shooter in the final year(s) of the contract. I don‚Äôt see many scenarios where he‚Äôs healthy and not productive for the team as he goes into the mid-thirties. We won‚Äôt have to pay a lot of our guys anything serious for a few years and Terry‚Äôs contract declines and expires, so it‚Äôs not like our cap situation is fucked.   Hopefully the stars align next year or the year after and we have a really dope squad. I‚Äôm hoping we trade for a semi-established young big since I don‚Äôt think there are too many in this draft apart from Mobley who will be super special. I could obviously be really wrong there, but I‚Äôd still love to trade for someone like Jarrett Allen and start really competing soon."
Jarrett Allen probably
"I know it's getting said a lot, but Jarrett  Allen is just so much better every year, and so far this season has been the biggest leap ahead yet"
The fact that Boucher and Jarrett Allen are in the top 5 should tell you everything you need to know about this stat

Jarrett Allen been a monster
Tons of cap space next year. I'd like to see them put in an offer for Jarrett Allen.
Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen and John Collins both going to have some suitors come free agency.  Im hopeing the Celtics can swing a sign and trade for one of them using that Gordon Hayward TPE
Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen are two of the most likeable players in the league

Is it coincidence the Nets play much better when Jarrett Allen starts and plays twice the minutes DeAndre does? I think not.
"I just don't think he can be our long term starting 5 once LMAs gone next year, whenever we get back to the playoffs he's gonna be even less effective on offense, they'll completely sag off him cause he can't shoot at all, he doesn't dunk much or show much aggression on offense and he's an awful FT shooter. Going after someone like Jarrett Allen in the offseason to be our starting 5 would be nice imo."
"Dude, everybody thinks they can beat up on Jarrett Allen. One of these years he‚Äôs can lose his shit. I‚Äôm amazed he hasn‚Äôt yet."
"I mean lets not pretend Kyrie doesn't bring this kinda scrutiny on himself, with his super-woke, holier than thou, im a genius artist crap. If it was Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, or anyone else on the team taking a ""mental health day"" it wouldn't even be a thing. But third-eye-kyrie must have had his chakra channels mis-aligned, or had a bad reiki session, or something"
Embiid looked really tired or not really interested in playing. This is the first time he doesn't completely punk Jarrett Allen. Don't care if it's a B2B - still good to see lol
yeah ill take jarrett allen as well!
"No one is ""supposed"" to lose but it happens. I had a feeling that we would lose but it's okay. And Nets did play very good, especially Joe Harris. Jarrett Allen also improved so much"
Jarrett Allen is making that leap and Joe Harris is dangerous
Jarrett Allen is fucking amazing. He might start to get MIP buzz
"Whenever Jarrett Allen leaves the game, the other team makes a run. Every game."
Can't help but notice Nash letting Jarrett Allen start over DeAndre Jordan the second Kyrie and KD are gone
"Jarrett Allen is Embiid, Simmons and Gobert's father."
**Jarrett Allen is the most underrated player in the NBA**
Jarrett Allen is the most underrated player in the NBA
"Okay I‚Äôve been playing a game on my computer and have been watching listening in the background, Chris Webber calls prince, demarre Carroll you have Marv Albert not able to go to a commercial break and the station has to interrupt him, marv calling Jarrett Allen Deandre Jordan when he‚Äôs not even on the floor, what‚Äôs going on at Turner?"
Did Jarrett Allen get hurt or something? Jordan has been on the court for at least 10 consecutive game minutes.
because Steve Nash is realizing Jarrett Allen is 1000000000000000x better
‚ÄúNot meshing well‚Äù is clickbait  2 of our 4 losses come from post Dinwiddie games. It‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre in the middle of adjusting. The speculation about Jarrett and Caris after a breakout game for Allen is pointless and semi offensive. Nobody knows how it‚Äôs going to play out so maybe wait until we‚Äôre 15-20 games in?   Just a bad article
Please do not forget Rudy goberts dad Jarrett allen
Austin Rivers is tonight‚Äôs ‚ÄúWho made Rudy Gobert look like a trash bum‚Äù just 1 night after Jarrett Allen took the honors
"$8m isn't too bad a solid backup big who can give you some 20mins a night, Plumlee isn't the worst signing in a vacuum. I mean he is certainly better than DeAndre Jordan who Nets fans are already clamoring to be benched in favor of Jarrett Allen  The trouble is the Pistons decided they didn't want to pay Christian Wood, who might be a fringe all-star player, just a little bit more. Essentially it makes them look as if they picked the cheaper, worse option"
Only reason I can justify it is that Jarrett Allen is a cheat code off the bench. He absolutely feasts on second string centers.
"Sincerely, Shaq shows once again he is mostly a bully and childish as fuck.  But, Gobert is that much better than any Jarrett Allen/Capela of this league. The Jazz shots themselves in a food by giving him this much money, which isn't deserve by any means."
"I mean if u don't wanna get shit talked. Don't get bodied by Jarrett allen when your making a max, that shit was embarrassing."
"Well at least they don't have copy paste protections like some other news sites. Sorry if there are any weird formatting errors, just did a quick pass on it.  NYTimes:  The ‚ÄòOld Soul‚Äô of the Nets Is Steering the Team in a New Direction  By Kelly Whiteside Nov. 25, 2018 Jarrett Allen stood outside a Key Food Supermarket in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn and handed 25 local children a grocery list and a calculator. Their task was to use math, and a calculator imprinted with Allen‚Äôs name and Nets jersey number, to fill their grocery carts and stay within the $100 budget he gave them.  Plenty of N.B.A. stars have their own shoe, clothing, underwear and eyewear lines ‚Äî often vanity projects for oversize fashionistas. Allen is different. And not just because his name is stretched across a calculator instead of kicks.  ‚ÄúMath is the future,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so different from everyone usually in the N.B.A.,‚Äù said Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, his closest friend on the team. ‚ÄúEverybody else is like, ‚ÄòWow, he‚Äôs weird.‚Äô When everyone was referencing him as weird, or just kind of different, I was like, ‚ÄòMan, that‚Äôs my guy.‚Äô He‚Äôs extremely smart. I love having conversations with him on that level.‚Äù  In the N.B.A., one man‚Äôs weird just might be another man‚Äôs love of STEM. ‚ÄúIt started with destroying stuff,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúI would break things apart, then put them together. Then my dad gave us one of his super-old computers, and I‚Äôve really been on that track since I was probably around 5.‚Äù  In high school, he built his own computer, which he still uses today. Like most 20-year-olds in the N.B.A., he loves gaming, particularly Overwatch, but he doesn‚Äôt play the ubiquitous NBA 2K. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play sports video games,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy whole life revolves around sports.‚Äù  After finishing his freshman year at Texas and declaring for the draft, N.B.A. teams had questions about his commitment. Did he love the game enough? Or did he play just because he‚Äôs tall? (He‚Äôs listed at 6-foot-11, but he‚Äôs more like 7-foot-3 with hair included.) Some N.B.A. talent evaluators would prefer their prospects have a singular interest, a life spinning on the axis of an orange ball.  Though Allen professed his love for the game during predraft interviews, he made it clear he was more than just a basketball player. The Nets saw the big picture, selected him 22nd over all in 2017, and hoped he, at center, would become the cornerstone of their rebuilding project.  Allen opened this season with back-to-back double-doubles, and added another, plus several near-misses, before sitting out two games because of an illness. In his first three games back, he averaged 17.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and nearly two blocks a game.  ‚ÄúHe has everything you want. He‚Äôs athletic, he can run the floor, space the floor vertically, shoot, finish with both hands and protect the rim,‚Äù Dinwiddie said. ‚ÄúRight now, the only thing you can knock him for is not being physically imposing, but he‚Äôs only 20 years old, and all of that is going to come with time. If that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre missing in your game, you‚Äôre doing really well.‚Äù  Allen‚Äôs father, Leonard, was a standout center for San Diego State from 1981 to 1985 and held a school blocked-shot record that was broken in 2015. The Dallas Mavericks picked Leonard Allen 50th over all in the 1985 draft, but he didn‚Äôt catch on with a team. After playing in Europe, he returned home to Texas and transitioned into a career at Dell computers.  ‚ÄúBasketball wasn‚Äôt the main focus,‚Äù Jarrett Allen said of his childhood. ‚ÄúFor my dad, he played his whole life. His life revolved around it. He just wanted us to be normal kids.‚Äù  Growing up in Round Rock, Tex., Allen was blissfully unaware of the intensity of elite youth basketball. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know about that whole crazy A.A.U. scene,‚Äù he said.  Allen and his older brother Leonard played basketball in church and community rec center leagues for fun. ‚ÄúWe were clueless about organized basketball, at least on an elite level,‚Äù said his mother, Cheryl. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even know it existed, and I‚Äôm glad we were oblivious to that world.‚Äù  Free from the demands of travel team sports, Allen pursued other interests. ‚ÄúJarrett from an early age has always had an interest and curiosity about the world around him,‚Äù Cheryl Allen said. ‚ÄúThat is why his transition to Brooklyn has been an easy one. I‚Äôd like to think that not starting elite basketball so young helped. He was able to be a kid as long as possible before becoming consumed by it, which unfortunately happens.‚Äù  At the end of Allen‚Äôs sophomore year in high school, it became clear that college basketball might be an option. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know the college scene was that big. I didn‚Äôt know the N.B.A. was that big,‚Äù he said.  On some nights after games at Barclays Center, Allen walks home, which usually takes 25 minutes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to just enjoy the night,‚Äù he said.  Nicknamed the Fro, his hairstyle isn‚Äôt some tribute to Dr. J and the A.B.A. of decades past. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to show it off, show that I can make it round,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even wearing it because it‚Äôs old school. It‚Äôs just how it is. I‚Äôm just wearing it because it‚Äôs my hair. I‚Äôve had it for five years. I‚Äôm in too deep now.‚Äù  His hair was one of many topics that came up when he did an ‚ÄúAsk Me Anything‚Äù online chat on Reddit (he considers himself a Redditor) just before the season started. He was asked questions such as: ‚ÄúWhat is the coolest celebrity experience you‚Äôve had since getting to the NBA/New York?‚Äù  Answer: ‚ÄúI got a free slice of cake for dessert at a restaurant one time.‚Äù  And: ‚ÄúHow do you achieve that amazing Afro? How much time do you spend on it a day?‚Äù Answer: ‚Äú45 seconds every morning.‚Äù Shampoo? ‚ÄúHerbal Essence.‚Äù  Allen continues to field questions from the intrigued, though most recently the askers were the children he had given calculators for a pre-Thanksgiving shopping trip and math lesson.  During the nearly two hours in the grocery store for his event, Allen shopped for his own groceries, helped the children with their calculations, grabbed the occasional box of penne off the top shelf for customers and answered no-filter questions.  ‚ÄúCan you cross Allen Iverson?‚Äù an 8-year-old boy asked.  ‚ÄúGiven he‚Äôs about 50 years old, yes,‚Äù Allen said.  ‚ÄúCan you dunk on LeBron?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never tried,‚Äù he said.  After locating some hard-to-find items ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the crescent rolls?‚Äù ‚Äî Allen checked out $40 under budget.  The feat seems to be more reflective of a lifestyle than one good day at the grocery store.  ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have a car,‚Äù Nets forward Jared Dudley said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt care about materialistic things. He cares about playing basketball, family and doing what he loves to do.‚Äù  However varied that may be.  So far, Allen has splurged on just one big purchase. ‚ÄúA part for my computer,‚Äù he said."

Rim protectors that can‚Äôt guard all 5 positions are not worth 200 million. And if Gobert can‚Äôt lock down Jarrett Allen then he‚Äôs hardly even a good rim protector. He was always overrated as hell as a defender and can‚Äôt even defend elite centers. Jokic literally cooked him in the playoffs last year Gobert is worth 20 million a year at best. I am sorry that your team ruined their future by signing this man to that contract but you‚Äôre 100% in denial of these facts

"Jarrett Allen was a force today. Not a fan of the Rudy takes though, the guy gets postered frequently because he actually tries to block it- most other players make the ‚Äòbusiness decision‚Äô to get out of the way :/"
Jarrett Allen outplayed Gobert tonight on a fraction of Gobert's pay
And Jarrett Allen routinely gets worked by bigs with offensive skill. Luckily today he just had ‚ÄòShaq but on defense‚Äô to deal with.
"&gt; Jarrett Allen stood outside a Key Food Supermarket in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn and handed 25 local children a grocery list and a calculator. Their task was to use math, and a calculator imprinted with Allen‚Äôs name and Nets jersey number, to fill their grocery carts and stay within the $100 budget he gave them. &gt;  &gt; Plenty of N.B.A. stars have their own shoe, clothing, underwear and eyewear lines ‚Äî often vanity projects for oversize fashionistas.

Petition to start Jarrett Allen over Deandre Jordan
Mitchell Robinson about to pull a Jarrett Allen tommorow
File this game for evidence on why Jarrett Allen should start over Deandre Jordan
"Stop starting DaAndre Jordan just because he's friends with KD and Kyrie, Jarrett Allen is MUCH more impactful"
Jarrett Allen is both good and has a sick haircut I'm honestly surprised he's not more well known
Jarrett Allen was absolutely insane this game.
Jarrett Allen about to secure his bag it's time
Jarrett Allen with 19/18 + 3 steals and 2 blocks on 8/9 shooting   Kyrie with 29/6/5 + 3 steals on 12/19 shooting   Caris LeVert with 24/5 + 2 steals on 9-18 shooting in 21 minutes   this game was a wet dream
"Jarrett Allen is v good. They should be wasting very little minutes in DAJ, who is washed. It‚Äôs what they did tonight and that was wise."
someones gonna pay jarrett allen 205m
how the fuck are we gonna pay jarrett allen lmao
Theres really no reason to start DeAndre Jordan above Jarrett Allen going forward
Jarrett Allen is his father
One of the most embarassing performances in the history of the NBA. The man got straight up bullied by Jarrett Allen.
Jarrett Allen one ugly motherfucker without a headband
"i think the only reason he plays so much alongside KD and Kyrie is because he nets better screens than Jarrett Allen, and the starting 5 uses him to set a screen on almost every possession. that‚Äôs the only positive thing i‚Äôve noticed DJ do better than Allen."
"Exactly, he's going to say something like ""Jarrett Allen dropped ______ on him, and he only made his first season start this game. I'd drop 55 and 25 on either of them, im a G"""
Jarrett Allen =)
"Nah Shaq gonna be like if Jarrett Allen did this, never mind what I said. I‚Äôm scoring 50"
Knowing Shaq he's probably going to hate on Jarrett Allen too with backhanded compliments for this game against Rudy
Jarrett Allen is the most underrated player in the NBA
I have never wanted the Nets to keep a player as much as I want them to keep Jarrett Allen. GIVE THIS MAN WHATEVER HE WANTS
Is Jarrett Allen the greatest center to play the game?
Sooooooo surely Jarrett Allen becomes the full time starter?
holy fuck i feel like a proud father watching Jarrett Allen right now
Jarrett Allen saw that contract and wanted to get him some.
yea after this game we better not see deandre jordan starting over Jarrett allen anymore lmao
"Jarrett Allen is coming off the bench to average more minutes than DJ, honestly if it weren't for KD &amp; Kyrie wanting him there DeAndre shouldn't even be on that roster especially with the salary he is being paid"
"we gotta get jarrett allen and marvin bagley III on the same team together, that afro power will be immense"
"The positives:    Bruce Brown finally getting minutes   Jarrett Allen starting over DJ    The Negatives:    Joe Harris coming off the bench? No idea why Prince would start over him when he is worse at literally every facet of basketball   Regardless, i‚Äôm intrigued to see how it works"
Jarrett Allen is not fuckin round 1 bit üí™
Yeah I'd absolutely take him but considering how bad our defense and rebounding has been idk how we'd survive without Jarrett allen
"In no order: Embiid, Jokic, Bam, Rudy, KAT, Zinger, Nurk, Vuc, Ayton, Brook. Dont think you can question any of those.  He may be in the next teir though - the position is much more shallow than I realized. Bryant, Turner, Jarrett Allen, Jordan, Adams, Drummond, Horford, TT, Robinson. I could make a case for any of those guys being better than Miles, or him being better than any of them. So the 10-20 range seems fair. But like - centers suck beyond the top 9/10"
not sure if they qualify as a duo but 2018-19 D-Lo and Jarrett Allen. or Dinwiddie. the whole damn team actually.
"Thats so weird y'all have Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Jordan, and Kevin Durant. How is post defense and rebounding the issue? I havent been able to see many of yalls games but I feel like those three by themselves have a solid history and reputation of good rim protection and rebounding. Have they regressed in those categories? Or low effort? Either way yall can still pull it together. You have Kyrie and KD that alone will get you in the playoffs. What you do from there is up to them."
(pre-injury) Jonathan Isaac   Tyrese Haliburton   Lamelo Ball   Ja Morant   Dame   Draymond   Coby White   Aleksej Poku≈°evski    Zion   Anthony Edwards   Jarrett Allen   Seth Curry
"I'm super high on Jarrett Allen, have been for a while. I can't believe the Cavs flipped the *Bucks pick* for him AFTER GIANNIS RE-SIGNED.  Houston fleecing the Nets FOR them, apparently, just insisting on that one extra FRP."
"I still don't understand it lol  Jarrett Allen + Prince for Dante Exum, Milwaukee pick &amp; a second round."
"did we really just call Jarrett Allen, JA? Not to mention a way more prominent players name is literally Ja"
Jarrett Allen has always been really good BUT he feasted more on this team because they couldn't defend for shit.
"With health and luck, they could push for the playoffs, if they wanted to. I think there might be some decisions coming that put it off a year.  I guess if the right deal came about though, maybe they do push. Maybe, Altman finds another Jarrett Allen budget move for like Collins, Lonzo, or another borderline good young starting caliber player. Maybe even a tier or two above that."
"You can actually (kinda) connect this trade as being a continuation of the Kyrie trade. It's not a perfect match but...  Kyrie was traded for IT, Jae Crowder, BKN's pick, etc.  Crowder + Shumpert + D-Rose (free agent pickup) were traded for George Hill &amp; Hood  George Hill was traded to Milwaukee for their first-round pick  Milwaukee's first-round pick was traded for Jarrett Allen &amp; Taurean Prince."
Oladipo is nice. Question is why didn't you guys keep Jarrett Allen for yourself ...
Maybe don‚Äôt trade away players like Jarrett Allen?
Jarrett Allen key to a powerhouse offense confirmed
JARRETT ALLEN LOOKS LIKE THAT ONE BLACK KID WHO WAS REALLY INTO NARUTO AND I‚ÄôM ALL FOR IT
That‚Äôs a big W. the cavaliers have done the same with getting Jarrett Allen it seems
Jarrett Allen? The Nets?  Don't see it.
My name is Jarrett Allen and I‚Äôm the best basketball player alive.
He got benched the other night for Jarrett Allen... not too far off.
"I think Kyrie would have been a better trade piece than the 8 1st round picks/swaps+jarrett allen that they had to give up. Harden is a better scorer and facilitator and defender than Kyrie, so just add a competent big man like Allen and you're basically all set for a strong playoff run."
That Jarrett Allen acquisition really cemented them as a finals contender.
Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton will torment the Nets for years to come on the Cavs
"And for the second game in a row, the combo of Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen substantially outscored James Harden.  Wait, Harden started at power forward what the fuck?"
If they find a way to trade for Jarrett Allen back I‚Äôd fall off my bed laughing
I understand that the Rockets didn‚Äôt really need Jarrett Allen because Christian Wood is so good for them. But they definitely could‚Äôve gotten more for him than Exum+ 2022 Bucks pick. Not much of a return for a very good young center.
&gt;Jarrett Allen and Mitchell Robinson*  FTFY
Bro teams with starting centers need to stop with this. Poor Jarrett Allen is a Center in a small ball league and still can‚Äôt get a starting spot. It was a dam travesty Jordan started over him
Cavs really got Jarrett Allen for a late first and Andre Drummond for a second. Cavs front office is playing chess while some of these guys are playing checkers.
Jarrett allen also Lowkey looks like a sweetheart. He looks so happy to be in Cleveland as well. Take good care of him please!
They reallllly need some depth. This bench unit will not get the Nets far. The ironic part about it all is that Jarrett allen would have been the perfect center for this team.
Not even joking.  the kind of player they need is... jarrett allen
They need someone like Jarrett Allen in the middle
"*Jarrett Allen looks at Joe Harris*  ""Y'all smell that? Smells like bbq chicken"""
Funny thing Harden was guarding Jarrett Allen.
"When Jarrett Allen said: *""I would do it. I'm not going to lie.""*   He wasn't talking about Harden getting traded, but about his trade to the Cavs."
Good they traded away Jarrett Allen huh
They need a center like jarrett allen to protect the paint
Jarrett Allen would be nice
Watching Drummond do post moves hurt my eyes. Watching Jarrett Allen destroy the nets hurt my heart
"And adding Jarrett Allen was a huge upgrade. I know he‚Äôs seen as just one of the pieces in the trade, but the nets are going to desperately wish they had kept the one guy who would make their team work 1000x better."
Jarrett Allen is a beast.
jarrett allen and collin sexton destroying betters' entire life savings in two games
I would literally rather have Jarrett Allen on the Nets than Kyrie
HOW DID WE GET JARRETT ALLEN LMAO
"Jarrett ""Questlove"" Allen"
I‚Äôm never gonna get over giving up Jarrett Allen.. he‚Äôs cooking us rn
Jarrett Allen with 19 pts off the bench!
We should trade Harden for some defensive pieces..is Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince available?
Jarrett Allen goated
jarrett allen is adorable
Is Jarrett Allen available?

"when the U.N pass resolution to ban Nuclear Weapons world wide, the totally looked over Jarrett Allen"
Yo angel just shut down the Jarrett Allen interview lol
"They need a solid centre, deandre jordan athleticism went down these few years and the nets need to replace what jarrett allen offered for the nets."
cavs solidify their playoff push this year by stealing jarrett allen. 48 mins of quality center minutes is rare in the nba
Jarrett Allen is so good
I'm in love with Jarrett Allen
Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen are exactly the kind of players the Nets could really use right now.
Cavs give us back Jarrett Allen and the nets will give you 2.5 Reese‚Äôs peanut butter cups? Deal?   *spits in hand and offers to shake*
"Bruh the Nets defense is absolute dogshit. Bucks put up 130 too. It‚Äôs not a one game sample, this is going to be the rest of the year. They don‚Äôt have anyone to defend left. Jarrett Allen was their best defender by a wide margin. They‚Äôre just going to have to outscore teams... which they absolutely can do."
He can block the shit out of the ball and finish lobs. like a super discount Jarrett Allen basically. or homeless mans Mitchell Robinson
"Bruh the sixers got beat down by the Caris Levert, Tauren Prince and Jarrett Allen led nets you guys aren't realistically beating the Nets."
"They had a wink wink on the Jarrett Allen deal lol.  Tilman and Gilbert on some sus shit, who'd have thought?"
He probly won't but Kings should've traded him for at least a future 2nd round pick. Guys they could've drafted besides Giles:  Terrence Ferguson Jarrett Allen OG Anunoby Kuzma Derrick White Josh Hart Thomas Bryant Dillon Brooks
"Jarrett Allen (C, CLE): 12 pts, 11 reb, 4 blocks and a steal.  I'm glad my Sixers didn't overpay."
"thank you. I don‚Äôt get the loss of depth argument. Harden &gt; LeVert, and Prince is only decent every like 4 games.   Losing Jarrett Allen was a huge loss for us though, and we‚Äôre getting destroyed in the paint because we have to rely on DeAndre Jordan who shouldn‚Äôt be playing big minutes, and a rookie who was selected 56th lol"
"Apprantly trading an incosistant Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen for one of the best scorers of all time makes us worse and losing in double overtime when a random player on the cavs goes for 45 points is called getting ""destroyed"". You sixers fans are delusional if you even think you're getting close to the finals when your second best player can't make a jumpshot, and your 3rd best player is Tobias Harris. You aren't getting past Milwaukee or Brooklyn. Deal with it second round exits."
"They are really going to miss Jarrett Allen, actually"
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
"Look at all the mentors Jarrett Allen has had so far in the league. He now has learned under Ed Davis, DeAndre Jordan, Amare Stoudemire, and now Javale McGee and Drummond. Allen is going to be a top Center for the next decade. He is amazing."
The Jarrett Allen revenge game
Yes with great defensive players like Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen all things are possible
"Lakers big 2 can match the scoring of any duo in the playoffs and has the best defense of any duo, by far. In addition to that the Lakers bench is crazy deep with shooters and playmakers and  good defenders. I don't think the Nets big 3 would have fun playing 45 mpg in a 7 game series against the Lakers. We legitimately have 11-12 players who will see playoff time - AD, Bron, KCP, Schroder, Gasol, Caruso, THT, Matthews, Kuzma, Markieff, Harrell.  Nets have Harden, Durant, Kyrie, Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Shamet, Green.   I have no why idea why they went after Harden when they had Kyrie. Harden is just better in almost every way, now they have more iso and lost Jarrett Allen, who's hella good. This was literally a game where the bit 3 went off and they still lost lol."
"James Harden is a good defender.   Kyrie Irving, Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet are terrible defenders though. Landry Shamet wasn‚Äôt part of the rotation today and I hope Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry aren‚Äôt part of the rotation soon.   Jarrett Allen was a big loss, but the Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"Before Sexton went nuclear, I thought the Cavs had better ball movement than the Nets too. Like that sequence leading up to Nance Jr's 3 pointer.  Also, rare Jarrett Allen mid range J sighting.  This may age poorly, but watching this game, I'm really feeling the lack of size on the Brooklyn roster is going to hurt them."
Issac Okoro is already proving his worth as our shock number 5 pick. His defense has kind of proved absolutely essential for the change in culture we were looking for and now paired with a similarly defensive minded and enthusiastic Jarrett Allen I can confidently say things are looking sunny here in the gray skies of Cleveland Ohio
Yeah I was mad when we traded him but we weren‚Äôt going to get anything better for him and his contract was expiring. And we traded Exum for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince so I guess it worked out ok.
Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince on the revenge tour
Getting Jarrett Allen for almost nothing to add to their young core was a fucking steal
"Derrick Rose, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert,"
Jarrett Allen revenge game
"As much as I love Jarrett Allen, yeah, it's a joke."
Largely because Jarrett Allen played 31.
Got Jarrett Allen for a bag of potato chips.
"Clint Capela, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic  How would you rank those players"
"I agree 100%, I‚Äôll take harden but Jarrett Allen and Prince are real players. Cavs team looks totally different than the past couple games where they were trying to live through Drummond. That guy should be done playing IMO"
"* James Harden: 6-14 shooting, 3-6 from 3, 21 points, 10 rebounds, no blocks, 2 steals, 5 turnovers, 5 fouls, -3 * Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince: 11-19 shooting, 3-5 from 3, 27 points, 18 rebounds, 5 blocks, 2 steals, 4 turnovers, 1 foul, +26  Welp, Nets clearly lost that trade."
Jarrett Allen is...the Love Prince of SexLand
The Nets only have one center. They traded their other one *to Cleveland.* Jarrett Allen was on the other bench tonight.
Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen lol
"This is the first Cavs game I have watched all season and wow, I'm speechless. This team has an absurdly bright future with Sexton, Okoro, Jarrett Allen, Larry Nance and Cedi. And Garland wasn't even playing today! I can't wait. to see this young group develop.  Some of the nets offense was insufferable to watch, particularly the Kyrie contested, off-balance pull-ups. Like cmon man, I know you can make those shots, but surely you can find something better with KD and Harden on the court!"
Jarrett Allen revenge game üí™
I'm glad its against Jarrett Allen and Prince. Cavs deserved this win!
"Jarrett ""Anti-KD"" Allen"
Jarrett Allen took the ~~hardest~~ Sexiest road.
Getting Jarrett Allen (and Taurean Prince) for Dante Exum and a Bucks 1st was absolute fucking robbery by the Cavs.
As a Nets fan at least Jarrett Allen got the dub
Turns out Jarrett Allen joined the superteam
Nets can really use someone like Jarrett Allen
Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen getting payback already lol
"&gt;‚ÄúIn all honesty, I would say I would do it, I‚Äôm not going to lie,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúIf you look at what happened with the Lakers, they did the same thing. They went and got their ring. If I take myself out of it, I would‚Äôve loved to stay in Brooklyn, but I understand that in an opportunity like that, you have to go do it.‚Äù  Guys, Jarrett was actually talking about his opportunity to win a ring with the Cavs here"
please stop posting up Jarrett Allen...
Imagine if the nets kept Jarrett allen
"My friends used to send me videos of Jarrett Allen getting dunked on all the time. But I'm like ""at least he's fucking trying!""  Love you JA üò¢"
Jarrett Allen is a center everybody wants on their team. Seems like he has a great attitude and no fear. Andrew Luck type of mfer
"Yep, so many of the best shot blockers in the league have gotten put on a poster every now and then. Ibaka, Jarrett Allen, Giannis, all them get dunked on occasionally but that‚Äôs gonna happen if you‚Äôre playing defense"
"Agreed on this. Jarrett Allen is a popular target for this, but it's also exactly why I like him. Personally I'd prefer my rim-protecting big not back down from anyone, thanks."
"Yes, we definitely needed a Center but we also coulda either just kept Jrue and brought Favors back (The team actually played really well last year once Zion and Favors were both healthy and in the lineup) or they coulda traded Jrue for a package either involving Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen who both would fit the timetable and the team better than what they got"
Jarrett Allen is perfect for Cavs because he's perfect player for their timeline and he's underrated centre.
"Nah Jarrett Allen is trash, so trash we will do the Cavs a favor and take him back for a 2nd rounder"
"Seems like stone wants expirings for the cap space. Not surprising.   Jarrett Allen would be great for us, but Wood is a better player. How would the minutes even work? Wood isn‚Äôt playing the 4 I‚Äôll tell you now.  Glad you aren‚Äôt the GM."
"It was a large deal. Collins, OG, Jarrett Allen and Kemba Walker for Murray, JV, Conley, and Plumlee. So far, I‚Äôve gotten the better end of the deal haha."
The Jarrett Allen Era has begun in Cleveland
"Zach Lowe put it well:  ‚ÄúLeBron is not a dirty player, but he made a dirty play.‚Äù  Joel makes dirty plays sometimes too, ask the Nets in 2018-19 when he almost hospitalized Jarrett Allen like twice. You gotta tell it how it is."
"Did Jarrett Allen just tell us all he‚Äôs an alien? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge space guy‚Äù sounds like he‚Äôs a really tall alien, idk."
Jarrett Allen is a *really* smart guy.
is there anyone who doesnt love jarrett allen
Kid is a high key nerd and low key genius... love Jarrett Allen
"hate that call, reminds me of the Embiid Jarrett Allen one from a few playoffs ago"
Jarrett Allen is the best and I miss him every day. üò≠
I fucking love Jarrett Allen
"dear jarrett allen  you claim to be a space guy, but provide no space  curious ü§î"
"Thank NBA for giving us a surprise game against the Nuggets right now, I really wanted that, really.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-19) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (15-13) ---|---   D.

"Dammit, I think I just became a Jarrett Allen stan"
"Wtf, I'm a Jarrett Allen fan now"
"Really?  I saw Jarrett Allen at a grocery store in Cleveland yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"When I first heard Jarrett Allen speak in a post game interview, my first thought was, ""oh this guy fucks"""
"Jarrett Allen invented the Jarrett Allen AI though, so it's really just an extension of himself"
"I haven‚Äôt checked in on Jarrett Allen in a bit. Does he still have the beautiful, huge hair?"
"PepeHands the illusion is ruined. Net you're gunna tell me that Jarrett Allen wasn't even real, it was just a complex AI pretending to be him"
I am un apologetic Jarrett Allen stan because of his fro. Glad to hear he is also cool in other ways.
"Plus 4 pick swaps, plus Jarrett Allen (great young center) and Levert. Don‚Äôt be shocked. I think the Bucks gifting 1st round picks every chance they get has made you underestimate their worth."
Jarrett Allen is the Space Core from Portal : https://youtu.be/HFgeustBpFk
I never looked at Jarrett Allen the same way ever since I saw a comment saying he looks like that one black kid who was really into Naruto üòÇ
jarrett allen is just a young neil degrasse tyson and this only further proves it.
"Not really related but Jarrett Allen posted an Instagram story of him making a mechanical keyboard and I messaged him asking for tips to get into it and he wrote me a great and helpful response.   He‚Äôs one of the most unique nba players I can remember and in all the right ways. I don‚Äôt care what the situation is, I‚Äôll never root against him no matter what team he‚Äôs on."
Jarrett Allen and Grant Williams would be best friends
"So let me ask you a pretty straightforward question. If the Nets have had an offensive rating of 120 with the big 3 playing, an offensive rating of 121 with only 2 of them playing, and an offensive rating of 121 when only ONE of them plays, how confident are you that it makes sense to keep Kyrie? Presumably the reasoning for keeping all 3 is the expectation that the offense would be even more potent with all 3, and quite a bit more to offset the depth and Jarrett Allen."
Jarrett Allen.
So you really want to pair up both of the Jay's with Sexland and Jarrett Allen? And Larry Nance Jr off the bench
"They didn't have Harden yet, and Jarrett Allen always has good games against us.  I'd say it's tough to take anything away from that game."
He got hit by Jarrett Allen on a screen.
"They played in what, week 1/2? Neither team is the same now.  Jarrett Allen was the best player in that game and isn't even on the Nets roster anymore."
The Jarrett Allen Era has begun in Cleveland
Watch this be the first Nets Twitter contest that Jarrett Allen wins
This makes no sense. If we didn‚Äôt trade for harden we‚Äôd still have more depth and defense with Jarrett Allen. We were one of the favorites to come out of the east coming into this season with just KD/Kyrie plus depth
"&gt; I don't see Jarrett Allen getting a max.  Too many teams have max room, and there aren't enough FAs to take that space.   He's going to get the 25% max.  Cleveland won't let him walk over a few million a year after giving up something to get him, so somebody will sign him to the poison pilled offer sheet just to fuck 'em."
"I don't see Jarrett Allen getting a max. He's a good young center, but not elite enough to commande that type of contract in my opinion.  The fact they won't have money to spend in FA is not a big deal either since no marquee free agent is going to choose Cleveland.   Also, whether or not Sexton is good enough to be a #1 guy on a contender is irrelevant for them, as a small market team they have to lock up their talented young guys.  I think there is definite value in a core of Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Allen, plus whoever they get in the draft this year. Yeah it probably won't get them a chip, but the fact is unless they hit on another generational talent in the draft, they are highly unlikely to win another one anyway. May as well build the most competitive team possible and give your fans something fun to watch."
"&gt; Cavs are still building  Whether they're building anything of value, it's hard to say.   They're going to have zero cap space this offseason once they pay Jarrett Allen the max (and though his cap hold isn't super high, they've still got quite a bit on the books once you include it and the rookies) Then the next year, they're going to have to pay Sexton something close to the max, probably (and his hold is 19m). Then Love comes off the books just in time to pay Garland.   So, there's no real path to major FA moves, and I'm not convinced that they have a good coach...and none of their young guys like capable of being the #1 guy on a title contender.   So, honestly, bad long-term money for Drummond might be a good path forward for them"
"People act like if someone has a good game against you, it means you‚Äôre overrated/overpaid. Jarrett Allen went beast. Not much anyone could do. Same with Jokic. Guys like Jarrett Allen don‚Äôt get games like that against Rudy, and guys like Jokic get huge games against everybody lol"
"Let alone last year, earlier this season, when Jarrett Allen had a great game against gobert and jazz, many here saying jazz is screwed when they give Gobert that big contract."
Jarrett Allen and Kyrie torched us without KD. No guaranteed wins in the NBA
Why didn‚Äôt the Rockets get Jarrett Allen in return? Was it money or something?
"How about when he said he wanted to re-sign with the Celtics, and then like 3 months later backtracked mid-season  Or when he came back after not playing for two months, lost, said they were missing too many pieces after the game, and specifically named the guys he saw as part of the future (and left a bunch of guys like Jarrett Allen out) on the Nets mid-season  Or when a kid in Cleveland asked him if he was going to leave like LeBron lol"
"Jazz openened the season 4-4, hadn't really figured it out yet. Wasn't the same Nets team either Durant was out and it was pre-Harden trade. Jarrett Allen was probably the Nets best player in that game and he isn't even on their roster anymore."
Jarrett Allen has one of the best and most wholesome personalities in the NBA. I just wanna see the guy succeed

Also It's not like this is blindsiding Andre. I'm sure he's well aware his time in Cleveland was always going to be short...especially with Jarrett Allen coming in.
"That could be good. You've got Sexton and Allen (I'm very high on Jarrett Allen), maybe if you get a good wing?"
"So when is it ok for teams to trade Boogie or Barnes? Are they not allowed to trade them because players deserve better?   Are the Cavs not allowed to do Drummond a favor and get him tf out of Cleveland so he can go ring chase with the Nets? The guy doesn‚Äôt even want to be there, he‚Äôs been pouting and playing like shit since they got Jarrett Allen."
"Jarrett Allen has the highest TS% in basketball, and is therefore better than Nikola jokic."
Jarrett Allen
Free my boy Jarrett Allen!
"Garland 15+ points, Draymond 8+ assists, and Jarrett Allen 12+ rebounds"
"Jarrett Allen playing drop defence against Steph Curry, that'll end well."
Jarrett Allen: 70.8%  Lebron James: 59.7%  That's a massive difference and the reason why Allen is a better offensive player than Lebron
"Jarrett Allen soaring through the air, blocking that shot with dope hair.  Perfect."
Someone needs to upload Jarrett Allen getting ready to rip Sexton‚Äôs head off
Jarrett Allen looked like he got fouled at the end right there
Jarrett Allen was available for Milwaukee‚Äôs 1rd. Centers are cheap.
"When are our games back to a time that's not so late? It's been rough here for me. :(  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-18) | [](/GSW)Warriors (14-13) ---|---   D.

Nance (OUT) :( |   A. Drummond  (OUT) |  T. Prince   (OUT) |  D. Windler  (OUT) |"
"This is just a very one-dimensional way to look at it. Playing on a bad team doesn't make you a worse player, and efficiency alone doesn't make you a good player.  You know who is number one in TS% this year? Jarrett Allen. Clearly he is the best offensive force in the NBA right now...er, I guess he was the best scorer when he was playing for the Nets. Now that he's playing for the non-contender Cavs, his skills have clearly been diminished."
"And DJ Augustin, Myles Turner, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, and Tristan Thompson."
"$4 Ben   $3 Seth  $5 Claw  $1 Aaron   $2 Jarrett  Looks solid. Nice scoring on all levels. Good defense, Ben and Claw with Allen would be gnarly. Aaron would have to shoot well from the perimeter to make this work. Seth is a bucket, give me this squad."
"I‚Äôm pretty much in the same boat as you, to be honest. It‚Äôs just one of those things where we could go a few routes depending on which domino we can get to fall first. Lauri is one of those dudes who feels like if we sign him to a long term deal he‚Äôs gonna be inconsistent and injury prone and if we trade him or let him walk he‚Äôs gonna turn into a perennial all star somehow and we‚Äôd still feel fucked haha. But honestly I would love for us to land Collins and also wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to waiting till the off-season to go after lonzo if they‚Äôre demanding a pick for him in any trade. It‚Äôs also super hard to really say Lonzo is the one to go after since we don‚Äôt really have any insight as to who may be available from other teams that we don‚Äôt realize can be traded for. I also wonder about what we could offer Jarrett Allen in RFA"
"Because people don‚Äôt realize how crazy good Adams is, his numbers don‚Äôt reflect how good he is at all. Pretty sure his team‚Äôs offensive rebounding percentage is crazy higher with him on the court than off the court for his career. And people don‚Äôt understand how smart he is, Adams makes all the stuff he does look easy but only a couple guys in the league can do what he does.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still a good player playing his style and got $40/2 year extension last offseason. Him, Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Clint Capela, and Rudy Gobert are the only starting centers in the league who still play that way, and Jordan probably shouldn‚Äôt even be a starter anymore (maybe Jarrett Allen should take his spot in this list though). It‚Äôs REALLY hard to play center in the league without a three point shot now."
"I agree with you that centers need passing or shooting ability in today's league, but does Jarrett Allen have either?"
Koby Altman getting Jarrett Allen for free was pretty neat
Being ass for 10 years has done more to hurt his free agency prospects than acquiring Jarrett Allen
"Then let Poeltl play and not pay Drummond more for the year since he‚Äôs also a FA next year. There‚Äôs no universe in which it makes sense to pay a player more despite the probability of having them leave and hindering the development and decreasing the playing time of your already young center.   The trade does not makes sense if the team will lose money, not let their current young center get playing time, and potentially further hinder and already bad offense. It‚Äôs a bad trade for the Spurs and saying LMA is broken and needs to leave isn‚Äôt a good enough reason. Cavaliers are even prioritizing Jarrett Allen and not letting Drummond play anymore.  Edit: check out my latest post on r/NBASpurs if you want more convincing"
Yeah id rather have Jarrett Allen. Doesnt put up the numbers but makes your team better by knowing his role and being an actual rim protector.
he has Dwight Howard-itis where he wants to do so much more than what he's actually good at. the problem is he's nowhere near the unstoppable finisher Dwight was not is he even on the same planet when it comes to defense.   its not what you want. he wants to play like he's Giannis/Jokic when the team he's already on traded a first round pick to replace him with Jarrett Allen.
"My Jarrett Allen cavs jersey came last week, just in time"
What if we get Jarrett Allen as well?
Cavs are the real winners of that trade. Getting Jarrett Allen for a late first and dumping Exum
Dropped Jarrett Allen and have Andre Drummond. Stand up!
"As a Jarrett Allen fantasy owner, I am thrilled"
"This is my time to shine. In six to eight years of watching most of his games, here's a rudimentary outlook.  **Pros**  * Clears the defensive glass (though often in an empty, contested paint). Clears boards regardless.   * Can finish with dunk on pick &amp; roll when lob is delivered above the rim.  * Sticks with his own misses, often tipping own shot three to four times in one single possession.   **Cons**  * Arguably the worst post game in modern history among all-star centers who still feel obligated to get touches (Ben Wallace couldn't post-up either but at least knew what he was and wasn't).   * One of his go-to moves in half-court offense is a running 13-foot floater.   * Shoots 59 percent from the free throw line, which is somehow a 20 percent improvement over what he used to shoot. Has been hovering in 59 percent range for four seasons.   * Has attempted 92 3-pointers over the past four seasons. That's 92 attempts too many for someone shooting 10.9 percent from three.   * Offensive rebounds often inflated on account of re-tipping his own point blank misses inside that should have been finished in the first place.  * Shooting just 47.4 percent from the field despite being built in the mold of a Clint Capela or DeAndre Jordan. In contrast, teammate Jarrett Allen is currently shooting 64.6 percent.   * Has a .500 total shooting percentage... for a guy who generally should never be shooting outside of three feet. Again, for comparison, teammate Jarrett Allen currently has a 69.5 percent total shooting percentage.  * Sometimes tries defensively, sometimes not.   * Subject to ill-timed fouls.  * Will openly mope when things aren't going his way, at times manifesting itself in lingering in the backcourt while an opposing team breaks out in the open floor for a back-breaking 3-pointers during an 5-on-4 advantage in transition leading to a time-out."
Jarrett Allen fantasy owners the world over rejoice!
"I was interested in taking a shot on him, but I no longer would like him. He's turned me off with how he's been since Jarrett Allen was acquired by Cleveland."

Would the Cavs give Jarrett Allen up?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  No.
What about inquiring for Jarrett Allen? They don't need offense as much as defense.
Would Jarrett Allen be a good fit?
jarrett allen might be the cavs best player so i just want to say thank you
"Drummond. He had a string of monsterous games but he's been mostly mediocre for his standard, especially after the arrival of Jarrett Allen. He's slowly getting worst, quietly."
we would have found out if we managed to keep jarrett allen
"Yeah that‚Äôs kinda my point, they had a lot better of a supporting cast for a lot of these wins. The Utah game for example had Jarrett Allen dropping 19 pts and 18 rebounds on 8-9 shooting while holding Gobert to 10 points on 3-10 shooting and Lavert with 24 pts and 5 assists. Same with the 76ers win: Allen had 15 and 11 and was +16 while holding Embiid to 20 points, Lavert had 22/10/7 with a +23 and even Prince had 13 pints that game. You‚Äôre talking about wins where over half of the teams points, 2/3 of the rebounds, and most of the defense came from players who are no longer on the roster.     Winning without KD and Kyrie only happened because of the performances of the players who aren‚Äôt even with the team anymore. The Nets pre-harden trade beat the 76ers by double digits without Kyrie or KD playing, the Nets post-harden trade and without Kyrie and KD lost to the 76ers by 16 with Harden playing. Harden is a great offensive player but looking back at it the combo of Allen, LaVert, and Prince were combining for 50 points in some of those games plus contributing a lot on defense."
Jarrett Allen woulda caught that.
is  Jarrett Allen the best player on the cavs team?
He got traded to Houston from Cleveland.   Houston originally got Jarrett Allen in the Harden trade but Tillman didn't want to pay his extension and wanted a draft pick instead so they swapped Allen for Exum (an expiring) and a Bucks pick.
"Then we traded Exum and a second for Jarrett Allen, so I'll take it"
Yeah imagine a young core consisting of KPJ-KJ Martin-Christian Wood-Jarrett Allen and whoever you get in the lottery this year. That would be fantastic
"Yeah but they gave him to us for nothing, probably bc we were generous with Jarrett Allen."
To think Rockets got laughed at for trading Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cavs. Rockets got KPJ and a 1st rounder for them.
"I don't know about it being the hardest to learn on defense; off the top of my head Mitchell Robinson, Jarrett Allen, and Bam Adebayo all had really strong defensive showings right off the bat.   I'd say that it's harder for young wing players to be good defenders because they can't get by on athleticism alone, they need actual technique."
"Book plus Ben and some high level role players like Tobias Harris, OG, Norm Powell and Matisse and a decent rim protector like Jarrett Allen? Yeah, I could see that being a solid contender in the east."
"Well from the words of another promising young player Jarrett Allen ""I would have traded myself too for James Harden"". In the end, both teams are happy cause I doubt the Nets could have gotten away with resting KD like this without Harden"
"Only asset with any significant value is the Minn pick.  Wiggins is a negative contract.  Wiseman is probably worth around the value of Jarrett Allen, who was traded for a late first."
"Brunson, OG, Fox, Jarrett Allen"
I think Cleveland legit wanted him to play him in good faith  but then they had a chance to get jarrett allen for free
&gt; Some day someone will question whether moving Jarrett Allen was worth it.  Lol no they won't unless this Nets team never wins anything
"Rockets: We should get Oladipo for Harden, his trade value will be high, maybe we could even trade him for a package of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or something!"
That was way more than 5 years ago right? We're talking KG trade right?  The Nets actually had a good young team when the FAs rolled in. Some day someone will question whether moving Jarrett Allen was worth it.

"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
I think it's difficult nigh impossible to evaluate absolute impact difference from a single stat (is Jarrett Allen better than Gobert in the restricted area?)   But obviously Gobert is better in that area. How much better just can't be accurately determined by fg% allowed alone.
Jarrett Allen looked way too good in them
I would choose Jarrett Allen
"Lakers: Steph Curry.  Nets: Mikal Bridges, Jarrett Allen."
"If Shamet regains his form, would he provide more value than Jarrett Allen to the Nets?"
"The only reason the Cavs were involved was because they wanted Jarrett Allen, so probably not"
Couldn't they have gotten Harden while keeping Jarrett Allen?
"Jarrett Allen, who?"
"Yeah, wish the best for him  I‚Äôm just gonna pretend we traded him to you guys for Jarrett Allen"
Were other teams hesitant?  I think the Cavs did HOU a solid on account of the Jarrett Allen deal.
"He didn‚Äôt really even cost us a second round pick. The pick is top 55 protected that most likely won‚Äôt convey. We just got him for free basically. Honestly, I feel like there probably were a couple teams who they could‚Äôve gifted him to but sent him to Houston because we have a pretty established relationship with the Cavs when it comes to trades and had recently given them Jarrett Allen for not too much in return."
"I take back what I said because this is a team that chose fucking TJ Leaf instead of OG Anunoby, John Collins, Kyle Kuzma, Jarrett Allen, and Josh Hart so they're gonna fuck up the lottery pick too I bet"
Just think of it as KPJ for Jarrett Allen cause u basically got him for free lol

Jarrett Allen fa..ntasy owners.......rise up.....?:(
"The Pels are strong af, and they're longbois too. As much as I love Jarrett Allen, Steven Adams is not a good matchup for him. And Kevin Love is a shell of himself."
This was not the game for Jarrett Allen fans on every level
"I thought Jarrett Allen was supposed to be good, guy is getting completely abused.   Cavs were better with Drummond."
Cleveland bad. LeBron good. Kevin love. Dan Gilbert bad. Jarrett Allen doesn‚Äôt deserve this. Drummond buyout.
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team!

Cleveland shipped him off during the Harden trade and somehow got Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince out of it
"you:   &gt;He literally was traded for 4 picks and Caris LeVert. You should look at your assets again because you 100% could have made a better offer.  Reply:  &gt;Also Jarrett Allen and four pick swaps lol  you:  &gt;Rockets did not receive Allen in the trade  Clarify if this is incorrect but your point was that allen doesn't count as part of hadens trade value, because he didn't end up on houston. This is wrong because hardens trade value is defined by what the team who got him gave up."
It was three first round picks and four pick swaps.  It was a multiple team trade but they also gave up Jarrett Allen without really receiving anything
Also Jarrett Allen and four pick swaps lol
Kinda similar to Jarrett Allen playing the Nets twice immediately after the Harden trade
Jarrett Allen was probably gone in the off-season and those picks are gonna be worthless so you can pretty much look at it as a Harden for LeVert and Prince swap
or jarrett allen for milwaukee's 1st and exum...
"The Only Team to beat the Brooklyn Nets+Drummond  PG- Stephen Curry  SG- Marcus Smart  SF- LeBron James  PF- Domantas Sabonis  C- Anthony Davis   6th Man- Jarrett Allen  7th Man- ALEX ""The GOAT"" Caruso"
"Ohhhh you're a Laker fan too! You make so much more sense now. Try sticking to one team.  A core of Sexton, Garland and Jarrett Allen is really nothing to brag about, and considering your history with high picks (outside of LBJ) your track record is awful. Please don't hype Okoro either because he hasn't done anything and is severely overrated as a prospect. The fact that you put Nance in there too is genuinely hilarious."
then they got jarrett allen and remembered what actual good basketball looks like
"KAT, Gobert, Embiid, Adebayo, Jokic, AD (if we count him as a center) and Sabonis in the first tier. And then guys like Jarrett Allen, Nurkic, Myles Turner, Ayton, Christian Wood, Capela... a lot of amazing centers in the league today. Know I missed a few but i remember when it was pretty much just Dwight and Bynum who were elite."
"They got him for Jarrett Allen, LeVert and 4 picks. Then they traded for Dipo and another pick"
I have no idea to be honest with you. My reference for him was Whiteside who I was kind of shocked to see only got a vet min.  I think it'll be below 10M a year but some team will take a flier on him (I think Charlotte is a real possibility).  I'm going to be very interested to see how much of a bag some the other free agent centers get such as Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen. They're both fundamentally sound rim runners who fit into their roles with a lot less negative qualities compared to Drummond.
Jarrett Allen getting a Fat max
"Not so much LeVert but people absolutely did and continue to view Jarrett Allen as a staple piece.  And hell, maybe he was, and still is. Still easily worth giving up for the return, though."
"They are playing Jarrett Allen, he has averaged 28 mins per game the same as Drummond lol."
cavs would rather play jarrett allen than contract year black hole drummond
"Jarrett Allen is a great asset though lol, better than Larry Nance"
"We take the same philosophy in the paint to the negotiating table, nothing for free. 3 or 4 offers have come in already and were blocked by Jarrett Allen"
"And a Blake Griffin who has less dunks this season than CP3 at that lmao, If this was prime Lob City Blake fine get tilted I probably would too  But this is old man Blake with no lift lol, he's still a serviceable player but its hardly the end of the world he joined the Nets lol. Not like Blake solves the problem of the Nets having to play DeAndre Jordan 30+mins a night because they traded away Jarrett Allen."

Would probably have to throw a near max at Jarrett Allen to get him out of Cleveland, and I think that's too much of an overpay. I think one of Markkanen/Collins are possible.   Markkanen more so because it looks like he's been moved to the bench and the Bulls are higher on Patrick Williams. Also I think Markkanen's fit with Siakam is better since he's a floor spacer and wouldn't clog the paint and Siakam does better in some areas of the game that Markkanen isn't really good at (rebounding and defense especially)."
Will be a really good fit in the backcourt with FVV going forward.   Since the Raptors are probably gonna be one of the few teams with cap space they should try going for one of Jarrett Allen/Markkanen/Josh Collins in free agency - might be able to pry one of them from their current team.
"When the Nets traded Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen stuff they did in the community was what popped to my mind.  It's cool to have guys on your team like Jrue, you can be proud to root for."
Jarrett Allen has to be up there.. he‚Äôs like the complete opposite of a typical young NBA player. He just keeps to himself and builds computers and shit lol
Jarrett Allen is rumored to be given a contract extension somewhere around 100 million dollars this offseason. We did not want to pay for that.  Same principle w LeVert ig considering Dipo was expiring and we also wanted to make a playoff push to make Christian Wood happy so Dipo was perceived to be better than LeVert.  Overall it‚Äôs damn near impossible to get equal value for a guy like Harden and most of the package is tied in those 2025/26/27 picks and pick swaps which will take years to know the true value of. We prob could have done better but idk if we keep our pick this year we will be looking pretty decent
"I still don't understand why you guys didn't just keep Jarrett Allen, I get the Oladipo/LaVert thing to an extent but like damn, only ended up with Kelly Olynik and some not great 1st's for Harden right?  Oh wait KPJ was part of that too iirc, dude looks pretty good actually"
Jarrett Allen.
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
"Or because they know his minutes with Deandre Jordan sink his DRTG and because the DRTG without Harden also includes the pre-trade ratings where they had more capable defenders, including Jarrett Allen. With Harden and w/o DJ, they have a 110 DRTG. With Harden and DJ, they have a 116 DRTG.  But yeah they're definitely the bias ones and not a dude who spends 75% of his reddit time trying to make Harden look bad"
He needs a hobby and more of a personal life. He's too focused on hoopin'  He could talk to his fellow Longhorn alum Jarrett Allen about having interests outside of basketball that could make his life more multifaceted and interesting...
"Then you have dudes like Jarrett Allen who like to build their own computers, play Legend of Zelda, and rush home to watch the Mars landing while saying he's a ""huge space guy"" after playing an NBA game."
Or: Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert
"Eliminating the Nuggets from playoff contention, giving them a lottery pick they might have missed otherwise, as they won their last two games. I believe Portland held the tiebreaker over Denver, but Portland also could have easily lost to San Antonio the next night - as it stands they only won by 1 point.  In 2017 draft, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell with their lottery pick. Various advanced stats place Mitchell as the 2nd to 4th best player from that draft so far. Portland, meanwhile, won just as many playoff games as Denver that year, but ended up with Justin Jackson, who has had a rather lackluster career thus far.  The only players of roughly similar value to Mitchell picked after him are Bam Adebayo (who was picked by the late-lottery Heat and thus unavailable to any playoff team), John Collins, and Jarrett Allen.  Westbrook's 35 foot dagger was a building block in the future of the Nuggets."
Jarrett Allen is a legit all-star caliber center. He starts over a lot of people  You saying the Cavs bought him out for so low not because it made sense for them but because they're pandering to a dude who left the team a few years ago? Not to show future players they're a player-friendly organization? Like there was zero communication between drummond and the FO and his desired locations?  And why would other teams offer more money if he was so trash?
He requested because they started playing Jarrett Allen over him because he was so Garbage. The only reason he got bought out for so low was because he‚Äôs a Lebron Stan and his first choice was the Lakers. A lot of teams had more $$ to offer. He basically screwed over the Cavs yet they didn‚Äôt care. Just glad to be rid of him.   And DJ got ten mil out of KD and Kyrie‚Äôs contracts. We wouldn‚Äôt have paid him that otherwise. Regardless i‚Äôd way rather have DJ on the court than that moron.
"They bought him out because he requested it and they got Jarrett Allen, not because he was too bad for their team  Yeah he couldn't get traded and he's not worth 20+ mil, but he's cheap and serviceable  His contract and production is worth way more than DJs  12/9 for cheap as fuck is better than 7/7 for 10mil"
hartenstein in over jarrett allen is just blatant tanking right
"They can give him a ring if they win. They could do the same with Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Kurucs, anyone who was on the team for that season."
"I will die on this hill, the Cavs would've never given the Rockets Kevin Porter Jr. for free if they didn't give the Cavs Jarrett Allen for a late 1st."
"The sixers would be better for sure. If the nets still get the injuries to kd and kyrie, I think they probably float around 5-6 since they‚Äôd still have jarrett allen and caris levert."
Nerlens ‚ÄúJarrett ‚ÄòMarcus Smart‚Äô Allen‚Äù Noel
"Nets fan here... It's definitely Ben Simmons. Even before the crap he's been spewing lately, we hated when he laughed at Embiid's apology from hitting Jarrett Allen. Then the whole Dudley business.  Yeah, we despise that dude lol"
Joe Harris. Rip Jarrett allen :(
"But his contract was expiring, they literally would rather save a lil than to have him on the team. He wasnt playing on the cavs towards the end bc they chose jarrett allen."
I mean he had no business in the buyout market. Issue was Jarrett Allen was younger and better. Harden trade doesnt happen and Drummond is still in Cleveland
Steven Adams and Jarrett Allen usually play him well. Even if the stats don‚Äôt show it for Allen
"Did the Heat have that many picks and pick swaps to trade? Seems like that's what the Rockets wanted... do the Nets even any picks left in the next like 6 years?  By the way everything went down, it seemed like the Rockets were clearly more interested in sending Harden to the Nets, and didn't really want back players. They rerouted Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to Cleveland, Caris LeVert to Indiana, and eventually traded Oladipo to Miami. The only player they actually kept was Kurucs, and he plays like shit. If you look at all that, I don't think they were all that serious about negotiating with parties other than the Nets, unless they were gonna fleece them."
"Right, that‚Äôs why I said Jarrett Allen before Deandre Jordan. It‚Äôs not like the Lakers have better centers than those two."
"Idk, I would put my money on healthy Lavert with Kyrie  and KD+ Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan over Lakers. That‚Äôs if the nets were fully healthy though."
"Okay but they didn't get a good return. Not a single blue-chip young player back, which isn't a big ask for Hardon  Then, the closest thing they got was Levert, who they traded for Oladipo, who was traded for Olynk and Bradley lol. They also didn't get Jarrett Allen.   I'm a Laker fan, but that rockets team was one of my all time favorite teams. They butchered this."
The answer is no and they are looking to trade him.  Problem is they won't get much in return.  Jarrett Allen who is basically Wiseman but better went for a late first recently.  Wiseman's value isn't close to his 2nd overall selection anymore
? jarrett allen has not been extended tho
"Lol Cleveland fucked it up by giving 100 mill to Jarrett Allen for 4 years already. Ayton has looked deserving lately though, at the start of the season I was skeptical"
I love Jarrett Allen

"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
"I think nine of the roster spots are spoken for if they want it:  PG Steph, Dame  SG Harden, Paul George  SF Kawhi, Durant  PF Lebron, AD  C Bam  who would you have filling the other three spots on the roster? I was thinking something like this:  PG Chris Paul - good to have another floor general on the roster but might have bad blood with Harden  C Jarrett Allen/Myles Turner - backup big that prbly won't see much floor time with Bam and AD on the roster, but can be used against a big center like Jokic or Nurkic. Either of them would be a better fit than Drummond   SG Khris Middleton - thinking of a 3&amp;D guy to fill the last spot but not sure who to pick. It doesn't matter too much since whoever I pick here won't see much floor time unless someone gets hurt. I was also thinking of Tatum but he is still very young and can be picked for the 2024 team along with Zion, Beal, Trae, Fox, Mitchell, etc.  Didn't pick Butler because his offensive skills are redundant with all the ball handlers on the team already and his bad 3 pt shooting"

"Nobody is going to ‚Äústop‚Äù Embiid.  A prime Gasol or Bogut could, but nobody out there right now.  That doesn‚Äôt mean Jarrett Allen wouldn‚Äôt do a much better job than the corpse of DeAndre Jordan or Nic Claxton."
"Nope.  He was a rookie last year, got about 15 games scattered throughout the season, then hurt in Feb. 2020.  He was recovering and only came back after we traded Jarrett Allen."
I remember Jarrett Allen said that the Cavs talked about animals and stuff on their roadtrips lol. This fits with that
"KD + Kyrie + LeVert + Joe Harris + Jarrett Allen would still have been pretty good. Not as good, but still a contender"
Kyrie's bringing the Jarrett Allen energy with the fro
"I think they‚Äôre a bit different though. Rudy is definitely an OG center, but Capela is more of a modern nba center that‚Äôs quick, athletic, can catch lobs, and can switch/defend the perimeter relatively well. You‚Äôll see a lot of the Capela type nowadays. Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, etc.   Maybe the only archaic part of Capela‚Äôs game is his inability to shoot"
"Ughh id have tk go Clippers the Nets super team just is my mortal enemy. I love the role players Joe Harris and Dinwiddie (if he was healthy) Claxton but I loved the Nets the previous few years when they were a group of underrated hustlers who finally made the playoffs under coach Kenny. I feel like the Nets did Kenny Atkinson, Jarrett Allen, and even LeVert kinda dirty just to stroke James Hardens ego . . . the Clippers r also basically anothrr ‚Äòdouche‚Äô team in the NBA but that mostly bc of Pat Beverly / Rondo less than desirable attitude plus Kawhi ego though less outlandish than Harden / Kyrie is similar level ...i know they extraordinaire basketball players but Kawhi n Harden attitudes have kinda just been Blahh lately.  Overall though Ibaka is one of my favorite basketball players in my lifetime so Id love to see him get another ring before Harden gets 1 üòÇ"
"And this is why some people shouldn't be trusted with a stat sheet.  Gobert takes 8.2 shots a game. 77% of 8.2 is 6.3. Ayton takes 10 shots per game. 53% of 10 is 5.3. So their difference in shots from less than 3feet is approximately 1 per game. The ft difference is 5.3 for Gobert to 2.5 for Ayton. Ayton is also not a great ft shooter either, if he shot Gobert's volume on fta the difference would be about 1 point every two games.  Ayton is a significantly more aggressive player than Gobert, taking a similar volume of shots in the paint and gets to the line less than half as often. I chose Ayton as an example because I like him but it gets worse.  Capella takes 70% of his shots within 3 feet, he also takes 11 shots a game so he takes more shots in that area than Rudy does. He averages 3.6fts per game, still markedly less than Rudy. Jarrett Allen takes fewer shots total than Capella takes in that zone and still gets to the line 30% more.  JV takes a similar volume of shots in that zone and gets to the line less than anyone but Ayton.  This isn't some ridiculous conspiracy theory, its just a thing that happens."
"Wouldn't be surprised to see any of Lillard, Curry, Draymond, PG, Ja, Zion, Booker, Mitchell, Trae, Tatum, Lavine, Bam, Jimmy, Middleton, Jrue, Randle, Beal, Westbrook, Jarrett Allen invited/participating. Depending on camp size, possibly some younger/less proven guys at least being invited to camp like Bridges, Fox, BI, JJJ, Rob Williams, etc.       I think anybody who makes the Finals likely won't play in it which could rule out guys like Harden, Lebron, Kyrie, and AD *if* they make it. I only see Lebron going if they let him have some low-effort role where he just plays a few minutes here and there and gets his medal, but idk if they operate like that. I have no clue whether Kawhi is interested or not but if he just wants to rest and focus on his offseason, that would be another notable missing piece. The list above is very guard heavy and they'll need some quality bigs for the international game so some of those guards are just going to get squeezed out, likely the younger guys."
You say that like there isn't an actual superteam chillin in the East right now that came from Harden quitting on his old team and getting dealt to a contender for Jarrett Allen and picks.
"I mean I think you‚Äôre being disingenuous if you say that Gary Harris and KCP can do what Ben can do while also saying that Capela can ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù do what Gobert can do. If players like KCP are the bar for perimeter defence, guys like Derrick Favours, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Draymond, Poeltl , Gifford, Robin Lopez, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen + more should all count as ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù defensive anchors"
"Yea with a good scouting department and being able to identify talent and hidden gems like Joe Harris, who knows what could happen. Obviously nets would have liked Tatum and Brown but through taking on salary dumps for late firsts and trading away any players that had value to contending teams they got Jarrett Allen, Caris levert, and D'lo and built a winning culture that players wanted to join in free agency."
still he qualifies for the all-afro team starring marvin bagley III and jarrett allen
"Caris and Jarrett Allen were used as TRADE pieces for James Harden, that's not bought. Again, a TRADE. That's where players are traded to another team for another player. They aren't bought from another team.  Also, Joe Harris, you may know him from last night's game, was picked up out of the garbage bin. Spencer Dinwiddie is injured, but he was as well."
"Yeah, too bad he was on such a shitty team with Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris Lavert, Joe Harris, and Jarrett Allen. That team already had a good shot of winning the title but Durant can't help but always take the easiest way possible."
They got Jarrett Allen...but then they sent him to Cleveland for some reason.
Wiseman and the 14 pick is not worth a all star at most your probably getting a miles turner or Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen and I'd take Mitchell Robinson over him as well.
and Jarrett Allen
"I‚Äôm probably biased, but saying a dude who just put up 11/9/9 in 20 minutes in the playoffs against the Nets will never be on that level is a little premature as well. He‚Äôs defo not on that level yet, Id put Ayton, Bam, Jarrett Allen (and maybe 1/2 others im forgetting) above him, but is still incredibly young and I think he could be in the conversation by the end of next season"
"Just piggybacking off this. Just because AD isn‚Äôt always in the low post like an Embiid is, doesn‚Äôt mean his work is not done at the rim. Drummond just standing right in the paint all game hinders AD as a roller, cutter, lob threat, and reduces the risk of him driving to the hoop, then making him easier to defend in the mid post as well.  Other low post scorers in this league like JV, Nurk, Jokic, Embiid, Ayton can all step out and at least hit a midrange, so they don‚Äôt carry the same issue.   Those who can‚Äôt shoot, are athletic and mobile to the point where if you leave them at the midrange spot they just need one step to dunk it on you -like Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela etc.  Drummond is NOT a shooter at any spot. He is not too quick and doesn‚Äôt have a high vertical to compensate. AND is not even good in the low post. His touch around the rim is atrocious. He generally has shot under 50 percent despite shooting mainly at the rim."
He's the most overrated player in the league. Jarrett Allen is better than his ass
Jarrett Allen is better than AD
"Sort of.   1. He's been injury-prone so far. The current toe injury isn't a concern long-term but he's had a hip injury for the past 2 seasons which has really limited him. We're hoping he's nearing the end of it but we definitely need insurance.  2. Similar to Myles Turner and Jarrett Allen, you want to pair him with a big who can help out against post threats because they generally play him off the floor.    This offseason, one of our big areas of improvement will be the frontcourt. Thompson and Kornet have looked decent in their roles but we either need to add another big or swap one of those two out for another.   I'd say we're like a Dwight Howard away from having our C problem solved. Alternatively, if we could get Baynes playing well again."
"Wonder why that was never on the board. But to be fair, I feel the likes of Vuc, Capela, Valanciunas, Ayton, Nurkic, Porzingis are too out of reach.  I think Wiseman would fit in the range of Drummond, Whiteside, Jarrett Allen, Robert Williams, Gafford, Mitchell Robinson. None have the upside but would be solid, win-now contributors."
Believe it or not some ppl care about learning either way. Jarrett Allen iirc is a huge math guy
"One of the Cavs young guards, Kevin Love, and a lotto protected first round pick for next year. Would throw in Jarrett Allen on a sign &amp; trade. Conditional on Kevin Love approval because he is a franchise legend."
"I mean you can handwave it all away because of KD, Kyrie and Harden but the Nets absolutely made some great moves in the past few seasons. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen just off the top of my head are/were awesome players for them and helped get them to where they are today."
"Curry - 43  SGA - 4  Luka - 8  MPJ - 4  LeBron - 39   And I got money to spare  If I really don‚Äôt want to go small, replace MPJ with Jarrett Allen"
"before he got his concussion he was an easy 15/13  he and DG in the pick and roll is like Nash and Amare damn near  jarrett allen at minimum is a good starter, not even close to a role player"
"What could they get for Allen? At best a late 1st round, a guy in his 2-3 years that hasn‚Äôt really found its rhythm in the league? The odds are not in your favor to get a star from that, on the other hand you‚Äôd be really happy to get a solid starter/8men rotation player and that‚Äôs pretty much what Allen already is. They won‚Äôt get a top pick for him, but playing him doesn‚Äôt stop them from finishing bottom 5 and getting a top pick of their own. A guy like Jarrett with his interior defense and pick and roll abilities give way more liberties to any pure scorer you could find that could blossom into a star. I just think the Cavs have way to much improvements to make as an organization to just play the lotto with mid round and late picks hoping for a star, they can‚Äôt afford to trade away young talented players they already have."
"I understand that's what it does. I think that's bad for the league. Upping max contracts would balance out. Stars would get higher contracts, role players would take a bit of a hit. Instead of Danny green getting 15 million a year he might get 10. Jarrett allen wouldn't be looking at getting 100 million, hed be probably getting 60. Guys would be getting paid much closer to they're actual on court value. All the current system does is hurts team like cleveland that are forced to pay exorbitant amounts for role players while bigger markets can get stars for bargains"
Huge shock? Are we watching the same Jarrett Allen?
since when is $20m/yr a lot?  Bogdanovic and Bertans basically make that  there is no way with the cap rising that Jarrett Allen making 5/$100m is going to have an impact on Sexton‚Äôs contract
please don‚Äôt compare draymond one of the best defenders of all time to jarrett allen
"I like Jarrett Allen a lot so I am glad he's getting paid. It will be interesting to see where the market is for big men like this. As a Knicks fan, similar decisions will be need be made with Mitchell Robinson in the near future."
"Money in the nba is crazy nowadays, Jarrett Allen not even a top 50? Player and he‚Äôll get 100M.   Good job securing the bag though, nothing but respect"
Man it‚Äôs pays to be average at your job in the NBA! Congrats to Jarrett Allen that‚Äôs a bag üíº full of cheese üßÄ!
All-Defensive Team seems realistic. DPOY and/or an All-Star I can't see happening at all.  Jarrett Allen is good. But he's not *that* level of good.
Then they should consider trading Jarrett Allen not Sexton
"&gt;Jarrett Allen is 23 and has dpoy and all star potential.  He's a good young player with borderline all-star potential but isn't anywhere near DPOY material, keep it real."
Claxton is 21. I love Jarrett Allen and Claxton but Claxton good be just as good and probably has more potential to be more than that.
Jarrett Allen wasn't good with you guys this year???   no way
You think he deserves Jarrett Allen money?
"Hahaha yikes. Didn't mean to upset you my friend. It wasn't a total abomination of a trade but we definitely won. I remember when the trade just went though, everyone thought that we had given up a first and were still cool with it.  If only NO didn't suck at drafting. We had 3 FRPs that year and ended up with Collins (always hurt) instead of Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen. Hell, we could've had 3 of those players."
But he's never going to be the player to build your franchise around. He's a role player on a terrible team. No one is going to Cleveland to play with Jarrett Allen. They're not going to be a contender or even a playoff team with Jarrett Allen. They're overpaying for a very talented role player. That's NOT how you build a team. You don't overpay for Robert Horry or Derek Fischer and hope Kobe Bryant is going to land in your lap.
"[Ed Davis called this over two years ago](https://nypost.com/2019/01/10/nets-mentor-sees-possible-100-million-player-in-jarrett-allen/)  &gt; ‚ÄúJust trying to help him out as much as possible. I got big expectations for him,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs a $100 million player, so he‚Äôs got to go get it.‚Äù"
2k Jarrett Allen is the greatest player to ever hit the court
"I mean is the Cavs window opening up in the next 4 years? If guys hit their peak at 26-28 (best example today is Denver), and they want Jarrett Allen to be a piece of that, then what‚Äôs more important than keeping him and whoever else they consider vital for the next 4 years?"
"Kevin love was like 30, has dealt with numerous serious injuries, and was coming off 4 straight finals runs.   Jarrett Allen is 23 and has dpoy and all star potential."
So your comment is just genuine concern about Kevin Love on a thread about Jarrett Allen? And that genuine concern resulted in you suggesting the Cavs should give him a hug or a blanket?  Sounds a bit more like you're taking the piss.
If real life 2023 Jarrett Allen is anything like NBA 2k 2023 Jarrett Allen this would be a hell of a signing.
"Yeah I definitely agree. I also think there‚Äôs a lot of guys who are so good at their role that I value them more than a lower impact young guy putting up good numbers on a bad team.   I think having guys like Kyle Anderson, Jarrett Allen, Joe Ingles, Robert Covington helps teams win more than Garland. Ingles is a pretty egregious omission from this list imo."
"&gt; No one said anything when Drummond was sitting for the Cavs so why is it such a big deal for the Thunder?  because he was benched off of him being in his feelings about the Cavs    trading for Jarrett Allen and not wanting a reduced role, not because they were trying to lose games."

"That surprised me too, I would‚Äôve guessed Jarrett Allen"
"I agree with this but am also unnaturally high on Scottie Barnes. While having 3 non shooters on the court could be problematic (Okoro, Scottie, Jarrett Allen), the defensive potential of those 3 is insane and too good to pass up in my opinion"
screen assists &gt;&gt;&gt; actual assists  getting worked by Jarrett Allen &gt;&gt;&gt; being jokic before jokic
Seeing Jarrett Allen play us last night in a Cavs uni still hurts ngl. Miss the Fro
Yeah what is with these people downvoting lmao. These are obviously jokes and the discount Jarrett Allen was hilarious

Finally noticed Jarrett Allen and now it‚Äôs a little sad
Jarrett Allen is the undisputed most likable player in the league right now and will forever be loved by the Nets organization and fans
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron‚Äôs effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie‚Äôs exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron‚Äôs people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA‚Äôs other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn‚Äôt pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
"Obviously there was a lot of luck involved getting their stars, but let's not forget the 18-19 season where they were 6th in the East with All-Star D'Angelo Russell and supplemented by dudes they drafted late like Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert, or traded for like Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Yes the FO massively fucked up the Celtics trade, but it's not like they've been totally sitting on their ass since"
"You're right , at least you ended up with Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen. It's better than nothing"
"Forreal Jarrett Allen is legit as fuck, can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt take him."
"Houston would still have got all the picks from the Nets but it's crazy how they didn't add Nic Claxton, Jarrett Allen or Caris LeVert. All three have all-star potential. LeVert's on a great value contract.  The Houston GM will probably be fired by the time the unprotected picks from the Nets come into play. But for whoever is GM for the Rockets when those picks convey it'll be a bonus."

"Probably in the minority, but I won't derive value as a fan in any titles these teams win. I've been a Nets fan since right after the two finals (was too young, didn't become fan until I was around 8). I've always dreamed of a championship, but with a team that felt organically built. All teams utilize free agency and trades, but there's a difference between standard utilization and what's done to create a modern superteam. It was way more meaningful when we were building a team post-celtics than the current situation where we randomly become a top 3 team because a few superstars decided that they wanted to be in Brooklyn. It was awesome to watch Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, Levert, Russell, Harris, and others develop and grow together, but suddenly almost everyone is gone and we have a team of ringers who happened to pick brooklyn to play in."
Lopez thought Jarrett Allen [was a mascot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYVT3QqHQiA) with all his fluffy hair.
They also walked into the firefight in the first place by trading away Levert for Dipo and Jarrett Allen for a half eaten bag of cheetos
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7. Brook Lopez|1902 MPG|103 blocks| |8. Richaun Holmes|1782 MPG|96 blocks| |9. Robert Williams|985 MPG|91 blocks| |18. Giannis Antetokounmpo|2013 MPG|73 blocks| |21. Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
"Trade him to Cleveland for Jarrett Allen? Need to fill salary and maybe attach a pick but Allen is p young and very solid, is probably expecting 25m or more though."
"We have a top 3 pick, a team USA select point guard, a borderline all star in sexton, and Jarrett Allen. We are just as up and coming as them."
The only other player is maybe Meech but I wouldn't do that unless it was for someone like Jarrett Allen
Jerami Grant should‚Äôve been swapped out with Jarrett Allen
"Randle is 6‚Äô8, that‚Äôs not gonna cut it. They need Dwight Howard or Jarrett Allen"
"Myles Turner, Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen. That's the best I can do."
Yea how is Myles turner and Jarrett Allen not inside the team
"If Lowry leaves, use the cap space created to pursue Jarrett Allen or Richaun Holmes.  If Lowry stays, use an exception to pursue a cheaper option, like Nerlens Noel.  Using our exceptions to sign a shooting wing like OPJ or Bullock would be nice too."
Jarrett Allen
He low key lucked out big time. He would‚Äôve been good anywhere but no other place could he win a game by 30 while playing 35 minutes and dropping 5 points. Could‚Äôve been a Jarrett Allen type where he found himself on the way out of a lot doors in PG13/Westbrook/CP3 type deals.
"when harden got injured vs the bucks the nets literally played the same if not better, he‚Äôs not the reason why the nets got anywhere. the ball actually moves better without harden, however having harden to lead the second unit never hurts either but to be honest the argument could be made that levert and jarrett allen are a better fit for the nets overall than harden"
"Wouldn‚Äôt the Nets have Jarrett Allen in this case? I feel like a healthy team of Kyrie, Caris Levert, Joe Harris, KD, and Jarrett Allen (or put Bruce brown as PG and let Levert play 6th man) would be able to take it, even have a guy like Jeff Green who wouldn‚Äôt have to play as major of a role on defense if Allen was there.  Dunno, i guess i might still take the Cavs in that series but it‚Äôs a little closer than i thought."
"I completely forgot Zion &amp; Mitchell, swapped them in.  Ant close but not there yet, who would you boot for him? (Jarrett Allen &amp; LaMelo are gone)"
Even if it's just for Wiseman though. Kenny is the guy who worked with Jarrett Allen his first 2 years.
"Let Allen walk.  But knowing this is the NBA they‚Äôll draft Mobley, pay Allen a ridiculous contract for his average production, and the Cavs will claim they can play both big men together with Mobley playing PF due to his ability to shoot the 3. Kevin Love may or may not be on the Cavs by the end of the summer but we‚Äôll assume he is. Mobley will come off the bench because they want to bring him along slow because he‚Äôs ‚Äúa kid‚Äù. They‚Äôll experiment with a 2 C lineup in the preseason and see minimal results. The regular season comes &amp; Mobley will be the backup C. All of his minutes will come at C &amp; it will take several games before Bickerstaff feels comfortable to test out playing both big men together due to pressure from fans that makes the front office want to appease them. They‚Äôll try it for different 5 minute stretches over the course of maybe 2 weeks with the 2 C lineup ranking at the bottom as far as efficiency of their 5 man lineups. Eventually they‚Äôll abandon it and just begin a rotation at C with Allen &amp; Mobley. Allen will face criticism because he‚Äôs now viewed as overpaid because he‚Äôs a limited rim running big man &amp; his production is still 11 PPG 10 RPG or around that level but he has little room to grow or develop beyond that because he‚Äôs splitting minutes &amp; his backup offers more upside on both ends. As the Cavs slip out of contention once again, we‚Äôll see Woj mention that Cleveland would be interested in moving Allen for the right deal. The trade deadline comes &amp; Allen is still underperforming based on what he‚Äôs paid &amp; teams are hesitant to trade a valuable player or pick for him. While Cleveland still wants to recoup the 1st they gave up to acquire him. No trade takes place. Long story short in Summer 2022 the Cavs trade Jarrett Allen and the 4 years remaining on his deal along with a  future protected 1st round pick to OKC for 2 future 2nds to create a Trade Exception."
"i dont have a strong take on Sexton either way, Im not as high on him as others right now but I could also see him improving alot and maybe following the Zach LaVine trajectory. It's TBD. What I do think is really stupid though is trading Sexton because you dont want to pay him but then turning around and giving Jarrett Allen huge $$"
It also gets forgotten that trading Jarrett Allen for a late 1st round pick to the Cavs was more than likely an unofficial part of the KPJ trade
"LeBron and Curry easily, that is an all time scary duo. Give those 2 Jarrett Allen, Crowder, Danny Green and they would repeat lol"
"Jarrett Allen, Drummond (b4 the buyout) just for the memes, Larry Nance for the dunks"
"you can keep hiding behind that flair if you want but simmons was insanely bad last series and with that contract and who he is as a player, no way we would get equal return for simmons back. As far as Jarrett Allen, even the Cavs who took him in the trade are hoping Mobley falls to them."
because simmons and jarrett allen are great prizes as well?
Bold of you to assume he was a nets fan last year when their best player was Injured Kyrie and Jarrett Allen
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
I wonder of that would change of he needed to play 33 minutes a night instead of 20. For me: Best Case: Bam Adebayo Probably: Jarrett Allen Worst Case: Willie Cauley-Stein  You are probably right re intensity though
1. Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton 2. Jalen Green - Zach LaVine 3. Jalen Suggs - Baron Davis 4. James Bouknight - Brandon Roy-lite 5. Evan Mobley - Pau Gasol 6. Jonathan Kuminga - Jamal Mashburn 7. Kai Jones - Jarrett Allen 8. Ayo Dosunmu - Taller Dennis Shroeder 9. Scottie Barnes - Thaddeus Young 10. Josh Giddey - Mild-Mannered Lance Stephenson 11. Moses Moody - Shane Battier 12. Corey Kispert - Doug McDermott 13. Franz Wagner - Kyle Anderson 14. Rokas Jokubaitis - Derek Fisher/Left-Handed Juan Carlos Navarro 15. Jaden Springer - Desmond Mason
Lol we just got Jarrett Allen for nickels and dimes this season. I get that in the past we have a bad rep but recently things have definitely turned around within the last 2 years
"Dame-Beal-Tatum-Durant-Adebayo should smoke opposing teams out the gate  Lavine, Grant, Draymond can fill up minutes  Holiday, Booker, Middleton 15mpg  Love gets participation award? I don't understand his role, John Collins or Jarrett Allen would've been better"
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that‚Äôs also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
didn't embiid do something worse to jarrett allen before  and then laughed about it?
"Brook Lopez, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen for the Nets. None of them left on their own though so no reason at all not to like them. They were all traded."
I honestly haven‚Äôt been that impressed with Jarrett Allen.  I‚Äôm excited to have him on the team but I think he has more to prove.
"So you went from saying you could see cavs players get visibly upset at him to you read some silly report where opposing players taunt them during games by saying, ""you know he‚Äôs not going to pass you the ball""?  Let me ask you something about this incredibly well sourced article. Do you believe multiple players- on different teams mind you- have all come to cavs games and mocked cavs players because sexton dominates the ball? Like, it's so obvious that sexton dominates the ball (despite being an off ball sg playing next to a PG), that multiple teams have had players that have all picked up on that and then mocked the cavs other players? You think that's realistic? And on top of that, you think this is only true of the cavs? Teams with west brook or harden or other players who dominate the ball more... people don't mock those teams similarly?  I mean the story, if read literally, stretches all credulity. On top of that you are welcome to look at the tracking stats and it shows hes a willing passer. And that's despite his team having one of the worst shooting surrounding casts in the league. Like do you want him passing to larry nance for a 3? What about Jarrett Allen? Or Andre Drummond? Or Okoro? I mean he's surrounded with guys who cannot hit shots and you think he's a ball hog for not passing to them more?  Everything about this is fucking stupid click bait bullshit."
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
I play for the cavs on next gen. Jarrett Allen is the only person I can consistently get assists from. Colin sexton is OP on current gen but next gen I can‚Äôt get that man a bucket for shit
"CLE had that pick and traded it to HOU for Jarrett Allen in the Harden trade.  That thing is really well travelled.  Even if Giannis misses the year, i don't know that MIL is actually a bottom feeder though.  They have a lot of talent there."
"Yes, it went to Cleveland in the george hill trade, then to houston for jarrett allen, and then swapped with our 2023 first in the PJ Tucker trade. Minor miracle that we have it right now."
"nah, you guys just managed to make it find its way home.  [here's the jarrett allen trade release from the nba](https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/allen-prince-trade-210114)  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers have acquired center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince from the Brooklyn Nets as part of a three-team trade that also includes the Houston Rockets, Cavaliers General Manager Koby Altman announced from Cleveland Clinic Courts. In exchange, Cleveland is sending guard Dant√© Exum and a 2022 unprotected first round draft pick via Milwaukee to Houston"
"curious, what's the chain that led this to happening. we had that pick, it turned unprotected in exchange for help in the jrue trade, and then sent the pick to houston in the jarrett allen trade"
&gt;Do you think ~~Cleveland~~ Kings would draft ~~Mobley~~ Luka after ~~trading for~~ drafting ~~Jarrett Allen~~ De'aron Fox? If they go and draft ~~Mobley~~ Luka I guarantee ~~Allen~~ Fox walks in FA
"I mean when you look at the entire resume from 12-now it looks kinda bad, but I think their front office has taken some pretty big swings and misses in the draft and free agency. Carlisle kept them at a league average floor. Like everyone points at Donovan Mitchell there for them in 2017, but fuck if DSJ was like Jarrett Allen or John Collins they'd probably still be bad enough to have gotten Luka in 2018 and have been more competitive these last couple years."
"Being a shitty team with upside is nice.  Like we‚Äôve got Collin Sexton, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, they‚Äôre exciting.  But right now I have no stakes in the playoffs.  I‚Äôm rooting for Ty Lue above anyone else haha."
"I think we can agree that Jokic and Jarrett Allen are very different players, right?     I would argue the question shouldn't be ""who is paying centers?"" but ""who is paying non-shooters?"""
Do you think Cleveland would draft Mobley after trading for Jarrett Allen? If the go and draft Mobley I guarantee Allen walks in FA
"Portland would have made out way better just keeping the picks and choosing any two of Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White instead."
"Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. The NBA is a little weird with draft picks and unless you get a top pick in a good draft class, their value is very small. Compare that to the NFL, who value top 15 picks like gold and you can many times find a franchise changing player. The NBA is just strange that way, and many times, you need 2-3 firsts as well as a decent player or two to trade for a all star.   Look at the Harden trade, for example. The Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, Rodions Kurucs as well as three unprotected 1st rounders (2022,  2024, 2026) and four first-round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027). With two young promising players they still had to just throw in 4 firsts and 4 swaps to get Harden. If the Nets team goes bust any time soon (which, can happen with Kyrie.. just sayin), they are fucked. Even if they tank down to the bottom of the league, they either gave their pick away, or another team will swap their pick away.  I'd imagine the same kind of firepower in a trade for Dame will be needed, likely with a 4 team trade as well, so even with a young a promising Anthony Edwards, I would expect a TON of picks to be going Portland's way as well as at least another decent starter."
"I think either of the Lopez Brothers or even Jarrett Allen would have been Bette picks as the Center. Bam is going to the starting Center, but any of those would be better backups then Love"
"Nets traded Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, three 1st round picks and four 1st round pick swaps. If we had something comparable to offer I‚Äôd be way more optimistic about landing a big fish this summer. But we are currently strapped for assets, particularly 1st round picks.  And look, I‚Äôd love nothing more than to be totally wrong here lol."
"Imo Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen, Rob Williams would have all been better picks for that last roster spot. I wonder if they just didn't want to join? Lopez is in the middle of a deep playoff run, Allen is probably in bubble wrap before he signs the big contract, and Rob Williams has had injury issues.         The only player type they're really missing is true rim protector to go up against some of the other top teams. Love is sort of a stretch big who won't help on defense. Durant does everything Love does but significantly better and other players on the team can easily make up for Love's shooting. The other benefit of getting a guy like Allen and Williams is that they would get valuable experience in the international rules and be set up to help out in future years too."
"People want to pretend they are only seeing ‚Äúspoonfed shots‚Äù (which is dumb on its own), but will ignore how he‚Äôs someone who is a legit threat in the mid range and has quite a few really nice single-move post moves, like the post fade we saw over zubac going baseline. He‚Äôs got the fades over either shoulder 15 feet out, he‚Äôs got great post hooks either hand, a brutal drop step with how quick and big he is, and his spin while driving has produced some crazy highlights.  I legit think he could be a 24-25 a night guy right now, but if they let him shoot 3s and he hits at 30% like I think he‚Äôs extremely capable of, then I could see 27. If his driving gets better off the face up I could see him taking another step, but I think he has enough tools to absolutely kill any team that‚Äôs too small (Ayton bodies Jarrett Allen whenever they play, he‚Äôs too small). Plus, he steps up in big matchups, he can show up in a matchup vs guys like Jokic and Embiid better than most in the league... plus he‚Äôs well above average on the perimeter"
"No one is saying he is, but the crux of the argument is that Sexton is due a new contract after next season. How much are you willing to pay him vs. Jalen Green on a rookie scale contract?   This isn't just his second contract in a vacuum either. Jarrett Allen is up for a new deal this offseason, Sexton next, Garland the year after, Okoro the year after that, and so forth.   None of these guys are finished products, but the salary cap dictates we can't really pay all of them, so tough decisions are going to have to be made."
"I think you're missing the fact that Lowry leaving could create ~$25M in cap space for the Raptors to address their actual needs (i.e. starting C). They're not gonna facilitate a S&amp;T unless they're geting something worthwhile in return.  Trez and Caruso do nothing for us when we already have enough guards and bigs off the bench, I'd rather just let Lowry walk and pursue guys like Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen in free agency."
"Off the top of my head AD (he probably declined with injury), Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Ayton, Zion, Christian Wood, and Robert Williams all would have been more interesting adds than Kevin Love. I'm unaware out of how many of those other 5 turned down Team USA.  But if I had 20 dollars to bet, I'd bet it on this being lobbied for by Kevin Love and his people with Pop and Kerr because he's got one of the worst asset reputations in the whole league, still has 2 years left on his contract, and essentially hasn't proved he can play plus basketball on a contender since 2018."
"&gt;I agree paying Allen reduces his value but I have no idea what his contact demands even are.  With the current market I dont think there's any way he doesnt get at least 20m/year. Clint Capela was traded for pick 17, and he made less than that at the time. Serge Ibaka was traded for TRoss and pick 25 and Ibaka back in 2017 was considered much better than Jarrett Allen"
"If Mobley falls to the Cavs and they are insistent on trading Jarrett Allen, I wonder how this trade stacks up...  New York receives 11  Charlotte receives 19 + Jarrett Allen  Cleveland receives 21 + one of Nick Richards/Vernon Carey  New York consolidates quantity into quality and gets into the lottery, Charlotte receives their new big man and still stays in the 1st, Cleveland gets a decent 1st round pick for Allen"
Am I the only one who thought Jarrett Allen was like 25 or 26?
"Lmao what the fuck is this? Cavs wouldn't give up Sexton for Simmons alone, let alone adding Jarrett Allen."
"I dont see it. I think we have enough guards for the future. We have Trent we gotta re-sign, Fred, maybe Lowry, and possibly Green or Suggs.  I could see us going after Jarrett Allen or John Collins tho."
"&gt; Larry Nance, Jarrett Allen and Okoro  Why all the Love hate? He's definitely a better shooter, and arguably a better passer and rebounder then all you guys mentioned. Those three guys probably just have him beat on all around defense (roco, etc will cover him). Is he a bit rusty yeah but he's the same age as mr 50 point scorer himself, KD. He'd get super motivated and back into form playing next to Dame since KLove is a bigtime producer in the NBA playoffs.  You guys get your homer, and we get our homer. win win !"
"Wow, you're a dick, and you're still wrong!  ""That's not a bear!""  ""No, it's a grizzly bear.""  ""Uh huh, not a bear then.""  Is the exchange we just had.  Restricted free agent is a type of free agent.   If the cavaliers draft evan mobley they will no longer want to pay jarrett allen 100 million dollars, meaning if someone offers him that, the cavaliers would, barring incredibly poor judgement, not match the offer, and allen will go where he pleases. They are now considering a sign &amp; trade to not let him walk for free. If next year rolls around and evan mobley is on the team alongside jarrett allen on a 100 million dollar contract, the cavaliers owner should consider firing their GM. Paying Allen when you have Mobley is literally worst case scenario for the cavs, you'd rather let Allen walk for nothing. So yes, the fact that Allen is a free agent matters, because he needs a new contract and the extent of that contract determines what team he goes to.  If he wasn't a free agent, it wouldn't matter, because his contract would stay the same on the books and you'd have no problem benching him. His free agency means keeping him costs many dozens of millions more to your cap space."
"Holy fuck, you‚Äôre actually sitting here and seriously arguing that 28 year old Boucher has more potential and that 23 year old Jarrett Allen is the one that has reached his ceiling?     For my own sanity I‚Äôm just gonna assume you‚Äôre a troll. I refuse to believe this is some serious arguments you‚Äôre using."
I‚Äôve made my argument. You think a 28 year old has more potential than a 23 year old. There‚Äôs no helping that.      Even as a raptors fan you should understand that Boucher was a focal point of our offence for a large part of the season before he started to cool off. Jarrett Allen doesn‚Äôt get the same offensive focus.    And this is without me even beginning to mention the difference defensively between the two. But I can already see you trying to argue ‚Äúbut but Boucher get a slot of blocks he‚Äôs a great defender!‚Äù
Stop making us raps fans look delusional we already get a bad rep    Chris Boucher Age: 28    Jarrett Allen Age: 23
"You can get better, I just dont think its with an impeding FA Jarrett Allen who you traded a 2025 Bucks 1st for in the first place.  But if you dont think hes the future, then there was no point wasting a 5th overall pick on him"
Jarrett Allen for OG Anunoby  Garland Sexton Okoro Anunoby Mobley  Suggs Vanvleet Trent Siakam Allen
It was rumoured to be $100/4 years   https://factoryofsadness.co/2021/05/19/cavs-jarrett-allen-may-not-worth-100-million-theres-no-choices/
Ah man I love me some Jarrett Allen.
How is Myles turner or Jarrett Allen snubbed for k love? They are garbage man
"I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player, but when you already have so much perimeter firepower, why not bring on another big (Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen)"
"KLove is probably a no. I wouldn't hate Larry Nance, Jarrett Allen and Okoro for CJ but that would make no sense for Cleveland."
They got the donuts and then threw the donuts away.   And by donuts I mean Jarrett fukin Allen
"I was surprised to find out that KAT plays for the Dominican Republic, really would prefer him to Love for adding size. Other people I think would fit better than Love include, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, and Mitchell Robinson."
"The truth is we didn‚Äôt want to overpay Jarrett Allen after this season, which is definitely what is going to happen. And we don‚Äôt want to be giving Levert 16-18 million a year. I don‚Äôt think the Rockets were ever intending to keep Oladipo, it was pretty clear from the start we were going to try to flip him. Our mistake with that trade was just Oladipo not being as valuable as we hoped. I doubt the Rockets regret not keeping Levert or Allen. We probably would‚Äôve been a better team and missed out on a high pick this year."
Personally I would prefer if Cleveland and Houston would kindly fumble this draft for Jarrett Allen and Christian Wood and let the Raptors take Mobley.
"No I wouldn't, and you're not getting my point. Nobody outside of GSW thought that KD going to the Warriors as a free agent was good for the league.  Imagine if Harden went to Brooklyn without Brooklyn having to give up most of their playoff core, and without them having to mortgage their future. Would you see a team with KD, Kyrie, Harden + Joe Harris, Levert, Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, and Taurean Prince as fair, especially if they had their first rounders every subsequent year?"
"It would have been different if the Warriors had to give up equal compensation, not just a high first rounder. Past-prime CP3 on one of the biggest contracts in the league, got a blossoming star in Oubre, a valuable vet in Rubio, two young players, and a first rounder.   KD, being well in his prime in 2016, would need a PG13 (Gallo + 5 1st rounders) or Harden (Levert, Jarrett Allen, 3 1st rounders, 4 1st round swaps) level of return to be traded for. The fact that the best team in the league was able to sign a top 3 player as a free agent is laughable, similar to if Lebron went to the Celtics in 2011 or if Kawhi went to the Lakers a couple years ago.  And no, Harrison Barnes wasn't seen as good enough for a max, he got $94 million over 4 years. Certainly a lot, but not a max. He also choked badly in the Finals (2 for 14, 0 for 8, 3 for 10 in the last three games), and was heavily ridiculed, similar to how Ben Simmons is right now.  The problem isn't that the Warriors were too good. It's that they were a great contending team with a homegrown core, until they went and upset the balance of the league by signing another top 3 player without having to give up significant parts of that core, or giving up their draft future."
"You all like Jarrett Allen right? Would you trade #3 for #6, #16, 18 and Kemba if we took on Love's contract for you? Not sure you want Kemba but if you got rid of Sexton or something elsewhere, then maybe Kemba isn't bad to have? idk i'm just throwing out stupid ideas right now trying to see how we can move up a few spots lol  Edit: Also Kemba and Love have similar contracts so might not be worth, but you get my point. Maybe we add something. But we could take Love for ya if you needed, so long as we move Kemba somewhere."
Nets almost traded Bojan Bogdanovic for Noel back in 2017.   Brooklyn ended up sending Bojan to the Wizards for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen instead.   Believe the trade broke down over draft compensation. Noel was also dealing with a bunch of off court stuff that made him look bad at the time like the reports of him trashing the house he rented.   Without the Wizard trade the Nets likely don‚Äôt get Harden since Allen wouldn‚Äôt be on the roster.   It‚Äôs the same kinda butterfly effect of OKC bailing on the Lopez for Reggie Jackson trade that eventually led to KD and Kyrie in Brooklyn.   OKC at the last second sends Reggie to Detroit who then Max him before his injuries instead of Brooklyn. Nets trade Lopez to LA for D‚ÄôLo which leads to them making the playoffs and become attractive to Free Agents.
Raptors would prefer Mobley over Green/Suggs? I am assuming the Cavs wouldn‚Äôt draft Mobley cuz they have Jarrett Allen. Might need a raptor fan to chime in.
"Yeah I seriously think that the Cavs are going to trade down - I could see them getting #5 and #8 from Orlando.   Sexland's height issues are very, very flawed but they have their young core already with them/Okoro/Nance/Jarrett Allen. Okoro definitely needs to learn how to shoot though."
"Not to be overly critical but not great. Green/Mobley would be big time,  Jarrett Allen and Okoro are cool, but quite frankly there's no future in their backcourt. They could be a fun team but realistically would never develop into a real contender if Sexland is the starting back court. I'd take a lot of teams young cores over theirs"
"sexton, garland and Okoro, and trading for Jarrett Allen, have been absolutely awful? how do you figure lmfao"
"All 3 of the Pistons, Rockets, and Cavs could draft Mobley and have him be a great fit for their roster. Mobley isn‚Äôt a paint scorer. He was like 10th percentile in post scoring last year. He‚Äôs a face-up, agile, rangy big man. He basically co-exists really well with all of Isiah Stewart, Christian Wood, and Jarrett Allen.  I think in the NBA it makes sense for him to start at the 4 and then play the 5 in spurts. Hell his comps have been AD, JJJ and neither of them play the 5 full time.   I think there‚Äôs a very slim chance he‚Äôs there at 4 for the Raptors. Imo he‚Äôs easily the 2nd best player in the draft and he‚Äôs also a good fit for the top 3.  Regardless though the top 4 is where you want to be in this draft. Suggs or Green is an amazing consolation prize for the Raps."
If I was Cleveland I'm not sure if I'd rather have Mobley on a rookie contract or Jarrett Allen making $25 mil a year. Allen is solid but he's kind of limited offensively. You could also probably get a good return on a sign and trade for Allen.
I was just kidding with the Brick Simmons I actually like Ben and think he can be great on the right team with a shooting center  However KPJ was likely a handshake deal due to us giving away Jarrett Allen lol he is worth far more than a pick in the 20s  Also we wouldn't have traded for KPJ if we had Simmons as he would have been our franchise guard
kpj wasnt even part of the harden trade unless youd call it a handshake deal for the nonsensical jarrett allen trade. and pick swaps dont exactly count as additional picks... just say ben sucks without the bullshit lol
There is a very real chance that he does. Rocket fans think they‚Äôre goin Green. That leaves Suggs and Mobley for the Cavs who like Jarrett Allen... it‚Äôs a pretty realistic possibility
"We have Jarrett Allen, I wouldn‚Äôt see us taking Mobley if he fell to third. I suppose you never know"
It has to be Myles turner or Jarrett Allen right. Both should make it over k love
"We‚Äôve gotten an 8th pick which was Brooklyn‚Äôs and two 5th picks.  We‚Äôve hardly tanked and we‚Äôre a pretty small market.  How were we supposed to be good now! We are outright lucky that Sexton is as good as he is, lucky that Garland is good, and lucky we got Jarrett Allen for nothing.  Other teams have tanked for much longer and really have less to speak for."
"Ayton, Turner, or Jarrett Allen at C"
"To be fair, just because I said the Cavs fit is the worst relative to the other lottery teams doesn't mean I think it's a bad fit to start with. Having Garland (most likely) as your back court partner and Jarrett Allen as your big man is a great start to your career. Just not super confident about the rest of the team in general."
"Problem is most good bigs don't play for Team USA, other than AD   Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, Sabonis, KAT, Ayton, Valanciunas, Vucevic, Capela are all international players. Unless you think Jarrett Allen is a better choice than Myles."
"Unless Jarrett Allen suddenly turns up with a 3-point shot, De'Aaron Fox is gonna tear all his hair out trying to run a pick&amp;roll with Allen and Simmons both being non-shooters"
PG: Fox  SG: Sexton  SF: MPJ  PF: Simmons  C: Jarrett Allen
Then who drafted Jarrett Allen?
"Sure, if you ignore Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie. Asume the Harden trade is never even made and Brooklyn beats the Bucks if they have Allen and LeVert, even if Dinwiddie and Kyrie are hurt. And would for better or worse be favored over Atlanta. But the trade did happen, and KD Kyrie and Harden are likely going to be title favorites for years to come"
I hope we let him walk and throw the max at Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen
"So far we got: KD, Harden, Dame, Beal, Tatum, Booker, Draymond.... anyone I‚Äôm missing? Also this team is gonna put up some serious numbers. Would love to see Jarrett Allen at the 5, or Wood."
Who is going to be abusing the guards? Sexton is no slouch on defense in fact I'd say he's above average along with Jarrett Allen.
"Is crazy, at the same time people celebrating that Jarrett Allen contract. I'd much rather have Duncan Robinson on this deal honestly"
Jarrett Allen does that to a bball fan. Wholesome as ayy eff.
"Literally just need someone tall who can dunk and stand in the paint, give me Jarrett Allen"
I just don't get why we didn't bring in a legit center? Someone like Jarrett Allen would have been nice
Man I really wish Jarrett Allen hadn‚Äôt been eligible for a new contract this summer
No one is talking about so I will.   Jarrett Allen! Let‚Äôs go Cavs!
IKR MAN! In the NFL superstar rarely make good money other than Qb's.   Aaron Donald the best defensive player in the league for a long time signed a 6 yr 135 mill contract. Roughly 22.5 mill. Thats how much Lonzo/ Jarrett allen makes in the nba. If u take donalds value to his team and compare it to Allen or Ball's its MUCH MORE VALUE for much LESS MONEY.
Jarrett allen was near the top of the league in fg%
"What's not to like about the Cavs off-season? Drafted a player that fits perfectly into their big man rotation, resigned Jarrett Allen, those guards will be better with another year. I think they go just under .500. And I think the Wizards are a worse team than they were last year, but still better than the Raptors. They got a lot of good role players to run with Beal, I think they're still not a playoff contender, but they have the best player between the Raptors and Wizards. Raptors just flat out got worse, and they weren't that good last year"
Actually a reasonable deal. Makes the 5-year/100M deal for Jarrett Allen look even worse.
would much rather have Holmes on this deal than Jarrett Allen on his
Almost Half the price of Jarrett Allen
"really?  I think it is quite good for his level of production  he's more productive than tim hardaway jr who just got signed for about the same amount of money but this one is more team-friendly with a 4th year team option  don't know why boston didn't re-sign him since a deal like this can be packaged as part of a big deal for a superstar.   nets only had to give up caris levert and jarrett allen + picks and they got harden.  even if he just stays at the level he's been at the last few years this is a very moveable contract that makes it less likely we would have to include RJ barrett as part of a big package for a superstar  I see boston fans didn't like his defense but hey thibs seems to get the best out of everyone on that end so I'm not really sweating it, our guys played great defense last year and almost all of them are coming back"
"yes we need to prove to the NBA and prospective players that we aren't a trash fire anymore and we have competent people steering the ship  i'm not gonna be like oh now we are favorites for the ECF or like now we can trade fournier for zion williamson or anything like that  but if some huge name star gets grumpy where they're at.. well harden got traded for caris lavert, jarrett allen and a bunch of picks  this makes it easier to put together a good trade package that doesn't include RJ or randle..  fournier + toppin + burks + 4 first round picks should buy you almost anyone in the league (who is available) if these are the going rates"
&gt;	shows signs of potentially being a stretch 5  ? Genuinely curious what signs he‚Äôs showing that‚Äôs he‚Äôs a stretch 5. [His shot chart shows he lives in the paint](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jarrett-allen-shot-chart) and he shot a total of 19 threes last year.
"At this point, Jarrett Allen had a better age 22 season than Clint Capela and furthermore, Allen shows signs of potentially being a stretch 5, which would make him infinitely more valuable than Clint Capela.  I'd rather have a 23 year old Jarrett Allen on 5/100 than 26 year old Clint Capela on 5/90."
He‚Äôs nowhere close to as good as it gets defensively. Lmao do you watch any basketball besides the cavs because it gets a lot better than Jarrett Allen
Something about Norm getting less than Jarrett Allen doesn't sit well with me
Apparently Jarrett Allen of people think a rim running center like him is worth 100m. He is like 10-15% better than dudes that sign for the minimum
Just wanna say that Jarrett Allen is underrated as hell
"If you‚Äôre like, in the 60th percentile of nba players, youre making over 20mil per now (like Jarrett Allen)"
Anyone that hates Jarrett Allen hates greatness
jarrett allen massive overpay
"Jarrett Allen is 23, he‚Äôs a lot easier to move than Kevin Love"
that would be a dumb way to use jarrett allen  those two combined for like 40 threes with the cavs in their last seasons there lol
Alright seeing a much younger jarrett allen get 20 mil makes me realize how outlandish 20 mil for fournier would be
"Ok good luck with that. There‚Äôs 3 factors at play here: 1- How good is he, 2- Wven if he‚Äôs good, it could be (probably will be) a very bad idea to play 2 7-footers in today‚Äôs game:   The last part; which of course a team can‚Äôt think TOO much about, is this: the top 3 players for 2022 are all bigs. So if they get a chance to get Chet Holmgren, Paulo Blanchero, or Jalen Duren (likely reclassifying), Jarrett Allen immediately becomes dead weight"
"Jarrett Allen isn't part of the Cavs long term plans, they'll move him for someone who fits"
Lmao at people praising this deal but criticizing the Jarrett Allen one. This is a horrendous deal.
"Just because you can play him alongside Jarrett Allen, doesn't mean you should.  Just because Anthony Davis can play alongside Dwight Howard doesn't mean he should.  Just because Chris Bosh can play alongside Joel Anthony doesn't mean he should.  Just because Al Horford can play alongside Joel Embiid doesn't mean he should."
"Yes, but did Jarrett Allen dominate Tim Duncan in the playoffs?"
Enjoy not being in the playoffs after paying Jarrett Allen 20 million dollars next year.
That‚Äôs Jarrett Allen on one less year money
Jarrett Allen 5/100mil üòÇü§£üò≠üò≠  These teams are so stubborn. Still paying non shooting 5‚Äôs despite. Still insisting on antiquated  PF/C lineups.
Highest paid centers in the league today:  1. Rudy Gobert (3x DPOY)  2. Karl-Anthony Towns (2x All-Star)  3. Nikola Jokic (MVP)  4. Joel Embiid (4x All-Star)  5. Jarrett Allen
"If I was Jarrett Allen I would take $100 and not leave Cleveland either. Sucks for Cleveland, Happy for Allen"
Actually for this Jarrett Allen one Shams tweeted it at the exact same second. Only this one got posted to /r/nba
"&gt; Is that biting you in the ass because it was a bad decision or just unlucky?   Both.  Collins being injured all the time isn't Olshey's fault.  We'd absolutely be a better team if Collins could actually play.    However, going 2-for-1 in a deep draft on a fairly risky pick (Collins wasn't considered an NBA prospect out of HS, didn't start at Gonzaga, and half of his games were against crappy WCC teams).  Its not even clear that we couldn't have snagged Collins at 15, and if not our consolation prizes looked pretty good.    I agree with you that Portland might be 1 move away from being a genuine contender, but that 2017 draft was a massive missed opportunity where Portland could have had Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG.  Any one of those guys would have been a really big deal for us and it didn't happen.    Also there is the 25 pick where we grabbed Swanigan, who is out of the league, who got followed up with Kuzma, Bradley, White, and Josh Hart.    That draft was a complete mess for Portland, and Collins' being constantly turned it into a disaster.  I also think Olshey deserves a ton of criticism for the 2016 offseason where we threw giant contracts at Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard, and Harkless, tying up our money for years.    All said and done, I don't think Olshey is a complete idiot, and there are certainly worse GMs in the league.  I just don't think he's capable of putting together a championship team and there is plenty of criticism that can be launched at him."
"Mfers just say anything, jarrett allen can‚Äôt shoot"
his shot chart looks like this: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jarrett-allen-shot-chart  spoiler: he's shot 85 threes his entire career!
Nerlens the last 5 years is at 71% at the line.  Jarrett Allen career? .696
I think you can live with Jarrett Allen at 20 mil a year in a vacuum but it doesn‚Äôt make sense when you drafted Evan Mobley and you know he‚Äôs your center of the future
Jarrett Allen can shoot. He shot 31% from 3 w the Cavs.
"If they get dimwiddie back I‚Äôm not sure they can be beat.  This dude almost took the nets to playoffs a few years back when it was just him, Jarrett Allen, levert, and joe Harris.  I can‚Äôt imaging him coming off the bench!"
If this is the common belief than Jarrett Allen is underrated. He's what Drummond should've been his entire career.
Holy fuck that is a lot of money for Jarrett Allen
"Dallas needs to bring back THJ and offer Norman Powell a max and try to lure him from Portland. Then call the Cavs and try to swap KP for Jarrett Allen. In my opinion, this would be the best option for Dallas. But it's not gonna happen."
One Jarrett Allen please.
"First of all, even without taking Dragic, there's like 24m in cap space for the raptors before they sign GTJ for 16ish, Barnes for 7ish, and the other roster spots. Then we can use MLE for 10m. What C are you gonna sign as a FA thats between 10-24m? Either Jarrett Allen or Holmes pretty much. So if they know they aren't getting Allen or Holmes, they might as well just sign someone using MLE, take on Dragic, then you get Precious who might be a decent C in the future and a 1st.   Again, I can't stress enough that we are only aiming for playoffs this year and Dragic is expiring. It really doesn't hurt us to take him on for this season if we had no other use for the cap space."
I want this to happen so the Rockets Front Office looks even dumber for passing on Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert
Maybe try to sign Jarrett Allen ?
Signing a center for one. Raptors are interested in jarrett allen and sure cavs will probably match but for the off chance they dont
"Getting something decent back in a Lowry sign and trade, and making a hard run at Lonzo or Jarrett Allen"
"In no particular order:  1. We waive or trade Hood + Baynes for a future second  2. We sign Jarrett Allen for 72-80m/4 years (Holmes would be a backup if the Cavs match our offer) to resolve our team's major center issues  3. We sign and trade Lowry to get Precious and a future 1st from the Heat.  What about Dragic, you may ask?  4. We off-load Dragic to the Pelicans, Mavs or Knicks for either cash or a future second  5. We re-sign Trent for 15-18m for 4 years  6. Masai Ujiri is officially re-signed"
"The assumption would be that it gets us at least one asset like Precious Achiuwa or a first round pick. Maybe both if we can bargain hard enough. Then they can try to flip Dragic to another team. Or maybe they‚Äôve figured out that the guys they‚Äôre targeting in free agency with big offers (Jarrett Allen, Lonzo Ball are rumored examples) are going elsewhere. So then Dragic is a solid vet on an expiring deal that can be moved at the deadline to a team that wants to add some depth for the playoffs."
the jarrett allen trade claims another casualty
I don't think we drafted Jones with the expectation that he's ready to play year 1. I think it makes the most sense for us to bring back Monk and Devonte and go after cheaper backup with the MLE. Letting Monk walk leaves us with a decent amount of space but not enough to pursue anybody worthwhile like Richuan Holmes/Jarrett Allen.
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"&gt; Jokic-Truther-Guy hype aside  I mean, if there's one thing Hart can do it's pass. Jokic is a tall mountain to climb but he sees the game in the same way. Sign him and forget you ever heard about Jarrett Allen."
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."
"Minnesota should be on the list for John Collins (S+T), but I bet he re-signs with Atlanta too.    My prediction is Minnesota will sign or trade for a F/C that no one thinks they‚Äôll get.  Could sign JaMychal Green to the MLE, could trade for Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Jonathan Isaac, etc.     Something is definitely in the works."
Jarrett Allen/Noel/Holmes/Bobby last but only because the raptors could use a center
1. Jarrett Allen  2. Richuan Holmes  3. Nerlens Noel 4. Bobby Portis
Jarrett Allen is the best player there so probably him
Can we use that TPE to sign a free agent (e.g. Jarrett Allen)?
"I don‚Äôt know man, I think we need to see what Jarrett and Allen wants."
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"Well there are multiple kinds of expiring contracts that have different valuations depending.  Also, Love is not an expiring contract as it currently stands. With 2yrs 60mil left, it is a current albatross. Love would be desirable for a team looking to clear space for a possible 23 FA run.   But you say ‚Äúhow does that help the dumb cavs stupid‚Äù?  Well, the answer is that depends on the market and where the current 22-23 cavs would stand (or any team in a similar position). It could allow them to flip love for either a 2-3 year deal for players that the rebuilding team wants to clear who are of reasonable quality OR players coming up as RFA who the team isn‚Äôt sure about paying big money too OR a salary dump for bad contracts with draft picks attached.   But of course, the other type of ‚Äúexpiring‚Äù contract is the one mentioned in part 2 above. The RFA that the team may not or would not be able to match. Jarrett Allen is an example from last season. Collin Sexton is becoming one for this. This also occurs when the Supermax comes into play.   Although the value of expiring contracts is cyclical due to the large jump in the cap in the mid 2000s combined with the newer trend of elite players to take the ‚Äúhometown pay increase‚Äù, and although this trend is leading to decrease currently in said value, to say they don‚Äôt have any value is not entirely accurate."
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
"I think if we stay over the cap we get the non-taxpayer exception, so 9.2M to start in the first year. Won't get Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen, but Olynyk or Theis maybe, and we will need the shooting for damn sure.  Also, it's possible we could do something like Jarrett Allen sign and trade for Hood, Boucher and Malachi Flynn, that would get us up to being able to offer low 20s a year with max increases."
"Jarrett Allen, as least during his time in Cleveland, was not that good on defense. He is big, but skinny and kinda slow. He was out of position a lot and didn't bring a ton of energy on that end. The other personnel and scheme on the floor didn't help much either, and the whole team was pretty bad on defense after Larry Nance was injured.   I was looking into some of the advanced stats a little while back - I think dunks and threes had him ranked as the 41st defensive center. If the Raps really want to have a good defense, they should try to get Poeltl back from San Antonio or sign Nerlens Noel."
"Spurs better make a run at Jarrett Allen. Otherwise, what's the point of this offseason?"
"Lakers should try to get Rose, Tucker and Milsap to come over for vet min deals to win a ring and offer Reggie Bullock or Doug McDermott the MLE. Then try to S&amp;T Schroeder for Lauri Markkanen or Jarrett Allen."
The Nets traded their future away for Harden. I would've liked to see more of Jarrett Allen progressing throughout his career but we gave him up.
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
"We still dont have a NBA starting calibre C, unless we get lucky and somehow land nerlans noel or Jarrett allen, and we also dont know the future of lowry on the raps. I dont think were gonma try to tank, but anything higher than 8th seed would be surprising"
Do we even have cap space for Jarrett allen
Nets need Jarrett Allen back.
"Concerned how he and Jarrett Allen mesh. Doesn‚Äôt seem sensible to drop Allen because we have no other depth outside him and Mobley. He has upside, but I‚Äôm concerned about the dynamic. We just got bad luck that there was a lack of PF‚Äôs and SF‚Äôs this draft and were forced to pick depth"
"Nice, hope Jarrett Allen gets sent to Detroit to make a nice young core around Cade/Allen."
I mean Allen is a RFA and Mobley is a good enough shooter to play next to Allen for stretches. Really not that big a deal. Mobley was the best player left on the board and you don't pass on that guy because of Jarrett Allen lol.
Bye bye Jarrett Allen I guess
"Cleveland has imagined USC 7-footer Evan Mobley playing on a frontline with Jarrett Allen; some four-man, some five. Cavaliers believe he's a franchise player. Teams tried to trade up to three, but Cavaliers are keeping it."
They have some players in Sexton and Garland.   Jarrett Allen us a positive asset. Personally I‚Äôm not all the way sold on him but I think he‚Äôs pretty formidable. Obviously an Evan Mobley lifts that ceiling up.   But other than that. They don‚Äôt have anything too awesome.
Oh we will. Rubio is exactly what we needed and I think he can help develop our young guys a lot. We embraced Jarrett Allen instantly and I think the same will happen with Rubio. He'll be in good hands in CLE!
Don‚Äôt pass up highly touted possibly generational talent because you already have Jarrett Allen.
"They should absolutely take Mobley IMO. Jarrett Allen is not good enough to dictate the pick. If Green falls to them, I think they should consider moving to 6, but they can easily take him and figure out things with Sexton as well"
U dont give a shit if mobley doesnt work with fucking jarrett allen. If it doesn't then you move Allen
"I‚Äôm hoping for Mobley at 4. With the reasoning for the Cavs that they don‚Äôt see Sexton in their future, have Garland and Suggs run the guard positions and plan on keeping Jarrett Allen as their big."
"Collin Sexton, Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, and a couple lottery protected picks"
"My comment on a similar post:  The Nets started 2-0 and would add Curry and Tatum.  Their next two games were close losses to Charlotte and Memphis (who entered 0-2, bye bye 2 best players). So the Nets would win, but not add stars.  Game 5 would be a big showdown against the 3-0 Hawks (+Lavine, Valanciunas or Brooks, and the Pistons 3rd best).  Irving/Curry/Durant/Tatum/Jordan starting but Jarrett Allen still on the team, vs.  Young/Lavine/Hunter/Collins/Valanciunas  I say the Nets win that game, get Trae, and that's as far as I want to go... A different superteam would probably develop to the same level, leading to massive regular season games between the two."
"As a Cavs fan, gotta say the Kyrie to Boston deal. At the time (and even the season following the deal) it appeared that the Cavs had lost the trade pretty badly. Isaiah barely played, Crowder was awful, and the pick ended up falling to 8.   But the Cavs picked Sexton and got LNJ and Clarkson for assets from the original Kyrie deal. Sexton looks promising and LNJ is a big part of our core. Clarkson was eventually turned into Jarrett Allen.   Meanwhile, after two miserable seasons in Boston, Kyrie left without winning them a thing.   Not a massive win, but a win nonetheless."
Why do you want Mobley when you have Jarrett Allen? Would you trade Allen if you were to draft Mobley?
I love Jarrett Allen but I would do that trade 10/10 times.
https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/08/why-ben-simmons-caris-levert-and-jarrett-allen-werent-fits-in-houston/
Has potential to actually be pretty good too. At least what Jarrett Allen is now.
Cavs might pass on Mobley since they are likely to resign Jarrett Allen and Sexton might be on the move.  But we'll have to wait til tomorrow.
Probably but you have to remember that the Rockets technically got 5 picks when you consider the Jarrett Allen flip so its still 4 v 5.
Dumping Larry Nance so you can give Jarrett Allen $100 mil how is this even real.
Jarrett Allen is also better than capela
idk if ive ever seen Rui love that wasn't like weird fetishization  and idk if ive ever seen a non hawks fan hype up reddish. which like yeah fans are gonna be homers lol  jarrett allen one is true as hell tho
"Rui, Reddish, Jarrett Allen"
No one on that roster is even above average save for Jarrett Allen‚Ä¶you‚Äôre living in the past with Markannen and KLove. Cedi is horrible. Only one who‚Äôs worth anything on that roster is Allen‚Ä¶are you a cavs fan? Lol. Only a cavs fan would think these pieces are great
This scout thought Cavs should've kept Drummond instead of Jarrett Allen? Confirmed this moron is bad at his job.
Did this guy really say Cleveland‚Äôs problem was not keeping Andre Drummond and getting Jarrett Allen instead? What a clown.
"&gt; I thought they were on the right track last year until they traded for Jarrett Allen and basically told Drummond we're not bringing you back, because defensively they were hanging around that top 10 area ‚Ä¶   Is the scout saying he thinks they got worse on defence with Allen instead of Drummond??"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"the guy is wrong lol Jarrett Allen was traded because of the Harden trade, Atkinson wasn't even coach anymore"
Zero hassle? The Nets traded Jarrett Allen because Atkinson was playing him over Jordan and then fired Atkinson that off-season all to accommodate Jordan. It wasn't until Jordan proved beyond a shadow of any doubt that he was totally washed up that the Nets released him.

"And thats what management is probably saying. If I was aytons team I would say ""No, these rookie extensions come from players being paid based on potential. The top 5 centers in the league all get paid maxes, and before my extension is over I will be a top 5 center""    If Jarrett Allen could sign a deal worth $20M a year, then if I am aytons agent I think I could get him $25M/yr.    To your point, you might be right that he isn't worth it. But the question shouldn't be ""is DeAndre worth 25m/yr?"" But instead ""are you willing to let him find out if another team would offer him $25m/yr"" thats why all these extensions get paid. How is a team that was shit just a short couple years ago going to tell their fans that they are going to be shit again because they didnt want to be cheated out of 5M a year?"
"And they got him for basically Jarrett Allen and some really bad picks.  If KD is healthy and stays until his career ends, it is more likely that the Rockets get just like 3 or 4 late 20's picks from this trade."
Mvp Darius Garland  MIP Kevin Love   Dpoy Jarrett Allen   6moty Ricky Rubio   Roty Evan Mobley
Ayton is not so much better than non-max players like Jarrett Allen and John Collins that he is a clear max guy.
"Zach Collins.  Blazers traded up for him and he was pretty much a complete whiff.  Also painful considering who went after him (Donovan Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen)."
Steven Adams &amp; Jarrett Allen too. And maybe JV.
"That draft will haunt my dreams forever. Portland picked Zach Collins with Bam, Mitchell, OG, John Collins, and  Jarrett Allen still on the board."
Makes me miss the nerdy big man era so much more. Brook Lopez and Jarrett Allen would never put up with this jabroni.
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9‚Äô0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn‚Äôt as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6‚Äô1.25 H, 8‚Äô1 SR), Keon Johnson (6‚Äô3.5 height, 8‚Äô1 SR), Jericho Simms (6‚Äô9 H, 8‚Äô10 SR), Jalen Harris (6‚Äô2.75 H - 8‚Äô1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6‚Äô10 H, 9‚Äô1 SR), Tyler Bey(6‚Äô6 H, 8‚Äô9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
"Yeah, he also had a 9‚Äô0 standing reach and a 36 inch standing vert.  Edit: That‚Äôs better than a lot of rim runners in today‚Äôs game, like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, etc."
Maybe just the first one - I got in an argument with him on the Cavs sub where he was trying to say that Hartenstein was a better defender than Jarrett Allen.
This didn't list any options. All it said was they can find and develop young guys as they did with Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert while also acknowledging they traded away every pick they could for Harden.  The only option it listed was plugging Cam Thomas into Kyries minutes lol
Jarrett Allen is making $20 million per season.  Houston didn't have to pay him. That's a W.
I still think it was a shitty deal for Harden. U guys  really traded Levert for Olidipo and basically got nothing. Then traded Jarrett Allen for a first round pick which is kinda of an ass deal.   U guys were already getting KPJ and u guys didn‚Äôt capitalize on Harden besides the picks. The picks are good but still felt like u could of done way better. I like the Rockets tho because of Jalen Green so I want y‚Äôall to succeed. You guys have a good young core the best actually.
Pre-max contract Jarrett Allen would've blocked that. He sold out üòû
If we can make him healthy I'd trade Wiggs + our young ones for Jarrett Allen in the mix of a Ben Simmons trade.
Jarrett Allen already tired of getting dunked on this year.
"Maybe if OPJ outperforms...we could slide him in the starting lineup and get Jarrett Allen?  Im thinking a 3-4 way trade in the Simmons sweespstakes, we trade Wiggs and 2 of our young guys + picks for TJ Warren and Jarrett Allen."
"We need a center. I was thinking being in the mix of a three way or a four way trade with the Simmons sweepstakes that would net us Jarrett Allen and a 3 and D wing. We could offload Wiggs and yes, one of our young guys but hopefully we get a good deal. Otherwise Im okay with being stagnant but I dont think we'd be that lethal without a legit center."
"I'm looking to trade for Jarrett Allen but it could sacrifice Andrew Wiggins and I'm not sure if its worth it. Like JA raises our ceiling but Wiggs could come crucial in the playoffs because the Western Conference is wings heavy and we need Kawhi stoppers, LeBron stoppers."
Poor Jarrett Allen got caught in the cross fire
"""Either way you're going to be in a highlight"" - Jarrett Allen talking about going up to block any dunk he can"
Jarrett Allen helped him stay in the air too lol
"Because we have no other choices. No one wants to play in Cleveland, and we don‚Äôt have the money to sign any good forwards because we have love‚Äôs $120m contract and just signed Jarrett Allen to a $100m deal, and we‚Äôre going to have to pay garland and sexton soon also.   Cedi was shooting (not sure if he ended the season with the title) the lowest fg% in the nba last year through like 75% of the season. He is a bad shooter, can‚Äôt handle the ball, and isn‚Äôt a good defender. He has good spirit, but that‚Äôs about it."
When Jarrett Allen woke up today I don‚Äôt think he expected to learn what John Collin‚Äôs taint smells like.
"John Collins just submitted his adoption papers for Jarrett Allen, congrats to Allen for finding a forever home ü•∫"

"I mean, he listed Jarrett Allen"
"Lmao you were wrong in almost everything you said  &gt;Jared Allen  Think you meant Jarrett Allen, unless you are indeed talking about the former Viking's defensive end  &gt;Similar stats  Ayton is leaps and bounds a better offensive player. Last year was his lowest PPG at 14.4, compared to Allen who has never cracked 13 PPG in a season. 2 years ago Ayton was over 18. And he was at 15.8 in the playoffs. His advanced stats last year are also better than Allen's.  &gt;8-10 mill better is a pretty decent role player that you'd lose  That's not really how you can look at cap space unless teams are under the cap, which the Suns are not ($128M in active contracts right per Spotrac). Signing him with Bird rights doesn't really mean you lose out on the extra cap space he's taking up. It means the owner has to spend more, but since the Suns will be over the cap it doesn't mean if they give him $20M/year instead of $30M/year that they have an extra $10M/year in free agency. Also, they have their team's core really locked up and set for the next few years anyway. Booker-Paul-Crowder-Saric-Payne-Johnson are all locked up through 22-23 at the earliest, with Ayton-Bridges-Shamet all RFAs. That's a pretty set top-9, not even considering if someone like Jalen Smith pan out.  &gt;small market where money matters to sign guys  Phoenix is not a small market. With CP3 there, and after their performance last year, they should have no problem getting ring chasers if they have another good showing in the playoffs this year. Phoenix is a good NBA city - not first tier like LA, NYC, or MIA, but definitely a 2nd tier NBA city with places like Houston. They've struggled to sign guys in the past because of their ownership and how bad they've been, not because of their location."
"Cavs have drafted 8, 8, 5 and 3 over the last four seasons and gotten Sexton, Garland, Okoro and Mobley out of it. Arguably, we have done better with this not-great draft capital than when we had three \#1 picks in four years. We also got Jarrett Allen for what will essentially be a second-round pick (Milwaukee's first-rounder next year). Beilein was a ""who cares?"" mistake that was *quickly* corrected, and Koby hasn't pissed away any assets to get rid of Kevin Love when there's no reason at all to do it.  I don't know what else people expect of a GM in this kind of situation. I also think he's done a fantastic job, but I would expect onlookers to at least think he's done *OK* and is not worthy of being fired and replaced with ... whom? And what is that whom supposed to do differently other than draft as well as you can and not make pointless short-term trades?"
"You could probably convince me that Jarrett Allen is 5'11"" if he shaved his head"
"&gt;consistent DPOY candidate to justify a max  I mean Rudy Gobert is a consistent DPOY candidate and he is a supermax player.  The max for a young player this year is $28m.  Towns will make around $31m.  Bam Adebayo makes about $28m.  Jarrett Allen will make aroudn $20m this season (his contract is flat though, important caveat).  I mean maybe  you could argue Ayton is closer to Allen than the others. but I don't think I would agree.  I'd say he and Adebayo are pretty close.  The only convincing argument that there's a lot of daylight between them IMO is the rarity of Adebayo's skills - the playmaking and excellent 1-5 switchability.  Maybe that's enough to say he's in a different category than Ayton even if he's strictly worse in the other areas, I mean idk.  Given how bad the Suns were for the last decade and how difficult it was to come down with two high level prospects in Booker and Ayton, I say just pay the man.   If this goes on too long and he loses patience and decides to force his way out, it's going to be hard to justify to fans that the sticking point was like $5m a season."
"&gt; Collins didn‚Äôt get a max, Jarrett Allen didn‚Äôt get a max. We‚Äôll see  were those guys #1 picks though"
"Sure his postseason was good, but regular season has he been better than Jarrett Allen? Everyone was saying Allen was an overpay at 20M, they are both 22yo, so 20M for Ayton doesn't seem crazy.   I like both of them, but they haven't show Trae production or MPJ potential."
"How do you all consider Ayton as compared to Jarrett Allen? Seems to me like Allen has somewhat better stats except for fewer points on fewer attempts, and they're about the same age. We just got pilloried for giving Allen $20 million a year - is Ayton worth so much more than that on a max extension?  Note: I am not criticizing Ayton or praising Allen, comparatively. I am legitimately wondering what people think their true values are, because I really don't know given the seeming slide towards irrelevance of the ""traditional"" center."
"I guess they might do that and see what happens. Collins didn‚Äôt get a max, Jarrett Allen didn‚Äôt get a max. We‚Äôll see  I think it‚Äôs dangerous to have all your cap space tied up in 4 players when not one of them is a top 10 player like the Nuggets and Lakers and Nets  And I think as Chris Paul declines, he was instrumental to that team, and I‚Äôm unsure Booker, Ayton, Bridges and 38 year old Paul are still contenders."
&gt;  A rookie max extension is given to basically anyone with all-star potential nowadays.  I think the John Collins and Jarrett Allen deals gives the Suns some leverage. High level shot creators get paid.  But a lot of other guys on the level of Jaylen Brown and Domantas Sabonis did not get maxed.
"It is for shot creators, but Ayton's number may be pegged differently based on what John Collins and Jarrett Allen just got.   Allen got $20, Collins got around $25.  Ayton is worth more than those guys, but not by a lot. They probably want to give him a near max number but not tie him to % of cap."
"He would definitely get a max on the open market.  I mean, Jarrett Allen just got 100 million.  Vucevic is getting 25 mil a year.  He would have a max offer one minute into free agency."
"Fair point and in the Bazley draft, it's not like we passed up on anyone significant in the 20s so it's ok. It was a meh draft beyond the top 5.  In the TFerg draft, OG and Jarrett Allen were good picks after Ferg"
JARRETT IS MY GOAT!    ALLEN FRO THE WIN!
"[Here is a more detailed article on the final year of his program.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/nets/2020/11/26/nets-jarrett-allen-creative-continue-thanksgiving-kids-grocery-event/6417017002/)  Yeah, the Cavs got a good person.  Hope he does well in Cleveland."
Crazy how he makes jarrett allen look small lmao.
Lmao this makes Jarrett Allen look small
"Giannis, Capela, Jarrett Allen, and Dwight Howard"
We got Jarrett Allen for Dante Exum and the Bucks pick.
"If you agree elaborate on your thoughts. What makes him worse than someone like Jarrett Culver, Dennis Smith Jr., or Elfrid Payton on offense? Be specific.   Alvin Robertson, Bruce Bowen, Andre Roberson, Tony Allen - all of these guys were TERRIBLE on offense, yet still played plenty of minutes because of their all league defense. You would think that the worst defensive team in the league could find a consistent spot in the rotation for an all league level defender, even if it was just 20 minutes a night.  I‚Äôm also still waiting for someone to actually SPEAK to his game. What does he do in particular on defense that makes him so good? What do you like about his on ball defense? His off ball defense? How does he handle switches? What does he do defensively in transition that stands out?   What in particular about his offense not only makes him bad, but the ‚Äúworst offensive guard in the league‚Äù? It‚Äôs all fun and games until you ask people to actually provide descriptions of the players they want to make blanket statements about."
"Nash had organized the birthday wishes with the blessing of owner Joe Tsai, who was a great fan of Stevland Hardaway Morris. Tsai had hired Nash largely on his impromptu rendition of ""Isn't She Lovely"" during his interview, and agreed that birthday wishes would bring passion and a sense of community to the team. Little did he know that Nash would have the rookies wheeled to various team meetings, practices, and weight training sessions, where he enjoyed singing music from Cats. Occasionally Nash would accost players and staffers in the hall, having blocked the way with Birthday wishes, and demand that they guess whatever tune he was playing. Jarrett Allen so rarely recognized the work of Patty Hill that Nash traded him at the first opportunity."
"He is very good, but I think the outcome the Cavs want here is that they settle on a contract not toooo far above what Jarrett Allen was paid."
Cleveland has reported to been shopping him and Jackson has big injury issues.  John Collins and Jarrett Allen didn‚Äôt get maxes.  Mikal bridges won‚Äôt get the max either
"I think a Simmons/Sexton combo makes more sense, because Garland isn't great off the ball at this point in his career. The Mobley/Simmons pairing might also be a bit clunky offensively unless Mobley is ready to shoot right away. Same with Jarrett Allen and Okoro.   All of that said, the Cavs should be interested in Simmons because it is hard for a small market team to get a player that good."
And? None of those guys are elite assets. Arguably the best trade piece would be the 1st. A core of Garland/Simmons/Mobley is young and can be built around. The one issue is the fit with Jarrett Allen but you don't avoid trading for a player like Simmons because of his fit with a role player.
I‚Äôm just glad we can all agree that Jarrett Allen is not the C he wants.
"If he doesn‚Äôt want 2nd place, I guess Jarrett Allen can have it"
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough‚Ä¶ seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I‚Äôd say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he‚Äôs already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"&gt; He averaged 17 a game in the playoffs, 80% of 17 is 13.6. Excuse me, it is way, way, way easier to find a 13.6 ppg spot up shooter than it is someone that can bring 80% of what Ayton does on defense      Its funny because even when you use a super small sample size to make that statistical argument there still aren't forwards who give you 80% of Porter's production on similar efficiency.       Also you're overestimating Aytons defense, you act like he's Gobert or something.     &gt;  and that‚Äôs not even taking into account that Ayton averaged 1 less ppg on better efficiency in the playoffs      You're not taking into account how important spacing is. We see year after year some random low usage lob catching big lead the league in field goal percentage, its not the accomplishment you think it is. No one considers Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, or Jarrett Allen to be great offensive players. That's just what happens when you take most of your shots in the paint as a roll man."
"do you have this one where he makes some iso dribble and concludes with a step back midrange ? I don't remember well, but he did it being guarded by Jarrett Allen (not sure which team he played against). It was this season btw. It was fun to watch (Jojo is fun to watch in general)."
Jarrett Allen needs to lose the ‚Äòfro.
Jarrett Allen with the ninja style headband.. iconic.
Whatever Jarrett Allen got.
"His 3 pt shooting was the same it was in college, bad. His FG% overall got worse as well, he's looking well on his way to being a bust and trading for Ben Simmons and Jarrett Allen means you're aiming for the playoffs not trying to rebuild and hope Lebron signs a contract for his 8th prime."
"There‚Äôs no need to be aggressive. You shouldn‚Äôt attempt to discuss basketball if you‚Äôre going to get defensive over someone disagreeing with you.  Yes I understand that Steph and Klay play a huge part in Draymond‚Äôs playmaking. But following that same logic, considering the Cavs wouldn‚Äôt have anyone near Steph or Klay in that regard (and no, Garland won‚Äôt be close), then that would mitigate how impactful Simmons can be as a half court playmaker.  &gt;On Philly you have Joel camped in the paint the majority of the game and multiple bodies down low to limit his game‚Ä¶  I fail to see how a lineup consisting of Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen offers *more* spacing than a lineup consisting of Seth Curry and Joel Embiid. Curry is a much better shooter than Garland, and Embiid at least shoots the three a little where Allen doesn‚Äôt at all. In fact, a starting lineup with Simmons, Allen and Mobley might just be the worst spacing lineup in the league. There offence would almost certainly be last in the league."
"Jarrett Allen has been out sick, Markkenan has been in Covid protocols,  Mobley has a sprained elbow,  Sexton has a torn meniscus,  Cedi hurt his back and  Lamar Stevens has a knee injury"
"Hey Cavs fans, since you guys obviously don‚Äôt need Jarrett Allen wanna send him our way?? Pretty please?"
"How in the fuck are we outrebounding the Warriors without Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, and Lauri Markannen? Like literally how?"
If nets don‚Äôt win a championship‚Ä¶.at what point do you regret giving away Dinwiddie and Jarrett Allen
If only he was 4-5 inches taller he'd be making Jarrett Allen money.
Jarrett Allen looked amazing _in_ Brooklyn.
"I feel like you could say this about most young players that are traded by teams looking to contend. Jarrett Allen looks pretty amazing after being traded out of Brooklyn. Young players on an upward trajectory + larger role on a worse team = player blossoming, generally. Not always though."
I miss Jarrett Allen :(
"I'm very lucky that I only saw 2 and a half quarters of last night's game and then was on the train home from work for when things took the turn they did.  Sad for my friends who are at the game (I'm at work again) who were probably looking forward to seeing Jarrett Allen back at Barclays =\. Next time, I guess.  Anyway, as usual...  *Let's Go Nets!*  **BROOKLYN!!!**"
Oh yeah losing Jarrett Allen was also bad.
"If Spencer &amp; Jarrett Allen make the All-Star team, I might actually scream."
"Last I saw, Jarrett Allen and Lauri Markannen are hurt, so they needed to give significant minutes to Tacko Fall.   So....  Kinda?"
"well, 2. Better option would have been (i know there was no way to know this outcome would happen) to just trade Kyrie and a pick or two for Harden. Could have afforded Jarrett Allen and more, Harden and Durant with Allen would have been dope."
&gt; The nets need a big man whose a lob threat to open up harden's p&amp;r game.  Jarrett Fucking Allen
What happened to Jarrett Allen?
Jarrett Allen won an eastern conference player of the week and the seasons only been going on like 3 weeks. If you‚Äôre the best player for 1/3 of the season then you deserve an all star bid IMO
He‚Äôs not a center it was literally the first time we played him there all year because Jarrett Allen Kevin love and markkenan were out. It was him or tacko fall (who we played a lot yesterday)   You actually don‚Äôt know what your talking about
"Beal, Dinwiddie, Luka, KP  Maybe Randle or Jarrett Allen?  At this stage only Luka for sure, but a few of these guys had slow starts and will almost guaranteed out that behind them."
Why would you have him play the five if you have Jarrett Allen? Was Allen out?
Agreed and Jarrett Allen has the exact build of a guy you want against some of the beefier bigs in the league night in and night out. It‚Äôs a great frontcourt
"We played hard and managed to keep it close. Basically half the team is out. If Mobley is injured too were fucked and season will turn ugly fast. Also im not on the Tacko train anymore, he is not a replacement for Jarrett Allen at all, front office needs to get out the meme train."
Jarrett Allen is/was out with illness
Jarrett Allen out is going to hurt
Mobley and Jarrett Allen better sadly
"I‚Äôm pretty fuckin surprised we‚Äôre top 10. Even assuming Mobley was gonna come in with good defense, we were still starting lauri/garland/sexton and had a horrible defense last year with garland/sexton on the court together, and that‚Äôs with LNJ/Jarrett Allen /Okoro who are all good defenders.  Also Cedi is getting a lot of minutes and he was a bad defender last year  Garland and sexton seem to have improved on defense, lauri‚Äôs been better than expected. Cedi‚Äôs active hands have a been a pleasant surprise and I didn‚Äôt realize how good rubio is at defense for his size."
"WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.  Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
"Didnt want Jarrett Allen, didnt want Mobley.   Cavs sending a bottle of Champs over now."
DLo has the best +/- on the team because he's the best passer and he's playing ok defense this year. The unfortunate thing is that KAT's offensive style doesn't really mesh with his.  Think the Cavs would trade KAT for Jarrett Allen?
"I‚Äôm pretty sure we just didn‚Äôt wanna pay Jarrett Allen this early into our rebuild especially while being locked with John Walls contract  Not even sure why you brought up Rubio, we never even targeted him"
"I personally would rather have Jarrett Allen for the price the Cavs paid, but trading Allen was always about the money for the Rockets."
"It was salary relief. That's the reason for that part of the trade, to make sure the Rockets didn't have to pay into the tax. That's why they wanted to get off Prince's contract and they weren't going to play Jarrett Allen despite him being a ""huge space guy"" who would have fit in with Houston very well."
"Oh for sure, you guys have been super fun to watch this year, Rubio has fit so perfectly with your team. Jarrett Allen has also been fun to watch playing at the high level that was expected, love how you guys are playing!"
"I think we are set up so much better than when lebron was drafted. We're coming out of a rebuild right now rather than entering one. Lebron had us as a playoff team by our second year, and losing boozer pretty much fucked us as we were already too good to draft a secondary star. This year we have Garland who is really coming along nicely, could be a future all star. Jarrett Allen is a very good player and unlike big Z is young and healthy. Collin Sexton is a nice piece who could be re-signed for a reasonable contract it seems. We do need a SF but there is way more talent on this roster than the one that drafted Lebron."
Darius Galrand alone is better than any player LeBron had in his first stint.   Not to mention Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton
"What? They got Jarrett Allen from the Harden trade, not the KPJ trade. The KPJ trade was just a heavily protected second for KPJ"
"As much as I miss them, it's great seeing both Din &amp; Jarrett Allen doing so well on their new teams."
"Giving him away for nothing is still dumb, full stop. People are even starting to include the Jarrett Allen/Harden trade to justify what they did when they aren‚Äôt even the same move"
"Losing KPJ may have helped team chemistry, but you‚Äôre making it seem like this was purely addition by subtraction.  The Cavs also went out and got Jarrett Allen and struck gold in the draft with Evan Mobley. These are arguably more important changes."
Agreed!  Jarrett Allen for the 30th pick is robbery only way it makes sense is if KPJ was included.
What bothers me the most is how the Brooklyn Nets decided to part ways with Jarrett Allen. The Cleveland Cavaliers scouted him and wanted his contribution to the game (defense/rebounding). It was easily a good deal for the Cavs.
"Let's see..Evan Mobley is the real deal, Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley as a back court means that literally 75% of the League don't even have the bigs to guard both of them. Ricky Rubio and Darius Garland mean that they have a consistent floor general almost every minute of the game, Stevens is an underrated defender and they have serious depth too. Cedi, Okoro, Markkanen, Kevin Love, oh and Colin Sexton who's not even healthy.   I'd view this team as a first round exit but a legit playoff team via the play-in tournament. Maybe they play in the tourney and get knocked out or maybe they make the first round, that's probably their ceiling right now but in 2-3 years once the right roster gets built up and Evan Mobley really gets into his bag, it's going to be disgusting."
That trade is more underrated because they somehow got Jarrett Allen from Houston for real cheap.. seems like both are linked
Mobley is a 4 not a 5. Thats why the Cavs maxed Jarrett Allen straight away.
Yeah and Jarrett Allen is a great fit next to him
"Mobley, Spanish Rubio, Jarrett Allen, Garland....how much fun is this team to watch?"
Damn Jarrett Allen has taken the young Mobley under his wing
Jarrett Allen seems like such a cool guy
"If we keep Jarrett Allen, I don't know that he really needs to bulk up that much"
Am I tripping or almost every posterizer features Jarrett Allen?
Fine I'm just gonna say it  Timelord &gt; Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen looks like he's ready to take the ABA by storm.
"Don't forget Jarrett Allen, he's been fantastic for us.  And if Okoro can improve his shot he'd become a cornerstone for our team as well."
The Celtics had a rough start but I think they‚Äôre turning it around.   My man Jarrett Allen gonna stomp them though.
Jarrett Allen!
Hot take but Evan Mobley deserves some consideration. He‚Äôs ALMOST single handily changed Cleveland‚Äôs defense. Of course playing with Jarrett Allen helps as well. But this dudes versatility is insane honestly I mean as a Rookie PF/C the Cavs are comfortable enough to let him guard PG‚Äôs on the perimeter.
Right now I‚Äôd say   1.	Draymond  2.	Giannis 3.	Gobert 4.	Paul George  Although what‚Äôs crazy is so far this season the top 10 by defensive rating are:   1.	Jokic 2.	Gobert 3.	Draymond 4.	Paul George 5.	Steph Curry  6.	Bam Adebayo 7.	Nic Batum 8.	Nurkic 9.	Jarrett Allen 10. Jordan Poole
My boy Jarrett Allen is gonna clap Boston's ass
You write Ja I see Jarrett Allen
"He‚Äôs a big, but Jarrett Allen makes up for it in viciousness."
LeBron gonna trade Jarrett Allen for CP3
&gt; [Highlight] Jarrett Allen posterizes Luka on the lob
"No. 41 Bey watches his man set a pick, doesn't switch during the pick, ball handler (#10 Garland) uses the pick to get few steps ahead of his defender. Garza is put in a tough decision where he either has to either switch on to the ball handler or leave his man wide open under the basket. Gets caught in the middle. The ball handler throws an ALLEY OOP to Jarrett Allen (who looks like Stretch from NBA Street)!"
Jarrett Allen / Evan Mobley
"I said this and got downvoted before the season started. Capela is still the better player. Hell, Jarrett Allen is better. People were comparing Ayton to Bam because he can hit mid rangers LOL. Bam can create his own shot and shot for others."
Had*  Currently a front office which hasn‚Äôt missed on a draft pick and picked up Rubio and Jarrett Allen for chips

Jarrett Allen is the future
"Jarrett Allen is responsible for most of my remaining will to live, so uh‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt."
Jarrett Allen makes the game easier for everyone else. Tremendous unselfish player.
Jarrett Allen - unsurprisingly - played in a weird Kyrie 3 or something for years now.
Yo Mobley is not a C. Mobley has the skills to play PG. Ayton has to be compared with Jarrett Allen.
Jarrett Allen instead of Trae Young/Jaylen Brown
What does he have to hold to evolve into Jarrett Allen? we desperately need another center
Jarrett Allen was also pretty good against Jokic. 21 pts 16 Rbs.
"Ok that makes a lot more sense and it looks like you‚Äôve edited the OP to reflect that.   I think my answer is Jarrett Allen.  To start with I wouldn‚Äôt consider any player over age 25 who isn‚Äôt an established star and those answers are all pretty boring.   Jarrett Allen is only 23 and has already demonstrated competency as a defensive anchor at the Center position.   Allen‚Äôs great rebounding ability, both offensive and defensive, low foul rate, great efficiency around the rim, and lack of injury history are all major selling points.   The biggest question marks/downsides for Allen are his passing ability and FT shooting.   Adding on to the lack of offensive upside for Allen is the question of whether he‚Äôs even better, right now, than his rookie teammate, Evan Mobley."
"Just saying, the Cavs have two literal male models in Cedi Osman and Kevin Love, plus Ricky Rubio who‚Äôs a beautiful man, and then Jarrett Allen looks like the lead in a 70s detective movie about a murder at a disco. Honestly Mobley and Markkanen aren‚Äôt too bad either, it‚Äôs just DG and Collin kinda letting the side down there."
In my view he is a SF or PF because of what he can do on offense and defense. He was viewed as a Center before joining the NBA but he isnt one. Everyone on the team except Jarrett Allen can shoot 3s.
"Still can‚Äôt believe the Cavs somehow inserted themselves into the Harden business and came out with Jarrett Allen. Blew my mind then, continues to blow my mind now."
Rather have Harden than Jarrett Allen any damn day
"I think you're mixing up 2 drafts, but yes, the Kings fucked up the 2017 draft as well ‚Äì instead of NBA champion Justin Jackson and the corpse of Harry Giles, they could have rounded out their bench with John Collins, OG Anunoby, Jarrett Allen, Derrick White, even Kuzma"
"Jarrett Allen isn‚Äôt the type of player to mind being traded. In fact I‚Äôm pretty sure he told a reporter that he‚Äôd trade himself for harden too if he was a gm.   He knew the nets loved him, they just weren‚Äôt going to be able to pay him what he deserved and with Dinwiddie out and no one biting on the Shamet trade he was the only option :("
"LOL, that edit.  Feel the same way in any thread about the Mavs.                          I read an interesting thing somewhere about how strength is a huge deal for some young players.  Like, Lebron was a grown man at 18, but a lot of guys are nowhere near filled out yet.  Mavericks fans have been delighted by Frank Ntilikina this year, and part of the explanation for his delayed  development is that he was drafted at 18, and he's just one of those people who needs to get physically more mature before he can do anything against NBA adults.  (In Frank's case, it also has to do with his giant wingspan, and how having really long arms means flinging a ball toward a basket takes more force and is harder to control.)              Similarly, I remember seeing Jarrett Allen in person when he was at Texas, and thinking ""My god, he's a *kid*.""  I couldn't believe when he declared for the draft.  I think the Cavs got ahold of him at the exact right time.               Sorry to hear at Sexton.  Y'all are going to be frightening next year."
People questioning that Jarrett Allen contract was so weird man
Jarrett Allen is better than we thought. Many people didn‚Äôt see him working out on the Cavs lol
"Did anyone see this coming? It feels like only yesterday the Cavs picked Evan Mobley, traded for Rubio, brought in Markannen, and then we all heard that the roster was going to start with three near 7-footers and thought to ourselves ""no way that'll work."" The [preseason power ranker predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qcvtja/202122_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) did not. No one thought Mobley would be a ROY candidate, JA might be a MIP candidate given the way things are going, and no one put them down for most surprising team. They're definitely surprising us now.  Tricky Ricky's playing better than ever (having so many roll threats must be a dream scenario for him), Mobley was amazing right out of the gate, Jarrett Allen has exceeded expectations, and Lauri provides spacing (I guess).  I do worry a little about depth. Sexton's about to be out, which could be withstood by moving up Ricky or playing D. Wade. Love has only played a little. Markannen is also temporarily out. Windler, the other D. Wade, and Lamar Stevens seem like decent depth, and JA/Mobley are more than enough to cover for Markannen's temporary absence. However, losing either JA or Mobley would be huge hit to the rim protection and defense, kind of like if we lost Rudy, so I'm going to hope they both stay healthy for the whole season."
Jarrett Allen is probably better than the other teams starting center by a wide margin
"DeAndre Jordan, he's has no ability to defend whatsoever. Good when we're playing him, bad when he starts for you over Jarrett Allen bc he friends with your superstars ‚ò†Ô∏è"
"jarrett allen, jordan poole, miles bridges i would probably have at least equal if not more deserving of MIP so far. but it‚Äôs ridiculously early days"

Bumped knees with Jarrett Allen. Sounds like they decided to keep him out there for a minute before going out for the remainder of the game. So not expecting anything too serious going forward.
Our best player is either Evan Mobley or Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen and Draymond Green
Jarrett Allen.
"That‚Äôs great! I just wasn‚Äôt sure how effective it would be to play Allen and Mobley together, if it works that‚Äôs great. Two bigs doesn‚Äôt work for us so i was curious, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a Jarrett Allen on my team, unrelated."
"So, on some level what does this mean for Jarrett Allen?"
That Jarrett Allen guy is ascending
"Hair that only goes straight up does nothing for you. You need the good wide fro.  Seems to work for Jarrett Allen, who is tragically 50 years young for the starring roles he absolutely could have had in blaxploitation films."
"Jarrett Allen All Star, Mobley ROTY and All Defensive Team, Rubio 6th MOTY"
"After tonight, the Cavs. Always felt like Jarrett Allen would be big but he‚Äôs looking like the perfect anchor and is playing surprisingly well alongside Mobley."
Makes guys like Jarrett Allen and Jonathan Isaac even more impressive
"Isaac, Fultz, ingram, fox , Jokic, as younger guys Beal dame kyrie Jarrett Allen"
"i see a lot of players with a chance honestly   Jarrett Allen and LeVert, Josh Hart, Harrell, Boucher, Dragon, Haliburton, LaMelo, Ingles, Clarkson, Derrick White, Bogdan, Gallo, Bertans"
Jarrett Allen is properly rated maybe even overrated. He got bullied by Thomas Bryant and Robin Lopez last game.
And that Irving is no Wade and that Jarrett Allen isn't fucking Chris Bosh lol.
lol jarrett allen has been better than deandre jordan. the move the need to make is playing him more
Jarrett Allen has been impactful what are u on about
Offensively easily. But Jarrett Allen is their only plus defender on the Bench lol
Jarrett Allen doesn't understand that he needs to get a body on Lopez to keep him off the glass?
Jarrett Allen is supposed to be a good defender??
"Why is a 6th man not considered a solid player? By solid player do you mean starter? You don‚Äôt need to start to impact the game, look at Jarrett Allen, Dennis Schroeder last year, Lou will himself, etc"
Kawhi and PG are still top tier defenders who could limit the Nets stars.   I'd laugh my ass off watching washed up DJ and Jarrett Allen get destroyed by Shaq.
"The Ascension of Jarrett Allen, by John Collins -1/1/2021"
Jarrett Allen!
"Live by the block, die by the poster. Rinse and repeat. That‚Äôs the life of Jarrett Allen."
"It's def a jab at the Hawks adding that context, but I think it's viable bc they ain't pulling that off against DJ or Allen. Vicious poster by Collins on JarretT earlier in the game though."
"Meanest dunk, props for Jarrett Allen for consistently contesting dunks though."
Are there any two current players on more opposite ends of the hair spectrum than Trae Young and Jarrett Allen?
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
need to start jarrett allen
Jarrett Allen &gt; DAJ
Jarrett Allen is a very good defensive player.  Biggest reason why the Nets ranked 15th in defense 2 seasons ago and 8th (pre-bubble) last season.  Compare this season's roster with the ones that ranked 15th and 8th. It's not like the Nets lost a ton of great defensive players. It's largely the same roster except with KD and Kyrie added.  &gt; Joe Harris is a bad defender but Nets fans seem to think he's solid for some reason  You mean the people who actually watch him play all the time lol? What makes you think he's bad? He *is* a solid defender...
Jarrett Allen
KD and Kyrie look like they‚Äôre building some good chemistry with Jarrett Allen
"I think that the minute split between the two is going to grow.  Last game Jordan played 15:13 and Allen played 24:26. Jordan didn't play at all in the fourth quarter (of a very close back and forth game), while Allen played 7:45.   It's so very clear that Allen is significantly better. And it's not just that he's better than Jordan (which isn't saying much), it's that he's actually a really good and impactful player. I think that KD and Kyrie realize that Jarrett Allen needs to get a lot of minutes for the Nets to reach their ceiling."
"How? Trading away defense and rebounding for more iso? Losing depth and bench scoring for a more top heavy playstyle? I‚Äôm not convinced. They‚Äôre 3 generational iso players but there‚Äôs only 1 basketball.  I may be biased but they aren‚Äôt beating the Lakers, and certainly aren‚Äôt now. Clamping 2 guards won‚Äôt be difficult for us. KD is a problem but they gave up their best rebounder for ANOTHER iso scorer, and one who doesn‚Äôt play off ball well. They‚Äôre gonna get destroyed on the offensive boards with DeAndre Jordan being their only center - he‚Äôs about the most one dimensional center there is left and Jarrett Allen was way better in of a scorer, rebounder, defender and shooter."
"Spencer Dinwiddie responds to a graphic thanking him, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell for making the new Durant, Harden, Harden and Harden era possible."
"Yeah I see us just letting Aldridge go at the end of the season. I can see us resigning Derozan to like a 1+1 with a team just to allow another year or two of development for our young guys. I could also see us letting him go and just full on tanking, or maybe be able to sign John Collins or Jarrett Allen with all the money we have"
"Now that you guys have Jarrett Allen, I'd be shocked if Drummond isn't traded soon."
Yea if they could have gotten away without trading Jarrett Allen that would have been perfect for them
"and now they have a sick combo of Dipo and Wall with 4 worthless picks, they didn't even get Jarrett Allen"
The Jarrett Allen era will begin after the trade deadline once we ship off Drummond to some desperate western conference team
Delly is still on the roster? I thought we waived him to make room for the Jarrett Allen and TP trade
Would be a good fit on the Mavs now that the Cavs have Jarrett Allen coming in
"I think he's gotta be upset the Cavs traded for Jarrett Allen, which will fuel more performances like today's. I know he doesn't really fit the SexLand timeline, but he's still only 27 and the Cavs were actually winning games with everyone healthy to start the year. Remember that this is a guy who was essentially traded for a second round pick last year, and now another team is showing that they don't necessarily value him as a part of their future."
"Yeah but if you say 4 picks then you don't include Allen and Prince in the deal. What we gave up was 3 picks, Jarrett, Caris, Prince, Kurucs, and 4 swaps. No matter of perspective changes that"
"The Rockets later flipped LeVert for an expiring, and Jarrett Allen (due for an extension) for a pick.   Suggests Tilman is going broke and Houston really wanted to just shed salary."
"Considering Zach‚Äôs injuries right now, his value has declined. It definitely wouldn‚Äôt be enough for Jarrett Allen. I doubt we‚Äôll make a trade for anyone as of now."
"As someone who watches the Blazers a lot more than I do, is it worth trading Collins (assuming you can get decent value back, in the form of a temporary starter at C and a late 1st?) Collins for JaVale and a mid-to-late 1st could be something, as could Collins and a 1st for Jarrett Allen."
Im gonna miss watching Jarrett Allen in Brookyln.  Deandre Jordan is like a depressing husk of his former self.
If they win year I guess their argument is they gave up a lot to get a lot. The Cavs seemed to give very little for a Jarrett Allen. I still think the Cavs come out of this trade looking the best.
1. DeAndre Ayton  2. Bam Adabeyo  3. James Wiseman  4. Mitchell Robinson  5. Jarrett Allen  6. Wendall Carter  *Onyeka Okongwu( Way to early to tell)
"My list on *expected whole career value*, but disagreements welcome:  1. Bam Adebeyo 2. DeAndre Ayton (but not currently this high) 3. Jarrett Allen 4. James Wiseman (too early to really know but his flashes are balanced by his decision making) 5. Wendall Carter Jr 6. Onyeka Okongwu (too early to really know) 7. Mitchell Robinson (I'm kind of low on him and think he's already peaked)"
"Those 2025-2027 Nets picks are more valuable than Jarrett Allen, and in totality are probably more valuable than the Lakers #4 pick.    There is also a hindsight bias with Ingram as well, on the date he was traded he had some medical concerns and he saw a massive increase in efficiency since he was traded. We don't know how the Nets picks are going to turn out, but it's within the spectrum of possibility that they're ultimately more valuable than Ingram.   I think that the Pelicans haul was better, but until those picks ultimately convey we can't say for sure."
"Getting Jarrett Allen for a (most likely) late first round pick that wasn't even their own is really good.   They did have to take on Taurean Prince, but he only has one year left on his contract. He's overpaid but it's not anything crazy."
"They imploded the moment they traded Jarrett Allen, if you ask me.  Traded away that team's best big, who was clearly on an All-Star path.  I still feel like the Nets were with just the right amount of balance, before introducing Harden.  That roster depth was the true secret to Nets' future success.  I was worried Kyrie might ruin the team's chemistry, being ball-centric and a bit of a diva, but Kyrie *AND* Harden will for sure bother it."
"This is what I don't understand about player empowerment.  Only star players are being empowered. Everyone else is being depowered.  Do you think Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert, Rodnis Kurucs feel empowered? Why don't they get a say in where they play? The obvious answer is because they aren't as good, but it just shows that the NBA is beholden to like 10 players."
"After getting screwed in the last two drafts, it should be apparent tanking wont help us get a high draft spot but I do think that is what we have been trying to do since 2018. This team is being built to be a contender ~2024 or 25, really just need a star post player to partner Jarrett Allen and we are in with a proper shot"
So why did houston prefer the milwaukee pick over jarrett allen?
u are completely right and i honestly don‚Äôt understand how some rockets fans are so chill about this. jarrett allen would‚Äôve been a great addition tbh. the sole reason of not keeping him is because of fucking tilman.
"Follow the money. Tilman is going broke, and Simmons is just starting a max contract.   Also explains why they dumped Jarrett Allen (due for an extension), and dumped LeVert for an expiring."
"Levert is better than a role player but he‚Äôs not anywhere near an allstar player level. Just a good offensive threat to have, but that doesn‚Äôt matter since they can have KD, Harden, and Kyrie constantly on rotation. The Jarrett Allen trade was the one that fucked the nets over."
Also why they didn't want Jarrett Allen
"Maybe they can get a center from the Cavs, they have like 9. Maybe even Jarrett Allen, he'd be perfect for this team."
I like the Jarrett Allen starter theory
"That's true in a vacuum but I look at it like this. Jarrett Allen is a nice player, and they were undoubtedly better with him on the floor than DeAndre Jordan. But both of them play the most replaceable position in the game. And when you think about the amount of effort other teams will have to put in to defend this team, their defense doesn't matter. There are no stars in the east that can do enough to keep their teams in games against this."
"I agree. You‚Äôre NBA media, you should be able to name Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert if you‚Äôre the one asking the question about the trade. I‚Äôd be justifiably miffed if I were either of them"
Cavs gonna legally change Javale McGee's name to Jarrett Allen and then send him to you guys
Yeah I brought up offense because pointing out that he lost is not a good argument when winning has to do with offense and defense.  Don't understand why that block is so famous. Marcus smart did that shit on Jarrett allen
"Cavs have jvale, Drummond and Jarrett Allen that's 3 bigs"
"You're damn right. That district attorney's zoom meeting was all about Jarrett Allen too, I was there."
He‚Äôs happy that they lost one of the guys who could possibly stop him in Jarrett Allen
Except now they're out anything resembling above-replacement at Center and nothing resembling bench points. I don't doubt they're going to kick major ass but there are some aircraft-carrier-sized holes in the Nets game now. I think losing Jarrett Allen is going to hurt them more than anyone's letting on.
"I've seen a lot of people either misunderstanding what we gave up or blatantly over-exaggerating it.  I've seen people say we gave up 8 first round picks. No, we didn't. Hell we didn't even give up 4 picks. We gave up 3. The other first round pick is coming from Cleveland. We also gave 4 swaps, which aren't the same thing as picks. For some reason a lot of people have trouble understanding this. We still have picks in the years of those swaps, we simply have the worst pick out of ours and Houston's  In total it was: 3 first round picks, 4 swaps, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, and Rodions Kurucs for James Harden and a second round pick. In no conceivable way did we get fleeced"
"The slander against Jarrett Allen.  Dude is so young and so talented, surprised he doesn‚Äôt get more attention.  Might honestly be better for him long term if he can develop out from under KD Kyrie and Hardens shadow."
I can‚Äôt believe that the best player they got was Oladipo. Like he‚Äôs okay but he‚Äôs like three tiers below Harden and he‚Äôs always injured. LeVert is younger and has higher trade value.  I‚Äôm at a loss for words that they only got a late first (Bucks) for Jarrett Allen. That is just piss poor.
"You forgot about the FRP coming from the Cavs (that they got from the Bucks) and the 4 pick swaps. All unprotected.  The starter they gave up, Jarrett Allen, was pretty important for them considering how atrocious their defense is. I'm assuming LeVert is the 6th man. They also gave up Kurucs and Taurean Prince."
"That definitely makes sense and I agree. I guess I was looking at it with the perspective of I think y‚Äôall are close to being in finals contention once KP is all the way back and Dallas for some reason has had a hard time attracting top caliber free agents despite being a big market and sound front office structure.  Once I saw Jarrett Allen go practically for free and the low price of Oladipo I was just like how are the Mavs not active? Time to strike. But you‚Äôre right, y‚Äôall‚Äôs assets are a lot more valuable now because they‚Äôre so limited after the KP deal"
"I'm only saying the only way the Raps get one of those big men but I don't think it would happen or would be a good idea for the Cavs.  But I do think LNJ could potentially be traded. Love is going nowhere on that contract but he belongs on the bench. Jarrett Allen will supplant Drummond as the starter and Drummond will leave in FA. LNJ is great, especially his contract, but I could see him being moved.   What do you think of LNJ, 2021 1st (top 5 protected), and 2022 Bucks 1st for John Collins? Think he'd be a decent pairing with Jarrett Allen."
I heard that Jarrett Allen guy is pretty good.
"It's not that rare.  The Sixers have hit on players the last 3 years straight.    The bigger reason is simply, for the Cavs, what's the upside of trading for Allen, who's entering RFA this off-season? Players like him aren't rare.  Dwight, Nerlens, and WCS can be signed for pennies.    The Cavs would be in better position taking a shot at a player in the draft who will be cost-controlled for 4 years and potentially a tradeable asset.   Jarrett Allen has very little tradeable value at this point."
"Okay well... shit.  Are you sure you want Jarrett Allen, then? &gt;_&gt;"
And Claxton is still out w/ right knee tendinopathy. Nash hasn't set a timetable for his return either.  Dude also had shoulder surgery so he missed the bubble.  Jarrett Allen was the best player they had at any sort of rim protection.
I figured Tucker will be just bought out by Houston and end up on the Nets.  Drummond to the Pelicans for Adams. Drummond reunites with Van Gundy and is more of a force on the boards and scoring then Adams.   Adams goes to Cleveland where he is more suited to split time with Jarrett Allen at center.
"*gestures towards Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert, and Rudion Kuruc's empty lockers*  ""We can move you with the swiftness üóø"""
How dare you disrespect Cavs legend Jarrett Allen with that take.
&gt;	bunch of other little pieces moved around  the disrespect to jarrett allen smh
Lol this is funny. But also RIP to your Jarrett Allen tag thing
"Harden, Jarrett Allen, and Kenny Anderson appear from the tunnel to join in helping him up."
Can you imagine being Jarrett Allen if the Cavaliers weren‚Äôt trading Andre Drummond? You‚Äôd have been banished to fucking Cleveland after playing in New York and doomed to watch him brick post ups while you‚Äôre wasting your potential and future earnings on the bench
Uhhh gotta say I like the Nets chances against us a lot more now with James Harden as opposed to Jarrett Allen. Hot take I know
I think they just were a filler to send money out. Exceptional value for the MIL pick. The Nets sold so low on Jarrett Allen
Take Jarrett Allen so we don‚Äôt send him to a contender   Why the Rockets didn‚Äôt ask for him I don‚Äôt know.
I guess it was taking on Prince's contract.  But yeah getting Jarrett Allen for basically nothing is crazy.
"Well right now they have 2, because where‚Äôs Kyrie? They‚Äôre all getting up there in age and Harden is an overweight cancer. It remains to be seen how they fit together, might take them a little while to figure shit out(see Lebron in Miami). They SHOULD make the finals this year (cuz it‚Äôs the East) but they will lose to LA and in 7 years when they are still sending out 1st round picks you might feel a little differently.  The picks make it a great trade for Houston   I like the trade for Indy, I think they got a little better.  The winner of the trade is Cleveland who gave up nothing to get Jarrett Allen."
"&gt;They rerouted for Jarrett Allen who was an upcoming RFA for a 1st round pick right after they just signed Christian Wood to be their future starting C, so while I agree it was bad value, Allen wasn't going to be starting there anyway  it doesn't matter whether Wood is there or whether Allen would be starting -  it's still terrible value. even in a sign-and-trade scenario next summer you should net more than a '22 Bucks pick for Allen.   Prince isn't good but he'll be an expiring mid-tier contract next summer, his contract alone is valuable for salary matching purposes. a competing team could be very interested in him this summer in a salary dump situation, similar to the Horford/Danny Green deal, or for the purpose of consolidating smaller contracts into 1 medium contract - because he would make it easier to trade for a high salary guy at the next trade deadline.  if that trade happened in a vacuum people would be losing their minds."
"&gt;other than the fact that they just re-routed every player with multiple years on their deal to an other team for pennies on the dollar  They rerouted for Jarrett Allen who was an upcoming RFA for a 1st round pick right after they just signed Christian Wood to be their future starting C, so while I agree it was a bad value trade, Allen wasn't going to be starting there anyway.  The only other move was Levert for Oladipo which could be looked as a shrew move taking advantage of the Pacers' consistently valuing the long-term asset in Oladipo negotiations as a Presti-like move to flip later on to a team the Pacers wouldn't trade to (due to potentially being the Pacers playoff matchup) - like the Sixers or Heat.  See, its easy to spin the narrative to how you want it."
They didn‚Äôt. It was a penny pinching move. They gave away an asset for some cap relief. Same thing with the Jarrett Allen trade to Cleveland.
Jarrett Allen is not making the cavs a playoff team
But who is going to play D? I think they‚Äôre going to miss Jarrett Allen a lot more than they think.
"i just feel bad for jarrett allen, since he was doing so well for the nets, only to get traded for a superstar whose role overlaps a lot with kyrie and kd already."
Why is this Jarrett Allen trade breaking this subs brains?   The Cavs traded for Jarrett Allen so that they can extend him this summer and make him part of their foundational core. He isn‚Äôt being traded and Drummond and McGee are not part of the future.   Just think of this as a FA acquisition for the Cavs. They can‚Äôt attract big names In FA so they traded for one that they can now match and control long term.
Why the hell would Cavs trade 22 year old Jarrett Allen for Montrezl?
"I understand that those two aren't great, but if you're the Nets for example you are in desperate need of another center and you have limited assets available.  Jarrett Allen isn't going anywhere though; Cavs got a great deal swapping Dante Exum for Allen. Drummond will either get traded or walk in FA so Allen can get the bag."
All good. The Nets will obviously be good but we‚Äôll see how they do after they gutted their depth and lost their defensive anchor in Jarrett Allen. They‚Äôll drop 120 a lot of nights but their defense might suck ass. Also who tf knows if Kyrie wants to play let alone with Harden
Jarrett Allen was used with the wizards pick
Haha thanks. Everyone wants Jarrett Allen who would be a decent combo with Chris Boucher but it would also be nice to not be good this yr and get a prospect. Will depend on if Lowry wants out...
Send him to the Cavs for Jarrett Allen
"They have a massive hole in the front court right now because Jarrett Allen is gone and Jordan is washed.  If they can‚Äôt figure it out, they could have massive issues in the playoffs and be a surprise exit early.  I have to assume they have a trade plan for that."
"DeAndre is really bad compared to Jarrett Allen, who they let go. They don't really have rim protection.   Dinwiddie is out for the season, so he's a non-factor this year. We'll see how he can contribute next season."
Bro the league overvalues picks. I don‚Äôt get it. So few picks pan out. Also Jarrett Allen is crazy underrated. Cavs might be the biggest winners from this draft for me
"Yeah I don't think Drummond is in their long term plans, they've got Jarrett Allen, Javale Mcgee, Kevin Love, and Larry Nance Jr. They should be starting Jarrett Allen long term given his age - Drummond is superfluous for that team because Jarrett Allen does about everything he does but better for less money."
"Obviously worth it for getting harden, but losing jarrett allen is a huge loss. A washed up Deandre Jordan is going to have to play big minutes and AD will be an absolute nightmare for them. They also traded away some depth while the Lakers are swimming in it"
The Jarrett Allen trade*
"Absolutely the Bucks. They're the only team with the personnel to guard all three of their stars *and* an elite big that can take advantage of them losing Jarrett Allen. I think the Celtics and Sixers also match up well defensively, but I'm not sure that they have the offensive firepower to keep up‚Äî I'm still not sold on the Sixers' offense as a total package, and the Celtics don't really have the roster to take full advantage of the Nets' defensive holes (offensively speaking, Kemba/Brown/Tatum is basically a worse version of Kyrie/Harden/KD)."
Maybe a younger developing prospect who already has shown flashes of defensive excellence? Who can also rebound and score efficient buckets without the ball in his hands all the time? Idk what do you think about Jarrett Allen?
"It would have been nice to get Jarrett Allen involved in the Mavs offense. Impressed with the Cavs for getting those pieces so easily.  Oladipo is someone you‚Äôd want to hold out on til FA. He‚Äôs been inconsistent of late, and you‚Äôd want to see how he can hold up post injury.  (Although this would be the best time to buy low on him). Mavs simply don‚Äôt have many tradeable assets atm.   I‚Äôd go out on a limb and say he‚Äôll walk in FA. At 29, I doubt he‚Äôll want to stay on a rebuilding team for an extended period of time."
"Its a Bucks pick, essentially tanked in value since Giannis signed that extension.  Jarrett Allen fits their timeline, is a good rim protector and pick&amp;roll player. He fits very well next to their SexLand back-court"
we literally got him for dryer lint.  He's been pretty good this year for us and we'll either let him go or get something for him. The key is that Jarrett Allen is our C moving forward
yep we have literally just been holding it in case Giannis left.  Now it's like the 27th pick for Jarrett Allen. It's a robbery.
Poor Jarrett Allen. Sentenced to walk among giants in The Land. Love. Drummond. Allen. Who‚Äôs next?
Jarrett Allen got totally fucked in that trade... Hope dude gets to a good team sooner than later
Why would the nets trade away Jarrett Allen to the Cavs for essentially nothing? Was that a cap space move ?
Cavs somehow turned Dante Exum into Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Gotta give it to them.
they lost a FRP though for basically just Jarrett Allen and they already have a small army at C
Andre Drummond is the only stupid one.  They should release him.  Getting Jarrett Allen for what they paid was the biggest steal of the trade.
"I would still take the Nets deal in view of the sheer amount of draft picks they were offering.  I don't know how many draft picks the Sixers were offering, but the Rockets essentially got 7 unprotected 1st-rounders from the Nets (3 picks, 4 pick swaps). Although I'm surprised the Rockets didn't press for Jarrett Allen and instead allowed the Fro to be sent to Cleveland.  Thats quite a haul, especially since Harden has a player option he can opt-out of in 2022 (same with KD). If the Nets suck after 2022, thats fantastic news for the Rockets."
"They could get away with a bad bench by staggering the minutes of the big 3, the biggest miss however is Jarrett Allen seeing as DeAndre Jordan is washed af.   Defense &amp; rim-protection especially is gonna be a problem unless DJ magically finds the fountain of youth somewhere"
"Cutting Maker hurts. We had a lineup in our last game of Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, Thon Maker, Larry Nance Jr. and some guard (sorry, I don't know who's on my team at this point). They could have kept Thon for one game and given us Drummond, McGee, Maker, Jarrett Allen and Nance at PG."
"This is a pretty big trade and I'm happy for the players that are benefitting from this (sorry Jarrett...) but what is Brooklyn thinking. They have no backup now, one center and 3 iso players. Don't flame me but I think KD, Kyrie (if he plays), Allen with LeVert and DJ as backup works out a lot better than this. They don't have anymore picks either not sure how this is going to go.   The firepower looks good on paper."
Their defense is suppperr sus. All world offensive talent but the traded their only plus defender I'm Jarrett allen
"Idk I think the choice was heavily influenced by financial concerns. If they get Simmons, they have to pay him on a big 5-year deal that just began this season.  Like what happened to LeVert and his $52.5M over 3 years? Flipped for a guy who comes off the books after this year. What happened to Jarrett Allen, who is set to land a big deal in free agency the summer? Rerouted to Cleveland.  Who did they keep? Kurucs who is owed $1.7M this year and subject to a team option next season. Oladipo, an expiring. And, Exum, also an expiring. They chose this ""treasure trove"" over the Sixers deal because this one leaves them with no major financially commitments. Draft picks are free until they turn into cheap rookie deals, which will happen over the course of almost a decade in this case."
"Yup, in a vacuum it's an absolute slam dunk for the cavs.  Exum is a non-asset and that Bucks pick will be a borderline 2nd rounder.  Technically, Prince is overpaid on $13 mil per year, and he had an awful season last year, but its a short term contract, and they could swing him next year for a marginal pick if he finds his pre-nets form.  As a person who lives in the NY market, I'll just say Jarrett Allen is awesome. You'll have restricted free agent rights, but it's also a barren free agent class, so someone is tossing him a 4 year $90 million contract, and you better be ready to pay up because he can for sure get Capela money (5 years/90 mil). I'm sure the nets would have loved to keep him, but he was guaranteed to walk because their luxury tax bill would have been equal to the size of the NBA's National TV contract."
Cavs fans pretending to be excited about Jarrett Allen. lol
"Feels like Cleveland got out like bandits in this trade, got Jarrett Allen for just a FRP"
"It only makes sense for the Young Bull to finish this game with a game winner, that or Jarrett Allen hammers it down on three of the Nets."
#I want a game winning step back 3 from Jarrett Allen

How the hell does Jarrett Allen shampoo? Does he have someone do it for him
Jarrett allen sets some bone crushing screens
Jarrett Allen okay? hardly been in since the 1st
Jarrett Allen killing us this game.. and I‚Äôm not even mad about it
"A lot of narratives going on this game : Jarrett Allen revenge game, Kyrie Homecoming and Collin (Net's pick) Sexton"" the pick that could have been""."
The league isn‚Äôt ready for the defense of a Jarrett Allen/Larry Nance front court
Love the new Nets team but I'm hoping Cleveland wins this one bc Jarrett Allen.
the second jarrett allen stepped on the court we havent hit a shot.
Cavs fans are gonna like Jarrett Allen
Can we get Jarrett Allen back?
"This game is gonna be a hot take factory no matter how it goes.  I'm excited, though.  Miss Fro, and wish him the best.  I hope the Cavs lose of course but I wanna see Jarrett Allen do well=)  *Let's Go Nets!*  **BROOKLYN!!!!!!!!!**"
So lazy can‚Äôt even spell Jarrett Allen
"Broke: Can't wait to watch Kyrie, KD, and Harden play together for the first time  Woke: Can't wait for the Jarrett Allen revenge game"
"Wasn't there just a highly upvoted post not too long ago that stated that WE NEED TO STOP ABBREVIATING NAMES?   There are a select few that are allowed to be abbreviated (KD, PG, AD, etc.). It took me longer than it should have to realize you were talking about Jarrett Allen. I thought you were talking about Ja Morant for a split-second.   Spell out the name the first time and then abbreviate all you want for the rest of the post."
You gotta clarify that you mean Jarrett Allen lmao
just fucking say jarrett allen  there is a Ja in the NBA and no one calls allen JA
I think this happens because they try to change it shot in the NBA. Jarrett Allen best freethrow season was his rookie year
I thought Jarrett Allen is gonna be the heart and soul of the Nets was kinda sad they trade him.
"K-Love and Drummond don't fit that team and it's timeline imo.They gotta go somehow.I'd try to put really good defenders around Sexland.Okoro has potential,Jarrett Allen is already good defensively,Larry Nance can stretch the floor,would be nice alongside Allen.They'd also have great lob threats.I'd hold on to Cedi because his floor is decent and he can be a playmaker.And he seems to have no problem coming off the bench.He loves Cleveland."
Sources tell me that the Cavs are signing Len to play PG.      Cavs starting lineup:  PG: Alex Len  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Javale Mcgee  C: Andre Drummond
"Ok fair enough but I don‚Äôt think it was about political correctness. Jarrett Allen was effusive in his support of Kyrie.  If he felt differently he could‚Äôve sidestepped it.  If KD is displeased, we  see it, like with Dray or Westbrook.  For all the locker room cancer talk, even all his former Celtics teammates all praised him except al Horford.  Jayson Tatum always talks about his love for Kyrie."
Jarrett Allen knows a lot about pasta sauce.
I just looked at the second guy on his list and his FGA:FTA ratio is already higher than Trae Young.  Per Basketball reference  Trae Young 126 FTA : 215 FGA 0.586  Jarrett Allen 61 FTA : 65 FGA 0.938
"Jarrett Allen is just as young and he's not getting a similar amount of flak, so there's probably more to it."
"Smart is on here because of small sample size. He has as many shots as Jarrett Allen that should tell you he's not looking for his own short most of the time. Most of smarts FGA attempts are actually 3s, which jokes aside are less likely to go in than 2s.  From an eye test perspective it seems as though Smart tries to get himself fouled if the team is in the bonus and he's playing with the second units, the lowery special. I don't say that to hate its a good idea. However I really doubt over a larger sample size smart issue gonna be anywhere near the top 10."
"Welcome to Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to complete a clean sweep of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers.   The starting five for the Cavaliers tonight is Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. Look for big contributions from 6th man Larry Nance Jr off the bench."
"Outside of Jarrett Allen, what other players are on your great hair list? I feel like the league is on a tear with solid hairstyles over the past few years."
His teammates don‚Äôt seem bothered at all by him.  KD flat out said there‚Äôs no drama or chaos. Jarrett Allen called him his brother and fully supported him.  Nash and Marks said they support him.  So the people that matter don‚Äôt care.  Only non important people online are deeply offended
Jarrett Allen looks like that one black kid who was really into Naruto. That alone makes it easy to root for him.
Murray-Walker-Keldon-Random PF-Jarrett Allen would be a really fun and very promising young core to build around. Would definitely need a star or two (either through development or acquisition) to grow into a truly competitive team but that would be a great start.
"Funny enough, I think my team has a better shot at beating them without Jarrett Allen."
Who wants to tell this guy that a journeyman is the last thing Jarrett Allen will become?
"Cleveland Champion and Retired Jersey Jarrett Allen  He‚Äôs already averaging 11, 10, and 1.6 blocks in just 26 minutes a game...."
Jarrett Allen seems too mature to give a shit about what Kyrie Irving thinks.

"When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister was grocery shopping. So when there i am, sitting in the deli with my niece and who walks in but Jarrett Allen.  I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Jarrett, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Jarrett put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a deli. Chill guy, really nice about it"
The Rockets got a 2022 1st round pick from Milwaukee for Jarrett Allen.
"The Nets have been the home for outcast misfits for years now... it's kinda our thing.   DeAngelo Russell was viewed as a rat, Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris were basically out of the league, Caris LeVert was injury plagued, hell even Jarrett Allen dropped in the draft because people thought he didnt care enough about basketball.   In a weird way, KD Harden and Kyrie are the perfect superstars for the Nets"
"The problem with these NBA players (not Jarrett Allen obviously) is some of them have egos that are insanely too high.   That, plus some might not quite understand the business side of the league and they get mad for no reason.  Like, if if I was making a millionaire salary to play a sport and my boss told me he is shipping me to a different city, I‚Äôd just take it in stride."
Jarrett Allen is a good dude.
Love Jarrett Allen that man ain‚Äôt afraid to jump with anybody
"Jarrett Allen's honesty is refreshing.  He understands that the NBA is a business. The Nets executives did their job by getting Harden back. It was an opportunity to be seized.  They would have preferred to keep Allen and trade Shamet, but Allen's value was more important.  Allen will recover and will have a great opportunity in a Rebuilding Riders team."
"I still vividly remember the 2018-2019 Brooklyn Nets season in detail. LeVert goes down with a  gruesome injury in their 14th game of the season and I felt like crying. The team was kinda exciting and not only do we lose our best player (at that time) but the kid's career looked like it could be in jeopardy. They go on an 8 game losing streak which included quite a few 4th quarter blown leads. The double OT loss to Memphis stands out to me given I took the girl I'd recently started dating to the game, and when the Nets led by 7 with 30 seconds left she turned to me and said, ""it's impossible for the other team to win now right?"" Poor girl had never seen the Nets play.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm watching them play the Raptors trying to avoid 9 losses in a row. They go to OT, down 1 VanVleet gets the ball down 1 wide open for 3 with a second on the clock and misses. I had no idea that would be the start of a 7 game win streak and the complete turnaround of a franchise. These guys were 8-18 with their best player looking like he'd just snapped his leg like a twig, and 25 months later they have 3 of the most talented basketball players the league has ever seen. But that came at the cost of literally every player from that 2019 roster barring Harris and Dinwiddie.   &amp;#x200B;  Jarrett Allen is all class and such an incredibly likable dude. As much as you can understand why a move was made, it must be heartbreaking to know you're going to miss out on the benefits of what you were such a big part in creating."
"future superstar GM, Jarrett Allen"
I had assumed Jarrett Allen was the cost for dumping Taurean Prince and his deal basically.
"Not to mention Harden is a tank and his stamina/usage are insane.  I really wish somehow, someway, yall coulda just traded Kyrie and kept that bench depth. Losing Jarrett Allen might be a big L in the long run. I just doubt KD was ok with Kyrie being traded, or that any team wanted him."
of course he would  Jarrett Allen is gonna get a bigger contract now
"This may sounds Caraaaazzzzyyyy, but Jarrett Allen with another role player and 2 future unprotected 1st round picks. IMO would be a great trade for Irving."
Jarrett Allen is a solid starter level player. You're massively overrating his impact.
What‚Äôs the price of Jarrett Allen or Andre Drummond?
Jarrett Allen?
Kuz should grow his hair out like Jarrett Allen
"Joe Harris has a well rounded offensive game. He can finish near the basket too, and is a solid cutter.  I think the main problem is they don't have enough bigs without Jarrett Allen. In the first 7 mins of the 3rd quarter, DeAndre literally didn't make it back on offense to inside the 3 point line 5 times by my count. He was basically power walking and then just stopping if the play looked like an iso. Hopefully he's coasting and can turn it on a little more in the playoffs but that seems unlikely."
"I‚Äôd love me some Jarrett Allen. Seems more realistic now that he‚Äôs with the Cavs too, or worst comes to the worse, pick him up in the off season ."
Imagine Jarrett Allen on this team completely shutting down Giannis.
"Deandre Jordan is a better fit for this team than Jarrett Allen, he has much more experience"
Jarrett Allen in a Cavs uniform is gonna look weird as hell.. the Fro just resembles Brooklyn
They should trade for Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen would yammed all those lobs with ease. Good thing they shipped him out
Does Harden think he's lobbing to Jarrett Allen lol
I miss watching Jarrett Allen play already. I'm never gonna see that man again.
At least you'll bare witness to the magnificent Jarrett Allen.
I kinda wish Harden had a fro. Someone on the Nets needs to fill the Jarrett Allen sized hole in my heart
The Jarrett Allen Era 'bout to bring 'em back!
"If they somehow got Jarrett Allen, sheesh"
"I mean this report tells us otherwise, I assume the deal came down to a list of things Rockets wanted and Jarrett Allen wasn't on the list. So it was probably we want x-number of FRP back and while the Nets tried to find another FRP by dangling Shamet, when they weren't able to, they had to include Allen to fill the Rockets demands. Why would the Rockets care how the Nets fulfill their needs, if somehow some team was willing to give up a mid-early first round for Shamet but not for Allen, they would take the deal that ends up routing the higher pick to them, not anything else. Obviously that reality doesn't exist but this report just says Nets tried that and it didn't work."
"My point is that Shamet just isn't even a legit asset. The Nets had two traceable players who were actual assets outside the big 2, holding onto either of them in negotiations for James Harden is a pipe dream  Even if the Nets offered up Shamet, or managed to get a pick for Shamet, the Rockets would just say ""let's get real, include Jarrett Allen"" just like they were going after all of Simmons, Maxey, and Thybulle"
"Yea DJ on AD will be a big mismatch, but I thought DJ actually did a solid job on AD last time we played each other (the last pre-rona game, an actual eternity ago). AD was eating Jarrett Allen alive and DJ came in and pushed AD outside the paint (where AD killed us anyway, but I'd much rather have AD shoot mid-rangers than lay ups lol).  I mean if we're operating under the pretense that no screens can stop Lakers defenders and they'll be able to exploit every mismatch while the Nets cant then yea Lakers in 4, maybe 3 even because the Nets will be so demoralized they wont come out for game 4.  I'm not sure if you're even trying to have an actual basketball discussion, but it sure doesn't seem like it. Also I saw Herro and Robinson set multiple screens for Butler's defender during the Finals, that actually worked, especially since they scampered away as fast as possible to the 3 pt line and a defender had to follow them, so seeing as those literal toothpicks could set screens, I have a little faith a few Nets players will be able to as well."
Jarrett Allen is not what the Celtics need. He does nothing for us in terms of guarding guys like Embiid and Giannis and also provides zero spacing.
"Hold on now, Jarrett Allen is good and young and on a good contract but they might be able to find someone like him, probably hidden on the Cleveland roster. I wouldn't rate him as high as others might."
"I think the problem with Allen is, he's due a fat contract that makes it so he is the third piece.  No wiggle room.  As it is, when Walker's contract expires, the Celtics will have a shot at a free agent to pair with Brown and Tatum before they get 30% max contracts.  That would literally be the last chance to add any free agent to Brown and Tatum in their primes.  If they had to re-sign Allen (sunk cost and all of giving up picks), his salary would remove any cap space before Brown and Tatum get paid.  &amp;#x200B;  Personally, I don't think Allen is all that great to be the third best player on a championship team.  And Boston is attractive enough that they could risk it and hope for free agency.  A Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker tier player is much better than Jarrett Allen.  I might be wrong, but I don't see Allen ever being as good as third options on recent championship teams (Lowry, Klay, Love)"
I really like Shamet. I liked him on the Sixers. It's wild to me that he's on his third team and has just been passed around like he has.  I think it's mostly mental with him. I think he will bounce back. He will be a key role player this year.   Although Jarrett Allen is obviously better and a harder role to fill.
"But the first round pick could be anything, it could even be a Jarrett Allen?  To your team, at the moment, Allen should be worth multiple first round picks because he's a known commodity and his age lines up well with the roster. Ainge needs to be aggressive at some point."
Might be the difference between a ring and not. Jarrett allen with this team would've legit been broken.
"&gt; So you think you should trade players who by all accounts are happy?  In some cases, yeah I think so.  Jarrett Allen was ""by all accounts was happy"" and they definitely should have traded him.  I'm sure a good chunk of those Lakers young players were ""by all accounts happy"" and they should 100% be traded for Anthony Davis 10/10 times.  Apparently that's a scorching hot take."
if celtics didn't want to give a first rounder for jarrett allen that's terrible talent evaluation
Which is ridiculous considering the age and talent of Jarrett. Honestly the Nets ceiling is obviously high but the Cavs definitely won the trade by getting a guy like Allen for pennies on the dollar just by having cap space and a pick.
By the wording I'd guess we were after Jarrett Allen but didn't want to give a first rounder.
"We‚Äôll take him on if you attach Jarrett Allen and ~~Taurean Prince.~~ Actually, just Jarrett Allen."
Maybe they can get Jarrett Allen.
Houston could have taken Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert if they wanted. Tilman was just cheap and wanted expiring contracts
Wonder if they could get Andre Drummond since he‚Äôs on an expiring and I assume Jarrett Allen is their center of the future?
"If they didn't get rid of Jarrett Allen for Harden I'd say come to the nets but it's still a solid choice. KD, Harden, one of the best 3pt shooters in the league with Joe Harris. DeAndre Jordan can be a force on the interior. Itd be nice if Kyrie played a game once in a while but oh well. Or jump on the bandwagon with the Lakers. They're goings to the finals again."
"Sure, that's a smart comparable. Jarrett Allen was traded for the Bucks 1st round pick, which is roughly the #29 pick.   If you value Lonzo in that ballpark, but maybe slightly less, multiple 2nd round picks feels like reasonable value.  Looks like Clippers have unprotected Pistons 2nd round picks in 2024, 2025, and 2026. Likewise an unprotected Blazers 2nd round pick in 2023. On top of that, they have most of their own 2nd round picks. Could possibly make a competitive offer."
Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen has the best hair in sports and I wish more athletes looked like him
Jarrett Allen without the fro is tragedy.
"We can say similar things about your guys, SexLand is looking legit and Jarrett Allen has been one of my favorite non-Warriors to root for since 18-19"
You saying that you thought LeVert was a bad playmaker tells me all I need to know about whether you‚Äôve seriously taken the time to watch him play.   Its like saying Joe Harris was a bad shooter or Jarrett Allen was a bad defender
"I always prefer to see guys attempt a block if they actually have a chance to block it. I love seeing guys like Jarrett Allen contest every dunk because he can block anyone. You‚Äôll definitely get dunked on sometimes if you do that, but you‚Äôll also get some great blocks. Jarrett Allen has blocked attempted posters from guys like LeBron and Giannis  Now, if you‚Äôre a 6‚Äô2‚Äù guard and LeBron is coming at you to the rim, you should probably try to strip the ball or get out of the way, because if you try to block it, at best you‚Äôre gonna get dunked on and at worst you‚Äôre gonna get dunked on and get called for a foul"

i dont like that jarrett allen/ drummond starting lineup tbh
Expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|---   D. Garland | Jamal Murray  C.

"Well we know how much Jarrett Allen is worth, they should trade for that guy"
He definetley misses Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. I hate that the Nets traded for Harden they were perfectly fine without him.
Jarrett Allen
"I understand that part. I just think KD and Kyrie said they want to get their friend paid and into their locker room even if it could lessen their chance at a title, and I think that's pretty cool. I also think they obviously saw that Jarrett Allen was the better option, but maybe they valued having a close friend on the team over a better player. I dunno, just speculating"
dj has been plenty paid. it's not like he's tristan thompson. i blame them for not recognizing that jarrett allen was the guy who should be center.
"KD was out, Harden wasn't on the team yet, and Kyrie absolutely assblasted us lmao.  Jarrett Allen played really well too.  Brooklyn Nets as they are now is kind of a mystery still."
"Not excusing it, but providing better context. Was prior to the Harden trade so Nets still had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen. Also, Curry got pulled just before the game started due to COVID."
I think so too but that lack of Jarrett Allen is becoming more apparent.
"Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and Taurean Prince who were all contributing on Defense to various degrees along with Rodions Kurucs who was relegated to the Bench.   They received James Harden who isn‚Äôt known for his Defensive skills and only recently filled up 3 Empty Roster Spots a month after the trade.    Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between the trade and Dinwiddie‚Äôs injury. Not to mention Sean Marks shitting the bed on the Bey for Shamet trade. Of course their Defense was going to be bad.   How many great high quality Free Agents are available to sign mid season? Nets can only do so much and so far Sean Marks hasn‚Äôt proven himself to be on the level of Morey when it comes to in season roster building.   Sean Marks gets a ton of his shine from hitting on LeVert and Allen back to back in the draft along with finding Dinwiddie and Harris in the trash bin. He‚Äôs been very limited in his drafting skills since 2016-17."
It‚Äôs like they got rid of Jarrett Allen or something
Kaminsky looking like luka out there against mcgee and jarrett allen lol.
"as a jarrett allen holder in fantasy, plz trade this man"
All I can do is thank the Houston and Cleveland for forcing Jarrett Allen into that deal.  I would be much more terrified of the Nets if he was still on the team.
I'm surprised it took this long for them to sign Vonleh. I thought he'd go there as soon as they lost Jarrett Allen.
Pretty sure Jarrett Allen is surviving
Why is Jarrett Allen performing at the half time show
"It's still the TWolves (to be fair to them but especially supportive: the ones without KAT of course) + there's a history of bigs dominating (especially the recent Clint Capela's one before this), but still, Capela had a triple double with blocks and Jarrett Allen played like Wilt Chamberlain, so nothing at all that moots these performances I would say."
"To be fair, it's not like he doesn't keep getting enabled. Hell, he was starting over Jarrett Allen in spite of Allen being much better. And in the end Allen got traded for pennies on the dollar because of it"
"Probably but those guys are proven commodities and I don‚Äôt know if they decrease that significantly. But yes I see your point. I just think a Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen front court along with Levert and some young pieces around that sounds pretty nice."
I mean they could also have all that plus levers and Jarrett Allen sooo nah they still got some bad return on one of the best offensive players ever.
Nice  Also by taking the Nets trade we got ourselves KPJ. Not only would this not have happened if we had Simmons but also the Cavs likely gave us him since we gave them Jarrett Allen
"Does he still have Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or do we mean literally *these* nets?   Lebron, Harris, Green, Griffin, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Mike James, and Deandre Jordan doesn't seem like it could possibly make the finals."
"I am the most vocal Jarrett Allen stan in this sub.  Sexton is cool, but Allen is my guy."
I like to think that the Cavs gave KPJ to Houston out of goodwill since they got Jarrett Allen for next to nothing.
Indirectly.  I think there was ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù deal because we sent Jarrett Allen there.
Yea obviously if it was just the picks I wouldn't feel as good about the trade but we did also get KPJ from it. Likely an under the table part of the Jarrett Allen deal but even if it wasn't if we took Philly's package we would definitely not have traded for him
Yeah from everything I‚Äôve heard he would have replaced Jarrett Allen in the Harden trade if he hadn‚Äôt gotten hurt
I only liked Jarrett Allen for the most part after the nets series two years ago. Dude was awesome and the fro was legend.
Trade Kyrie for levert and Jarrett Allen
The Jazz were rewarded? The Nets built quite a bit of that team organically. They developed very good assets in players like Jarrett Allen &amp; Caris LeVert and were able to leverage that into a highly-coveted asset. It's not like they got Harden for free...
"I wonder what Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen, and all the other Nets who were traded away for this super team are thinking now."
"Reminder that as part of the trade to get harden, the nets gave up 3 first rounder, 3 picks swaps, and lost LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince and Kurucs.  Now they have 3 aging stars, a threadbare team and no assets."
Thanks for Jarrett Allen!
Then we move Jarrett Allen for some other pieces - I think I would that tbh
"Josh ""Afroman"" Richardson gonna turn up next year with a bigger fro than Jarrett Allen or Josh Childress"
"The Cavs are great for player prop parlays. The online site I use has a section for them but call them ""accumulators"". You can add up to 10, one gets you a few bucks, 3 gets you maybe $5-10, 5 starts getting a bit more and 10 you can win like $800- 1600 on a dollar. Garland was one of my favorite players to add for pts and threes. The star players it gets kind of difficult, like Beal the lowest you might be able to take for a certain game is 24. And even 24 doesn't give you great odds, if you want those really tasty odds you gotta take like 28-32. Which is fucking hard! Lots of games at 24-26. So star players I'd do assists and rebs, those are more easily attainable. Threes as well. Then look for mid tier guys to take their points, someone like Garland at over 18 or 20 seems much better. RJ Barrett in the same range, those kind of guys. Garland and Sexton are so good for those, because they're not an unreasonable level. Jarrett Allen rebounds too. I liked Cleveland for those, someone's gotta score on the team, it's not like GS where Steph may score 46 which made everyone else score significantly less. Until Kevin fucking Love came back and threw a wrench into my low key favorite prop team. Those 3 were so reliable until his return. Moses Brown and Christian Wood too.  As a Cavs fan.. since you're obviously not winning a championship next season if you're looking for something to keep the games interesting, you have a really fun team to take for those kind of bets. And again, it's only a dollar, so you don't have to worry about spending crazy money (although obviously you can always bet more). If I had to guess, I'd say the start of next season might be a great time to take them, before those 3 all have solid numbers for a month and people realize. Kevin love should go away though, leave my guys alone so they can get their stats. Really disappointed with the Moses Brown trade too. I liked him on OKC where everybody could forget that he existed. Christian Wood better not go anywhere"
Bam and draymond? Bring one of Jarrett Allen or Myles turner
Jarrett Allen
It should be Jarrett Allen. He is a legitimately good rebounder with serviceable rim protection and post defense.
Is Jarrett Allen still in contention?
Don't forget Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert.  The Rockets probably left the best deal on the table because they didn't want to trade with Morey.
"I‚Äôd say, give Moses Brown some time and minutes and proper coaching guidance. In 3-4 years he can be what? Jarrett Allen?"
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"No arguments there.    What I don't think is a good idea is looking to replace a fairly affordable Ibaka-like contract with a $25M Jarrett Allen because the difference between an average center like Ibaka or Birch versus a potentially good or great one like Allen or Gobert isn't worth the additional $10-13M+.    The modern NBA and officiating biases toward big men makes them less necessary pieces on winning teams and watching Gobert get exposed in the play-offs tells me they should've had a cheaper center and allotted salary for better players to support Mitchell.  Traditional C's have lost significant value and the impactful ones like Embiid and Jokic are relevant because they've adapted to the modern game with the ability to shoot, pass and space the floor.  I remember Raptors fans losing their minds when JV would hit a 3 point shot on those awkward mechanics.  Now it's almost expected as players like Birch who shot more 3's this year than his entire previous career work to remain relevant in the modern NBA."
"Listen you‚Äôre out of your mind and it‚Äôs awesome. One day you will come back here and be like ‚Äúwow this comment brings me such joy, I was so wrong about getting the best player in the draft.‚Äù Jarret Allen is fine man but this kid is THE archetype of a title winning player. Look at AD and now Giannis - a flat footed 7 footer than can protect the rim, switch onto wings, and create his own offense? The ultimate asset in the NBA. Jarrett Allen?? Who cares."
Wiseman and 7 would definitely get the cavs answering when they already have Jarrett Allen.
If the Cavs are drafting based on Jarrett Allen than they should just fold as a franchise. I say that as a Cavs fan and Jarrett Allen fan
"If the cavs are locked in on Jarrett Allen, they should definitely look to trade the pick."
Losing ninja-band Jarrett Allen was a HUGE blow to this league. I miss NinJarrett every day
"1. Keep Chris Paul 2. Sign Crowder 3. Keep Gallo or sign another decent free agent 4. Trade Schroeder for Danny Green, but keep him instead of flipping for Horford.  5. Add Jarrett Allen for scraps (could have EASILY outbid the Cavs).   They could have been this year‚Äôs Suns. SGA would have given them 85% of Booker‚Äôs production at like 15% of the cost. They were the 4 seed last year and had a ton of assets and cap space to improve."
"Idk how its not obv the kid is clearly a troll. We've been trying to get Jarrett Allen for a while now, and still are hoping the cavs dont keep him."
Yeah exactly. Capela is really quite good but is extremely limited. And that‚Äôs probably what Allen‚Äôs high end is gonna be. You‚Äôd never want that kind of player making a max or near it if you were building a championship roster. You‚Äôd want a transcendent big or a scoring guard or a two way wing. We‚Äôve seen that be the blueprint again and again. So why is everyone so quick to label Jarrett Allen as worthy of a max
Jarrett Allen is nothing like what wood did  Allen is on his way out if mobley gets taken by the cavs immediately. Same can‚Äôt be said for Christian wood.
Hayes started launching threes toward the end of the season. I know the comparisons were always guys like Javale or Jarrett Allen but I‚Äôve thought of him as an Ibaka type if things go right for him. His shooting form and mechanics have looked good even before drafted. I do think he will have a decent and reliable three ball eventually which will be massive. I just don‚Äôt know if that will be with him in another uniform by the time this happens.
"Okay I'm not trying to deny your point, but using Kevin Love as your example of a good player? really? Have you seen him play lately lol.  Garland and Jarrett Allen were Sexton's best teammates last year."
"Paying one of the bright young scorers of the league 30m a year? Nah, trade his ass  Paying jarrett allen 20m a year to be your second center? &lt;Drake pointing meme&gt;"
Jarrett Allen has a decent shooting form btw I wonder if he'll ever become a Brook type of player
"The thing is, how many of those you just mentioned were obtainable for NOLA? Maybe Turner and Porzingis, but they are currently on the same level as Jonas, atleast I think so. Horford too old for NOLA, Jarrett Allen is an interesting option but maybe lacks experience as a starting center for a team that has just traded away a lot NBA experience and wants to move up. Valencuinas is a known quantity, he wont move the needle up by much but a stable performing center is a must for any team that wants to take the next step."
What about Sexton and Jarrett Allen
Wtf is Jarrett Allen doing there? Lmao
"USA first team: Curry, Harden, Lebron, KD and AD USA 2nd team: Trae, Klay, Kawai, Zion, Bam   USA 3rd team: Dame, booker, PG, Tatum, Jarrett Allen  I‚Äôm taking USA"
I think they should have taken Jarrett Allen and/or Brook Lopez
"People talk about all the most formidable 5s being from other countries, but the US still has the undisputed best depth there, AD, Adebayo, Jarrett Allen, Dwight Howard, Myles turner, jonathan Isaac..just too many injuries and sit outs this year.  This roster is a mix of America‚Äôs B or C team plus Durant. Still medal favorites.  Would love it if stars saw the olympics as an opportunity to flex their pesky defense skills without worrying about getting gassed. Would be fun to see a defensively minded roster. The league‚Äôs 12 best defenders would probably be an offensively decent squad anyway."
"Jarrett Allen is a free agent and could have declined the offer to avoid risking injury. He‚Äôs an athletic big whose value comes from his athleticism, so an injury could cost him tens of millions of dollars.  This is conjecture though, we‚Äôll never know for sure"
Jarrett Allen
That made me think that basically the cavs frontcourt from last year is team usa... but then that made me wonder why neither drummond nor jarrett allen are on the team.  Obviously neither are superstars but they are better than javale mcgee.
"Aside from AD, the best American big man is probably Jarrett Allen, unless I'm forgetting someone. That's fucking wild"
Did Jarrett Allen change his name to ‚Äúone‚Äù?
"Shut up bro you dont know what you are talking about.  Pop constructed this shit show of a roster himself, he hand selected players himself.  Inviting Love over any other big man was a huge joke then when he left the team he asks McGee and Keldon fucking Johnson.  What about Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Turner, or Julius Randle?  What about Ja Morant?  He made his bed and this loss will be a huge stain on his coaching record and may finally open people's eyes to the fact that Pop is no where near Phil Jackson or any of the other great coaches.  His managerial moves are overrated as well. He directly played a hand in getting DeRozan instead of Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart which would have set the Spurs up nicely instead of watching DeRozan (thus Kawhi) walk away with nothing.  He has no idea how to manage superstars or egos in the modern NBA and was a horrible choice to coach this team. Just dumb."
They really screwed up the bigs position. Could have had Jarrett Allen or Christian Wood. I‚Äôm happy for Javale but just not it.
"It is shocking. I feel like any idiot would just do this:  leave: K.Johnson, Draymond, Grant  pickup: Trae, Zion, Bridges  There's a reason all our real best players are sitting at home. They already won gold medals when they were young and passionate about facing a new challenge. Anthony Davis played team USA ball before his first NBA game. Instead we have Trae and Zion, the future faces of American basketball, sitting at home.   Not to mention JaVale lmao.  Timelord? Montrezl? Plumlee? Jarrett Allen? Nerlens Noel? Christian Wood? Richaun Holmes?"
"I'm pretty sure the best pure Center in the league who is only eligible to play for USA is either Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen.   Obviously AD playing Center would be the best, but still that's kinda crazy to think about."
I honestly think Jarrett Allen would have been better than Javale at least.
"I feel like better American centers are young: Chet Holmgren, Evan Mobley, types. Myles Tuner, Dwight Howard l, Jarrett Allen, Bam, Plumlee I guess.   Definitely the weakest position for the U.S."
"Roster was certainly poorly put together. There was a lot of talent like Zion or Ja or Fox or Young that I think should‚Äôve had a shot and would‚Äôve added a lot to this team. Christian Wood as well wouldve been interesting. Even Jarrett Allen or Mitchell Robinson. Team is seriously lacking an inside presence and a guard/wing who puts a lot of pressure on the paint. Not really a drive and kick guy on this roster. It‚Äôs really a bummer Lebron didn‚Äôt play, I get it with his age and recent injury, but he would‚Äôve solved so many problems for this team (not that that‚Äôs surprising he‚Äôs LeBron lol)."
Jarrett Allen?
Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen
"This is still in the ""if"" phase, which it has been since literally the beginning of this past season. Also, the Wiz would be dumb to take any package they doesn't involve Jaylen Brown, which defeats the purpose. I'm still very skeptical this could actually happen even if Beal wanted it.   And before anyone says ""reeee Brooklyn!"", the Celtics don't have anywhere near the package of picks and young upside players that Brooklyn used in that deal. Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen are not Romeo Langford and Robert Williams."
"I completely blocked out of my memory those DJ Wilson minutes  His nice NCAA tournament run led to him getting drafted too high (went ahead of guys like John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG Anunoby)"
They‚Äôre going to sign Jarrett Allen and trade Rozier for Lonzo in a S&amp;T
Jarrett Allen is 23 as well
Just keep 4 and go after Jarrett Allen since Cavs will get Mobley  Suggs/FVV/OG/Siakam/Jarrett Allen
Simmons is still more valuable than Jarrett Allen and Levert.  Or a broken Oladipo.
"It wasn‚Äôt directly to Houston, but the harden trade involved Jarrett Allen (who is probably getting a hefty offer in RFA, good player) and Caris Levert (I was at the Celtics nets game that he dropped 50, this dude is a baller). For Levert, the pacers had Oladipo (former all star with injury question marks) going to Houston. The picks were obviously the biggest factor, but the nets had to give up two very very very solid starting young players that have more room to develop and grow. It takes a lot to trade for a harden/Lillard type."
Jarrett Allen seems like a better match for the Warriors
"I mean if you want to bank on those unprotected picks turning into lotteries, I got a bridge I'd like to sell you. Nets under Sean Marks never tanked and made playoffs with D'Lo as their best player. To think that any of those picks would convey top 10 is fool's gold. Ben's trade value was way higher last year than it is now. Minny or Denver would've given up valuable assets for him at the time. Just because you acquire Ben doesn't mean you have to keep him and worry that you're gonna make the playoffs, you could flip him immediately and continue sucking for the foreseeable future.   &gt; Not acquiring Ben Simmons and bottoming out into the worst record in the league maximized getting a top pick and Cleveland did us a favor after routing them jarrett allen in harden trade.  &gt; Not to mention that KPJ never gets kicked off the team this year without the locker room incident which happened from... taurean prince entering cleveland as part of the harden trade.  &gt; Do you not see how everything is holistic and affects each other? Do you think we getting get the no 2 pick, getting kpj, developing kpj at point and him going 50 11 in a game, was compatible with us acquiring simmons this year?  Not gonna bother even arguing with this level of copium. The mental gymnastics some Rockets fans do to justify that trade lol"
[Dammrell] Evan Mobley doesn't think that he would be a good fit alongside Jarrett Allen.
"Yeah but ""get a real big man and we're contending"" to me seems like you're saying the Spurs just need Jarrett Allen and they can contend. Any team can say they will ""be a contender"" if they add one of the guys who just finished top 2 in MVP voting, the problem is that's nearly impossible to do."
"that's fair, he can stretch the floor a lot. Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen as a twin towers duo is not what I expected though lmao"
"I feel like Jarrett Allen should be a target for them. Looney's a good role player but the fact they don't have a vertical threat on their roster makes them look like an upperclassmen college team how they just run around ground level and hunt jumpers all game. Wiggins and JTA got hops but if they could crack the lid on some defenses with a reliable lob threat and a legitimate rim protector you dont squirm at going against other 5s it'd let Draymond play free safety a little more and focus on being where defenses *don't* want him, which is his most valuable defensive skill imho."
"Wiseman, Oubre + 7 for Jarrett Allen is a really interesting deal that I haven't seen get talked about nearly enough. There's also maybe something to a DeRozan deal for him to slot into that 6th man/wing creator role like Iguodala used to play. DeRozan might cost you Wiggins though and it ages your roster a bit though.."
"As a Portland fan, we traded 2 picks in an amazing draft for Zach Collins instead of Bam or Mitchell or staying put and getting guys like John Collins, OG, Jarrett Allen. This fucked us so hard. So, so hard. We had to hit in that draft and it was a great draft, and we just missed completely.  So yeah, your Gonzaga core team gargles ballsack like an NBA thot on all-star weekend."
"Given no injury issues, they have 2 MVPs on the floor at all times. So offensively they‚Äôll be great. Defensively they won‚Äôt survive without better forwards, but the biggest thing is Embiids replacement. Give them 2 from Steven Adams, Jarrett Allen, Rui, Millsap and they could do 65 wins, even with LiAngelo starting."
Conley  CJ  Slow-Mo  Giannis  Jarrett Allen
"Man, fuck *checks notes* Jarrett Allen?"
"1st of all, show me a SINGLE time Sexton has ever said he wants a MAX ? that's everyone else's words, not his. I havent seen a single time he's actually said that.  If the League's not ""super hot"" on Sexton (despite tons of 'rumors' every.single.day. about teams trying to throw all kinds of trade packages together to get him /) then let him test free agency and Cavs can match and then we'll see if he's worth a MAX per the market. Simple.   I've also seen reports about Love that the team love him, so which to believe ?  End of May:   ‚ÄúWhat people don‚Äôt see is his vulnerability with the players and his teammates. I don‚Äôt think people see his generosity,‚Äù said Altman, who last spoke to reporters in January. ‚ÄúIf he was an all-out bad guy and those plays that you talk about represented him, his teammates wouldn‚Äôt love him, wouldn‚Äôt want to be around him.‚Äù   ""Altman said Love gives the Cavs, who at one point were starting four players under 22, a needed mentor for younger players. He may have some quirks, but Love‚Äôs value stretches far beyond his ability to shoot and rebound.  ‚ÄúJarrett Allen loves Kevin and I asked him why and he said, ‚ÄòOff the court he provides leadership. He provides a sense of humility. He‚Äôs funny,‚Äô‚Äù Altman said. ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs been here a long time; he‚Äôs won a championship with us, so he has a lot of equity here. I love talking to him, I love being around him. He has his moments, but he‚Äôs ours and he‚Äôs uniquely Kevin Love.‚Äù https://www.sharonherald.com/sports/cavaliers-still-view-love-as-valuable-piece-in-slow-rebuild/article_231018e0-c021-11eb-9cdb-d3711fb80ed6.html  I'll just re-visit these threads in a few weeks when none of this actually happens."
I wouldn‚Äôt trade both picks for 3 either.  We have the Bulls pick in 23 and the Nuggets pick in 25.  Is package those picks with number 5 to move up plus a player or two if Cleveland doesn‚Äôt want to pay Jarrett Allen and Sexton.
"From 8 FRPs to 10.  Still if you could snag 2 other max contracts that offseason, say Kawhi and Jarrett Allen, you'd be laughing."
Playing Mobley at the 4 next to Jarrett Allen is not what‚Äôs best for Mobley and his development.
"Ask Jarrett Allen, he dared to keep hold of the ball."
"Strength: Deep through 1-15, team chemistry, shooting, defense  Weakness: Turnovers, a competent center(Javale McGee-Jarrett Allen), a driving threat (a more agressive Andrew Wiggin-Zion Williamson)"
"Between this &amp; judo throwing Jarrett Allen in the previous game, Scottie's showing signs of dominant strength."
Remember when he elbowed Jarrett Allen in the face then laughed about it at the press conference? I‚Äôm still blown away by that
Anybody remember when he elbowed Jarrett Allen in the face then laughed about it at the press conference?
Obviously it‚Äôs Jarrett Allen at the end of the shot clock from 3
I still remember when Embiid elbowed Jarrett Allen in the Jaw couple years back. Then he laughs about it with Simmons in the post game. Dirty AF player.
Rockets chose wood over Jarrett Allen
"I don‚Äôt know if Jarrett Allen has a million pairs of the same pair of black/white Kyrie 3s or what, but dude has worn that exact pair for as long as he‚Äôs been in the league"
Im happy my son Jarrett Allen is flourishing  &amp;#x200B;  all mans do is pick that unnecessarily large fro and patrol the paint
"Jarrett Allen hit a last second bank 3, shit happens"
&gt; Jarrett Allen  Could we have afforded him? He has a 100M dollar contract

"Jarrett Allen, also.  Houston trying to rebuild Cavs fast."
"Zion, Wood, Jarrett Allen"
Jarrett Allen is making a good case for himself this year.
"lmao no kidding, 17 made 3s in a 6 year career, glad we got to be graced with Jarrett 'Steph Curry' Allen.   At this rate he will hit his next 3 around January or so"
Jarrett Allen is also known for his arm flailing. Love the guy but he would get a couple calls every game from just flailing his arms on screens
I honestly never say this but fuck those refs!  Credit to the Cavs at the same time! Yall got a squad! Id kill to have Jarrett Allen or Even Mobley if I could!   I feel so annoyed though. Freds horrible shot to ice the game. The goaltend that wasnt called? 2 solid defensive possessions at the end of the game only for OG to trip him up and send him to the line. So many missed opportunities!   And so many fuckin bad calls!
Refs are killing me with all these overturned calls! I am so salty. Shout out to Jarrett Allen though wish the Raps picked him up.
Jarrett Allen has back to back game saving contests! What a beast!!
We played like shit. we don‚Äôt have answers for your bigs.    Do you know how many threes Jarrett Allen had made? I can‚Äôt believe he made that bruh.   Also garland didn‚Äôt miss in the 2nd half. He‚Äôs a lot of fun to watch
Jarrett Allen not having a single foul call against him and the Cavs still having one to give at the end is disgusting. They were getting away with murder.
Those calls at the end were trash. Garland should have never received those free throws. Shout out to Jarrett Allen though for hitting a 3
"Jarrett Allen got $100,000,000.00 in the   #BANK"
jarrett allen lmfao  picking the fro out with the 3 is an ELITE celebration.
I do appreciate how Jarrett Allen tackled two guys mid air and no foul was called. Very cool.
AD for Jarrett Allen!
and the fact that they had to start him over Jarrett Allen to keep DJ happy.. such a joke lol
"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Maybe I‚Äôm biased but it‚Äôs an Absolute sham that Jarrett Allen or Garland isn‚Äôt on this list but cam reddish is
Jarrett Allen has improved significantly but idk if we will be good enough for him to get noticed
&gt; but...has that paid off at all?  I would say it has paid off in years past in that a lot of those teams overachieved for the youth of the stars.   But the money Smart gets in that next deal would have been much better spent on a Jarrett Allen type who can anchor the defense and does not care about shots as much or take bad 3s. Now they have too many guards and the ones you want to get rid of are not that movable.

They quickly forgot how Jarrett Allen went on spree and had a block party tally on every big all-star that season  https://youtu.be/By1RI2QqUUg
"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS¬†has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched¬†[Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers)¬†center¬†[Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen)¬†vault over¬†[Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee)¬†to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it:¬†[Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges)¬†sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball¬†[hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171)¬†over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds¬†after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.  ""He really is a basketball savant,"" says¬†[Charlotte Hornets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets)' teammate and 12-year veteran point guard¬†[Ish Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4305/ish-smith). ""You watch him make these calculated-risk passes, and I'm like, 'How did he even think about throwing it like that?'""  Sheer¬†chutzpah.  A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his r√©sum√© has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward¬†[Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and¬†[P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington)¬†could make jumps and add to production provided by¬†[Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from¬†[Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics)¬†a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ÔøºThrough the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3.¬†Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN¬†flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like¬†[Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks),¬†[Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons)¬†and¬†[Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic)¬†all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as¬†turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
I will never root against the Cavs unless they‚Äôre playing the Nets. And that‚Äôs because of Jarrett Allen.  I really hope he makes the All-Star this year. He deserves it so far.
"At the end of the season, someone should make a compilation of guards being excited when they switch onto Evan Mobley, only to be shocked when Mobley keeps up with them and blocks their shot at the rim. Dame was his latest victim and it'll never get old!  Also, Jarrett Allen better be an all star this year."
Jarrett Allen is the fucking TRUTH.
I would do some evil things for a Jarrett Allen
"Plus when we were within one, grabbed the rebound and they called a foul on Roco when he was clearly hooked by Jarrett Allen"
Jarrett Allen is an Allstar
In a game in which we shot 53% from the field and 50% from 3 we really tried hard to give this one away. 13 second half turnovers nearly cost them the game but Jarrett mother fucking Allen absolutely stemmed the tide and carried us to the W.
Lillard actually switched off Cedi for Jarrett Allen on the last playüòÇ
JARRETT ALLEN IS A TOP 5 CENTER IN THIS LEAGUE
God damn Dame is cold this year  ALSO JARRETT ALLEN OWNS YOUR FRANCHISE (29 TEAMS INCLUDED)
Jarrett Allen going full 2016 Kevin Love Game 7 defense on the last play
How we feeling about Jarrett Allen? Holy shit.
I am still so dumbfounded we lucked our way into Jarrett Allen in that whole thing.
"I‚Äôd trade Jarrett Allen, Collin Sexton, and unprotected 2022 1st for Tatum, but Boston would probably just hang up lol"
"I saw someone calling Evan Mobley ""Evan Garnett"" the other day and that really tickled me.  When Matthew Dellavedova was here, Outback Jesus was a pretty good name.  Of course there's Sexland for Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  There's been the name floating around for our trio of 7-footers (Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, Lauri Markkanen) of ""Tower City"" because there's an area in Cleveland called the Tower City Center. Though personally, as a Kent State alum, I'm hoping to get the name ""Tri-Towers"" going because those were the dorms I lived in."
Darius garland and Jarrett Allen for Brown
"Garland, Jarrett Allen"
"Need someone like Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen to be a sure shot play-off team, might as well go to 2nd round as well with a good center.  If not I think we will be again in the play in spots and may go out from there."
"Kings are okay. we've had a tough schedule and are 3-3 despite that so we'll take it. our defense is better this year, but it's mostly effort-based. in reality we're an average to mediocre team which is honestly delightful given that Fox doesn't seem like himself at all. if he can get himself straight and start being an honest threat again, we might have a shot at making the playoffs.   I really wish we could get a big that could guard the rim - Holmes is great and all but he doesn't have the physical tools of a defensive big, and it kills us. people always want to put Simmons on our team but I'd be more excited to make a move for a guy like Jarrett Allen or Myles Turner or whoever."
And Houston willingly making the worst trade of the decade.   You get harden we get ~~Jarrett Allen~~  ~~Oladipo~~ ~~Kelly Olynyk~~

An hour ago I was ready to murder Jarrett Allen but cavs but I do generally cheer for the cavs
"Are people saying Jarrett Allen is overpaid? Fuck them, as a Nets fan he was fantastic for us. He‚Äôs got such a bright future"
"While true, Jarrett Allen just has our number like no other. Dude's been cooking us since his Nets days."
Evan Allen  Jarrett Mobley
People will talk about the refs &amp; whatnot but I just hope we never see Jarrett Allen again tbh. Man destroyed us tonight.
Man I know but look: we trailed by 19 after the 1st quarter and Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 5 dunks I think. Maybe the Cavs still would have had 40 points but maybe if PJ starts we score 28 instead of 21 and just that difference wins the game in the end. Being down 19 and completely soul-crushingly dominated was just too much to climb out of.
Jarrett Allen should be an all-star this year. I will hear no arguments against it.
Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen payed the refs
ill never forget Embiid getting a flagrant for a clean strip on Jarrett Allen in that playoff series just because the nets organization threw such a bitch fit
Jarrett Allen @ Halftime vs hornets: 17/6/1 on 8-9 from the field. Wow
"Where do you think they get it from?  If you redraft 2016 and 2017, do Brown and Tatum get drafted any higher than they did in real life? Probably not.  Brown is 8th in BBRef Win Shares among the 2016 draft class, after Simmons, Sabonis, Siakam, Poeltl, Brogdon, Murray, and Zubac. A redraft today, he probably goes after Simmons and Murray ‚Äì third, just like he was originally.  Tatum is 3rd in Win Shares among the 2017 draft class, after Bam and Jarrett Allen. In a redraft, he'd probably go after Donovan Mitchell and Bam.   Both are solid players, but they've been treated like superstars-in-waiting by the NBA media for years."
Just trade him for whatever value you can get. It's Garland and Mobley's team with Jarrett Allen as a big piece.
"&gt; But he's 6'2"" and we have a roster of other players we want to take shots.  I don't watch the Cavs much, but who are you referring to? Sexton is fourth on the team in TS%, only behind Jarrett Allen, Osman, and Mobley. I really doubt you're referring to Allen or Osman, so who is on this 'roster of players' you'd rather have taking shots?  I don't think Sexton is great or anything, but in my experience, he gets ripped way, way more than he deserves."
"5 years 100-110 mill is probably fair, similar to what they paid to Jarrett Allen. It would be a mistake to let him walk."
I don't see Jarrett Allen being the answer. But that's just me.
Our odds of being really really good is as high as it gets. I can't say with a straight face that we're winning it all. But we're a Jarrett Allen away from being the favorites.
"This is not the same Warriors team tho... and remember, we have to consider if Klay comes back and gets outplayed by Poole and others/allowing Klay to chill and continue to rehab more while coming back slower than everybody anticipates he will need to. Which makes him deadlier come playoff time.  And... what if Wiseman returns, *awake*, more along the lines of a Robert Williams or DeAndre Ayton or Jarrett Allen?  These are plausible realities we can see."
[LeBron bearhugging Jarrett Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_XUAoDH7tk&amp;ab_channel=MLGHighlights)
"If only Jarret Allen played more water polo he would have known to throw both his hands straight up in the air to demonstrate he was not the one initiating contact.  Water polo is chock full of moves like this where you are basically trying to trick the official in to calling a foul. The responsibility to prove you are not fouling falls on the defender, usually in the form of showing both palms above the water to demonstrate you are not holding the offensive player below water as a lot of offensive players will drown themselves to get a call.  That's exactly what Lebron did. He drowned himself, Jarrett Allen didn't get his hands up and so he was punished."

Can‚Äôt see makes but Mitch Robinson Got 77% on 18 attempts and Jarrett Allen got 33% on 17 attempts.
I laughed so hard when Jarrett Allen ran Russ off the 3pt line for a dunk. Bonehead decision.
Jarrett Allen needs to get his head in the game
"Okay first off. Chill. Was there anywhere in my comment that said ""Allen was totally blameless and didn't hug back at all.""  I saw LeBron initiate a smart foul bait. Jarrett took the bate. I audibly laughed."
Now where it the post of the clip of him running up and grabbing Jarrett Allen from behind and Allen being called for the foul
"Bron literally ran up on Jarrett Allen and grabbed him, and they called it on JarrettüòÇ open ur eyes"
Lol LeBron got hit by 2 dudes and it‚Äôs nothing. LeBron goes and hugs Jarrett Allen and that gets him a call. The calls suck this year
"Dang, reading ""replacement for Jarrett Allen"" made me sad"
killed us the first 3 quarters of the game. Looks like they found a good replacement for Jarrett Allen already
"""like harden is good and all, but what about JARRETT ALLEN"" what a fucking take dude, you just traded 2 non all stars for a top 5 player HAHA you still complain? jfc which would have been a good trade? should houston have given some picks too? jfc"
"""like harden is good and all, but what about JARRETT ALLEN"" what a fucking take dude, you just traded 2 non all stars for a top 5 player HAHA you still complain? jfc which would have been a good trade? should houston have given some picks too? jfc"
"Definitely. Not gonna lie, I'm a little bummed that we lost most of the super likable guys from the last few years, and losing Jarrett Allen sucks, but this is a slam dunk great trade for the Nets. And we kept our guard/wing depth with Harris/TLC/Shamet/Brown. Definitely need another big man, though."
"Simmons easily tops this offer, so why would they need to sweeten it with Maxey or Shake? I would be pissed if I were you, they couldn't even get Jarrett Allen!"
"Nets certainly got more star power, but the fit is questionable with all 3 players preferring the ball in their hands and the the rest of the roster having no depth at all  Oh and they are losing Jarrett Allen then its bad news for their defense &amp; rim protection as well."
"Wizards could, Hornets could, Raptors could, Celtics could.  He's an expiring too so it's not like he's eating up money for multiple years. We have Jarrett Allen now so Drummond is genuinely not needed."
"It's actually only 3 picks! 2022, 2024, and 2026 firsts, then swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025, and 2027. The 4th first is from the Cavs for Jarrett Allen, not from us."
Drummond is most likely gone this year. Kevin Love definitely isnt in our future plans. Getting Jarrett Allen to be our future center is a great get by Koby.
Lowkey a good move for them tho if they can move off Drummond. A late FRP for Jarrett Allen is a steal imo
Lowkey a good move for them tho if they can move off Drummond. A late FRP for Jarrett Allen is a steal imo
"I feel bad for Jarrett Allen, he has to compete against the legendary Thon Maker for the centre position"
"&gt;Allen looks like he could be special on defense.  Again, not all that rare for that position.  Just look at how cheap players like Noel, WCS, or Dwight Howard signed deals for.  All of whom are slightly worse or slightly better than Jarrett Allen.   &gt; Since you're going to be playing against Embiid, Jokic, and AD - having a center who can actually play some defense against them has plenty of value.  Allen can't compete against any of those guys.  The way you defend against those centers is with team defense and properly executed double teams.    This isn't the 90s anymore.  One on one defense isn't really how it works."
They gots to be trading Drummond right? Jarrett Allen is too good to come off the bench I think
"Caris leVert and Jarrett Allen for James Harden? They‚Äôre absolutely better. They may not be favorites to win the title over the Lakers, but trading two role players for an MVP in their prime absolutely makes a team better regardless of ‚Äúfit‚Äù concerns"
"Bruh you just drove by and stole Jarrett Allen from the trade and now you be eating popcorn, feels good"
Do you think Jarrett Allen will cry in his first game back in Brooklyn and seeing all his old buddies face-to-face again  Cus I would :(
"Are you kidding? How was Dinwiddie, Le Vert, Jarrett Allen, and multiple picks not better for Houston in the preseason when Brooklyn was willing to give them everything not named KD/Kyrie? Instead they just got Oladipo, scrubs, and picks which half are worthless?"
"So I think this actually a good, smart move by the Cavs taking advantage of the situation. Jarrett Allen brings a long-term solution to a team that has none in the center position. Drummond and McGee are both free agents at the end of the season, Nance isn‚Äôt a rim protector like Allen and Love isn‚Äôt in their plan.  This season doesn‚Äôt exactly matter how it goes for them, and they essentially secured a very good starting center for a long time for a dirt cheap price."
They‚Äôll trade/let Drummond walk  They‚Äôll trade/let McGee walk   They already waived thon  Larry Nance is a forward   They‚Äôll match any Jarrett Allen offer   They‚Äôll keep love until he ups his value
"If you can trade a late first round pick for Jarrett Allen, you do it. He is their big of the future"
they‚Äôre not going to be good anyway so might as well get as much young talent as possible  Jarrett Allen is a peace for the future literally no one else on that list is
The Nets didn't need more offense. They didn't need anything really. But they definitely needed Jarrett Allen.
why the fuck would we give up jarrett allen
Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert are my two favorite players   :(
Jarrett Allen said today he and the team have been communicating. Stop it.
"""Center of the future"" doesn't mean much in today's NBA.  Unless you're talking about an Embiid, Jokic, or AD, the rest are very easily replaceable role players and that includes players like Jarrett Allen. The improvement from Javale and Drummond to Allen isn't that much.    On top of all that, Allen is entering RFA this year, so you'll have to pay him or let him walk or be unhappy playing under the QO.    The justifiable argument to trade for Jarrett would be if you had almost all the components to be a contending team and he was the missing piece.  But i doubt this trade brings any additional wins to the Cavs."
"The nets would rather play a 3,000 year old Jew at the 5 than Jarrett Allen"
"I agree that good players can be found in the late first round and second round. That‚Äôs how we got KPJ, but I fail to understand why we lose out on this trade. We gave up an injured exum and practically 2 seconds for a potential center of the future. We could find another Jarrett Allen in the draft but draft picks are gambles, so I‚Äôm happy receiving a proven player in Allen for almost nothing. This also provides us some flexibility in moving Drummond. I think Allen also fits our team with him being a low usage player that gets boards and plays great defense."
Jarrett Allen running the floor with Garland and Sexton should be fun.
"I agree if they play to potential they‚Äôre the best team in the league, but the issues with Harden and Kyrie doesn‚Äôt guarantee that. Kyrie doesn‚Äôt look hungry if he was he‚Äôd be playing right now, Harden is questionable but he likes being the focus of the offense and when he‚Äôs not he‚Äôs lazy, These 2 players also had problems following COVID-19 rules the NBA has in place, what if they have to miss 14 days because they didn‚Äôt follow the rules during the playoffs?  The nets also lose Jarrett Allen and will have to play Jordan who hasn‚Äôt played good, another question for the nets is who‚Äôs the leader?"
I'm interested in one Jarrett Allen
"Phew internet just came back on in time for the game, really excited to watch my favorite players Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert ball out tonight against the Knicks!"
Jarrett Allen is great but he doesn‚Äôt fit the Rockets schedule. He‚Äôs cheap this year then a RFA in the summer. Depending on his next contract and his play he could have minimal excess value after this season. The Rockets shifted their schedule a few years out with the wall and harden trades.
I'm a Warriors fan and don't hate the Nets. I do like them less because they traded Jarrett Allen and hope he ends up in a good place. But I still love KD. He helped bring us two rings!
Dipo is expiring. Cavs gave up a Bucks first for Jarrett Allen. Houston is up in the air at this point. Nets are also up in the air until we see them play.
"Definitely, Jarrett Allen looks Like a legit good young player and prince is decent. I‚Äôd take Allen&gt; over exum and a later frp."
Jarrett Allen  Sexland  Jedi Osman
Sucks man. Jarrett Allen no longer a Net...
I don't care. Jarrett Allen is gone. There is no joy left in my world.
Cavs for Jarrett Allen and Garland.     It be funny
"We‚Äôre getting more dudes with big boy appetites, he may have to bring extra  I‚Äôm so hyped for this though, from a basketball standpoint. In a vacuum we gave up Dante Exum, a bench player who never stuck and that we didn‚Äôt need, and a first round pick for *Jarrett Allen* and Taurean Prince. It‚Äôll be a lot of sharing the paint, but good luck getting to the rim on us"
Lol only good bench pieces they traded away were Caris and Jarrett Allen and they got a top 5 player in harden back
"Right, I figured Jarrett Allen would have the best shot but he gone now."
"Bruh cavs gave up a Mil pick and Dante for Jarrett Allen and Taursean Prince, underated move imo"
What about Jarrett Allen?
"Cavs low key getting an absolute STEAL in Jarrett Allen. Also, Rockets may have gotten better this year plus secured 4 first round picks to build on. A+ for them."
And Jarrett Allen was dealt but we let the Cavs have him for their 2022 Bucks first rounder. What in the fuck.
"""The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four-pick swaps, all unprotected. Those picks will come from Brooklyn in 2022, 2024 and 2026 along with Milwaukee in 2022 (previously owned by Cleveland), and the swaps will come from Brooklyn in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.

"I like Jarrett Allen, but did the Cavs really trade a 1st round pick for him? Exum's contract wasnt that bad."
"This is just not true. Jarrett Allen was picked with Wizards' pick from Bojan Bogdanovic trade. Dzanan Musa was picked with Toronto's pick from Demarre Carroll trade. Neither were traded before they played with the Nets.  Nets picks ended up in Boston/Cleveland until 2018. Their 2019 pick was traded for philly's 2020 first, which was traded for Shamet in a 3 team trade."
Okay but how the fuck did the Cavs get Jarrett Allen?
Jarrett Allen deserved so much better than this :( we‚Äôll miss him
Nets don't have rim protection (Sorry DJ but we know) since they traded away Jarrett Allen.   BBQ Chicken for the Lakers all game.
Maybe they could get someone like Jarrett Allen
"Exactly and in finals games he can play that role 20 min a game against a marc gasol let's say.  Also another point to make tho. In 2016 when Andrew bogut went out for games 5-7 of the finals, lebrons mentality changed for various resons(Drayton, desperation) but also no true big in the paint. Jarrett Allen is a guy that has blocked lebron. I think in minutes DJ is off the floor, the combo of AD and lebron offensively is tough to defend with no true shot blocking big. Also do we know if DJ can even pkay at that level in finals games at this point in his career given either age or lack of playoff success."
"I'm guessing they'll find a way to get rid of Drummond and keep Jarrett for the future. Allen is up for a new deal at the end of this year, I don't think they'd trade for him without planning on re-signing him."
"Fertitta found out Jarrett Allen actually is paid a salary to play basketball, and he wants no part of that shit."
"Drummond, Javale, and Jarrett Allen all on one team"
Just run Jarrett Allen at point guard. Have you seen his handles?   /s
I mean I'd take jarrett allen too
"That‚Äôs a big swing from Brooklyn, but it SEEMS they should be in contention with Harden and KD for the next 3 years. The back end could be ugly but even if the last few years are rough again, it shouldn‚Äôt be as bad as the Boston deal barring a worst case scenario playing out.   The Rockets loaded up on first round picks but flipping LeVert and the 2nd for Oladipo seems like a strange choice given he‚Äôll be 29 in May and I think his contract is up at the end of the year. Oladipo is neither a young franchise cornerstone nor veteran star on a long term deal.  They‚Äôre either stuck overpaying for him this offseason, or letting him walk and completely rebuild, and in either case, why not just keep LeVert? (Younger, cheaper, can still trade him later if you want to)  The Cavs traded Exum and a late first round pick (Milwaukee) for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince‚Äôs contract (which has another year on it at $13 million)  I don‚Äôt get bringing in another center who wants money for the Cavs but I guess it isn‚Äôt a bad move talent-wise.   The Pacers just snagging LeVert for Oladipo‚Äôs expiring and getting a second round pick for their troubles seems like nice business."
"this was a bad defense who just got significantly worse losing by far their most impactful defender in jarrett allen. defense will be a big time worry, but being able to have at least one star/superstar on the court for 48 minutes should mitigate that issue a bit."
"Trade him for Jarrett Allen, Rodion Kurucs, Caris Levert, and Taurean Prince. Get a haul of picks, reinvigorate the defense with some youth."
The nets are not a super team. Jesus people you cant just take any 3 well know players and call them a super team. The Nets would have been better off likely if they'd traded Kyrie and retained Jarrett Allen. I give it exactlyv2 weeks until both Kyrie and Harden are disgruntled with their touches and the over under on points against per game will start at 125
"I‚Äôd see them going for Jarrett Allen,Drummond, love or McGee before oladipo"
"The Nets done fucked up again! I understand adding LeVert to the trade, but Jarrett Allen is so much better and younger than DeAndre. This soap opera is not gonna end well..."
All this talk about Jarrett Allen you would think he is a future superstar or something.
"The Nets sent Houston a package that includes multiple players and draft picks and features guard Caris LeVert, who was then traded to the Pacers for Victor Oladipo, sources tell ESPN.  Center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince are headed from the Nets to the Cavs in the deal, according to sources, while the Rockets receive Cleveland guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs  Houston also receives Brooklyn's three unprotected first-round draft picks -- 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- in the deal, plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to sources. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the Milwaukee Bucks.  Wow"
So the Cavs really gave up the perpetually injured Dante Exum and a late first for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince? Completely fleeced em
"I'm not sure if this is complete, but from what I gather:  To Brooklyn:  * James Harden (obviously)  To Houston:  * Dante Exum * Victor Oladipo * Rodions Kurucs for some reason * Two 2022 firsts, a 2024 first and a 2026 first  To Cleveland:  * Jarrett Allen * Taurean Prince  To Indy:  * Caris LeVert"
"We get Jarrett Allen? Well, I‚Äôm hyped  My team with Prince and Allen and the Nets with Harden-Irving-Durant. This season just got more interesting"
you guys got jarrett allen for...dante exum and a first or two?  ....thats it?
"Via @ShamsCharania on Twitter  ""Sources: Full current trade:  Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)   Nets: James Harden  Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder  Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"""
aw man just when I was starting to dig the vibe in Brooklyn. now they DON'T have Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince and they HAVE Harden. oh well. Going back to my Wiz kidz.
"They're going to need to trade Kyrie for more depth. Their depth just got destroyed, and they have no picks for the future. Dude ain't showing up to work anyway. And the Nets biggest problem is not enough defense. DeAndre Jordan w/ no Jarrett Allen sounds like a disaster in the paint."
Cave won this trade. Idk how the fuck they got Jarrett Allen for basically nothing I bet most NBA teams would give up a similar deal even if they don't need him
"   The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to acquire James Harden from the Houston Rockets.  The Rockets will acquire four first round picks and four pick swaps. Brooklyn will send out Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince as part of the package.¬†  The Cleveland Cavaliers will acquire Allen and Prince while sending a 2022 first round pick from the Milwaukee Bucks, Rodions Kurucs and Dante Exum to the Rockets."
"I understand they HAD TO include Allen and they're getting Harden, so no real loss, but what a loss, Jarrett Allen is a max player for sure"
"i highly doubt the deal blew up over Maxey, or because Fertitta doesn't want to deal with Morey for that matter. i think it's very obvious Fertitta is trying to save money. look at it more closely:  why send Jarrett Allen and Prince to the Cavs for Exum and a '22 Bucks first, a pick that will surely be in the 20s? that's a bad return on for those guys if you look at it in a vacuum. but Prince has another year on his deal for 15m and Allen is RFA next summer while Exum is expiring.  and right after that they traded LeVert, who will make 17/18 for the next 2 years, for Oladipo, who is also expiring."
Wasn't the Jarrett Allen pick from the Wizards?
Jarrett Allen!  Oh...wait
"Houston sends Harden to Brooklyn  Cleveland sends one First round pick and one Second round pick to Brooklyn  Brooklyn sends Chris LeVert, Rodions Kurucs, Four first round picks, and Four pick swaps to Houston  Brooklyn sends Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to Cleveland  Houston sends Chris Levert to Indiana  Indiana sends Victor Oladipo to Houston  Cleveland sends Dante Exum to Houston"
"Love is essentially done, Drummond is an expiring contract, Javale is a 1-yr deal. Plus it‚Äôs JARRETT ALLEN we‚Äôre talking about here"
"Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)    Nets: James Harden    Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder    Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"
Jarrett Allen deserves better than this.
"Oh for sure, I'm just talking about the bench  Their interior defense was already weak and they lost jarrett allen"
"The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four pick swaps, all of which will come from the Nets except for a 2022 Milwaukee pick currently owned by Cleveland. Houston will also receive Caris LeVert, Dante Exum and Rodions Kurucs. The Cavaliers will get Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince in the deal, according to¬†ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.¬†"
This is one of the most wild trades of all time. Exactly why I love the NBA!   Jarrett Allen got screwed tho
"Prince has been pretty bad, so it‚Äôs really a late 1st for Jarrett Allen which is solid value IMO."
Browns beat the Steelers in the playoffs and y'all manage to get Jarrett Allen out of the Harden deal. It's a good week for Cleveland and I'm here for it.
"Per Shams   Full current trade:  Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)   Nets: James Harden  Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder  Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"
So they traded the Bucks pick and Exum for Jarrett Allen and Prince? Great trade
"Man, why doesn‚Äôt anyone want Jarrett Allen who doesn‚Äôt already have a C they‚Äôre committed to starting?"
"I was about to get Jarrett Allen in my fantasy league, good thing Woj said his piece."
"Is it though?  They don't want LeVert (who they turned around and flipped to Ind for a rental of Oladipo).  So its basically 4 1sts and 4 swaps, at least 2 swaps are guaranteed to be useless- and likely more b/c Hou is unlikely to be good 3 years from now.  Plus a starter in Jarrett Allen, who could have trouble playing with Wood.  The 1sts are a total question mark.  But Bkn is going to be a fuckton better than they were with KG and Pierce- who were already breaking down.  It's roughly similar to the Jrue Holiday haul."
"Cavs traded an utterly shite contract in Dante Exum and ended up with Jarrett Allen, lol."
We got Jarrett Allen? Well damn lol
Lol people think this is a super team. gave up Jarrett Allen. Basically they said let's be able to beat every team but Lakers. Lebron and Davis with free paint. love it
"Do you feel like Jarrett Allen getting traded, essentially, for a late 1st would affect the market for Lonzo?  They're both RFAs with Allen being arguably a much more promising player."
Jarrett Allen&gt;Adams
Lol is it Jarrett Allen or is he that hyped for Ja Morant lmao
Really wish they had someone like Jarrett Allen
"Any possibility of a Drummond buyout? With the Cavs getting Jarrett Allen, it seems unlikely Drummond will return next season. There isn‚Äôt a trade partner out there for his salary size. Buyout would save Cavs money, and possibly allow them to get a better draft pick. Drummond would be an amazing pickup for the Nets"
"No one is guarding Embiid, Giannis or AD.  Jarrett Allen wasn't.  Taurean Prince wasn't.  Jeff Green at the 5 gives the Nets the most switchable lineup.  There is going to mismatch no matter what, but determinations have to be made.  I'm sure the Nets would rather have AD than Harden or Kyrie but they can't get him.    BTW I like Bam, but offensively he is not in the same conversation as the other three."
I'll take one Jarrett Allen
Jarrett Allen is completely average but for some reason (the hair maybe?) this sub is in love with him atm
I hear Cleveland has an exciting young center named Jarrett Allen!
Yeah they should get someone like Jarrett Allen
"Giving away Jarrett Allen definitely did hurt for sure. Interior defense has been bad, but without him, it'll be worse.   Hoping Sean finds someone, but as of right now, defense is pretty horrendous. All around. Big time. Of not, Nicholas Claxton needs to find his knees. He was solid in a small sample."
for real.. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh after the third failed lob attempt.   It pains me to think how perfect Jarrett Allen would have been paired with Harden. Hopefully Claxton can become that guy for him.
Trade him to the Cavs to get back Jarrett Allen
"Jarrett Allen in a vacuum is worth more than a late first, but with the time pressure and viewed as part of the whole deal, the Nets were willing to take a loss on one part of the deal to get Harden. Kinda like the Clippers trading all those picks for PG13."
i could see jarrett allen fitting nicely on the nets
"A lineup with KD, Kyrie, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris can basically have those guys take all the shots and combine for Harden-level efficiency, so it makes way more sense in this situation."
Cleveland riots as Jarrett Allen slowly heads back to Brooklyn.
you gotta consider they have Jarrett Allen now and Drummond's cap hit is huge - offloading him is definitely something they want to do but I'm not sure at what price
&gt; Jordan is so fucking bad  It's been that way for a while. He's only there as a starter because he's friends with the star players. Giving up Jarrett Allen was likely not something that came easy for the FO
Maybe they can offer him up for something like... Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen lol
But it‚Äôs a late first from the bucks next year. For the nets he‚Äôs probably the difference maker for being a middling defense and one of the worst in the league. Could the nets not have figured out something else to sweeten the deal. Just seems like Jarrett Allen is worth more then a late first.
Maybe we can get Jarrett Allen from the cavs
"Yeah, especially after they finally put Jarrett Allen in the starting lineup... Just for them to trade him."
Maybe someone like Jarrett Allen!
Kyrie to the Cavs for Jarrett Allen who says no????
They should trade him for Jarrett Allen
"They missing Jarrett allen big time. Their defense might be a problem, excited to see the nets play against one of the LA teams"
Jarrett allen died for this
"Bro if we has a guy like.. say.. Jarrett Allen, this would be a blow out."
Man a Jarrett Allen James Harden pick and roll would have been deadly
Kyrie for Jarrett Allen and Drummond lol
as far as I know Brooklyn sent Jarrett Allen directly to Cleveland. I assume it started as a three team trade but then Houston decided to involve Indiana
should‚Äôve kept jarrett allen and given away kyrie tbh  like how much more offense do you need if you have harden and kd?
Nets basically gave up Jarrett Allen.  Harden replaces Levert. Kurucs was a benchwarmer. Taurean Prince is absolute garbage.   Allen is a huge loss and I'm sad to see him go. But we didn't destroy our depth.
Add Jarrett Allen to the list
What does finalized mean though?  Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen were at last night's game on the Cavaliers bench in Cavaliers warm-ups.   James Harden already had his introductory press conference and the Nets are using him in marketing material.   How would any of that be legal if the trade was not approved by the league office?
They just traded for Jarrett Allen who is better and younger.
If they wanna slide Jarrett Allen and 2 if those pics for Demar I wouldn't mind
"Yea I feel bad for Jarrett Allen, he seemed to be doing so well and enjoying himself on that team"
I feel the Cavs got out with a pretty sweet deal. Jarrett Allen and all they gave up was Exum and 2022 1st rounder.
"Shout out Jarrett Allen, who outplayed DeAndre Jordan and still got used as filler"
"Harden to Nets. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
Jarrett Allen to the Cavs is weird
"drummond is not part of the cavs future, let‚Äôs be real. jarrett allen is twice as valuable"
Poor Jarrett Allen. The man‚Äôs never gonna start
Cavs with the steal in this trade. Jarrett Allen has a bright future and they can trade Drummond for pennies on the dollar to a contender now
FREE JARRETT ALLEN HE AIN'T DO NOTHING WRONG
Nope. They got a big 3. 3-team deal with the Cavs.  Nets gave up LeVert (Rockets) and Jarrett Allen (Cavs) plus picks
"Nobody probably cares but I really feel for Jarrett Allen. He's been behind shitty Deandre Jordan cause of ""friendship"" for 1.5 years with no peep. Now he's gonna be sitting behind Drummond? Dude deserves to be a starter in the league and given a full role"
Damn they really sold out. Also shoutout to the cavs for landing another big man. In all honesty tho Jarrett Allen compared to what they gave up was worth
"lmao, I can't believe they gave up Jarrett Allen. Someone's got to play defense and rebound on that team. I guess Deandre Jordan is their guy now."
What does Cleveland need with Jarrett Allen? They already have like an entire roster of centers.
Hornets will take Jarrett Allen please.
"Yes, but who cares. Just draft the next Jarrett Allen and you can get away with it again."
"Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
"Assuming irving is staying in Brooklyn, the trade has to include Jarrett Allen, Lavert, and either prince or Dinwiddie to make the money work. And probably 4 first rounders. Maybe some pick swaps."
Four first round picks and four pick swaps. Plus Chris CaVert &amp; Jarrett Allen. Holy shit that's a haul for Cleveland.
we got JARRETT ALLEN for just 1 first. holy shit.
Wait they didn‚Äôt even trade kyrie?   So all the nets lost was Jarrett Allen taurean prince Caris and kurucs  This is an amazing trade for the nets
"Larry Nance Jr, Kevin Love, Javale Mcgee, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond.    TALL BALL IS HERE MOTHERFUCKERS"
"That leaves the Cavs with Jarrett Allen, Javale McGee, Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Thon Maker and Larry Nance.  Seems like a logjam."
"woj with the terms:  Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
drummond x jarrett allen looking dangerous
"Rockets kinda got the shit end of the stick, not even getting Jarrett Allen? like what  The picks will be in the future for once the Nets are bad again but damn man"
And 3 picks and 4 pick swaps and Jarrett Allen...
"lavert/allen are moving. no word on kyrie  woj with terms: Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
"No, Three way deal with Cleveland. Levert, Kurucs, Exum, 4 first round picks and 4 pick swaps to Houston, Jarrett Allen and taurean prince to Cleveland"
Losing Jarrett Allen is going to be costly defensively
Poor Jarrett Allen. Has to sit behind Drummond now
Houston got absolutely FLEECED they didn't even get Jarrett Allen hahahahahahhahaha
Huh Jarrett Allen to Cavs is a pretty interesting.
"wait what, Jarrett Allen let‚Äôs go"
the rockets should have gotten jarrett allen man. idc if christian wood is there or not. they fucked up there. cavs got an absolute steal
Wow that is a whole heap of trash. Literally Jarrett Allen is the only good player. Those picks better turn out.
Isn't Jarrett Allen the most promising player in this deal?   And Cavs got him lol
Damn Cleveland kinds just gets Jarrett Allen? Nice for them
fuck. i wanted the hornets to get jarrett allen
FREE JARRETT ALLEN
Drummond/Jarrett Allen/KLove ? How does that work?????
Four firsts four swaps lavert and Jarrett Allen
"&gt; Reporting w/  @RamonaShelburne : Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland.

This is a steal for Cleveland  Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince for a first? like shit
The Rockets didn't even get Jarrett Allen?!
WAIT WHAT LET'S GOOO  I fuckin Love Jarrett Allen
Caris and Jarrett Allen? thats it? a bunch of picks nice but no Kyrie?
"Jarrett Allen, caris LaVert and a lot of picks"
"Jarrett Allen &amp; Levert are better than Maxey &amp; Thybulle?  Wtf is it about Sixers prospects/former prospects and getting hyped to high heaven. Shake Milton, Shamet, Maxey &amp; Thybulle are future All-NBA locks if you only read this subreddit and don‚Äôt actually follow or watch basketball."
Not when the other offer is Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert lol
"does anybody even know what the nets offer is lol  Shams in his report an hour ago when talking about the Nets was just like ""this would give the chance for Harden to team up with Kevin Durant""  So you intentionally left Kyrie out of that? Ok then it's Kyrie and what? Is someone else like Jarrett Allen also involved? I  havent heard any cognizant idea of what the Nets offer is other than ""maybe Kyrie"" or ""theyll give up picks lots of them!"""
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
"predicting LeVert + \[1 of Dinwiddie and Jarrett Allen\] + \[anything else that isn't tied down\], would be surprised if the Sixahs dump Ben Simmons while their team composition and chemistry seems right"
Bro a team with KD and Kyrie is not going to have any chemistry regardless lol. These guys are already forcing Jarrett Allen on the bench and got their coach fired while one of them is out partying without even contacting the team for 2 weeks.  These guys have less chemistry than season 1 Jesse Pinkman.
Damn I really don‚Äôt want to lose caris joe Harris or Jarrett Allen or Spencer I really enjoyed watching these dudes grow and get better each year even when nobody else was watching cuz they were 15-67.
"Harden's value is set by the trade market though. Houston just lost a lot of leverage and it's looking increasingly unlikely they'll get a Jaylen or Simmons back for him. Murray+ 3 unprotected 1st rounders is better than, say, getting Jarrett Allen"
"Jarrett Allen  It's been 100% love since I first saw him play 3 years ago, still can't believe they did him so wrong on banning tied headbands."
"How many years until they start to really show the signs of aging?  Kd is 32 and coming off a horrible injury.  Kyrie is about a 50/50 shot to be healthy for the playoffs based on the past few years and players tend to become more injury prone as they age.  Harden is 31 and, to succeed, would need to play a different style than he has been playing for the past five years on both sides of the floor (Jarrett Allen, DAJ, Shamet, Joe Harris and Kyrie aren't great in a switching defense).  Not to mention what trading for Harden would cost them or the diminishing returns of having three guys who can carry an offense.  If healthy they'd be a favorite to make the finals for the next 2-3 years and then Harden and KD will be KG/Pierce on the nets age.  If I had to guess i'd say they probably won't win a ring, even if they get Harden on a good deal."
"Nets would be a balanced scoring team for sure with him , I think Nash would benefit heavily from a Harden at PG lineup ... Not to mention harden is a gr8 lob passer so Deandre Jordan and Jarrett Allen would benefit."
The nets core in 2018 included Spencer dinwiddie caris levert Jarrett allen and dlo. Everyone under 25 years old were the main contributors.
"Nets starters today: Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green, Jarrett Allen   Nash either starts Bruce or doesnt play him at all, no in between lmfao"
