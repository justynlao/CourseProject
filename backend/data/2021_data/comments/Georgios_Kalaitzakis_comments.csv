"Georgios Kalaitzakis, obviously."
"Georgios Kalaitzakis is a name to watch. Decent size, average athlete, inconsistent shooter, generally just been mediocre everywhere heâ€™s been, already 22.   He does a couple things really well though, you canâ€™t deny he has the same agent as Giannis, itâ€™s hard to argue with this according to my google search. One thing heâ€™s also done well is to be born in Greece (pretty much done this his whole playing career).   Heâ€™s coming over this year and I see him contributing right away in the Summer League, he has potential to put up 4 PPG on ~36-38% immediately and then almost with all likelihood go back to Europe and never play in the NBA again."

"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
