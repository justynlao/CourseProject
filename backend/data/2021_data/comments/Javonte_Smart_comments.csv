"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"If we're considering ""contender"" to mean ""has a realistic shot at winning a title"", a team running a bench lineup of Teague/Javonte/Semi/Tristan is not winning a ring man. Teague and Javonte are just legitimately bad players and Semi/TT are situational guys. Outside of the core 4 guys their is almost no shot creation and we saw how Kemba can get neutralized by the Heat and Raptors so realistically the only real reliable shot creators on the Celtics are Smart and the Jays.     The Sixers look a lot better than they did in previous years but like you said, no perimeter shot creation and even their 3pt shooting outside of Seth is sus. Simmons will be easily schemed against per usual in the playoffs by any good coach."
"Uh yeah I do. Tatum is also a very good defender and Javonte Green made multiple costly mistakes down the stretch. We also had a few stretches where Marcus Smart was our only starter playing, when normally we have one of Brown or Tatum in at all times. While Smart played well, Tatum scores more and more efficiently. And really the biggest thing is that we had every chance to pull ahead, but down the stretch we really struggled to get into our sets and get good looks because we were missing our best player. Not saying you specifically, but I don’t think people realize how much we play through Tatum—his on/off stats over the last couple seasons are insane."
"Javonte Green,PP, Semi, Theis, and Smart to close out the half. Yikes"
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"It’s not about total games played. Having a couple extra days off in early January cuz of COVID does not make playing so many games in Febuary any easier. And looking at Boston’s top 5 of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, and Theis, every single one of them has had injury problems and have had to miss games. No team has had to consistently play without 2+ of their top 5 players (but different guys missing each time) all season. You also just ignore Boston’s lack of depth in general makes a more condensed schedule much harder on them than other teams. Boston has had guys like Javonte Green, Jeff Teague, Carsten Edwards, Semi, and Grant Williams start games this season. The Pacers haven’t had to stoop that low this season."
"His shooting numbers will look bad all season long cuz of a few really had games. But he looked good yesterday, and the 3 games before the Pels he was the old Kemba again. He also won us the Clippers game in the 2nd half. Just give him time to find his consistency.   Team defense improves with Smart + a wing traded to us. The biggest difference between last years team and this years is that we don’t have Hayward. That’s why our defense has been bad. We’re trying to run a switch everything system without enough wings who can switch everything. I know Barnes isn’t a great defender, but neither was Hayward and Barnes also is 6’8 250 lb and athletic (if it’s Aaron Gordon then even better on D). Having that guy there to fill a huge role in perimeter defense helps our interior defense by being more competitive on dribble penetration. It’ll require us to have less off ball switching. He’ll take a 4th option role on offense (think JB last year) which will take some burden off our top guys letting them focus their energy on D more.  Team ball movement is bad right now because we’re missing the best playmaker on the team in Smart. Too often we’re forced to roll with offensive zeros on the court in Javonte and TT (center rotation will shorten with more wings) which also hurts our ball movement by allowing the D to focus in on our top guys.  So yea I don’t think we’re a JJ away from a contender, he’s been terrible this year. I don’t think we’re a KP away, he doesn’t fit our team too well. But a Barnes/Aaron Gordon + Romeo + more consistent Kemba, maybe. Guys can put us over the top even if they’re the 5th guy on the team by taking the load off the best players.   I think we all fancied ourselves as title contenders last season. So let’s go out and replace the dude we lost. Obviously no one is fully replacing Hayward. But we can sure do the next best thing and hope that our top guys can step it up."
"Boston doesn’t have a middle of the pack record, they’re a middle of the pack playoff team by their record. Those other dudes were on some of the worst team in the conference.  I get that all teams have had to deal with their own issues, just frankly none of them have been on Boston’s level. Smart and Kemba have only played half the games and most of Kemba’s have been rough coming off of injury. Theis, Jaylen, and Tatum have also had to miss a few each. And no other team has had a schedule as compressed as Boston’s. Indy played 16 games in January, 31 days. Boston’s having to play 19 in  February, 28 days. Those are not comparable.  Yea Sabonis is having a great year. Tatum and Browns stats are a little better tho when you factor in the usage rating and lack of quality teammates hurting their efficiencies. Indy doesn’t have to deal with guys like Teague and Javonte Green getting minutes."
"smart will be enormous, they really just need another wing off the bench that can provide nba minutes and hopefully rome will be able to contribute once hes back too.  ojeleye, javonte, grant just wont cut it when the games really matter.  those guys arent legitimate rotation players.  hopefully nesmith is fine and can continue to get some developmental time along with pritch as we go along cuz they need to keep growing  but smart is going to completely turn things around once hes back.  the team really, really misses him."
Semi has started the last two games. Obviously he doesn’t start when healthy but if we are missing Kemba and Smart and have to resort to starting Semi Ojeleye and Javonte Green we have a problem. We need 2/3 more good bench pieces.
"Just in theory: a trade of Tatum, Brown and Smart go to New Orleans and AD comes to Boston.   Kyrie and Al both leave and who knows if you sign Kemba but we'll play along and say you do (he probably doesn't come without Tatum and Brown here)  That leaves you with:  Kemba, Edwards, Hayward, AD, Theis,   Wanamaker, Langford, Grant, Timelord, Kanter  Javonte Green, Semi and Poirier.  That's not a championship roster. That's not even an ECF roster. So no it's not a guaranteed title. You have to look at how your roster is currently constructed."
"For sure that’s part of it. I just mean having Brown/Tatum/Hayward all being facilitating wings made it crowded. You’re seeing Brown take on more ball handling this year because it’s not split between him and Hayward. None of those 3 guys are effective as just spot up shooters, even if they’re capable of hitting the shots, which is basically the role Brown had last year. I remember recalling he needed the ball in his hands more but there were plenty of games where he just didn’t touch it in the 4th. I don’t blame the injury on coaching or the year after where Hayward was legitimately a liability on defense. Rushing him back for the Miami series last year was also just not him being 100%. They just never got a real shot at full strength with him and Kyrie.  I think the real problem, especially this year, is missing a key piece whether it’s Tatum, Smart or Kemba (them + Brown have been on the floor together for 21 minutes I think was the stat) is having that extra playmaker spaces the floor better. Right now their drives are getting stifled by collapsing defenses and their other guys aren’t getting open enough looks or just aren’t knocking them down because they don’t have that extra guy to account for so they can crowd the paint and guys like Semi Ojeleye or Grant Williams aren’t good enough without being wide open. Hayward also helped in this regard which is why he would be useful right now, because Boston’s half court offense looks totally inept. It’s the exact same problem they had against Miami’s zone and they really need the extra guy.  Yeah the coach needs to make adjustments to the personnel but when you don’t have the depth I think there’s only so much you can do because you’re not going to see guys like Aaron Nesmith or Javonte Green drive and distribute the same way that Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba can."
"I think Kemba is just what he is at this point. If we could move him on for a PG that can get to the rim and score and defend better then I would. idk who is going to want him at this point though.  We need to do something with that trade exception too. It is possible that something big happens esp with the 9 role players currently getting time/looking serviceable.  Kemba/JT/JB/Smart/Thompson/Theis/PP are the only playoff worthy players they have right now.  Teague/Grant Williams/Timelord/Semi/Edwards/Nesmith/Javonte Green are not realistically good enough. If we could turn 3-4 of them into one player to get into the first group, we could be in business.  Edit - Grant Williams looks like the closest to knocking on the door of the other group. He has played really well. Gotta see it for a long time first though."
"I don’t know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there’s some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn’t we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we’ve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn’t have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"&gt; First loss, we had no kemba, smart, or theis. Jaylen brown played point guard in a lineup with Tatum (struggling with coming back from covid), Javonte Greene, Semi Ojeleye, and Tristan Thompson. We played against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela and still only lost by 8.   Fair, but we were missing Hunter and Bogi - two starters. You can argue Smart/Walker are more important sure.    &gt; Next loss was the second game of a back to back on the road having played four games in six days. You were also coming off a back to back but hadn’t had such a condensed schedule. We had just played the Mavericks and you had just played the Cavs. Tatum was having fatigue issues and scored 13 points on 4/20 which I doubt will happen when we play you again.    This is honestly just kind of excuses. That's literally your schedule   &gt; we had Kemba who scored 28 points on 62.5/62.5/100 which would have made him the highest scoring player in either of the two losses.   This is literally not even true: Trae had 40 and Tatum had 35 in the first game. Trae had 31 in our loss. Trae had 33 in the 3rd game and Gallo had 38"
"I will stay we were in a worse shape, both teams were shorthanded as you say, but we f'in started Javonte Green who's not even an NBA player. I still really like Marcus Smart on Trae Young much more than Hunter on whoever he's guarding"
"Celtics also had Smart, Rob, Fournier, Langford, Thompson and Javonte, only Smart was before this season.  There’s a site that tracks games missed due to Covid, if a player misses more than 7/10 days then he likely had it."
"I just said the same thing to that guy! Like if you didn't watch the team, you could just not comment. Javonte Smart had one of the worst hairlines I've seen but he was money in the high PnR. Watford was not a great ballhandler, but he was easily able to score and generate offense for others. He probably generated more for others on LSU than Cam Thomas did. I do like Cam Thomas as a late first guy quite a bit though."
"Trendon Watford, Javonte Smart, and Darius Days were all legit players and Smart/Watford were both Cam Thomas' superiors as creators for other players. Yes, Cam Thomas created a whole bunch of shots for himself at LSU, but it is largely because he iso-d into a large number of contested jumpers. He was clearly the best player on LSU last year, but it's not like the team had 0 offense without him and nobody could get a shot without him. Hell, they had 2 guys who averaged 16 points (Smart and Watford) and that was more in spite of Thomas than it was because of him. I like the player, but that's not an accurate depiction of his college team."
"&gt;Javonte Smart was ass and you know it.  Wow what an amazing response, Javonte Smart was one of best scorers in college last year, he was a 40% 3 point shooter and overall shot 46% from the field while averaging 16 a game. Those are good numbers.   &gt;Trendon could generate some stuff off of drives but he wasn’t great handling the ball.  I agree with you, Trendon wasn't great handling the ball, he still was a good college scorer. Averaged 16 a game on 48% shooting.   &gt;Darius Days did not playmake much.  He didn't playmake much, but he still had the ability to create in the low post, so he is another person on this team who can create a shot.   If you want to argue that none of these players can create shots for others well, I agree with you, but Cam couldn't do that either, so if your definition of 'creator' is a playmaker than Cam doesn't fit that mold either."
Javonte Smart was ass and you know it. Trendon could generate some stuff off of drives but he wasn’t great handling the ball. Darius Days did not playmake much.
"If you're talking about LSU you're just wrong, Javonte Smart, Trendon Watford, and Darius Days could all create and score for that team."
I meant Javonte Smart
I think you meant Javonte Smart for the Heat
Who is Javonte Smith? You mean Javonte Smart?
