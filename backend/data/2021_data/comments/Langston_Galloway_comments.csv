Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
Kinda crazy that Langston Galloway gets that call but Steph doesn’t
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
That series was just tough to watch. Blake was not himself at all and that series was a wrap before it even started. We had no one to gaurd Giannas. If I recall correctly we even subbed in Langston Galloway to try and gaurd Giannas. We should have just taken Blake out the whole series. Wouldnt have been worth it even if we somehow managed to get a couple wins. There was no future with that roster. They had no business even being in the playoffs.
Oh god they have Langston Galloway? Certified Grizz killer
langston galloway
He’s more like the Turkish Langston Galloway
Bruh....literally any solid NBA player is a lot better than the best g league player. Give me Langston Galloway/House Jr/McGee and it might as well be Curry/Durant/Wilt in the g league.
"Now is the time to jump on the Suns bandwagon. We're historically a winning team, but the 2010's were very unkind to us. We have, however, taken great strides to turn that around, and I think we've got a lot going for us now.  1) A young star player in Devin Booker that shows improvement every single year (though he's off to a slow start this year) and has shown incredible loyalty and passion to the city/fans.  2) One of the most talented and respected vets in the league in Chris Paul, who people call the Point God for a reason.  3) A high energy young core of players that give it all on offense and defense, ranging from respectable role players to potential All-Stars down the line, in Mikal, Ayton and Cam Johnson.  4) A scrappy bench mob consisting of Cam Payne, Jevon Carter, Dario Saric, and Langston Galloway that is just smothering on defense and lethal on offense  5) An endearing and respectable head coach in Monty Williams.  Biggest drawback is our owner is a cheap bastard with a history of meddling where he shouldn't. Lately though, he's been much quieter and hands off while our new GM, James Jones, has turned our trashcan fire of the 2010's completely around and created a very strong, balanced, and deep team. Things are looking these days, so why not praise the Suns?"
This guy hasn’t heard of Langston Galloway
Voter fatigue is a real thing. The door is open for Langston Galloway MVP szn
\[Serious\] Is Langston Galloway the greatest shooter of all time?

LANGSTON GALLOWAY!!!!!!!
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
How have I never heard of Langston Galloway before? This guy has to have the fastest release I've ever seen.
Langston Galloway has been a good high volume 3 point shooter in his minutes off the bench. Etwaun Moore is good at running the offense when they need him. They have 12 guys I'm comfortable with.
"Honesty the team has just gotten way better overall. CP3 and book are obviously key, but giving either of them all the credit is short sided. Mikal has taken a leap. Cam Johnson is better. Ayton has improved  defensively and in rebounding while keeping decent offensive ability. We added crowder, etwuan Moore, Nader, and Langston Galloway. Also Dario and frank kaminsky have been playing some of their best basketball. It has really been a team effort.  Edit: I forgot Cam Payne who went from being out of the league to being a solid backup pg. he’s shooting 43% from 3 when he was closer to 32% previously."
Sir Langston Galloway
He hasn’t been playing a lot lately but Langston Galloway has one of the quickest releases I’ve ever seen.
"James jones was responsible for the bubble too and the award was given out before the bubble happened. we were just so bad that it took him 2 years to dig us all the way out instead of just 1. and to do it he made tough moves that many questioned. trading TJ Warren for cash was made fun of. but we needed that cash to get rubio. everyone said the suns reached on cam johnson, but he played a big role in that bubble run and this year. Dario saric came over in the same trade that lead us to draft cam. He's huge for us too. James did all that and we were given an F rating for that offseason. Then he picked up cam payne right before the bubble. payne has been a revelation. Then we sold high on Rubio and Oubre, both of which have been significantly worse this year, to get CP3. and just for fun signed crowder, Langston galloway, Abdul Nader, and etwuan moore. The last 3 of those guys have been really good for us this year and can't even find consistent minutes because we are that deep. to put it in perspective Isaiah Canaan was our starting PG 2 years ago. no one in the league has done a better job than him in the last 2 years and he should be rewarded for it this year.  with ya'll losing last night we would now be 1st in the east now because we own the tiebreaker. apologies for being 8 hours pre-mature."
"Dude I feel bad, a sad franchise like the lakers throwing out a starting lineup like: Langston Galloway, Alexy Schved, Andrea Bargnani, Lou Amundson and Lance Thomas"
"Like Booker said a while ago, the roster is so deep that even good players (such as Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter) aren't getting playing time."
"Have you seen one Langston ""Microwave"" Galloway?"
Get Torrey Craig for cash was awesome too. So was signing Langston galloway for a minimum. So was getting Nader in the CP3 trade.
"Even then, Langston Galloway or even Abdel Nader as a 10th man is pretty good.  But I image it will just be a 9 man rotation in the playoffs"
The absolute disrespect to Sir Langston Galloway
"He played, and didn't dunk with Ish Smith, Derrick Rose,  Langston Galloway, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard. All guards who can throw a lob. Bruce does it frequently now. All that said the gravity the stars on the nets cause opens up alot of space. Blake just isn't good enough to outright beat guys anymore. He needs to be open and he wasn't for us. He's not a good first second or third option. But he can be a solid 5th or 6th on a stacked team. It's no conspiracy."
"I still don't get why KD feels the need to respond to twitter trolls. How does someone with the talent, work ethic, and drive to become one of the top NBA players worth hundreds of millions ever need to prove to random people on the internet?  Forget being KD, if I had the career of Langston Galloway I would not feel the need to care about internet haters."
Langston Galloway but i dont think he gets PT anymore  Bobby Portis dropped a few 30 pointers against us  Bertans always torched us even when he was a nobody in San Antonio
fuck langston galloway
"Ayton missed half of last year between the suspension/injury, most of the team was ravaged by injuries all year, including Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre, and missed the playoffs by half a game. Also, people ignore the fact we added Crowder/Nader/Cam Payne/Etwaun Moore and Langston Galloway to replace a bunch of g-league guys.      The year prior we didn't have a single point guard and we were starting 2 rookies on offense with Igor Kokoshkov at hc. Devin Booker also injured his shooting hand that year and was basically shooting left handed for a while"
"1. The KP trade  1.5 KP IG post right after trade  2. The Bargnani trade  2.5 That one fucking cursed starting 5: Langston Galloway, Alexy Shved, Bargnani, Lou Amundson and Lance Thomas.   3. NY egghead smiling while we’re down 40 against the Bucks  4. Bargnani stupid plays"
"Basically every knick benchwarmer since 2013... KOQ, derrick williams, langston galloway, ron baker, prigioni, mindaugas kuzminskas, lance thomas, basically anyone not named Jared Jeffries who averaged less than 12 mpg"
So does Langston galloway only play against the Mavs ?
"Your biases are showing.   &gt; he should have been able to make the playoffs more than once in 6 years  He made playoffs twice in 6 years. Your information is incorrect.  &gt; Top-tier floor raisers like LeBron, CP3, Harden, Jokic etc simply don’t miss the playoffs like that even when their teams take a shit ton of injuries, **unless they themselves get injured**.  AD was in fact injured. The 2 seasons he made playoffs in NO (2015 and 2018), he played 68 and 75 games respectively, which is 2 of his 3 healthiest seasons as a member of that team. Following your logic:  * Top tier floor raisers don't miss playoffs unless they themselves get injured  * AD makes playoffs when healthy, missed playoffs when he's hurt  Therefore, by your own words, AD is a top-tier floor raiser. ""But what about seasons 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019?"" Well, seeing that you don't count Jokic's first 3 seasons against him (which is fair, he wasn't a superstar yet), you should be partial by ignoring AD's first 2 seasons. That leaves us with:  * 2016 - Injured (61g). Best teammates were Jrue (65g), Ryno (66g), Eric Gordon (45g), and Tyreke Evans (25g). All 4 of his best teammates were injured, and you still expect them to make playoffs? Outside of those 4 you had trash like Ish Smith and Alonzo Gee getting rotation minutes.  * 2017 - AD was actually healthy (75g). Surrounded by Jrue (67g), Dante Cunningham, Ish Smith, Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, Langston Galloway, and E'Twuan Moore. Boogie only played 17 games. This legitimately is a playoff supporting cast to you? Give me a break.  * 2019 - Missed a few games due to injury, but the bigger problem was that he had his minutes limited and was shut down due to trade requests."
"Our sub had some die hard Khyri Thomas supporters, Casey just never have him extended minutes. I liked Langston Galloway but we never allowed this man a real opportunity"
Langston Galloway had that nasty stretch with the knicks a while back
You're talking to someone who tried to order a Knicks Langston Galloway jersey from China
Langston Galloway Knick Legend
Who hasn't heard of langston Galloway? I remeber him being decent on the Knicks but nothing special
"Langston Galloway, he’s a bucket"
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Thanks for this comprehensive write up. I have a soft spot for Langston Galloway. Dude has a name like a founding father, a face that looks like Squidwards house, and one of the sickest sneaker collections in the league. His shot is so damn smooth too."
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
We really thought Cleanthony Early was gonna be somethin. The dude literally got shot wtf.   Langston Galloway was one of my favorite Knicks for way longer than he probably should have been.
"How dare you disrespect the Harlem Poet himself, Mr. Langston Galloway."
No langston galloway slander allowed
"This team was hopeful about dudes like Ron Baker, Jerian Grant, and Langston Galloway. Genuinely the happiest I've been as a Knicks fan ever, we've had some decent moments these last 10 years but this team is just plain good"
ESPN: Langston Galloway becomes the first player in NBA history to put up 2 steals and nothing else.
Deferred to who? Raymond Felton? Anthony Carter? Pablo prigioni? Langston Galloway? Chris Copeland? Come on. I agree. He is not a deferential player in his nature but there’s a time and place
"FWIW, Suns bench had the [best net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench) in the entire league last year which of course isn't perfect but a good reflection on how good and deep a bench is. Many Suns fans have a curious optimism on how E'Twuan Moore and Langston Galloway will perform. Of course... maybe not optimistic enough to wish it for more than the 1 or 2 games before Chris Paul comes back."
"I don't think Bridges automatically becomes the second option — Ayton is more likely. Booker is first, of course, but the Suns offense is motion-based, with a good handful of weapons, all of whom are solid passers: Bridges, Crowder, Payne, Johnson, Saric even.  My concerns are the backup guards for the Suns: Langston Galloway, E'Tuwan Moore and Jevon Carter. Carter's a great defender with a decent outside shot, but he's not an excellent playmaker. Galloway is a bucket, but his defense isn't spectacular. I don't know Moore well (I rarely paid attention to his minutes, to be honest) but he's not the first guard off the bench for a reason, you know?  It's going to be a hairy few games until CP3 is back. Hopefully the Clips/Jazz series goes to 7."
A few years ago the spurs would always offer two firsts for Langston Galloway so I'd trade some bullshit for him then insta-flip every time.
"Cam Payne, E'Twaun Moore, and Langston Galloway, right?"
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"I know there's a lot that went wrong with the Kings but I still can't believe how little they got back in that Boogie trade.   He was averaging 27 ppg and 11 rebs at 26 years old in the peak of his prime and was traded for Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, 1 first-round pick, 1 second-round pick."
"The Suns are up 25 with a minute left, and Suns 3rd Stringer Langston Galloway is STILL drawing charges.    I love this team"
And it's got etuan Moore and Langston Galloway
"Well technically Chris Paul was there, but Langston Galloway was not, you are correct"
"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
TIL Langston Galloway is still in the NBA
TIL Langston Galloway is on the Suns
How you gonna say this when cam payne has two goat tier guards on his own team in langston galloway and etwaun moore?
"I’ve seen the Suns, a team with lots of new players, try tons of different things on both ends of the floor in response to the different ways teams game planned against them throughout the year. Guys have gone from benchwarmers to heavy contributors and vice versa in response to the way teams were scouting the Suns.   RIP to Langston Galloway the Suns first 6th man, and to Dario the Suns second 6th man. Still love you for staying positive"
"Watch games when we started Lou Admundson, Langston Galloway, and Alexie Shved 😂"
"So many to choose from, I'll go with   The Alexy Scvhed, Langston Galloway, Lance Thomas, Lou Amoundson, Andrea Bargnani lineup"
"I wonder if we'll see other players utilized in Game 3 by the Suns. They have a deep bench of shooters, Torrey Craig, Etuwan Moore, Langston Galloway, and even Jevon Carter can get streaky. If I'm Monty Williams, I'm looking for my bench to step it up on defense against Schroeder when Lebron and AD are out.   For those that are trying to say this series is over without CP3 is maybe forgetting how good these bench players have been. The Suns are deep. And they have the best record in the NBA when they're playing AWAY games."
E'Twaun Moore  Langston Galloway  Frank Kaminsky  Torrey Craig (:/)
on free agency  etwuan moore  langston galloway  frank kaminsky  abdel nader  torrey craig  tyshon alexander  getting traded  jevon carter  jalen smith  cam johnson  dario saric
A lot of teams could use Etwaun Moore and Langston Galloway (two end of bench players for Phoenix)
"The Suns have/had 3 of my 4 favorite players in the series and I'm still rooting for the Bucks. Mainly because none of them play lol, Dario, Jevon Carter and Langston Galloway and Jrue is a core player. But I just think the Bucks deserve it more (emphasis on) in my mind. This team has been through it"
Right there with Langston Galloway
Booker imo. Perfect 3rd option after Frank the tank and Langston Galloway.
Started doing it this year. He credits Langston Galloway on our bench for teaching him how 😂
"wish Langston Galloway could get some run, he actually pretty chill player"
"I mean it was major news to me that Knicks legend Langston Galloway was in the finals. He was a good dude on some shitty Knicks teams, looks like he’s got an awesome pops"
"wait, langston galloway is still in the nba?"
Pls let the finals be decided by a 1 on 1 between Thanasis and Langston Galloway.
Langston Galloway bout to have a ring before Harden 😂
Langston Galloway bout to get a ring
Who is Langston Galloway
My first instinct was to clown the fact that Langston Galloway is coming out with a sneaker line but it’s a solid design and $100 is a pretty affordable price point if the shoe can hold up.
"He's not going to be a rotational guy when the team is healthy, but he's fine as an end of the bench guy. Someone has to fill out the 11th-13th spots on the roster. Might as well fill one with a freak athlete who is a decent on ball defender and who is close with the star.   It's not like he's any worse than, say, Langston Galloway on the Suns"
Langston Galloway
"I was worried we would have to wait until someone from another team joined the Knicks in the seasons after this but obviously the stars have aligned and the NBA gods want this streak to never end.   IT LIVES!!!  Big shoutout to Langston Galloway and either Bobby Portis or Danilo Gallinari. Little do they know they are contributing to NBA history.   Let this be a lesson to everybody out there, the decisions you make now could help shape the future in some obscure way, shape or form."
I just want to see Langston Galloway get some burn :’(
I just realized Langston Galloway might win a ring
Suns should put in Langston Galloway 😉
"Alotta people will disagree with that but that's what makes them lovable. They have a ton of strong personalities. I feel like most people would call the Suns lovable but they're just so boring to me. And they have way more players that I actually like, Dario, Jevon Carter, Langston Galloway. There's always something intriguing and interesting with the Clippers. And I fall on the side of liking most of their players too"
1. CP3 2. Jrue Holiday 3. E'Twaun Moore 4. Langston Galloway 5. Axel Toupane 6. N/A
Good point. I could probably get like a second rounder in the 50-60 range and maybe like a Langston Galloway type player in return. Fair value I think
Langston Galloway probably
Suns need to put my boy Langston Galloway out there 😤
Langston Galloway
Genuine question: Is Langston Galloway really unplayable as a 1/2 especially now with Payne hurt? I remember him tearing up MSG one time.
"If Payne can't go, I'm afraid I have some bad news.  By the way, I remember Langston Galloway setting MSG on fire. Is he really worse than E'Twaun Moore?"
Langston Galloway
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"I didn't like the way this post was phrased. Made is sound like the Clippers were getting lit up by Trey Burke and Langston Galloway, it's fucking Luka Doncic and Devin Booker."

"We still have E'twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, and Langston Galloway who are all decent players. Our offense will drop off some with Booker off the floor, but it won't die."
"Not a dumb question at all, man. Jevon played a crucial role in the 8-0 bubble run. He and Cam Payne played a full court press that just gave other teams a ton of trouble. Jevon also hit some huge shots and made some insane defensive hustle plays that only Jevon is capable of.   Unfortunately, he never really got a chance to hit his stride this season. Cam Payne has quickly turned into a top tier back up and we added two other guards in Langston Galloway and E’Twuan Moore that have been competing for minutes.   The Suns stagger Book and CP3 throughout the game, so there just hasn’t been a need to reach into the bench as much. With Payne playing as well as he has, on top of rotations being cut back in the playoffs, the opportunity just hasn’t been there for Jevon to get serious minutes.   Jevon didn’t light it up from 3 this year like Langston and Moore is a season get that can run an offense in a pinch. Jevon is an awesome energy guy off the bench, though. The intensity that he plays with is really fun to watch. He’s just got to work on his ability to run an offense and create for others.  Galloway and Moore are both in expiring contracts, whereas we signed Jevon to an extension last summer. There’s a good chance that he’ll have a bigger role next season."
SA and CC are very different. They just play the same position. It's like saying Derozan and Langston galloway are the same type of player
"And if we're truly doing old times sake, Langston Galloway too"

"&gt;I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is pretentious.  If you are taking that from a pure text comment on the internet, then that says more about you than me.  But, I already said in my first message that I couldn't think of a comparative trade being close to the same value, so if you just put a response about what you think, without backing it up with anything, yeah, you should expect people to call you on it.  &gt;He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then.  His statline this past year was a rounding error off from the previous year, despite COVID and displacement craziness. The only stat that dropped considerably was his three point percentage, but his other shooting stats all improved, most importantly his midrange stats (he was up about 10% from 10-16 and about the same from 16-3p, on increased volume) and his free throw rate (a classic indicator of shooting ability, which jumped above 80% for the first time in his career).  He also improved his playmaking this past year, up a full assist over the previous year, with turnovers going down.  I used the ""has made an All-NBA team"" thing so I didn't have to deal with the ""but he's not an All-NBA player just because he made one"" argument. I'm sure there are plenty of players who made an All-NBA team that you disagree with, but the fact that none of them got traded for a package the size you are talking about is the point.  &gt;Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing  This is probably the closest comp out there for a deal the level you are talking. It was considered a steal of a deal at the time, but Cousins was a notoriously problematic personality (which had been a concern going right back to College, and the reason why he dropped to the Kings in the draft). He was a dominant player, but he was also suspended several times by both the team and league for unprofessional behaviour. He also was traded with a year and a half left on his deal, and Sacramento was going to lose him in free agency if they didn't deal him.  He never actually even led the Kings to the playoffs, either, but he did make All-NBA, so there is some similarity. Still, it does represent the bottom of the market on that type of player (before even considering the context), and I like to think of Masai as being better than Vlade Divac at his job.  &gt;Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  This one isn't comparable, though. Vucevic was 30 at the time of the trade and had never been anything more than a borderline all star player. He has never gotten a single All-NBA vote, let alone made a team. It's a package comparable to the one you are talking about, but for a much lesser and older player, with less team control."
"I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is incredibly pretentious. You request information as if you’re talking to your secretary or you’re a teacher requesting homework from a student. It’s obnoxious and something you should work on.  For the record, Siakam’s value is not “all nba level player”. I personally don’t give a shit that he’s made a single all nba team. He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then. He’s a fringe all star and not a top 15/20 player in the league. He’s closer to top 30-40. Players as good as Siakam get traded every single year. I’ll give you some examples, but I guarantee you that your response is going to either be “this player isn’t as good as Siakam” or “that package is better than the one we’re discussing now”. There is no example that will cause you to actually change your opinion, but I’ll give it a try.  1. Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing   2. Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  Are two trades off the top of my head that roughly fit what you’re asking for"
Langston Galloway
"You need to work on your spelling, but this is an amazing question. I'm more partial to the guys who abjectly arent good but win a tanking team like two or three games and cost them a higher pick (under the old rules). Langston Galloway absolutely used to crack me up for doing this, loved watching the Knicks fans get mad at that while also acting like he was so good."
"I've heard some analyst make this exact argument about someone. I forget who. I also remember someone (I wanna say it was Alan Hahn) saying Langston Galloway was a ""big 6'2"" because he has a short neck."
"Josh Hart, JJ Redick, Wes Matthews, Paul Milsap, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Avery Bradley, Etuan moore, Langston Galloway, Frank Nitilinka, Stanley Johnson, etc.   There’s plenty of bodies still out there and they just need to eat up minutes in the regular season."
"Melo and bargs missed a bunch of games in 2015, so it probably would have been Langston Galloway."
"It’s not about age, it’s about ability. You can be 150 years old, but if you’re not washed, you’re not washed. Langston Galloway, Sterling Brown, Wayne Ellington are all better options than Melo, Iggy, and Dwight."
"I didn't say it was possible.  You'd have to get guys like Troy McDaniels, Langston Galloway, etc. They can shoot but can't do anything else."
"Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Jeff Teague, Kent Bazemore, E'Twaun Moore, Mike Scott, Langston Galloway, Wes Matthews, Ben Mclemore...   Really not as hard as you're making it out to be to just grab some cheap guys to shoot open 3s"
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
"I'd take Langston over IT in a heartbeat - a true professional, no drama. Monty couldn't use him much last year because he had to develop Ty-Shon Alexander, who in the end got waived. I'd still prefer Galloway over  Elfrid ""the shoe"" Payton."
Langston Galloway sounds like a persona that Roger from American Dad would have made up
The Westchester Knicks gave us Trey Burke and Langston Galloway. They were better at developing talent than we were LOL
Langston Galloway
It was Langston Galloway last season. He played less and less as the season went on but he was an automatic bucket any time he got minutes. I remember one game he had like 18 points in less than 7-8 minutes or something crazy like that
Him and Langston Galloway deserve to be on a roster. Sucks that they didn’t get much playing time last year
"I can see you have no intention on discussing this in good faith.  The irony about you talking about ignorance . . .  You said: ""Hali would have played maybe 10 min a game. Maybe"" You do realise both Jevon Carter (60 games) and Langston Galloway (40 games) averaged 12 minutes per game for us? More than your suggested minutes for Haliburton, a far superior player. Talk about ignorance and stupidity . . .  As I said. It's not a Payne v Haliburton argument. They would have split minutes at around 15 each. But you are too simple to figure that out haha. We are done here. Yelling at a brick wall is a waste of time"
"I mean with immediate thought, you’d figure the superstars would have the biggest egos and be most senile to nagging fans, and the role players/end of bench guys would be most down to earth.  But like really, it’s probably that the superstars that practice PR stuff and know their public image means something. There won’t be any headlines if Langston Galloway tells someone to get out their face. There will be if Lebron does. So i guess it’s not just as black and white as I made it out to be in my comment above"
"Became a Knicks fan around 2011, but been diehard since 2013.   Where do I begin?   Alexey Shved or Langston Galloway being legitimately the best player on the floor at times in 2014/15?  Losing our pick in 2016 to the nuggets, who drafted Jamal Murray?  Jarrett Jack and Ramon Sessions getting reps at PG in 2018?  Getting backstabbed by KP in 2019, followed by falling to the third overall pick in the 2019 draft?  Drafting Kevin Knox instead of MPJ, and Frank Ntilikina ahead of Donovan Mitchell?  It's been a dark eight years. Let us have this moment with a competent FO and team."
"""Cleanthony early, Langston galloway... are those even real people?!!?"""
Langston Galloway has such a quick trigger
"Langston Galloway hasn't been picked up by a team yet, but he was a bright spot on some bad Knicks teams."
"Our only playoff series win in 2 decades and winning seasons when he had NBA quality rotation players around him. There are fans who scapegoated him for not being able to do more with a supporting cast of Andrea Bargnani, Langston Galloway, Cole Aldrich, and Shane Larkin."
"&gt; James Jones likes high BBIQ, high motor guys   The first FA he signed was Jamal Crawford. Crawford was fun to watch, but he was the exact opposite of high BBIQ, and his motor only turned on when he had the ball.   His next big move after that was to trade for Kelly Oubre - another guy not known for his high BBIQ or motor.   Then he sold TJ Warren to Indy. Warren may not be the highest BBIQ player around, but he's smarter than Cash Considerations.   Here's his GM record, it's not exactly filled with the type of guys you're describing.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/executives/jonesja99x.html  It's basically Rubio, who was then traded for CP3, and then re-signing CP3. Maybe Crowder too, although he can't dribble or pass.   Cheick Diallo, Frank Kaminsky, Langston Galloway, Etwaun Moore, Cam Payne, Elfrid Payton - I mean, they're all NBA-caliber guys but I wouldn't say any of them are known for their high BBIQ or motors.   Granted, CP3 is top 2 in the entire league in BBIQ (Lebron), so the other guys don't have to be."

Langston Galloway will return in...  *Gangway for Galloway*.
"Lol I got a Pistons autographed Langston Galloway ball from a contest win. Sort of funny because I won the ball this year, so it probably was sitting in some Pistons storeroom for a while."

By not playing Langston Galloway
"The average NBA player is in the league for 4-5 years and goes back to being a no one. Like I said, people have a warped idea of what celebrity earns you. Celebrity isn't a privilege that makes money worth more. If anything celebrity can be dangerous to networth. You talk with athletes back in the day, they'll talk about how, as a perceived celebrity, living beyond your means can be detrimental. The average NBA player is closer to Ron Baker, Cleanthony Early, or Langston Galloway than Steph Curry."
Was pretty timid tonight but his opportunity has been ramping up so I think he just tried to stay out of the way with the rest of the starters. He's shined or shown good flashes in basically every other NBA context that you can rank below starter level thus far (Bench/G league/Summer League etc).   Knows how to play on offense without the dynamism of being a regular on ball self creator. Gifted passer and good shooter. Decent size but I think the defense is a work in progress. He's not terrible there but not quite the adequacy you want if he's carving out a serious minutes role on a team. Hard to come up with a perfect comp. Like a bigger Langston Galloway maybe.
We were better off with Delon Wright and Langston Galloway the last few seasons. Or even Ish Smith.  Like they're not good but they make teammates better. CoJo just plays for himself.
I don't understand why we're paying Cory Joseph $7M when we could have Langston Galloway on a minimum.

"They can't count on him to show up to his mandatory COVID test. They should cut him and sign someone else, Langston Galloway doesn't have a job right now"
