"If the Dubs start winning, they need to slow their roll a bit. See if they can get two top-15 picks. They can make the playoffs, then fine-tune their positioning a bit. Get a top-10 and a top-15 player, you have the foundation for the future (Wiseman, Wiggins, Pascall, two lottery picks in a great draft, or take both and package them to move up for their guy like Jalen Suggs if he slipped a bit or whatever).   If Minnesota can somehow manage a pick from 4-9 or so, this draft will be lit for the Dubs, they will have a solid block of young talent. The Athletic had GS with the 7th and 15th picks, seems about right, snagging a stud wing in Scottie Barnes and then arguably the best defensive player in the draft at 15 in Usman Garuba (6-8, F/C). Obviously who knows who they will get, but they are exceedingly well-positioned.  Oh, and I am forgetting Nico. IDK man, that kid was projected to be a top-10 pick, had a meh first season at Arizona, but that kid is a year younger than he was supposed to be when drafted (graduated HS early and reclassified), and playing with Steph, feel like he might learn enough to breakout like Draymond. Or maybe I just like how he plays, just watching him, I feel like he could definitely start in the league one day."
"Yeah, I saw the video of him playing Gobert some months ago. But he's still 3(?) years away, still just a kid. He has time to fill out.  I'm excited to see how Usman Garuba does, and I expect he'll be in the 2021 draft. And he's all grown up already. Just the draft for Mavs to have no first rounders in, eh."

I’m not sure we watch the same Usman Garuba got go off ig
"Usman Garuba has no sense of basketball, he only relies on his athleticism, he’s exactly the opposite of Draymond also he’s the most overrated prospects there is.  Alperen and Draymond both lacks physical tools but makes up for that with their impeccable basketball iq."
"I still do not see any comp to Dray in there, closes prospects to dray are Usman Garuba and Scottie Barnes."
Boston would pick Usman Garuba before Alperen.

"I mean, we have *50M* to spend this year, the problem is that I can't see us using them all, not the other way lmao. Money are our last problem atm.   If Samanic finally shows out, yeah. I would love an hybrid PF/C to develop and maybe already get minutes off the bench. I'm thinking about Isaiah Jackson or Alperen Sengun, but even Usman Garuba or Kai Jones are viable options."
Maybe 25 mins honestly since his defense needs to be developed. Olynyk would be good alternative too but he's more of a center imo and I think Theis is better.   If I was the spurs I would draft a PF like Usman Garuba and let him develop off the bench while Portis starts. No need to spend big on Markkanen/Collins imo.

I really want Spurs to draft Usman Garuba. Think he can be a high level role playing PF at the worst
"Some lottery talent will be playing in these games. Keep on eye out on Real Madrid’s Usman Garuba, he’s a beast big man. Could go top 10 in 2021."
Likely first-round overseas prospects are:   * Alperen Sengun (Besiktas) * Usman Garuba (Real Madrid) * Josh Giddey (Adelaide)  * Filip Petrusev (Mega Bemax)

"big fan of Moody. Also dont think Sengun is a reach at that pick, really a big fan of his defense and IQ. Usman Garuba and Franz Wagner are two that I like. Think Jalen Johnson is a good high upside pick but he's a bit of a project.  Not a fan of Kispert or Williams. I like Kai Jones for the right team, but dont think the Kings are it.  Everyone else I like at that pick range is a guard."
"Didn't catch the game, how did Usman Garuba do? I saw that he was matched up with KD for a few possessions."
Usman Garuba has gotten run tonight and he's 19. Likely lottery pick in the draft in a couple weeks.

How did he not make the Australia team when Usman garuba can make a spain team where literally every top Spanish hopper is his position. Kinda concerning

Add Usman Garuba to the list of Star Wars name
"Trade one of them, maybe with Wiseman and S&amp;T Oubre for some veteran help. If you trade 14, Davion Mitchell or Bouknight would be nice at 7. If you trade 7, I think Moses Moody or Usman Garuba would be perfect at 14. I guess it would depend on who you get in the trade though."

"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"This draft is ridiculously deep.  We look to be high on Usman Garuba, who can go anywhere from 11 to 18.  If he falls to 16, awesome.  If not and we're stuck at 16 and 18 (our draft position changes wildly if the Houston pick transfers at 5th overall), then 16 and 18 might be good enough to move up to 11-15 for Garuba"
somewhere in the 11-13 range imo. Along with Usman Garuba and Davion Mitchell.
"You would think of another reason why it was so obvious. For example ""Alperen was undersized"" or ""Usman Garuba showed no offensive game"" etc. Rubio was also benched at some point and he turned out okay. Even Luka started on the bench until the player ahead of him got hurt. Devin Booker was benched in college and he turned out to be a good player. There are times, particularly in weak draft classes, where you have to depend on small sample sizes and seeing a vision of the future rather than getting perfect information."
Christian Wood  Jalen Green  Alperen Sengun  Kevin Porter Jr  Usman Garuba  Kenyon Martin Jr  Armoni Brooks  Jae’Sean Tate   Josh Christopher
Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
Usman Garuba game high +14 is exactly what was advertised.
"A: Jalen Green B: Davion Mitchell C: Moses Moody D: Alperen Sengun E: Usman Garuba  PG: Mitchell, SG: Green, SF: Moody, PF: Garuba, C: Sengun  Wasn't even trying to go all-in on the Rockets boys, it just worked out that way."
Usman Garuba
Usman Garuba
"Usman Garuba. Physical Tools (6'8, 7'2 wingspan), defensive intuition, work ethic, it's all there. I think he ends up first team all defense."
Ackshully this is an Usman Garuba highlight
"I hope so man, and with Green and Sengun. The Rockets drafted Usman Garuba another non traditional college route player from Spain"
"I feel like Sengun and Usman Garuba are going to prove to be the two biggest steals in this draft. I mean, Garuba is the youngest ever starter for Real Madrid, younger than Doncic."
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
Usman Garuba is on his way from Olympics to claim that title.  But seriously Scottie Barnes had a great game
&gt;Usman Garuba  dudes yolked
Usman Garuba - he hasn’t played yet cause he was in the olympics with Spain
Don’t forget about usman garuba
"Rockets really got  Sengun, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba and some guy named Jalen Green"
"Hell no lmao  Kuminga is an uber athletic small forward with slashing and some post up scoring skill, way higher offensive upside. His comps are Jaylen Brown, Jeff Green  You’re prob thinking of Usman Garuba, the only guy who gets  the Draymond comp in the draft"
Usman Garuba
Usman Garuba is better
Crazy how Rockets got Usman Garuba and now Miami/Lakers/Nets are scrambling to add players to beat him  Wild stuff we’re witnessing
You have not seen Usman Garuba Up close yet.  And allegedly his younger brother is better.
Shoutout to Usman Garuba! Very impressive performance from the 19 year old and I'm excited to see him in Houston!
What I took away from this game is that Usman Garuba is a fucking nice defender.
Usman Garuba
"Yeah, saw that afterwards. You can't blame me for thinking he's African, with a name like Usman Garuba. Both his parents are Nigerian."
"Usman Garuba, just got drafted 1st rd by the Rockets"
That’s Future DPOY Usman Garuba for you
Rockets legend Usman Garuba gonna lock up KD
"Sergio Lull, Usman Garuba, Rudy Fernandez and Abalde are on the same Real Madrid team. Pau and Albrines are on the same Barcelona team   Ricky Rubio has been playing on the Spain team since he was 17 along with Luoll, Gasol brothers, Rudy &amp; Sergio Rodriguez.   So basically they’ve been together as kids with a few younger talent that play together professional.   They have more chemistry then the USA"
Fun fact: Rui Hachimiura went 2-7 this week when being guarded by Usman Garuba  *sips coffee*
Why isn't every comment on this post Usman Garuba?  USMAN. GARUBA.
Usman Garuba
Usman Garuba  Keon Johnson
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
"Usman ""Groovy"" Garuba"
Usman Garuba is the sound my stomach makes when I'm taking a shit.
Usman Garuba baby
USMAN GARUBA is getting slept on soooo much
Usman Garuba?
Usman Garuba
Usman Garuba?
I honestly don't hate Scottie but does he do anything that is 10 spots more valuable than Usman Garuba?
Usman Garuba
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
1. Jalen Green   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Suggs   4. Usman Garuba   5. Evan Mobley   6. James Bouknight   7. Alperen Sengun   8. Keon Johnson   9. Jared Butler   10. Scottie Barnes    Obviously some 2nd rounder is going to crash the party but I think all 10 of those guys are in great places to be high floor high ceiling.
"thats the question... wenyen gabriel or wes uwundu?   they have the defensive guy usman garuba, yall could take him at 17..."
"Hey Jake, where is Usman Garuba most likely projected to go to?"
Usman Garuba steal of the draft
6 Bouknight  Trade 16+18 up to 9 or 11 for Moody  If not able to trade then:  Jalen Johnson at 16  Usman Garuba at 18  Vrenz Bleijenbergh at 34  Quentin Grimes at 36
"Usman Garuba will be one of the best defenders in the league one day, barring a crazy injury or similar.  I also think Jalen Johnson will be a steal."
Usman Garuba will win multiple DPOYs
"That's what I gathered/presumed. Here's wishing for Usman Garuba, but I doubt it honestly...."
Usman Garuba
"May be drafted higher than expected: Usman Garuba, Josh Giddey, Joshua Primo  May fall: Davion Mitchell, Kai Jones"
"Nets should be moving up for Usman Garuba, perfect fit for them"
For someone like Usman Garuba of he is Drafted taking that money guarantees he has to be a draft and stash because of his contract. He has to pay 2 million by himself to buy out of his deal. It was the same with Luka as well. It completely fucks any international guys with longer term deals.
Usman Garuba
Don’t really know either  Would only be down to trade him on draft night for one of OKC’s picks if Usman Garuba is available on 16 or 18
I want Usman Garuba if that's who he's gonna be like.

"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."

"I’ll cast my vote for the Rockets, if we’re counting the draft. A team that was incredibly awful last year, setting one of the longest losing streaks in league history, re-tooled with four supremely exciting rookies in Jalen Green, Alpheren Sengun, Josh Christopher, and Usman Garuba. Considering how the Rockets were the league’s most moribund team after the Harden trade, with a core of Kelly Olynyk and washed Wall, to have one of the league’s best young cores (those four + KPJ + Tate) less than a year later actually gives Rockets fans some hope for the future."
"Jalen, Sengun, KPJ, Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Usman Garuba, C. Wood"
"Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, Alperen SengÜn, Usman Garuba, and one of the forwards from the top-10 picks of the 2022 NBA draft."
"Usman Garuba wasn't given as many opportunities to show what he can do as I would like, so that's been disappointing for me"
"Root for the Rockets. I think right now they have the best future. Im high on KPJ, Jalen Green, Usman Garuba and Alperen Sengun"
He bought out Usman Garuba Real Madrid contract and hired hella Stepien scouts too   I don’t think he’s that broke. He was definitely struggling during the bandemic
As an honest and unbiased NBA fan I’ll have to go Alperen Sengun or Usman Garuba
We don’t have much but… 1. Alperen Sengun 2. Jalen Green 3. Kevin Porter Jr. 4. Christian Wood 5. Josh Christopher 6. Usman Garuba 7. Kenyon Martin Jr. 8. Jae’sean Tate
Usman Garuba was the youngest ever starter for Real Madrid. The previous holder of that record was Luka Doncic.
"If we are talking about straight up bench warmers, Jay Scrubb, Brandon Boston, Usman Garuba, Cam Thomas."
This!!  Teams should stay away from him. He’s pretty much Usman Garuba with less feel for the game.  Not sure why he is mocked top 5
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
"Usman Garuba could legit be the best defensive wing we’ve seen a while but he gets zero minutes smhhh  He got sent to the g league yesterday, so it’s looking up"
"I appreciate your comment bro. Just the fact that one person read the post validates the time I put lmao. I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to watch our games, I'm barely hanging on.  As for our rookies. None of us can even say how good Usman Garuba (23rd pick) or Josh Christopher (24th) are. They play 7 and 6 minutes a game respectively. We seem to be developing Theis, Nwaba, and House instead lmao.  Honestly I can't even take the starting lineup seriously so it's hard to give an opinion of Jalen. I'm not just saying that either, I'm pretty critical of the team, but there's just no opportunities for him to show consistency when they struggle to even bring the ball up the court. I'd compare it to when Booker averaged 14 his rookie year. You see their game, you see the potential, but it's nearly impossible for a rookie to thrive in that situation unless you're Bron or Luka. Really all we can mention are his flashes, reserving judgement for now.  Sengun is surprising. His offensive game is translating really well. He's already an offensive option that the team can dump the ball to in the post, or even at the perimeter, and you can expect him to create a decent look. Definitely our most consistent creator and playmaker, which is pretty sad. He's going to need to improve defensively though. The rookie whistle isn't helping and fouls are what's limiting his playing time. I'm cool with him coming off the bench though, let's him show out against lesser talent and develop go-to moves. We also need to figure out in the next few years whether he's a 4 or 5, but gotta see how he fills out."

"Not gonna lie. I agree with you but Silas has been really bad.  The team looks best when Sengun gets minutes. What does Silas do? Give him only 16 MPG   He had 10/10/4/1 in 20 minutes today. It’s been the same story all year. He has to be starting and getting major minutes   Dude runs curls for Green on every play, no versatility whatsoever.  Don’t even get me started on him playing House and Nwaba while Usman Garuba who was on the Spain national team as a 18 year old rides the bench"
Anthony Davis? Usman Garuba?
Is Usman garuba really bad or is he just too far down the depth chart or what?

"His lack of offense is scary though, he’s like Usman Garuba from this year I think"
Usman Garuba's name is Destiny Usman Garuba.  Kevin Porter Jr.'s name is Bryan Kevin Porter Jr.
"How has Usman Garuba been playing? I was impressed by his defensive highlight reel, but I haven't heard from him since the draft"
