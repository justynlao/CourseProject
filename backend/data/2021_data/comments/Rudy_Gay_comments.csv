Rudy gay looks like the weeknd to me. I know they bear no resemblance but idk why my smooth brain still thinks they look kinda similar
"No. They’re best friends for life. DeMar was texting Kyle immediately after Kyle got the chip. Happy for him like he won it himself.  Him, Kyle and Rudy Gay have a beautiful trifecta of friendship that is amongst the purest shit in the nba."
"Much like Rudy Gay, Jeff Green is one of those guys who has all the tool to be a star player but never puts it all together"
"Losing vassell and a potential lottery pick so we can add Vucevic to a team that has no guarantee of making the playoffs is a complete waste of assets. This team is going in the direction of the DJM, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker timeline. Not the DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay timeline. That trade does nothing for us"
Conley  Mike Bibby or Cj McCullum  Petrovic  Rudy Gay  Sabonis
Rudy gay
"well it depends. for example, using this past game, i think Pop killed us against the grizzlies., because he didn't sub out LMA when he was getting DESTROYED by Morant, not even putting his arms up to contest. knowing that, he could have subbed him out for Jakob. he also kept in trey Lyles early in the game to put rudy gay at the 3. rudy's been good but that's not awesome for either of them. when you're having problems defensively, going with Devin Vassell would have probably helped more than Trey was gonna help on the boards.  so I say all that to say coaches have a huge impact on the game, whether it's the timing of timeouts, subs and rotations, or actually bring a playcalling genius. even the GOAT has days where he's like ""you know, fuck it, I'm willing to lose this game to see how this lineup holds up"" and some days where he makes nothing but good decisions and it still doesn't matter because the other team gets hot. so basically, it matters, but players are still the ones on the court."
"same for Rudy Gay, too"
"The same people who thought Batum was washed up.   I'm going to be harsh but some people are clueless and don't get certain things, even though the same situations happen every single time. Not just in the NBA, also in the NFL/soccer/... etc. Don't write off a player immediately. The fit in a team is important.   Batum never ever was a number 1 or 2 option, not even a number 3. Look at those Portland teams, he was the perfect glue guy when Dame, Aldridge and even Wesley Matthews did all the other stuff. He did get paid like one when he joined Charlotte, but if people actually thought he would turn into a Gordon Hayward type player then their expectations were wrong.     If a team offers you a 5 year 120 million dollar deal, are you going to deny it? ''No I'm good, I'll take 13 million a year because that's what I'm actually worth''. Of course not.  And as you can see with the Clippers, Batum fits perfectly.    And the same is the case for Rudy Gay. Go look at his Memphis days, number one and two were Conley and Z-Bo. And then you had other really good (defensive) players like Tony Allen and Marc Gasol. So Rudy Gay is the perfect glue guy, like Batum, who is more offensive minded and can/could score. Having Conley, Z-Bo, Allen, Gasol around you makes the game so so so much easier. If you don't have that and you are the #1 option, then good luck, because it's going to be very difficult and you have to adjust your game."
"Since that choke hold from Rudy Gay, AD hasn't been playing really well"
Definitely was. Loved playing with that Kings team with Rudy Gay Boogie and IT and then Rudy Gay Rondo and Boogie. Shit was super fun to do a myleague with
There was a time when Ramon Sessions was in the league with Kevin Love and Rudy Gay.   Imagine: Team LoveGaySessions
"I'm fucking Rudy, gay man."
Fucking Rudy Gay man
Reminder that Rudy Gay is a whopping 6’8 man but looks like a child next to Poetl.
I don't know if any other coach could have kept Rudy Gay this productive this late in his career.
"Rudy Gay, hopefully they never let him go. He’s a solid dude"
"It will be interesting to see coming down the stretch of the season and hopefully into the playoffs, how it works for other teams planning for Demar. There’s a lot more around him for teams to account for than before. You plan for Demar and get BIG BODIED by Keldon, or your eyes cut out by Dejounte, or FIBA patty goes off, BLOKOB POETLE is basically Rudy Gobert, Lonnie streaks for 12 points in 3 min, Vaselle wrecks havoc on defense and hits 40% from 3. Not even mentioning if Lamarcus Frankenstein goes sleep walking for 20-30, and NOT THIS GUY Rudy Gay does exactly what he’s been doing all season. Spurs are good! Currently sitting 4th in the west and finding their stride.  Edit: And Derrick White is back! Time to groove."
rudy gay
"We'll riot  Unless Sexton is traded to the Spurs to play alongside, ahem... *Rudy Gay*"
"The Raptors are 7-12 right now. They haven't been 7-12 since the Rudy Gay trade in 2013. You know what Masai did at that time? He traded Rudy Gay in an attempt to rebuild. The team overachieved but it was a rebuilding move. This team is built to win now and has had an easy schedule and is still really bad. There's a clear difference between this team and the Raptors teams that were 1st and 2nd seed in the East winning 50+ games. This team would have to go on a run just to have a mediocre record in the East. The Lowry/DeMar teams weren't mediocre, they were elite regular season teams.    You don't want to be stuck in mediocrity. Being competitive and ""pretty damn good"" isn't a problem, the Raptors unfortunately just aren't there. That's why I, along with a lot of fans, want to trade Lowry and other players we have to rebuild. If the team does well after that? That's fine, but you don't just sit around and wait and watch your expensive team do nothing. Obviously I'm disagreeing with the guy you replied with too though, the Raptors weren't mediocre. A lot of teams would want to be in that spot."
FOUR ASSISTS?   Must be a career high for Rudy Gay.
is that rudy gay or boris diaw
Can't wait for the rudy gay trade in cleveland
Rudy Gay needs to get traded there
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"I use base Kemba, release Rudy Gay on my 6'7”. It's a clean jumpshot. Release as the ball lifts past your face"
"Rudy Gay would be the best bench scorer and versatile defender on a lot of teams, is expiring, and isn’t too much money to match   Same for Patty mills minus the defense"
"Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Brad Wanamaker, Christian Wood, James Harden"
"Derozan has been the best player for the Spurs, but they are dead in the water without Poeltl.  The Spurs have 7 players averaging double figures and the leading scorer changes on any given night.  The second unit is murder (the first unit with Derozan/Aldridge/Murray struggles at times).  There have been multiple games this season where Derozan has taken a back seat and taken fewer than 10 shots.  Seven different players have led them in scoring this year.  So, they have some scoring, and if Lonnie Walker or Rudy Gay or Mills or Keldon are going, any of them can carry the load for a stretch.  What they don't have is bigs.  Poeltl is by no means the best player on the team, but in a lot of games, he is the one that the Spurs need the most."
Derrick Favors Rudy Gay Kevin Love Ramon Sessions
"Rudy Gay, Derrick White, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Love, Dwayne Bacon"
"How tall are you? For bigs, jumpshot 38 base with Rudy gay release. For smalls Kemba base or Wade base with Rudy gay release"
"He used to, but he really hasn’t the last couple of seasons. I know because we used to keep a chalkboard with a cartoon of Patty cheerfully chucking the ball into the stands on one side to tally them vs audible f-bombs on the other side (we would place bets at the beginning of the season for charity)  It was great fun and then around 2018... he just stopped. Now the chalkboard only holds weird nicknames we made up for Rudy Gay."
"There's no way you can compare the spurs to the wizards lol. The spurs have dejounte Murray, derozan, Aldridge, keldon johnson, two good veterans in patty mills and rudy gay, as well as promising young talent in Lonnie walker and derrick white. The spurs roster is WAY better than the wizards."
This is giving me vintage Rudy Gay game-winner vibes
Put this game away Rudy Gay
"Kobe's last three years didn't need to be that way, though. Just like Westbrook's play doesn't need to be what it is now. It's hard to do, but players can adjust their game to fit a new role and still be a productive NBA player. Vince Carter did it. Ray Allen did it. Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul, etc."
"DE-FENCE DE-FENCE  NO, IT'S RUDY GAY"
"The rumors/discussions were definitely more nuanced than that. More like LMA, Gay, + 11 for Wiggins and a 2nd. It's just a shame that LMA fell completely off a cliff last this year. Last year's version of LMA would've gotten you 16-20ppg while hitting 3s at a solid clip and serving as a release valve via postups when teams would trap steph. And honestly imagine if the Warriors grabbed Haliburton at 11 as a 6th man. Unfortunately shit has gone sideways for both teams but last year's lma + a healthy Klay, + haliburton + Rudy would've had me shook."
"I honestly cant wait for next season. Hoping that we make a run at an athletic big like Collins or Allen. Our young guys aren't quite ready to have the reins turned over to them yet, but good grief is it miserable watching Aldridge and DeMar together. Then to add insult to injury, watching Rudy Gay and Patty Mills sub in for them and play hero ball for the next 10 minutes."
"I mean you obviously don't follow the team close enough and I get it.  But here you go for achievements before Kawhi:   Essential part of the raps revival in 2013 when we was supposed to tank after trading Rudy Gay (aka the birth of Lowry + bench units which were among best 5 man lineups for half a decade), winning the division (I know) &amp; reaching the playoffs for the first time in like 6 years. Balled out vs vet BKN team in 2014 round 1, just falling short in game 7 at the buzzer  Dropped 35 in game 7 of 2016 ECSF vs Heat, reaching ECF for first time in raps history. Even took off 2 games from eventual champs 2016 Cavs where he dropped 35 in one of the wins  (Maybe other fans can add in):"
"If we're talking current players, then Rudy Gay"
Freakin Rudy Gay man...
rudy fuckin gay man
lmfao of course Rudy fucking Gay hits one from the logo
Fuckin' Rudy Gay maaaaaaan
I wonder what a team of Rudys would look like.   C - Rudy Gobert  PF - Rudy LaRusso  SF - Rudy Tomjanovich  SG - Rudy Gay  PG - Rudy Fernandez
Rudy Gay or Trevor Ariza.  I trust DeAndre Jordan more than any of these free agent and potential buyout centers.
Kevin Martin and Rudy Gay might have 3 rings by now on the back of Lebron and Steph
I love Rudy Gay
"[rudy gay was a notorious raptor killer, meme came from this video](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg)"
"His best years he was never inefficient, He was always above league average or at league average efficiency, Rudy gay would have been steve francis best teammate not even Conley's top 5 teammates though, switch them teams and I guarantee Conley would do much worse than francis and his defense would slip and the opposite would happen for francis if he didnt have to carry the offense by himself"
rudy gay meme applies to him as well
Rudy Gay + Sexton = GaySex
Yes he does.  That and not playing defense when he thought he got fouled are the two things that make me so angry with him.  Rudy Gay also holds the heaves...
"see, that’s what you think, but then Rudy Gay hits a turnaround 3 pointer with .2 remaining to win the game"
"Fun post!  This took some work to put together.  Was fun to read.  I haven't gone through this in detail, but here's a handful of ones where I would have gone a different direction:  Texas active:  Gimme Jimmy Butler over LMA, even with total career considered.  Last years playoffs alone were enough to push him past LMA if you ask me.     South Carolina active:  Ja gonna give Khris a run for it pretty soon, and I'm a Bucks fan.  Still Khris for now.  Maryland active:  Gimme Rudy Gay over Oladipo.  Numbers and longevity speak for themselves."
"The best evidence is that every high profile player who has torn their left Achilles came back as scrubs, whereas the only high profile players who tore their right Achilles was Dominique Wilkins and Rudy Gay, who came back more or less the same player."
I've seen rudy gay at the 5 when LaMarcus was out this season so I wouldn't be surprised lol
Chris Rondo  Rajon Paul  Carmelo Rubio  Ricky Anthony  Michael Benett  Anthony Jordan  Rudy Mann  Terrence Gay  For NBA Team: #1 and #30  Los Angeles Pistons  Detroit Lakers
I would have thought Demar and Rudy Gay.
"I agree but I think this will be the first year that we do not beat the Vegas over/under from before the season.  Prior to this, the Raptors have always beat it since trading Rudy Gay."
"I'm pretty sure KD's just had 2 massive injuries in his career, his foot breaking and his Achilles tear, I'm not sure that labels someone as injury prone. Rudy Gay and Wes Matthews have been really healthy since their Achilles tears, though every athlete is different."
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
"Demar being on teams which like a solid bench is not unfortunate.   Patty Mills going aggressive, Rudy Gay playing well sometimes and Vassell playing awesome defense helps us because our starting lineup isn’t getting us to the playoffs or even the play-in by themselves"
Yeah but we have Patty Mills and Rudy Gay who are the 19th and 21st best players in the league.
FUCKIN' RUDY GAY MAN ............^(shit)
rudy gay
Spurs bench iced this game. Fucking Rudy Gay man...
"Patty Thrills and now Blazers get hit with Rudy *""Not this guy""* Gay, not a good day."
Fucking Rudy Gay man
God down a bunch of players and just what we need is fucking rudy gay and patty mills of all people hitting every shot
"They’re a punching bag for a reason. They’ve had constant turmoil with ownership, front office, coaches, players, etc. Pretty sure there was even an embezzlement scandal too  No one hates them. But they are objectively the worst ran team the past 15ish years.  As Rudy Gay told his new coach George Karl, “Welcome to Basketball Hell”"
probably thinks rudy gay is transcedental
"Right.. over the hill ron Artest who put up 17/5/3 with elite defense next to Lowry, 2 years of mike miller who put up 17/6/4 shooting 42% from 3 next to lowry, who just came of winning 6th man of the year, the same team had rudy gay who was always good. Dont comment if you dont know also I wasnt arguing that Rondo had worse team my point was that lowry also had good teammates his whole career"
"I was def one of those guys. So glad I was wrong. He still looks explosive as ever  Same with wall. And with rudy gay and Wes matthews also making very successful comebacks in recent years, maybe achilles tears really aren't the death kneel they used to be"
That ref is on some bullshit calling that gather step travel on Rudy Gay lmao Spurs are missing Derrick White hard rn
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."
Ingram always just reminded me of Rudy gay. Solid player but not a star.

"I always knew he was good and underappreciated. I was watching this game and thought the Mavs might pull out a win, and when I saw Khris rise up for 3, I thought of that Rudy Gay NOOOOO video both times he pulled up.  Dude is a silent assassin."
Dejounte Murray tore his ACL and was okay last season and looks much improved this season. Rudy Gay tore his ACL too and has been good in San Antonio off the bench and is in his 15th year now. ACL injuries aren't what they used to be.
"They have some decent young players just none of all star caliber. I think they will be in the lottery again but they will also have \~50 mil in cap space next year as Rudy Gay, Derozan, LA and Patty Mills all have expiring contracts. They could trade those guys for assets or use the money in Free agency. Mills especially looks prime as a trade piece for a contender who needs a guard that can shoot 40% from 3."
It seems like Rudy Gay is friends with everyone in the league.
Lol Cousins was totally down to dap Gay up but Rudy said no thanks  That’s that Alabama boi
"It isnt. Rudy Gay has had a solid career, he's not in question. Nor is Mike Conley or Jrue.   If you're in contention for being in the top 30 players across a decade, you probably should be in the hall. 3-4ish inductions a year isnt crazy, especially since someone like Lowry would be inducted well after retirement."
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
"It's similar to the Raptors trading Rudy Gay and then going on a massive heater after the failed Lowry trade to the New York Knicks. The FO wanted to tank for Wiggins that season, and didn't expect the team to come together and get home court in the playoffs. (tied for the 3rd best record in the East despite a 6-12 start, albeit a weaker East that season)"
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Ben McLemore is one of those players where if you knew nothing about the NBA and you watched his highlights you'd think he was a superstar  Same with players like Rudy Gay and Jeff Green
Still waiting for a nance for rudy gay trade. Drummond's GayLove SexLand too good to pass up.
Name's Rudy but he says he's not gay. Something ain't adding up here.
"One of those guys was Isaiah Thomas who is basically the worst defender in the NBA and wasn't anywhere near as good as he was on the celtics. Another was Rudy Gay who was traded for peanuts and the raptors did better after trading him. After Gay, Thomas, and Cousins that team was bad."
Fuckin Rudy Gay mannnnn
Rudy Gay
There were a couple of years when us wolves fans would get irate at the Rudy Gay comps....we would have been fortunate for a Gay Wiggins.
Not bad for lightskinned Rudy Gay.
"If he wasnt a top pick and didn't have a bloated contract, he'd basically be viewed as Rudy Gay or Jeff Green. Nice enough role player, can get you some buckets. He'd also have been traded a bunch with every team thinking he'd be their missing offensive piece"
It was Biyombo and Rudy Gay
"Send us Rudy Gay, we'll make some three way trade shit happen"
That kinda just shows how stacked the west has always been like legit how the fuck did Rudy gay not get an all star ever??? Did Kevin Martin ever get one?
Rudy Gay? What?
Rudy Gay is a decent 3 and D wing
Miami is going to try to get LaMarcus and Rudy Gay in a package deal
One Rudy Gay and Patty Mills please
"We recently been without Keldon Johnson (recently came back last game), Derrick White, Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell. All were getting decent to big mins. Luka Samanic has stepped up and contribute as of late which is nice to see. Can't wait to get the whole squad back and healthy."
The last three games we played were without Derrick white and Rudy gay. KJ also missed two games. Demar missed a game due to his dad passing. We did postpone a few games but we also have been playing with guys missing.
"Tbf that’s the reason I asked the question about yalls injuries/COVID situation. But half of what you just wrote isn’t even really worth mentioning.. LA being old? Demar out for a very limited time for personal reasons? The only legitimate thing anyone in this thread has mentioned is White being out.   One of your “covid guys” averages 5 pts and the other is a 34 year old Rudy Gay.   This pretty clearly doesn’t compare to the other 3 teams I mentioned, but you can pretend you’ve had it rough.. lol."
"Yep, played our last 4 games without Derrick White, Rudy Gay, Vassell, Keldon Johnson missed 3 and LMA and DeMar have also missed a game each. We're 2-2 in that span"
"Spurs fan here, IMO if we trade anyone it'll be LMA or Rudy Gay."
I could see Miami taking him as filler along with Rudy Gay. Basically he can be salary filler but not the centerpiece of a deal
one Rudy Gay please.
"“According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Spurs are taking calls on LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Trey Lyles and Patty Mills ahead of the March 25 trade deadline.”"
NO! NOT RUDY GAY! NO NOT THIS GUY! *NOOOOOOOO*
I felt like the raptors fan getting destroyed by Rudy Gay in Iso at the end of the game.
"the year before the Rookies sported a 30 years young rookie Jorge Garborosa along with 22 year olds Paul Mislap and Andrea ""Primo Pasta"" Bargnani; 23 year olds Adam ""Mustache Morrison and Brandon Roy; and babies (21) Jordon Farmar and Rudy Gay.  Jorge was a year younger than KG, who would appear in his 10th allstar game the next night. And he was older than many of the other allstars, including Gilbert Arenas, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard..."
Rudy Gay
"The “defensive raptor” rating is famously unreliable. Has poetl as its highest rated defensive player; with Conley, Isaiah Stewart, Christian wood, and Rudy Gay all in the top 10. Would really only use offensive raptor rating, if you’re going to use it at all."
I know they have that's why I said I agree that they can be unstoppable  But OP made their very finalized take based on a game against a Spurs team missing some key defenders. I'm not trying to act like Rudy Gay is a KD stopper or anything but a strong judgment like that shouldn't be taken away from a game against a team with a significantly weakened defense
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
There's not a lot of options for stretch bigs on the market. Right now there's Boogie and Drummond. Are either of those a big improvement? If you downsize a bit you might be able to make a trade for an expiring Rudy Gay contract.

Yall Raptor fans have been petty with us dating all the way back to Rudy Gay  That was the weirdest fucking timeline. That he looked decent for us made you guys so mad
"My immature middle school self wanted Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Demarcus Cousins all to be on the same team"
Rudy Gay as well imo
He’s basically on the Rudy Gay path at this point. Not even throwing shade.
Rudy Gay though? Lol  It’s better names to throw out there than him.
Rudy gay tho
"I still feel bad because I'm sure he would have loved to have been a part of All Star Weekend. Boggles my mind that Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver are all stars while guys like Conely and Rudy Gay have never made it. On the other hand, I'm so happy for guys like Randle and Lavine making it, it's always nice to see first-time all stars imo."
Honorable mention: Rudy Gay
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
"No thanks, unless you're giving us prime Rudy Gay with prime Tim Duncan :)"
Why the fuck did you pick Rudy Gay?
"bro all I said was that they were actual nba players who could dribble basketballs and tie their shoes, and that *some* of them were good at basketball.  Rudy Gay’s career resurgence started in Sac, and Collison was a good shooter and passer who didn’t turn the ball over much.  it’s not revisionism, all of those listed players were exactly what I said they were, you’re just too lazy to read. honestly, 2015-16 Rondo/Gay/Collison are better than Lebron’s first finals team, and he wasn’t in his prime yet. Saying 2012-2013 Lebron wouldn’t drag those bums to the playoffs is just being fucking stupid."
"prime lebron would have carried those teams to the playoffs. where the fuck were you in 2012 and 2013? lebron would have carried ME to the playoffs. those were actual nba players.   rudy gay, rondo, darren collison, omri casspi, marco bellinelli, seth curry, ben mclemore, willie cauley-stein. those are all functional nba players who can dribble basketballs and tie their shoes. some of them are actually good at basketball. lebron might have gone to the finals with them. you're underrating how absurd he was in his prime. bro he used to jump with his head above the rim and play defense during the regular season and he was just as smart as he is now. it was fucking crazy"
"Im not saying prime lebron couldnt carry any team, i agree that he can. Im just disagreeing with your boogie take, the man gets so much slander. For most of his tenure at SAC, his 2nd and 3rd option were Rudy Gay and Daren Collison. As soon as he left to NOP, he was in the running for MVP for half the season before he got injured."
Rudy Gay would be awesome off Philly’s bench
"more like, which team has Rudy Gay?"
"That's because you're only looking at it from the offensive pov. Fans tend to overrate offense and underrate defense hence why inefficient volume scorers like melo, derozan and Rudy gay (when he was younger) would probably be seen as great players because people see the 20 ppg.  One in that era, people were still shooting tons of mid-range shots so other teams didn't really have the firepower to make the spurs pay for playing through the post. Secondly the trio of Duncan, Robinson and bowen were elite defenders. The video even mentions that Duncan's block rate went down 15% when Robinson was on the court with him"
"I mean compare it to other combo forwards of that era if you want, Lebron, Kirilenko, Rudy Gay,  Shawn Marion, Al Harrington, Gerald Wallace, litterally every combo forward of the mid/late 2000's was averaging that kind of rebounding numbers call it good if you want to compare it to smaller 3's but those guys who played both forwards spots all were between 7 and 8 rebounds per 36."
[NO NOT THAT GUY. NOT RUDY GAY!](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg)
"We drafted Devin Vassell at 11 this year. Rudy Gay was drafted 8th, Jakob Poeltl was drafted 9th and Trey Lyles was drafted 12th"
Yeah I love his game. Him and Rudy Gay are two guys I feel like just don't get enough praise
I'd put Battier over Rudy Gay. Battier was amazing at the 3 whereas Rudy was very inconsistent with us.
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
Is this the Rudy Gay guy? Their voices are weirdly similar
"Rudy Gobert, Rudy Gay, Rudy Huxtable, Laker in 5."
"Why would misses be relevant here? These are about game tying or made field goals.   Not about how many you miss vs how many you make. The only reason it would matter would be because one player might have taken more than the other.  But missing game winning/tying field goals is not a bad thing. Sometimes you just miss.  In fact, if we took FG% into account, Rudy Gay would be more clutch than Dame, Book, Oladiopo, Russ, LeBron, DeMar, etc. We know that's not true."
"Are they weak? not really. Can they make moves to improve? definitely. That TPE needs to be used before expiring, and they need to add at least one decent player with it.   28.5M fits quite a bit of players out there so they can add 1-2 rotation players for essentially picks and/or young players.   Spurs can send LMA for relatively cheap and he can solidify their big man rotation. We could swap Rudy Gay for Thompson to give more versatility. Both are on expiring deals so not much to lose it it doesnt work out, but both are old so not a lot of potential there.   But I think adding LMA and Gay for Thompson, picks and TPE to throw to the bench would be pretty legit move for BOS come playoff time. Both players can help win a game or two per series if put in the right position to contribute."

Rudy Gay
i was just testing ur knowledge bro obviously i'm talking about Rudy Gay
Used to be Rudy Gay
"You might be right if voting was positionless, but which winning Western frontcourt players would you have over Zion or Ingram?   Derrick Favors? Ingles? Ayton? Rudy Gay? Draymond?  Remember second to last isn't as bad as it seems. 8th through 14th are tightly packed."
"i called him ""Rudy Gay 2.0"" and ""wing Okafor"" before the draft lol absolutely shameful"
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better.

"Don't forget Rudy Gay man. He's still a valuable guy for us, especially when we need to go small and play him at the 5."
Rudy gay with the veteran move to get and 1
on my female gossip boards when it comes to the groupie talk some are saying they think rudy is gay.
Good dude who just wasn't efficient on the floor when he was a Grizz. Poor man's Rudy Gay. But just one in an endless line of failed attempts to find a good shooting wing alongside the Core 4 of Grit and Grind.  Can't hate the dude though. A great community guy especially pediatric heart patients.  Glad he's having a resurgence in his career.
That's an interesting way to spell rudy gay..
"Good point, but once we trade Blake for Rudy Gay and Kevin Love, Gay Love will out duel SexLand in a super sweaty 7 game series"
"I’m waiting for the day Harden, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Sexland, Dickley, and the both Balls play on the same team."
Prime Rudy gay = Lebron + Curry
"Well Atlanta’s young as well so we could send some young players. Probably Lonnie and a protected first? If they want a backup big, we have Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, and Luka Samanic (it would hurt to lose Lonnie &amp; Samanic)  If they want veterans for a playoff push, I could see adding expirings from Atlanta and giving Rudy Gay over for added offense and shooting. Idk if they’d WANT Aldridge, but he certainly is available in any capacity.  I’d nix any deal involving DeRozan, Mills, or our other young players, though, and just try and sign him in the offseason.   If Atlanta wants to make a playoff push and need backup shooting, I could see a way we incorporate Rudy Gay to the trade and get expiring back as well. God forbid we"
You finally got Rudy Gay to play for you guys
Paul George kinda resembles Rudy Gay. They could be cousins
"I compared siakam to green and grant to durant bec Green is an amazing player but his value suffers if there are no shooters/playmakers around him to play off of his skillset (passing, movement, defense). Siakam is the same. He’s the second most important (like green) but take the no. 1 guy from the team (curry, kawhi) and their value plummets. Grant is more like durant wherein his value stays intact whether u have a superstar with him or not (denver misused him Last season and played milsap, harris, barton more than him). The reason why i made such comparison is bec u said hrant reminds u of siakam with a three, which I humbly disagree with.   I’d reckon rudy gay’s a closer comp if not for rudy’s limitations derensively. Grant is a very versatile defender. But yes, way better than Siakam. Gay can actually create his own shot."
Would you say Jerami Grant is more similar to Rudy Gay? Maybe Danny Granger?

"""NO, NOT THAT GUY"" - Rudy Gay"
It's more fun with rudy gay huh
Rudy Gay got faked and then just have up as he knows no way he can recover lol
Don't let the 3rd quarter Warriors distract you from the fact that Curry hit the breaks on the 3pt line and Rudy Gay nearly ended up in the restricted area.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"DeMar post-Rudy Gay trade:   ""You can sink and drown, or you can stay afloat. And we're out here like Michael Phelps.""  I love this man"
Rudy Gay is contemplating his life decisions
Curry did it in rudy gay tonight also
NOOOO NOOOO RUDY GAY MAN???? is it gonna be one of those?
"I fuckin love Rudy Gay, man"
"not to mention salt lake city is pretty fucking liberal. our last mayor was a lesbian, there is a huge gay population here, i went to countless BLM marches in the summer with hundreds of people. if you walk through the avenues (a neighborhood in salt lake), you can’t go half a block without seeing either BLM, biden, feminist signs in front of houses.  i hate that we have the reputation that we do, i hate the racist fans, and i know a LOT of jazz fans that feel the same way. we have a lot of racist and/or conservative fans, but i feel like that has been overstated to the point that people think that EVERY jazz fan is racist, that we ALL comment hate on donny’s instagram when he posts about social issues (ignoring the large amount of us commenting our support), that people should dislike the jazz because they see it as a sort of moral signifier.  a lot of us just love the fucking utah jazz, love donovan, love rudy, love joe, just love BASKETBALL and aren’t racist at all. fuck anyone that says utah doesn’t “deserve” the team, this team is a huge part of the lives of so many people that haven’t done anything to deserve the scorn of the rest of the country."
"Yeah look at Pop. He changed his entire scheme to fit Derozan and Gay while still holding onto some of the motion/triangle stuff that they won their last championship with. He know Demar and Rudy aren’t going to just run around like JJ Reddick all night and it’s not what they excel at. He’s figure out a nice middle ground between iso five out ball and his traditional motion offense.  I would say Kerr should do this too but this team is so bad idk if it even matters. They need to minute restrict Steph and try and really work on wiseman’s game. This year is a wash at this point. I thought if they flipped Wiggins or Oubre for somebody they might have a chance to win a playoff round but it’s not worth potentially seriously injuring Steph just to play the play in tournament. I think Bob Meyers deserves some blame for bringing in Oubre when they already had shooting problems. I don’t blame him for the wiseman pick because Klay was healthy at that point and they didn’t necessarily need Halliburton or Lamelo. But man, imagine one of those two with Curry out there. They’d be so much better."
"Rudy Gay or Batum, top 25 earners ever and not known by the general population. Probably could have a normal life after playing."
Rudy Gay was unstoppable. Tony Wroten too. I'll try to think of some other slighty above average tier players that were gods in that game.
As Rudy Gay said about playing in Sac.   Welcome to basketball Hell.   Kill me please
"He's fallen into that Rudy Gay/Monta Ellis ""20ppg bounce around the league"" Club"
Never heard the possibility of Rudy Gay getting bought out and like I said in the post according to Chris Haynes the Magic most likely are gonna keep Otto.

Rudy Gay always so clutch in the 4th
Lol  Maybe Rudy Gay
"He’s on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they’re stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He’s averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn’t terrible, but it’s the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they’re significantly worse than Vassell."
Think he means Rudy Gay. Only logical explanation.
"&gt; In the ""Rudy Gay, not that guy"" game, we shot 0% from 3.   lmao I forgot about this clip, TSN used to play that shit all the time."
PG: DJ Augustin / Steph Curry  SG: James Harden / Bradley BEal  SF: LeBron / kd  pf draymond / rudy gay   center embiid / nick olayokich
Rudy gay when he tries to do too much. He’s mostly 75-80% good in his role but there’s the occasional time where he takes bafflingly bad shots
"Ya this is the dilemma i'm in. I prefer winning with our current young core, over tanking. Similar to the scenario the raptors had in 2014 after trading rudy gay and winning, instead if tanking for wiggins.  However, I also understand that the top 4 picks can be franchise changing this year. The only scenario i dont want is to finish in the 20-26 slot and miss the playoffs."
Correct.  Now it's Rudy Gay.
Rudy gay maybe? Dude has made a lot in his career  Edit: $168M
I think that'd be Rudy Gay
"One good way to look at this would be: ""How many players from the spurs roster would still be in the NBA in 3 seasons? Versus the Warriors roster?""  You can't tell me that a supporting cast of Trey Lyles, Rudy Gay, Mills, White is worse than Damion lee, a washed Bazemore, JTA and Mulder.    Kerr doesn't have  a goal to make a middling push to the playoff - hence this stressful period of trying to get everyone to adapt to the next season's game. Whoever can adapt well will make it to the next season and the rest will be cut."
Prime Rudy Gay.
you guys actually started the modern era for us. we were up 30 on you guys in the 3rd uarter and you came back to beat us. 2 days later we made the rudy gay trade and the 'We The North' era started
"Rudy Gay's first season was in 2006-2007. [Rudy Gay has the 14th most points since 2007, right behind Dwight Howard.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-points-scored-since-2007-season)"
Lol that’s funny Cus that game essentially made Masai trade Rudy Gay.

"Rudy Gay hit some clutch shots and was really in a rhythm so I understand leaving him in, but Trae is just built different.   Spurs were stuck, even when they would trap him or just chase him around the court he would just find Capela or Gallo for points. And the Spurs were pressed for points to keep up with Trae so even though he had 5 fouls, it's not like Trae is going to be in on defending plays  unless forced and the Spurs had to take the points to keep up. DeRozan and Gay both had great games, Trae just wanted it more in the end"
No that's Rudy Gay
RUDY FUCKING GAY MAN
Well damn Rudy Gay
NO NOT THIS GUY  FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN  nice shot
"Exactly, he’s not even better than Rudy Gay."
&gt;he’s not even the best SF in his generation  Yeah until he proves he is better than Rudy Gay there's no reason to have him in GOAT talks.
"Not necessarily true.  Miami could have put forward a Meyers Leonard/Kelly Olynk package.  Two expirings that weren't giving them much value (Olynk has been pretty bad this year).    Perhaps Miami would want to go for Aldridge as a backup big behind Bam.  Spurs would be happy to get Olynk back for the stretch run, since they were sorely needing any sort of depth in the frontcourt - way too much Drew Eubanks, Trey Lyles, annd Rudy Gay at the center position."
"Few things.   He wasn’t supposed to be the guy, he was supposed to be beside Rudy Gay. But when Rudy Gay was traded, the rest of the team stepped up huge because they realized they were going to be shipped out. This caused the entire turnaround of the franchise and instead of blowing up the Raptors went on the have the most successful era of Raptors history.   Another thing to note is Lowry at his best was an elite shooter.From 2015-16 to 2017-18 Lowry was shooting 3 3PM a game on around 40% shooting, the only players with a better % with higher volume in that time frame were Curry and Thompson.   After that it was really just Lowry’s IQ developing to an elite level."
"I always preferred the Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Ramon Sessions last name combo."
Rudy gives. Rudy takes. But he's always Gay.
Kings should sign Rudy in the offseason so they can have Gay Guy come off the bench.
"Nah I hella like Rudy Gay, he was on my tall-ball fantasy team a number of years ago.  BOSH  FAVORS  GAY  LOVE  SESSIONS"
We love Rudy Gay
Are these the only two fanbases in the league that like Rudy Gay?
"I can't find it now, but I remember seeing a vlog type video showing the day Rudy Gay got traded from Toronto. This was before the Raptors became a perennial playoff type and they were struggling hard, and it was clear Rudy was a terrible basketball fit there. But that whole locker room was super shook up about it, those dudes took it really hard. I still think about it before any major trade, that these guys build such a tight relationship with each other and to unexpectedly get traded or watch a teammate get traded devastating, no matter if it turns out to be the right decision or not."
"well, I have loved basically all of our young guys. DeJounte looks like he can legitimately be the second best player on a contender to me. Keldon is a human bull and great. Lonnies shot reminds awesome but him and DJ finally learning to finish has been amazing. Luka Samanic has shown excellent perimeter defense, strong rebounding, good shooting, good finishing, and solid driving. this dudes gonna be fucking awesome some day.  as for things that make me angry, not trading Rudy Gay even though his value peaked. not getting anything last year when LMA started bombing hells threes and I was begging for them to get something for him. all of our young guys get too passive sometimes and I just want them to just take the fuck over when they're hot, but they just stop trying to score and it infuriates me.  Iin the future, at this point, I want them to make the playoffs and hopefully take a game or two off someone good. no point tanking now since we only improved with the Gorgui signing. I'd like to see DeMar signed and traded the more I think about it. if that's not possible, then I guess you just keep him since he'd s great leader, but anything over 30 million is just gonna be....tough, for me. I struggle to believe they couldn't have gotten something really good from a team that could use him like the Bulls, since only so many teams were willing to be sellers."
Yes the 2 best defenders in the league are...patty mills and Rudy gay
"My Grizz would be fun  PG Mike Conley, Ja Morant,  Jason Williams SG Tony Allen, Mike Miller, Bonzi Wells SF Rudy Gay, Shane Battier, James Posey PF Pau Gasol, Zbo, Shareef Abdur-Rahim C Marc Gasol, Jaren Jackson Jr, Big Country Reeves"
How about Rudy Gay for Memphis?
Grizzlies would be pretty solid too. It’s either Ja Morant/Mike Conley/Jason Williams SG Tony Allen SF Rudy Gay PF Pau Gasol/ZBO C Marc Gasol
Rudy gay
"They won't. But regardless of where those picks land, I don't trust Houston to draft well. That was just one example of poor drafting. Before taking Yao first overall, their next best draft pick was Sam Cassell in 1993 at 24... Then you have Rudy Gay (at 8, which is actually pretty good). Aaron Brooks (26th in 2007), Marcus Morris (14th in 2011), Mirotic (23rd in 2011), Jeremy Lamb (12th in 2012), Royce White (16th in 2012), Terrence Jones (18th in 2012) (They had 3 picks, 1 lotto and 2 just out and Lamb is decent and the other two didn't last long in the NBA), Capela (25th overall in 2014, which was decent but not really franchise-altering).Martin was drafted by the Kings, and I'm not quite sure the circumstances. Was he taken knowing that the Rockets were going to acquire him?  It makes sense to judge them because we already know how good Simmons is. You're wagering that a front office with a poor draft record over the last 20+ years is going to do something with those late first round picks. You're being optimistic hoping that those three superstars opt out and leave Brooklyn, an organization that's been on an upswing over the past 5 or so years.  I appreciate the optimism, but it's objectively a worse trade than any package involving Simmons because you have guaranteed All-Star talent. Drafting at almost any position is a tough wager, and hopefully some of those guys pan out, but I would be a little worried that they don't. I also think Simmons, at age 24, could have been a pretty valuable trade piece in the future if Houston decided to move him. He's a #1 overall pick."
I remember I thought trading Rudy gay was a mistake and we should build our team around him. Whoops.
"Don't I know it, man.   I have been a huge advocate for getting whatever we could for DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay and Patty Mills (and even, before the extension, Derrick White if it was enough value) and hitting the reset button.  This team stinks, none of the young guys have the ceiling to actually be *the guy* and we're either going to overpay aging players this summer to keep them around, or we're going to lose them for nothing because we wanted to go 37-35.  All because our coach is 72 years old and doesn't feel like resetting the roster."
"&gt; I think it’ll be close to $15 mil.  There's about zero chance Lowry goes for that little money unless somebody does something dumb like gives him a 4/$60M at age 36.  37 year old Iguodola is still making $15M, 35 year old Rudy Gay, and a host of other guys who are far less productive than Lowry make $15M.  He'll get either a 1/$25M or a 2/$40M+ easily from a lot of teams.   He's aging but he's still putting up a 17/5/7 and he plays hard and brings veteran leadership."
Which NBA player is the most average? I'd say Rudy Gay
"He's talking about Rudy Gay, which is an obvious top 5 candidate"
"I mean, it wasn't the ideal situation, but he was kind of what we had when Eubanks wasn't on. Lyles and Rudy are both 4s, but once Aldridge was out, we only had 2 centers (and Eubanks is a bit small w/out a lot of rim protection) and 3 PFs (Gay, Lyles, and Samanic). Out of the non Poeltl options, Rudy is still probably the best player to get on the floor."
"""Basketball Hell"" according to Rudy Gay"
"For vets looking to rebuild their career (eg Rudy Gay), I think its a good deestination. For young players with high potential who got drafted to shit organizations, I think its surprisingly underrated. For everyone else, yeah SAS doesn't really make much sense."
Rudy Gay being here while shooting 38% from 3 is almost impressive
I mean Poetl is a top 10 center **defensively** lol. They don't need LMA who can't really play defense and has fallen off a cliff offensively as well. Especially considering they have Demar DeRozan playing PF and have Rudy Gay off the bench.
100% agree. I like the signing! Spurs haven't attracted a good free agent since LMA or Rudy Gay if you want to count him.
"Yep, it's either this or play Eubanks/Rudy Gay at Center when Poeltl is resting, I'll take it"
At that time KD hadn't comeback from his Achilles injury so there were very few players who looked the same after that injury (Dominique and Rudy Gay IIRC)
Terrence Williams and Rudy Gay were always some of my favorite players to play with
He absolutely has been a better rim protector than Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay
"Sam Perkins, Rod Strickland, Marcus Camby, Jason Terry, Ron Harper, Lamar Odom, Richard Jefferson, Cedric Maxwell, CJ Mccolloum, or Rudy Gay."
"Rudy Gay has had an awesome career.   always in contention in Memphis and just had to chuck. lived in toronto for a few years, moved out to cali, and now he’s enjoying his retirement in San Antonio on the riverwalk    he’s allay $163 million from basketball"
"Yeah I was blown away by his sheer size last time I watched the Bulls. I think I was expecting him to be like Rudy Gay size, but he is fully 7 feet tall and built like a center, but able to move like this highlight.   He seems super underrated as a guy who is still young enough to become a perennial all star."
"Love me some Norm but we can afford to part ways if it fits a need. Masais a great tinkerer, he turned Rudy Gay into a bunch of guys that fit our needs so well we became a playoff team. If masai trades norm for one or more pieces who can boost our rebounding and interior D id be for it rather than breaking the bank for him. Id love Norm back at 15/year but otherwise wed be overpaying him when he hasnt shown to take over games when it matters most (which is what you need to compete in the playoffs)"
I feel like Rudy gay can be a Jae crowder/Andre iguodala type contributor for a contender.
"https://imgur.com/sFETNUu  Vlade sold the farm to get more cap space to sign Rajon Rondo and Rudy Gay thinking that was enough to make the playoffs in the West. The two people the Kings got never played a minute in the NBA. The 2017 pick swap ended up happening as Kings dropped from 3rd pick to 5th pick.  Funniest part of all, there were reports Vlade didn't know what the Stretch Provision rule was. If he knew about it, he could have bypassed this entire trade."
https://i.imgur.com/fmQBX7a.jpg  Rudy Gay is fouling him.
Caris LeVert without a doubt. Young Rudy Gay was my favourite for a while too.
"And I think that giving up future assets to keep present, expiring assets is stupid when there is no ceiling for this team.   And let me be clear: it is *functionally the same* to trade away a future second for Rudy Gay to aid this year's team and to forego receiving that pick in order to keep Gay.  If you wouldn't trade a pick to get a similar player on a rental, then we shouldn't be keeping him when we could get a pick.  The stupidity of doing so is compounded by letting him walk in the offseason for nothing."
"Miami has plenty of 1 year deals to match salary, but Rudy Gay being included is likely what is stopping a deal from going through"
"&gt;Rudy Gay, Dejounte Murray, Luka Samanic  lol  why the fuck would the spurs do this??"
"&gt; Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?   So you love these defensive stats when they favour Lebron but discount them for Jokic? DBPM, D-PIPM, D-RAPTOR. Basically any defensive advanced stat paints Jokic as a very clear positive defensive player. Yet you call him atrocious.  &gt; Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.   Probably, although I could see Philly falling off a bit while he is out and then surging when he comes back helping the narrative on his case.   &gt; The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.   Yeah I mean if the best argument against Giannis is ""he's already won it"" maybe we should look at his actual stats.  &gt; So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes?   IMO no, I'd probably have him second or third on my ballot right now (with the exclusion of Embiid).  &gt; Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   Firstly, what does year in year out have to do with MVP? Its this years award. Secondly, I dont really love on/off anyway because it doesn't really quantify anything other than how bad your replacement(s) is/are, but regardless all these guys have amazing on/off numbers, they are MVP candidates. Embiid +17, Lebron +11, Giannis +11, Kawhi +14 even Jokic has a +6 despite an incredibly strong bench unit on his team etc."
Rudy Gay. I'm quite a Gay man myself
"Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?  Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.  Luka is the 8th seed.  Steph isn't even in the playoffs right now.  The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.  James Harden has his Houston mess which will turn off voters in addition to being apart of a superteam roster with 34 combined allstar appearances.  So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes? Poised to keep winning games without Anthony Davis for another 3 weeks.   Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   How do you *not* make the case LeBron is the favorite and in the lead right now?"
"Rudy Gay was never even that good. Not a great choice   Marcus Camby, Rod Strickland, Derek Harper, Andre Miller, Isaiah Rider are my picks"
"Rudy gay is a chucker, your not an all star when it takes you 26 shots to get 30 points, there’s a reason hes been traded so much he doesn’t make your team better. He’s played his best team basketball in San Antonio but no way he’s an all star"
Rudy Gay is a great pick.
"Rudy Gay, Jason Richardson, Lamar Odom were always at the top of this list to me."
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn’t pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‘04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‘05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‘06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‘07: Durant (#2 — sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"I'd say Rudy Gay tho  Everyone on our sub praises Demar, DJ, Keldon  But Rudy (and Mills) have been anchoring are defense. Without him our bench wouldnt be so good"
Rudy Gay probably

Rudy Gay has been my favorite player since his rookie year. I may be the only person on earth lmao.
This is hilarious from a TOR fan because a lotta Rudy Gay discourse nowadays is just people memeing his clutch shot against them. So that just means you literally haven't been paying attention to the league at all since the time you supposedly watched him lol
near 20 pts or more from Rudy gay like its 2012
Gay for Rudy Gay
The one where Rudy Gay shoots a mid court shot for no reason with 8 seconds left only for the Lakers to rebound for an end of quarter Kobe 3  https://youtu.be/Qlmg3yW60Xk
"&gt;	Sure every model has some outliers, RAPTOR just have so many it is pretty concerning.  Not really, RAPTOR has a lot fewer outliers compared to most models  &gt;	When you have someone like Conley who the model has rated pretty average for his entire career, and then the one year he starts for the Jazz he is suddenly the 7’th best defender, suggest that the model is heavily slanted towards team bias.   Conley has not been average for his career at all that’s a pretty casual take. Conley has always been an all-defensive caliber guard and it’s obvious that his high D-RAPTOR is heavily influenced by sharing the court with gobert a lot. You have to look at context.   &gt;	Then there are guys like Poetl, and Gay, this year, and FVV too where their ability just doesn’t match up with their ratings.  Rudy and Poetl both play low minutes and mainly play against bench squads. Again context. And FVV has been really good this season. D-Raptor is generally less reliable than O-RAPTOR, but even D-RAPTOR shows that this is Wiggins best defensive season. But his offense is still clearly very bad."
This is a stat that has Jakob Poetl as the best defensive player in the NBA and Rudy Gay in the top 10.  Raptor has so many outliers it is hard to take seriously.
Rudy “oh no not that guy” gay
NO It's Rudy Gay! NOOO!
"Tony Rudy ""Jeremy Lamb"" Gay Snell"
"Tony ""Rudy Gay"" Snell"
"If last nights game is any indication, Rudy Gay and Trey Lyles now playing a good portion of our backup center minutes. Yup we're thin."
Yeah I can see him having a solid Rudy Gay-type career
&gt;  Rudy Gay  Was better before he arrived in SAC and the Grizzlies improving after they traded him away should have been a huge red flag.  Love Rudy tho.
Rudy Gay had a career renaissance of sorts with us. Rondo won a ring with the Lakers and was valued everywhere else he went save Dallas.
"Pau George is just Rudy Gay with defense, change my view"
The Rudy Gay era in Toronto feels like a fever dream.  I remember tons of comments of “Fat Rudy” and destroyed statsheets in the lockerroom.  Time flies.
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
Rudy gay has really changed his game for the better
"I feel like the biggest thing for you guys was trading Rudy Gay back in 2013. There were tons of articles about how that was addition by subtraction and it's been nothing (well, mostly) up since then."
"Rudy Gay is a good comp. In Minnesota, he was expected to carry the team or try one of Saunders crackpot Point forward options(which, he is not equipped for as a play-maker, OBVIOUSLY). He is gonna be in the league a long time due to his durability. He'll get a market level contract and be an asset on any team he's on. Of course, Wolves fans have said this but, due to being drafted and signed by us, the narrative dictates how people see him as a player.  He was an improved defensive player in Minnesota and wolves fans told r/nba his defense wasn't that bad. (It's almost like good team defense raises everybody's ratings and some defensive analytics are nebulous)"
"Wiggins is the same player, now he’s just in a more natural role with true stars.   Wiggins is going to be one of those 20 ppg players that plays for 15-20 years as a solid role player that doesn’t miss time. The issue is everyone thought he was going to be a star. Instead we got another Rudy gay (18-20 ppg scoring threat for years) with better defense"
"Here's my list:  * DeMar DeRozan - It feels like he has fallen off a crater since being traded away from Toronto. I think he's obviously good, but if he's your best player or two your team doesn't go anywhere. I predict he'll have a sneaky great back-end of his career if he takes a steep pay-cut (maybe can take up the Rudy Gay role in some outside contender back East?)  * Andrew Wiggins - I thought Wiggins sucked in Minnesota and was a volume scorer. Now it looks like his efficiency numbers have gone up with the Warriors. What's there plan with him? Do Warriors fans like him? How does his role change with Klay back?  * Collin Sexton - He's a guard I loved out of college at Alabama but I don't know what to make of his scoring numbers on Cleveland, and I can't imagine the ""I'm the #1 on this team"" mentality can be good for a young player given some of the stories Russillo has told about his shoot-first game.   Any team fans that can provide insight would be much obliged"
Rudy Gay in Toronto for great player on bad team being the reason we lose.
[MFW Rudy Gay](https://youtu.be/a3_PPdjD6mg)
Always loved how Rudy Gay was basically a cheat code
"3 for the Kings: De'Aaron Fox, Boogie, and Rudy Gay. 4 if you want to count Kosta Koufos"
"He played the middle a lot on defense but we can’t pretend he didn’t play the majority of his career next to undeniable centers. Robinson from his 97-98 to 03. Then Rasho Nesterovic for 2 years then Nazr Mohammed, Fabricio Oberto... these were slow tall players that started and played big minutes next to Timmy. It wasn’t until Dejuan Blair started a lot during the 2010-11 season that Timmy was not playing next to a true center. That’s 12 years by then he was considered a PF. And even dejuan didn’t last long. Just a couple years later Tiago Splitter was starting. Another pretty undeniable Center. Unless were saying the spurs started 2 centers for about 15 years of timmys 19 year career I’m not sure you can die on the hill that Timmy was a Center his whole career. By the very end he was but that’s pretty normal for players to slide up a spot as they age because they can’t guard the same speed they used to. You can see it on the spurs right now with Rudy Gay playing exclusively the 4 at this point in his career after a long time playing the 3"
Grew up in New Zealand  Played 2k8  Dropped 102 points with Rudy Gay against my friend. Grizzlies locked in
When rudy gay crossed lebron wade and dunked on bosh
Why are you doubting Rudy gay and Patty mills
"F*cking Rudy Gay, man!"
I just look at our sub (perhaps not the most representative demographic) crying about Luka’s lost development this year at the hands of Rudy gay and I don’t personally know if it’s worth it. I’d rather take the plunge on the guys we already have and potentially draft that next big we need.   That being said I’d be fine if we signed lauri to a reasonable deal
"harden is too good to compare him to any other player.  like, i’m sure that someone like rudy gay has a similar drop off against playoff competition, but like, who cares? the question with harden isn’t “is he still an elite offensive player in big games?” the question is if harden is the best offensive player of all time, and he’s got a case for it. this hurts that case."
"Besides obvious ones like Las Vegas or Seattle, I’d personally like to see Baltimore have a team, although I don’t think it’s ever likely. But it is a city thats produced lots of quality pro players throughout the years (Melo, Sam Cassell, Reggie Lewis, Rudy Gay to name a few)."
Brooks over Curry makes the Sixers worse lol  Edit: what the fuck is this post. Literally every team in the league would rather have Crowder than Rudy Gay
Rudy gay is not an improvement
"So you’re “improvement” for the suns is to replace crowder who is shooting .385 from 3 with Rudy gay who is shooting .389 from 3? Not to mention he’s only scoring 1 more point, the same rebounds, and fewer assists than crowder. You don’t watch the suns much do you"
"His contract is 3 years $40 million. Players who make around that: taurean prince, patty mills, Cody zeller, Davis Bertans, Rudy gay, justice Winslow, dion waiters. Kuzma has been big for us all year if you watch the games. And what are you on about we kept him over lonzo? There was no way we kept lonzo or BI in that deal."
"I enjoyed seeing Rudy Gay drilling shots in Vivek's stupid face.  Eat shit, you fucking jerk."
What's that you say? 35 minutes for Rudy Gay and Patty Mills?
"Open secret used to be for yrs if he had no connections with a team/player/agent and a story broke about them he couldnt get he would take shots at them. How the LeBron thing all started. He took shots at John Hollinger and Memphis after the Rudy Gay trade for the same thing. And the JR Smith description yeah I remember.   He's kind of tamed on the blatant shot taking/childishness in that regard but it's still bad. He influenced Stein getting kicked out of ESPN, ESPN in general laid off alot of people around when Woj was hired April 2017. Obviously the reason for the exodus wasnt due to Woj but Ive heard that Woj not liking a few people might have tipped the scales in terms of them being let go at that time. He'll in general just do anything for a scoop beyond that.   It's kind of hilarious his protegee he helped mentor back in the day at Yahoo Shams is the same way. One thing that's been known in media for yrs that's become obvious recently is Shams basically takes credit for info that isnt his own and tweets it as stuff ""he's reporting"" alot. And youll see Woj sometimes take subtle shots at that as if he's somehow above general morally questionable behavior lol."
MCW  John Salmons  Brandon Jennings  Rudy Gay in Toronto  Rookie Tyreke Evans  Kevin Martin  Knicks David Lee  This is a whole list of nobodies.
You sound a lot like Demar Derozan fans in Toronto. And Rudy Gay fans in Memphis.
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"I was incredibly lucky and lucked into near courtside seats a couple years ago, I thought the same thing about Rudy Gay. It was the first time I saw someone a thought *""how can someone's arms be that long?*"" (He has a 7'3"" wingspan)"
&gt;	Rudy Gay/Jeff Green **hybrid**  Gay Green is a mid-tier strain.
"yeah man, he's the new rudy gay. catch him putting up 14 ppg on 60%ts as a 32 year old bench player for a texas team"
"Rudy Gay is exactly who I compare him too. Showed some really nice almost All-Star type flashes, but will likely just settle into being a frustratingly consistent guy."
Rudy Gay/Jeff Green hybrid
Basically Rudy Gay
Gobert is 3rd on the Jazz  Shake Milton is 1st on the Sixers  Defensive bum Rudy Gay in 6th in the league 😂

Some guys never click for some reason. (I definitely know that Melo is better than both of the players I am about to mention) look at Carter and to a lesser extent Rudy Gay and RJ. Juat realozed late in their careers that they can hang on make 8 figures and just help teama win and or develope. Just takes a bit of humility maybe. Some guys want to go out on top which is also cool.
Rudy Gay was everywhere you're right
rudy gay plays for the spurs

"Yes. Because he went against Drew Eubanks, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson lol.    Taking fade away mid ranges (including the potential game winner which he could have easily taken to the rim) is a massive win."
 &gt;	Rudy Gay has a career resurgence  NOOOO NOOOOOO NOOOO NOT THIS GUY!
"Spurs, Rudy Gay has a career resurgence"
Why does Rudy Gay give up his position on Ben it's not like a rebound would be useful the shot clock was at like 0.4 seconds
no not this guy!!!  fookin Rudy gay man
Would Lou Williams and Rudy Gay get bench spots on this ex-Raptors team?
Fucking Rudy Gay man lmao I’ve never seen that
All Time: Rudy Gay  Current: Aron Baynes
"This is more like when Kyle Lowry got his opportunity. He was awesome in Houston but they were enamoured with Kevin Martin for some reason and didn't put the ball in his hands. Then he went to Toronto and his first full season they got rid of that boat anchor Rudy Gay, put the ball in his hands and he was was immediately Kyle Lowry. If you got to the game logs you can literally see where they changed the offence and he immediately starts filling it up. He was always that guy."
Current: Rudy Gay (but only bc Pop plays him too much)  All-Time: Richard Jefferson (he was truly awful here)
"&gt; But he finally got an opportunity to start on the Rockets to be the lead PG, took advantage of it, parlayed it into a contract with the Raptors and the rest his history  This isn't completely true tbh. The Raps traded for Kyle when he had 2 more years on his deal that he signed with Houston. In Kyle's first year with the Raps Jose Calderon was still starting over him (Kyle was finally the point guard to take the role from Jose lol). He only started for us once we traded Jose. The Raps almost had him traded after the Rudy Gay deal but Dolan remembered what Masai did to them with Bargnani and backed out. I remember Masai spoke with Kyle before his second season with us saying he could be an all star, and then he became a perennial one."
&gt;Rudy Gay  who is the highest who hasn't won anything ever?
"Which one then? That's such a easy statement to throw out without an argument on who should be left out instead of Rudy.   Rudy Gay had a fine career. You can be very, very successful in the NBA without ever being an all star."
In no way shape or form should Rudy Gay have ever made an All Star team.
That Rudy Gay inbound pass was just so bad.
I’m convinced Rudy Gay threw the game 😂
Fuckn' Rudy Gay man..
Rudy Gay and Patty Mills actively throwing for the spurs lately.
Rudy Gay bet on the Celtics winning.
FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN! Take a damn shot!
Did Rudy Gay bet against us?
Rudy gay really threw the worst inbound pass ive seen in a while
Is Rudy gay okay?? Lmao take the three dummy
Lol pop just ignored rudy gay
"Hate to say it, but maybe so. The only weakness is Tony Allen on offense, I would rather start Rudy Gay at SG, and have Allen and Prince off the bench to keep the defensive identity. Conley in his prime is as good as Lowry (not as good of a shooter, but can score), and Gasol is Gasol. Maybe not as deep of a team but definitely better defensively."
"I think if O.J Mayo reached his potential then Conley, Allen, Gay, Randolph, and Marc with O.J as sixth man is very tough to beat. O.J flamed out and Rudy left and they didn't have a pure wing scorer anymore and that held them back. Melo before the knee injury is enough to put them in the finals imo"
"G&amp;G Grizzlies will forever be my favorite basketball, but yea if you upgrade Jeff Green, Tayshaun Prince, or even Rudy Gay to Kawhi Leonard, I think you’ve got the recipe for a ring.  PG - Mike Conley SG - Tony Allen SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Zach Randolph C - Marc Gasol  Geez. Hard to imagine many teams scoring +100 against that defensive starting lineup."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4. Jakob Poeltl 5. Joel Embiid 6. Myles Turner 7. Mike Conley 8. Derrick White 9. Alex Caruso 10. Rudy Gay 11. Nicolas Batum 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Andre Drummond 14. Jae Crowder 15. Larry Nance Jr. 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Isaiah Stewart 18. Khem Birch 19. Raul Neto 20.

Rudy Gobert 2. Myles Turner 3. Clint Capela 4. Robert Covington 5. Nerlens Noel 6. Matisse Thybulle 7. Jakob Poeltl 8. Alex Caruso 9. Larry Nance Jr. 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo 11. Brook Lopez 12. Draymond Green 13. Joel Embiid 14. Ben Simmons 15. Tobias Harris 16. Jae Crowder 17. Andre Drummond 18. Kent Bazemore 19. Nicolas Batum 20. Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
Ingram might just be a glorified Rudy Gay
Why did harden do that? He didn't wanna play behind mayo and Rudy gay?
And I believe Rudy Gay is one of Lowrys kids godfathers.
Trae Young  Dwyane Wade  Lebron James  Rudy Gay  Dwight Howard  Sixth man: Josh Hart
"\*cough* Iverson \*cough*  Detroit was a disaster, but he could've been a Lou Williams in Memphis with that team and the way it was set up. They had all the pieces that would get them to a WCF a few years later (Gasol, Conley, Randolph) plus they still had Rudy Gay, and young OJ Mayo and Demarre Carroll.  Still disappointed he didn't realize the opportunity. Probably doesn't play until he's 43 like Vince Carter, but still, he could've had a few more productive years of 13+ points off the bench on a playoff team."

"Idk but this dude was a GOAT in 2k, up there with Johny Flynn, Rudy Gay, and Alonzo Gee"
"finally saw the video, Jakarr was gonna swing til he realized it was rudy gay in there, no one wants the old-man-strength smoke"
Do players ever appeal these fines? Do they ever get the union involved to help with the appeals? What was Patty Mills guilty of? And I guess Rudy Gay was supposed to let his teammate get beat up?
Herro will never be Tatum but I still remember the Rudy Gay comps that Tatum was getting during his sophomore slump.
Rudy gay was the 2k goat back in those days though. We would do online leagues with a draft and that motherfucker would go 1st over LeBron or KD lmao

What would Manu have been if not for that one season he played with Rudy Gay.
"i think its a little ridiculous to compare dlo to manu, when dlos team is 15-43 and manu played with a top 10 player of all time, another top point guard ever, and random, great pieces here and there including but not limited to kawhi, bruce bowen, rudy gay"

Rudy Gay
We would have beat Memphis if it applied to us. Lol. Rudy Gay was going to save the day. Its not fair😭😭😭😭😭
"Gosh, it would be terrible if someone's opinions were ""extremely heavily influenced by reputation"". Someone like that would probably make claims that weren't backed up by reality - definitely want to avoid being one of those people.  In totally unrelated news, here's what advanced stats say about Lebron's defense this year  * 18th in [DEPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), between Marc Gasol and Rudy Gay * 26th in [DRAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=-2146555570), between Duncan Robinson and Brad Wanamaker * 40th in [Real Plus-Minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), between Steven Adams and Jae Crowder * 92nd in [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/), with the same rating as Jokic and John Collins * DWS tied for the lowest of his career * DBPM below 2.0 for the fifth season in a row  Interesting.  &gt;awards that are extremely heavily influenced by reputation  Wait...you you actually think that *Lebron James* hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  &gt;I recommend actually watching the games  [**The people who vote on NBA awards**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/htmlview) **are literally employed to watch the games**, and not just the ones involving the player they stan. Basketball is their career. They haven't put Lebron on an All-Defensive team since 2014 because he has not been one of the best defensive players in the league since 2014. Other than that, great comment."
"Dwight, Tyson Chandler, Mcgee, Rudy Gay, Amare lol"
They're putting Gatorade in the water that turns freaking Rudy Gay
I saw rudy with no last name and my mind immediately went to gay
"yeah that was always the masaiplan.  the rebuild was actually supposed to happen when we traded rudy gay away wayyy back in 2013, but that obviously worked out in a wonderful way with the demar/kyle duo for years."
Rudy Gay?
Rudy Gay is great too but since Kawhi left we haven't been able to do anything with him
"Maaan yall cant take jokes/sarcasms sometimes. ""/s"" is really important in this sub eh?   As a continuation of my joke: yeah, lebron is ben simmons on steroids. KD is Rudy Gay on steroids. Steph is Jordan Poole on steroids"
"Where is Rudy Gay?  I meant KD, my bad. 😂"
it's okay man. sorry kd is rudy gay without a super team
durant is just rudy gay without a super team
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
Rudy gay was a high level player he could score with the best of them in his prime. Borderline all star.
"In fairness to Rudy Gay, he had all-star caliber seasons and he got injured in the start of his prime which set him back."
"This is a great point. It makes me wonder about other guys who fit this mold; pretty good at everything, but not great at anything. Never an all star, but in his prime, had the potential to be one. A few that come to mind-    - Josh Smith  - [The L Train] (https://youtu.be/ecdAAdNfwyo)  - Nic Batum  - Boris Diaw, I suppose  - Mychal Thompson  - Rudy Gay  - Jim Jackson managed to be that guy for like half the teams in the league.   - Maybe Larry Hughes and Kendall Gill too.   I refuse to include Lamar Odom on this list because he 100% deserved to be an all star. He was a decade ahead of his time and was the greatest ever at everything. Forever."
He's more like a Rudy Gay type player IMO
"So true. In all fairness, Rudy Gay was a good scorer even in the NBA so it doesn’t surprise me he’d torch just about anyone else."
"reminds me of the Rudy Gay ""Not this guy!"" fan"
"Well, we were chasing playoffs spot, and I'd rather have Rudy Gay than Luka Samanic during crunch time.  What's the deal with Samanic btw? It seems everyone there are obsessed with the guy."
"like don't get me wrong, I could see any of them making all star games someday if EVERYTHING pans out, but everyone's gotta relax calling for pops head lol I didn't love all the rudy gay and patty shots in the second half of the season but next year, hopefully those shots open up for the guys to step in and take their role by the horns."
Fucking Rudy Gay man!
Smh such disrespect for fuckin Rudy Gay man
Not really... trading in Kemba for some more depth players would be better. They dont really need his scoring when they have Tatum and Brown. I feel like it would be similar to the Raptors Rudy Gay trade that sent a high usage low efficiency player out and got them back a hungry bench squad which elevated the team.
The year he got meningitis I think was the best chance the kings had at the playoffs. Rudy Gay and Boogie were cooking people before he got sick.
For a second there I thought you wrote Rudy Gay and I was a bit confused. I guess it's because of the capital G
"Yeah but the thing that gets people in the top 10 is when you can say ""I'm not sure if that team could have won a ring with any player besides him."" Like if you replace LeBron with any other player in 2016, they don't win a ring. It's true the Warriors probably don't win a championship in 2018 if you just remove KD, but if you replace him with any other pretty good SF then they probably still win. Like the player wouldn't even have needed to be that good. Someone like Rudy Gay probably would have gotten the job done."
"We trade Rudy Gay for pieces and got better. Same with PG and Indiana, it's not impossible."
Reggie Evans snatching boards like a madman and Kenyon Sr (weird to even include the Sr. now) locking up Rudy Gay on the final possession to Blake high stepping it out after the final whistle   What a way to get Lob City's first playoff win
CJ McCollum is to guards what Rudy Gay was to forwards 10 years ago. Respected player...but no superstar wanted him to be his max player runningmate
7 foot Rudy Gay.
"What you don't want a starting lineup of CJ, DeRozan, and Rudy Gay? Mid range jumpers for daysssss"
Rudy Gay before his ACL and Achilles injuries was on the way to becoming a superstar.  Post Achilles he’s a useful role player.
Is this actually true? I feel like Wes Matthews and Rudy Gay have been pretty solid health wise since their Achilles injury.
"Rudy Gay was inconsistent with us. But he was able to make his own shots. However, trading him our offensive prowess improved massively as we played through Conley and Gasol mainly."
Rudy gay was not consistent on offense... He fell in love with his mid range. He had nights where he would disappear and nights when he looked liked one of the best players on the floor. He was never close to top 5 in the league. I like Rudy gay but he was the definition of inconsistent and never lived up to his potential before injuries.

"I don’t think it’s directed just natural and it could come back in a way. I think reputational defense allows for an entire team to play and get reffed different.  The main issue is that Centers aren’t being sought for their defense. Let alone someone who played like Marc Gasol.  Wings like Tony Allen just don’t exist because the lack of offense was too big. That ended up getting him benched. You have to at least be decent from 3. And that changes the selection pool.  And even point guards like Conley are rare.   I actually think the 2019-2021 Lakers are the closest modern equivalent. We’ve had a slow, defense driven game plan for 2 years. Our offense just craters and LeBron is LeBron, not Rudy Gay."
Nah Rudy gay was never that nice. Not even close. But he had his moment..he was more Bonzie wells than top 5.
"&gt;Rudy Gay, man  [I can't unhear his voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGJhj2IE8i4&amp;ab_channel=oldrippy86)"
Yes just ignore his defense like everyone else  I think a healthy Rudy Gay explodes into a nasty prime.    We will never know.
"lol that's your right, but yeah Rudy Gay never sniffed All-NBA or anything close at any point in his career."
Rudy Gay and Danny Grainger were the prototype for a lot of these cats.
"Fuckin’ Rudy Gay, man."
"I miss prime Rudy Gay, man"
No. Just found one more I thought retired though. PJ Tucker is still playing.  Rudy Gay is also still playing.
"This is literally everyone, if you include 2006 there's more though but OP said 05  2006 has: Rudy Gay, JJ, Rondo, Lowry, Millsap and PJ Tucker"
"Ive seen LeBron throw the ball at the ref just because Rudy Gay blocked his shot...   (To make things worse, Crybaby didn’t even get a call for that when DeMar was ejected and fined last time he threw a ball in the refs direction)  With all of LeBrons achievements, you’d think he wouldn’t be so insecure..."
"alongside Andrea Bargnani, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, and Rajon Rondo."
"This is as emotional as ""No not Rudy Gay"""
“Tatum is just a light skin Rudy Gay”
Rudy Gay guy
"I think I could win an NBA game with a line up of - ish Smith, Danny Green , finney Smith, Rudy gay,  and thad young."
Kuzma is a like a poor mans Rudy Gay
Only person more Clutch than Dame is Rudy Gay
"7 foot Rudy Gay was always my favorite, but he's not even worthy of that one anymore."
Yeah Rudy Gay is pretty good but I wouldn't say its one of the best defensive season ever
"I gotta go with Big Al Jefferson over Rudy Gay  CJ McCollum and Rudy gay are close seconds tho all time.  Tend to agree with your picks for last 3 years, notwithstanding tobias’ poor acclimation year last year"
"You had me and ya lost me. People have come back from non contact and people haven’t come back from breaking bones. Bill Walton broke his foot and was never the same, Jordan broke his and was Jordan. Rudy gay tore his Achilles and wasn’t the same, kd looks great and Dominique was no slouch after."
Rudy Gay never gets love for his. Still hooping
FUCKIN' RUDY GAY MAN
Will always respond to rudy gay with this   https://youtu.be/b9J4NjkKtlc
I haven't liked the Grizzlies this much since 2k11 with OJ Mayo and Rudy Gay.
Yo! Rudy Gay vs Paul George would've been a nasty matchup!
DDR and Rudy Gay sign and trade for KP and 'stuff'
"Rudy Gay would be nice, that boy was a good shoota"
"A mix between Zach Randolph and Rudy Gay probably, idk if he had accurate comparison lol"
Rudy Gay that goes to the gym at 3:30am
"Carmelo the black hole lol, he’s Raptors Rudy Gay useless."
What if he said Rudy Gay?
  [De-fense! De-fense! De-fense! De-fense! De-fense! Oh it's Rudy Gay! No! No! No! Not this guy! Not this guy! OHHHHHH MY GOD YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg)
"I think the rudy gay thing was recorded from the fans phone, not picked up by the broadcast."
"I remember a Lakers game when a lil boy incessantly screamed right behind the table  but there are also good moments like when the Raptors' fans yelled to stop Rudy Gay  I'm always pro-crowd in big games and big moments ---- dont need to hear ""hand down man down"" for the 200th time"
Then when do we get Rudy Gay?
"Yeah but Kobe was trivial in comparison to Lebron in terms of fucking us over. We only played the Lakers a couple times a year in the regular season and never in the playoffs because they’re out west. So I don’t care about that at all. You can’t compare that to Lebronto at all. Like, we used to somehow lose Rudy Gay all the time too lol but no one cares about that.   Facing Lebron in the playoffs every year sucked though."
I was talking about Manu missing Game 1 for us and Mitchell missing Game 1 for Utah.  Rudy Gay not playing in that series is kind of what unlocked the Grit n Grind Grizzlies.
"Rudy Gay missed the whole series, I think."
very random but id love to see rudy gay on a contender.
This guy sounds like the offensive version from the [Rudy Gay buzzer beater video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg).
"He sounds exactly like the ""Rudy Gay not this guy"" dude!!"
Rudy Gay with a GQ center fold and an espresso machine.
Rudy Gay
"Seriously, people acting like Book/Lavine were playing at a Toronto Rudy Gay level."
Rudy Gay would be a good re-addition to Memphis this summer imo.
"I don't know that there will be an opportunity to bring in another star but I don't think they need another star.  The big thing honestly is how Klay comes back. He's eaten up ~30% of the salary cap these last two years while not playing a minute. No team can win like that. If he can't come back looking like himself next year then the Warriors 2nd run is over before it starts.   If Klay does come back looking close to the level of production he used to have then I really like the idea of a starting lineup that is Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Draymond/Wiseman. Wiseman I imagine will take his 2nd year leap and hopefully by the end of the year learn enough to be a positive impact player at a position of need while also giving the Warriors **much needed** size and rim defense and rebounding.   One thing I think that was underrated by the wider NBA fans is that the Warriors had literally **zero** depth here at the end of the season. Wiseman had season ending surgery, Chriss broke his leg and was eventually moved at the deadline, it was literally only Draymond and Looney holding down the center spot. D.Lee was recovering from COVID and unavailable and biggest of all was Oubre, who was our best perimeter defender and would have been a huge help in both the Lakers and Grizz play-in games.   My thoughts right now are that despite how raw he was Wiseman did show a lot of potential and I think the Warriors are still quite high on him and will not be moving him at all unless someone completely overpays, which I don't think will happen.     I think the Warriors will stay the course with the starting lineup and try to bring in a couple veterans in the off season. I think how they played down the stretch and how Curry played all season, Draymond being top 3 in DPOY, ring chasers will believe that this is both a team that can compete but also a team which may have a real role for them. I haven't gone through the league yet to look for likely candidates. Someone like Rudy Gay, a smart veteran who plays a position of need and has skills that would mesh with the existing roster, is exactly the kind of veteran I'm talking about.   The biggest glaring weaknesses on the roster this year was the absolute lack of shooting and the lack of any kind of off the bench ball handler.  Jordan Poole has stepped up in a huge way and will likely be providing a lot of that next season but I still want to see them bring in at least two more rotation level veterans.   I know Oubre had an up and down season but I think the Warriors would like to re-sign him if the price isn't too high. I think they value his perimeter defense, I think they would like him to come off the bench and provide some scoring punch with the second unit, and he's also a hedge against Klay taking time to get up to speed. If it works out well then great, if not, well once enough time has passed he could be a valuable trade chip.  Looking at the end of the Warriors bench I think Alen Smailagic should not be taking up a roster spot. I don't think Nico Mannion is going to be doing anything for the Warriors anytime soon. Maybe bring Justian Jessup over from Australia and give him the spot, he's supposed to be a knock down shooter.   The Warriors may want some of these roster spots because if the Wolves pick results in a player the Warriors like, if their own pick gets the tiny percent change of being top 4, then the Warriors might just add another prospect to the roster."
Fuckin' ~~Rudy Gay~~ Khris Middleton man
"Boogie is 7 feet tall and heavy, lower leg injuries and loss of mobility on a guy who already can't afford it is a lot different than an off-ball wing like Klay. Klay will definitely be helped by his game being skill-based.   Cousins was already clearly not himself coming off the achilles, whereas KD this year is still dropping 30 a game. Rodney Hood hasn't responded well to his Achilles tear at all, Rudy Gay in his later years recovered well for the Spurs.   Different guys are gonna be effected differently. It would be silly to say 'Klay is definitely going to be 100% the same guy', but it's also kinda silly to say 'Klay is obviously the same as Cousins'."
Oh u are trying to get rid of your problems.. i'll rather take rudy gay than derozan
Rudy Gay flashbacks
Their best shooter % wise is Rudy Gay.  That's the reason.  Their best player is exclusively scores from the midrange.
Best player right now is DeMar DeRozan.  They also don't really have any great shooter.  Best is Patty Mills who's at 37.5% on 6 attempts.  Then theres Rudy Gay at 38% but on 4 attempts.  Pops is just working with what he has.
"We had Bryn Forbes last year, Davis Bertans, Kawhi, Danny Green, a couple years before that.  Derrick White has upped his 3pa rate, but was hurt most of the season. We still have Patty and Rudy Gay shot more 3s this year.  Pop coaches to his players strengths and by the end of the year our 2 best players in DeMar and DJ both don't shoot many 3s. Remember we started the year with LMA who had started shooting 3s a little into the 19-20 season."
Facu-Rudy Gay
"Completely agree with everything you said. I'd even say Porter was also better in the bubble as well. If I'm Denver I'd have traded him last off season after he went nuclear.  This situation reminded me of when Rudy Gay got injured and didn't play the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs a couple of years back. They didn't skip a beat and ended up eliminating the 1st seeded Spurs.  Scoring is very easy to replace. Defense, playmaking and rebounding are what's really valuable in basketball. Anyone can get a bucket."
"Facundo Campazzo, James Wiseman, Rudy Gay, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood"
"You miss all the shots you don’t take - Wayne Gretzky, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Dejounte Murray."
"I got it for free off gamepass, played one game, uninstalled, and went to GameStop to get 2k16 for 99cents  Rondo to Rudy Gay alleyoops all day everyday"
"I was rooting for the Spurs in this one but it was so frustrating to watch him brick those jumpers. Many even rimmed out, it just felt like he had the worst luck possible. That incredible Rudy Gay three gave me hope at the end, but of course they couldn't get another bucket because Gay was doubled and no one else was hot from downtown.   That postgame press conference with DeRozan was hella emotional although I don't even know much about him. I just read sm about him in the Raptors sub when y'all talk abt where Lowry might go and if they somehow end up playing together again."
I get some Rudy Gay late bloomer vibes from him.
"Not a tv announcer but the Rudy Gay ""NOT THIS GUY"" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg) is my favorite."
Rudy Gay 2.0  The seemingly lackadaisical energy is certainly there
Best case scenario trade him to like bulls have bulls give coby white to some team with a decent forward/center and have that center be traded to u and some centers that make sense are boucher if mobley somehow falls to raps diallo rudy gay
"KD and Klay both tore their *right* Achilles, most other stars (Kobe, Boogie, Chauncey, Rudy Gay) tore their left. That's a good thing– for a right-handed player, the left foot is usually the pivot that generates most of your burst. Dominique also tore his right Achilles, and he was still an All-Star after the injury. I'm mostly just worried about the full two-year gap, it's gonna take him a while to get back into playing form"
"The Grizzlies started rebuilding when they first gave up Posey, Wells, and Williams for Eddie Jones and Damon Stoudamire, and then traded Shane Battier for Rudy Gay. The team wasn't losing but it wasn't built for playoff success. But that first year without Battier the Grizz fell off a cliff. Pau was hurt much of that year, but when he came back the team wasn't doing any better."
"Terrifying game. Never want to see Patty 'Steph Curry' Mills, Rudy 'Steph Curry' Gay or Dejounte 'Steph Curry' Murray again."
"His defense looks bad, yes, but he's having to be the 2nd biggest guy on his team because the Spurs have been so guard-heavy. Their power forwards have been Trey Lyles who had to play center, LA who had to play a lot of center, and Rudy Gay who wasn't really a power forward either. His defense was ok the last year in Toronto where he got to consistently play SG/be the second-smallest guy (and they also had OG Anunoby)."
"Using RAPTOR, which is a terribly flawed metric (also he was [3rd](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)). The same metric ranked MCW 14th and Rudy Gay 15th (depending on what you set the minutes minimum to). And last year it had Dieng 2nd, WCS 4th, and Cody Martin 6th."
"Rudy Gay and DeMar worked with Keldon personally even back when he was still in the G league.   So dear a *certain* player:   This is what happens when you have faith in, encourage, reassure, console, genuinely care about, and treat a young developing player like an equal (not inferior).     When you always provide a listening ear&amp; are a true friend, never putting them down especially PUBLICLY and always being there to boost the youngins confidence:                     THIS IS WHAT YOU GET."
"According to my calculations, a ring for Holiday would put him 223rd all time, right above Rudy Gay, but below Monta Ellis."
Oops I thought we were talking Rudy Gay
"rudy gay - "" i cant wait for a time were no one gives a shit about these kinds of stuff"""
I feel like the Spurs might sign and trade DeRozan and/or Rudy Gay
Rudy gay is an option too
"And while you guys were contending, you handed out bloated contracts to guys like Patty Mills and Pau Gasol. In 2017-2018, the holy quadruplet of Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Tony Parker, and Rudy Gay was taking over half of your salary cap."
"This was when Kawahi was with the Spurs and Rudy Gay was with the kings, me and my cousin were talking about nba players. He asked me who do I think is a better player and my dumbass was a big Rudy Gay fan and I was trying to convince my cuz that Gay was better than Kawahi😂 took a big L that day. He still brings that up sometimes lol"
"Bah Gawd, is dat Rudy Gay music?"
"Rudy Gay, Rajon Rondo, Boogie Cousins, Seth Curry was the year"
"Lol yeah T.J. Warren has no fucking business on this list. He’s a “maybe”...so he’s on par with Rudy Gay, Kemba Walker, and C.J. McCollum."
"imo let the old vets walk except for rudy gay, yes the spurs should move on from patty mills as well even if he's a spurs legend. and don't trade either derrick white or dejounte murray nor any of the young guys unless they're getting a star in return."
"The Spurs are likely letting Demar and Rudy Gay go. So if Ben takes Demar’s role as the SF/PF it’s not much of a loss in terms of actual three point shooting. Of course they’d miss the mid range acumen. But they could easily add 3 pt shooting in FA.  They also have a good core of young guards in Murray, Johnson, and Walker IV. So they could afford to give up one of those 3. I don’t think they’ll do it though since they haven’t had this good of a pick since Duncan (I think) and are usually decent drafters.   It would be fun to see Popovich embolden Simmons. But I also don’t think their personalities would mesh since Simmons seems to be a bit of a diva."
"[Raptors @ Kings February 2014.](https://i.imgur.com/aDUMWDM.jpg) Free tacos!   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201402050SAC.html   only game I've gotten to go to, just graduated from high school, really wanted to go to a game before I moved out but I didn't have a lot of money, but this games tickets were pretty cheap. Boogie, Isaiah Thomas and Rudy Gay scored 20+ points, then after the game me and my friend got lost in the parking lot lol"
"If I remember correctly, Rudy Gay was asked about Becky's achievement as the ""first female \[insert accomplishment\].""   He responded along the lines of, ""I look forward to the day no one gives a shit."" Becky seems to be the same way, even though all the headlines are about her gender and so are the discussions surrounding her"

he basically is rudy gay
"True, but Wiggins was supposed to be at the LBJ/KD type talent level. He was supposed to be transcendental.  I think his projected worst case coming out of college was as a Rudy Gay type player and he hasn't even been that"
Rudy Gay
"Give me Gerald Henderson, Jeremy Lamb, and Rudy Gay if they’re playing the Raptors all day."
"Combo forwards went from a con to a pro as the game modernized. Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, Rudy Gay, etc became more relevant players."
"This is how I came to feel about DD as much as I love him. This is why the deal was even better for the Raptors than people realize.   I truly believe that if we traded DD for Danny Green straight up, the Raptors still improve, in a Rudy Gay type, addition by subtraction way."
"So he'd do well individually on a team that isn't a contender.   Sure. I'd agree with that.   Now... who do you want to be. A guy like Dennis Johnson, Vinnie Johnson, Michael Cooper, or Derek Fisher?   Or a guy like Rudy Gay, Rex Champan, or Mike James.   Not saying all those guys are comparable, but you got guys who have score near or over 20 a game on teams that couldn't win, or guys who thrived with inconsistent roles on offense and still stepped up when called upon and have multiple rings to show for it.   People still remember guys like Cooper, VJ, DJ, and Fisher.   Nobody is going to be talking about some dude who dropped 18 ppg on a lotter team for a few years."
thats exactly what would happen if the spurs re-sign derozan and the corpse of Rudy Gay and then trade away DJ and the only bigman worth a damn on the team for freaking Ben Simmons lol
"Trae Young    DeMarcus Cousins    Rudy Gay    Kevin Love    Ramon Sessions"
"Doncic, new coach, circus organization, he doesn't get along with KP, being over pampered, etc., he's a little chubby, it would be surprising if he progresses in that environment. Also I think Rudy Gay will be worse."
"Like wen Rubio and Derek Favors played with Ramon Sessions, Rudy Gay, and Kevin Love.  [Rubio Favor, Gay, Love, Sessions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omshb/rubio_favors_gay_love_sessions/)."
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
The new Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay to the Dubs confirmed.
he was actually talking about 14 year old me during the draft when we picked him over Rudy Gay
 &gt; I mean Rudy Gay. They (Wallace wasn’t in control) salary dumped Rudy Gay.   They traded Rudy Gay because they were better without him taking inefficient touches away from everyone else.
Rudy Gay and Jeff Green are both names that have been thrown around due to their connections with Udoka
Where's Rudy Gay when we need him?
"Fuckin Rudy Gay, man"
&gt; Rudy Gay  NOT THIS GUY!
"Lol so here’s how many games CP3 watches: one night a few years back in a random early season game, Rudy Gay went for a hammer and doinked it off the rim.  Rudy later posted a pic of his takeoff on social media.  CP3 almost immediately chimed in “I watched the game, you missed that dunk RUDE BOI!”"
"That article kind of says the opposite. It talks about how role players would generally jump at the chance to play with Lebron because they are used to being role players with limited offensive involvement, but All Stars/All-NBA guys wouldn’t because they don’t want to be marginalized.   Sorry for the length, but I pulled a few quotes from the article.   Tyson Chandler: *”If you’ve got LeBron, you’ve got to make it all about LeBron. You’ve got to be able to [coexist] with that and fit with that.”*  Kevin Durant: *”It depends on what kind of player you are. If you’re Kyle Korver, then it makes sense. Because Kyle Korver in Atlanta was the bulk of the offense, and he’s not a No. 1 option at all, not even close. So his talents benefit more from a guy who can pass and penetrate and get him open.”*  Trevor Ariza: *“Guys similar to [LeBron], why would they want to play with somebody who does all the same things? I can see why they would want to play elsewhere.”*  Rudy Gay: *“A lot of people are going back to thinking, ‘I can possibly be as good as him,’ and sometimes when people think of playing with someone like that, they feel it hinders them, maybe, from getting to that point because he takes up so much of [the] opportunities.”*  Durant again:*“LeBron is a player that needs to play with guys that already know how they play the game—and shooters. Like, young players that are still developing, it’s always going to be hard because he demands the ball so much, he demands control of the offense and he creates for everybody.”*  *“None of the players approached for this story, both stars and supporting cast types, resented that James’ stardom “sucks up all the oxygen in the room,” as one Eastern Conference vice president put it. But there is little doubt they would have to transform themselves and accept lesser roles than they enjoy now if they joined the Lakers.”*  *“What comes with that is the knowledge that if the team wins, it will be credited mostly to James; and if the team loses, it will be blamed on everyone around him.”*  *“Bosh and Love were established All-Stars before they hooked up with LeBron, but the perception of them shifted from franchise cornerstones to, at times, weak links in James’ quests for another ring…It earned them championships, but the perception remains they were the beneficiaries of being James’ teammates.”*"
Gimme Mo Cheeks for my Fat Lever but I'm not Rudy Gay
Mo Cheeks  Rudy Gay  Fat Lever  Pooh Richardson
"I think people are misreading the question, you shouldn’t be suggesting people that were picked number 1.  I’d say maybe someone like Rudy Gay?"
"allstars, superstars and players who can create their own shots (rudy gay. wiggins etc) should be the only players taking mid range shots. everyone else its should be a 3"
"The year prior we fired Mike Malone after what still is the best start of our current record-breaking playoff drought. Boogie got along well with Malone, who was eventually replaced with Karl. Karl &amp; Boogie hated each other, with Karl frequently going to the press and publicly dragging Boogie. Malone got fired by our GM Pete D’Allesnadro, who was hired after Malone and who was evidently looking for an excuse to can him from day 1, brining in Karl who he knew from Denver. This was part of a broader culture of infighting and backstabbing throughout the organization. The year started with Divac doing the same maneuvering to get Pete out, and then immediately selling the farm (shipping a 1st to Philly for cap space lol) to sign Rondo and Bellineli. Karl spent the off-season trying to force a Boogie trade, which is when the famous Boogie “snake in the grass” tweet went out. Bear in mind this is all *before* the season started, yet we decided to roll with Karl and Cousins for the entire year anyways  Gay Rondo &amp; Rudy are all decent rotation players but none are a second star to Boogie. So you have an all-NBA player and 3 average / decent NBA rotation players. The rest of the roster was mostly trash. Seth was basically in his rookie year (had bounced around but we were the first team that gave him regular minutes) and got very little burn. Willie Caulie Stein and Ben McLemore were regular starters with Omri Casspi and Quincy Acy being major rotation players as well.   So we had Cousins, an incredibly thin roster, a franchise that was always setting itself on fire, and an old ass coach at the end of a decades long career who very obviously didn’t give a shit and was constantly fighting and attacking his best player. I’ll admit as a Kings fan we all had cautiously optimistic hopes with Rondo and Gay onboard, but it was truly one of the most Kangz seasons ever. That roster maybe fights for the 8th seed if everything goes right with strong team chemistry and coaching, but as it was the season was a complete dumpster fire and with that thin of a roster there was zero chance anything good was going to happen"
"Assuming CP3 becomes a champ,  Guards: D. Rose, Russ, Wall, Conley  Forwards: Melo, Hayward, DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Jimmy Buckets  Centers: Adams, Whiteside  Considered other superstars but I think they got a lot of time compared to those I listed."
"Assuming CP3 becomes a champ,  Guards: D. Rose, Russ, Wall, Conley Forwards: Melo, Hayward, DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Jimmy Buckets Center: Adams, Whiteside  Considered other superstars but I think they got a lot of time compared to those I listed."
"&gt; Towns has Russel, Wiggens, Anthony Edwards. An actual All Star on his team, multiple top picks.  Rudy Gay and Wiggins were comparable players basically but you really just named wiggins like he was great help  You ignore the Timberwolves played a lot of games without KAT and D'lo on the roster this year too so bringing up ""he has D'lo and Edwards"" is a wash  Also some of these ""top picks"" were either not good or got traded away from the team but this argument could be said for boogie (its a stupid argument either way)"
Best and most realistic answer here. The core is good enough to compete with any east team besides Brooklyn. Hopefully some jumps from the rookies and sophomores make the bench better. Sign or trade for a big 3 and D wing like a Rudy Gay.
he only couldnt get minutes because we decided to go small ball with derozan at the 4 and rudy gay was his backup. but when he did play he was solid for what its worth.   &gt; why would we be interested in signing him?  because why not ?
"Rudy Gay missed 25 games that year, only started 6, and was 6th on the team in MPG (0.1 ahead of Dejounte Murray).   He was a role player. Not the second best lmao."
"Cousins never won more than 30 games in Sacramento. That’s a legit fact. It’s not like this is a high bar but the fact that they more or less treaded water at the same record shows that he’s not adding a ton of value to those teams. Meanwhile Jokic and Embiid dramatically raise the floor and ceiling of the teams they’re on.  &gt;name one team Rudy Gay was second best player that was decent  The 11-12 Grizzlies finished second in their division with ZBo down and Rudy Gay as their main scoring threat.  &gt;Boogie counting stats  Dude would put up numbers because he had infinite touches but he was so frequently inefficient, turn the ball over frequently, and whine and give up points. Dude was averaging 4 TOs with those 5 assists. He was an offensive talent but fell in love with bad shots and got blocked frequently and wasn’t good on defense."
"&gt;Name one team that Rudy Gay has ever been the second best player on that was anywhere close to decent.  2018 Spurs won 47 games with LMA, post-Achilles injury Gay, 37yo Pau Gasol, and Patty Mills."
"Um so first of all, yes they did??  Which of those teams do you think had a shot at being significantly better???  Because Boogie had 3 All-Star seasons in Sacramento. His second best player in every single one of those seasons was Rudy Gay. Name one team that Rudy Gay has ever been the second best player on that was anywhere close to decent.   Boogie was putting up 28-11-5 in his last year in Sacramento and they still weren't even half decent because he had literally nobody around him."
"We also could of helped boogie by drafting One of Lillard, Klay or Kawhi, Booker, or Giannis. Instead we wasted his career in sac, the best teammate he had was Rudy fuckin Gay.. poor guy."
"Alot of casuals never watched a single Boogie game like us Kangz had out here spewing bullshit takes like ""they're not even in the same league"".  Boogie was a COMPLETE offensive center with decent defense. Dude can score in side and out, shoot 3s at a respectable clip, can handle the ball and distribute. Mofo is Jokic before Jokic. Just bc the best teammate he had on the Kings was Rudy fucking Gay doesn't mean he's some bum slaying stat padder.   Too many young casuals over here smh."
"I completely disagree.  We are comparing talent, production, and outcome.  Jokic and Emdiid has him beat in all 3 regardless of his antics.  Jokic might be the best passing big ever and Embiid is a force with MVP considerations every year he is healthy.  I'm not saying that Cuz isn't talented, because he is, but he is also a black hole on offense,  a minus defender and contributed greatly to a losing culture with his playstyle.   Now you want to blame the org for breeding a toxic player.  Yes our org is trash.  Bad draft picks, bad signings, bad trades, poor development.  All true, but we have had talent and Cuz is the ONLY one to play with such a malcontent attitude night in and night out.  Other talented players played hard, took their lumps and was ready to go night after night.  Shout outs to Kevin Martin, Metta, IT, Rudy Gay, Tyreke, Fox, and hopefully our new favorite rising star Haliburton for being professional.  I love Cuz, but there really is no comparison no matter how you spin it."
"He didn't even get hurt. We started out hot that season, he got meningitis, and then our dipshit owner and scumbag GM used a short losing streak as an excuse to can Malone.  Not only did Boogie love him, Rudy Gay legit signed a fair market value extension with us that offseason because he enjoyed playing for Malone and felt like we were building something."
Wasn’t Rudy Gay the best player on a playoff Grizz team?
Lol look at the teams he was on u can hardly blame him. Who was his best teammate at sacremento?? Rudy Gay?
"Boogie’s starting 5:  G: Rondo  G: Darren Collison  F: Rudy Gay   F: Omri Casspi  C: Cousins  Bench: Willie Cauley Stein, Ben McLemore, Quincy Acy  Westbrook’s rosters have ALWAYS been WAYYYYY better than that.   Westbrook had Oladipo, Sabonis, Jermai Grant, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams, and other great role players in the year he “dragged” them to the playoffs. Later had Paul George."
Can't forget TMac and TRoss. And briefly had Rudy Gay but he's not a 2.
Rudy Gay doesn’t flop because he knows the refs aint gonna help him out😂
"IT on the Kings was a lot different than IT on the Celtics. And you are trying to say Rudy Gay was a great player on the Kings?  Towns has Russel, Wiggens, Anthony Edwards. An actual All Star on his team, multiple top picks."
Do you even know who was on the Grizzlies that year? They beat the #1 seed of the west Spurs with their best offensive player Rudy Gay out with injury.
I was going to say Raptors are up there but it took six years. I started counting from the day rudy gay was traded.
Rudy Gay. Oops sorry
Rudy Gay
"Patty Mills and Rudy gay have even higher Def Ws than all 3 of them, 1 stat can’t be used to determine a players’ impact"
"You can tell the nephews came out in when the top responses don't even include the fact that the first half of this terrible run was mired by the Kings being threatened to move to another city and cheap owners dumping assets to prepare for a sale.  The nepotism and poor management decisions that followed after keeping the team also didn't help. But for me personally, when Rudy Gay called us ""basketball hell"", it was so on the money that our subreddit still references it."
Not what you were asking for but you just reminded me of something.  I was in a Mexican resort when Rudy Gay was traded from the Raps to the Kings. I met a dude from Sac and we had a great time shit talking each other about trading distressed assets. Dude was positive Rudy Gay was the missing key and they had fleeced the Raptors...  Wish I could show him the pictures I took at the Championship parade.
Was it Rudy Gay?
"Sure, I think there have been plenty of questionable player personnel decisions the Spurs, and therefore Pop, have made. That Pau signing, trading for DeRozan, the Pau extension, the Rudy Gay signings.  As far as coaching I don't agree with the start of this thread exactly but the 2019 team played a pretty basic and iso heavy stile that didn't really work well. Plus there were a ton of player decisions with that team that were really questionable.  I get it though. You're a Spurs fan, you're in your feelings that someone said something about your god coach."
TT and a distant 2nd for Rudy Gay would be pretty good for the Spurs and Celtics
"This.   Masai never got a chance to truly rebuild the team in the way he saw fit. We were supposed to do that when we offloaded Rudy Gay, but we made a run of it until last year."
Ibaka called him Rudy gay? LMAO
Terence Davis? Rudy Gay? idk
Ceiling: Rudy Gay
"I hope he takes it like me. I’ve been such a Rudy fan throughout the years and after last year when Ibaka called him Rudy Gay, followed by all the covid stuff and the years of him getting made fun of, I’m just numb to it at this point and I hope he’s close to that. He should be great at tuning out the noise after all he’s been through"
It's absolutely not. A mediocre young center with some potential and the new age Rudy Gay for a guy who was 2nd team all pro a year ago. 7th pick really doesn't have a whole lot of value in my mind either.
"Hey we want dibs on Rudy Gay. He can fulfill one of the requirements listed, and he's Mike Conley's buddy."
one rudy gay and u will like it
"This is the way, although I might target Larry Nance Jr or Rudy Gay rather than Delon Wright. I think our need's bigger at 4 than 1."
"Lots and lots of years.   Think of Cousins, AD, KD, Dwade, Kobe, Klove, Kyrie, Wall, Lillard, etc etc.   It's basically every fucking year.   Shaq. Dwight Howard. Rudy Gay. Paul George. Westbrook. It goes on forever homie."
"I don't know I feel like someone like Bargnani, or even like Rudy Gay or Lebron I'm surprised aren't more hated then Paul Pierce"
"If a player has been on the same team 3 years in a row, the team has full bird rights for him meaning they can give him whatever contract they want. It does count against the salary cap but you can go over the cap to keep them.  If a player has been on a team for 2 years, the team has early bird rights. The team can give the player a contract for 75% more than his previous contract using bird rights. The spurs did this with Rudy Gay, giving him a 14M/year contract and went over the cap. This allowed the spurs to keep him without affecting our cap space compared to letting him walk because we still had the mid level exception after giving him the contract. This would've worked out great for us if Marcus Morris didn't screw us over.  Basically all bird rights let you do is go over the cap to keep a player that's been on your team."
Rudy Gay is still in the league...
"Rudy Gay is in SA, right?"
TIL that Rudy Gay is still in the NBA
"Vets signing gonna be interesting. Even a guy like Rudy Gay could be good addition, but the 14th pick of the draft is a good spot to grab a NBA ready guy like Duarte or Kispert"
"&gt; Rudy Gay infamous ""not this guy"" game winner against Toronto  Rudy Gay was quite literally the guy for that team, but whatever.  &gt; Lowry's inbound to OG last year in the bubble  Desperation play with 0.5 seconds on the shot clock, Lowry went for the only thing he had, totally different situation.  &gt; Lin's game winner vs Toronto (okok this was Linsanity)  You responded yourself.  &gt; Bird's steal still had ~2 seconds on the clock, and Bird was famously lethal and clutch - still passed to DJ for the layup  It's a layup, which i specifically mentioned that i'm fine with.   &gt; Literally yesterday, Ayton, a 10m/yr player, caught a lob for a game winner instead of Booker, who's being paid 27m.  Ayton is in a rookie contract and the Suns went for what they had, a lob was the ONLY option and again, it's a layup.  Pat Connaughton is a 35% 3-PT shooter, he is a mediocre shooter in general, drawing a play for him (even wide open) is and always will be a mistake, but whatever, people will keep defending passing to role players in the clutch moments, they will keep missing and everything will be fine.  I guess people don't ask themselves why said player is wide freaking open, the defense is literally begging Giannis/LeBron/KD or whomever it is to pass the ball to these guys and you are doing EXACTLY what they want, the moment Khris gave that ball away to Pat freaking Connaughton in the 3-PT line, Nate McMillan should've jumped in celebration."
"Rudy Gay infamous ""not this guy"" game winner against Toronto   Lowry's inbound to OG last year in the bubble   Bellinelli shot in 2018 vs Boston to send it to OT  Lin's game winner vs Toronto (okok this was Linsanity)  Bird's steal still had ~2 seconds on the clock, and Bird was famously lethal _and_ clutch - still passed to DJ for the layup   Literally yesterday, Ayton, a 10m/yr player, caught a lob for a game winner instead of Booker, who's being paid 27m.   **I will agree a three isn't the right play.** I'd also be inclined to think that Pat didn't draw up the play. But to say that role players shouldn't take game winners or open long range shots because they're role players is ridiculous. If Giannis or Jrue or Middleton caught it and got stifled, we wouldn't be talking about ""Pat C airballed"" but instead how one of the Bucks stars aren't clutch."
"Please delete this. Prime Kyle Korver wide open from 3 is one of the highest expected points per possession plays you can imagine. No one wants him shooting wide open, and the defense would never intentionally leave him wide open. This is a guy who has shot &gt;50% on wide open threes for periods of his career. He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  And you don't even seem to know why one player is maxed and another isn't. Korver made what he did because he basically had one single elite skill that was second to no one, but didn't bring enough value otherwise. Players aren't maxed because of some stupid intangible idea that they ""step up, bro!"" in ""big moments."" Otherwise, why wasn't Rudy Gay first team all NBA?"
50 shades of Rudy gay
Rudy is a Gay. Ha!

"Just peeked at the Spurs roster - remembering they lost DeRozan (their leading scorer), Patty Mills &amp; Rudy Gay (arguably their two best guys off the bench) - and it's looking a little dire. Dejounte Murray &amp; Doug McDermott are probably their top two scorers this season - maybe Derrick White too? Spurs were last in 3pt shots made &amp; attempted per game &amp; 24th in 3pt%. ""McBuckets"" will help with that, but I think at this point the Spurs might be best just to Choke for Chet (Holmgren).  Orlando seems to have a slew of players who aren't really starter material yet but someone's gonna have to do it. Where's their offense coming from, guys who can't stay healthy?"
"Wes Matthews is basically unplayable at this point, Rudy gay is nowhere near where he was. Still I don't see how is that connected to Klay. Guy *two* catastrophic injuries, only one of which is the Achilles tear. Another similar guy are Wall and Cousins, both shadows of their former self.  Obviously Klay is a diff kind of player, however indeed, merely being a contirbutor IMO would be a *big* step forward."
"Between Wes Matthews, Rudy Gay and Kevin Durant there hasn’t been a ton of crashing and burning post Achilles"
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
Jazz @ Spurs and Nets @ Spurs for Rudy Gay and Patty Mills return games
maybe keeping rudy gay because of continuity.
"The quickness is TBD but I mean Wes Matthews tore his Achilles and he was still an elite defender until he just dropped off recently due to age.....his defensive stats were incredibly good. And even just by the eye test, he was the Bucks best defender on Butler in the bubble, staying in front without fouling when no one else could do anything with him.   And on the offensive end, a player like Rudy Gay has been fine and a very good shooter.  Klay will be very rusty because he hasn’t played in 2 years and conditioning will probably take a while, but I don’t see why eventually he can’t get back to a version of himself. He’s never played an explosive game, being able to shoot over defenders will still be his main thing"
Nah Rudy Gay first
"Davidson was a 10-seed in '08, and Steph Curry is easily a top-5 PG all time, top-20 player all time (arguably better for either category). Now, Steph wasn't at that level yet in '08, but he was amazing... and Davidson lost in the Elite Eight.     A 16-seed &lt;&lt;&lt; 10-seed, and Rudy Gay &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Steph Curry"
"I remember watching him at Georgetown as a kid. People don’t always realize, but dude had serious All-Star potential. I think he compared pretty well to Rudy Gay (who I just found out never made an All-Star Game, huh). Still incredible what he’s been able to do with his career."
Almost any NBA vet could do this. So maybe.. current day Rudy Gay?
"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
"Nah it’s looking like tank szn lol. Similar win percentage would be about 38 wins or something and I see them as about a 25 win team.  They lost Patty, Demar, and Rudy Gay and used their lotto pick on a rookie who won’t contribute much this season."
"I thought about including him in my post body, but I thought I might get clowned for implying he was forgettable (even though he kinda was strictly as a player)  Also shoutout Reggie Evans for sparking that comeback and Kenyon Martin for D'ing up Rudy Gay on the final attempt"
"Rudy Gay aint forgettable, man."
Sort of. Bojan can post up but he’s only a threat to small or thin players. Rudy Gay can probably post up but idk how good he is at it.
And Rudy Gay. Based off his tomahawk dunks alone you'd think he was a superstar.
"The Jazz timeline is rn to 5 years ahead. Bojan is 32 while Ingles and Conley are soon to be 34 plus they recently signed a 35 years old Rudy Gay. Hence, imo, they are trying to add athletic wing defender to their team since only Royce O'Neil and Eric Paschal are the only ones whom can be considered that type of player."
"You know, there have been some rumors floating around SA about Rudy Gay.."
Rudy Gay
"Jazz fan here. I love Bojan, but nothing he is saying is off-base. We are a shorter team and if there’s one position where we could use more perimeter defense it’s bojans at the 4.  Ultimately because we got rudy gay I don’t see us trading bojan. But bojans strength (shooting) is something many Jazz players also have, and he’s getting a step slow on defense."
I'm hoping Rudy Gay is everything Niang isn't.
I'll play along because I too am bored.  Bold players are my starting 5.  **PG Stephen Curry (2009; All-Star)**  **SG James Harden (2009; All-Star)**  **SF Kawhi Leonard (2011; All-Star)**  **PF Kevin Durant (2007; All-Star)**  **C Nikola Jokic (2014; All-Star)**  PG Chris Paul (2005; All-Star)  SG Klay Thompson (2011; All-Star)  PF Anthony Davis (2012; All-Star)  C Joel Embiid (2014; All-Star)  PG/SG Jamal Murray (2016)  PG Ja Morant (2019)  SF Jeff Green (2007)  C Clint Capela (2014)  SG J.J.

"You could say that, yeah. But then again, our only other option at that time was Derrick Favors who is a worse perimeter defender than Gobert. Basically if a team decided to go Stretch 5 against us, we were fucked. That’s probably why our FO was so eager to sign Rudy Gay, who will probably just be playing at the 4 but could also be used as a “break in case of emergency” Center if teams go Stretch 5 on us."
You can add Rudy Gay to the Jazz at the bottom of this list.
Rudy Gay and Monta Ellis should be on there I think.
"Carmelo won’t be forgotten I think because of his strong ties to LeBron and general memeability. And the fact that he played in a huge market.  I think the guys you mentioned and more so borderline/one time stars like Rudy Gay, Eric Gordon, DeAaron Fox if he stays in Sacramento, or CJ McCollum will be forgotten.  Also, this post is Roy Hibberts music"
"Ah, like the old ""got rid of Rudy Gay"" bump"
"Tyreke Evans or Rudy Gay, those guys were scoring freaks their first few seasons."
Kyle Lowry Josh Smith Rudy Gay CJ McCollum Isaiah Thomas Siakam
Rudy Gay was legit OP from like 09-14 as well
"Rudy Gay is the prototypical ""Hall of Very Good"" player. Over 1,000 games played, career averages of 16.8/5.8/2.1 on 45/35/80 shooting splits, bounced back from an Achilles tear; dudes career is nothing to sneeze at. However, his only real accolade is 2006-2007 All Rookie, and he never really took the teams he was on to that next level"
"Yup, reminds me of Rudy Gay a lot in what he was projected/what he has become"
"Here’s a name I haven’t seen yet: Rudy Gay.   As a grizzlies fan I really thought this guy was gonna be our Lebron or KD. Didn’t quite turn out that way, but I still really liked him as a player. Wasn’t a fan of him getting traded. I still don’t think we’ve had a SF as good as him since he left. He’s always been an all around solid player, and I think he’ll be a big help to the Jazz this year.   Not to mention that he is still a god on 2K"
"I wasn't really expecting anything other than a documentary about the Malice in the Palace. That was mostly what I got, with a lot of ""the Pacers were going to win the title"" thrown in. This was distracting and too heavy handed (in my opinion).  Here is an analogy: Utah was very good last season (best record in the regular season), some playoff success. They added a Rudy Gay, which is an upgrade for their team. They are a strong contender. If you made a documentary about this Jazz team nine games into next season, then I don't think the narrative should involve that they are definitely going to win the title."
Derrick Williams was balling out during this stretch and then Kings traded for Rudy Gay and he couldn't adapt to a new role off the bench.
the disrespect to rudy gay
Pre-rudy gay trade
"Oh yes, that amazing two weeks where D Will went off until we got Rudy ""Basketball Hell"" Gay."
Yeah a player or two like a healthy All star PG and SG and maybe a switchable backup PF in the vein of Rudy Gay.
"2006: Aldridge, Rudy Gay, Rondo, Redick (?), Lowry, PJ Tucker, Millsap"
"Of course they do. It’s just tiring to hear players “don’t find it safe there” or “do not like it there” when the city itself is progressive (while the state is not), the Jazz is actually attracting free agents (favors, clarkson, rudy gay, Conley have all ultimately chosen re-signing there), and the org is extremely progressive.  I am not denying Utah (especially the greater state of Utah outside of salt lake) has a racism problem though. But so do lots of states like Louisiana, georgia. As well as places everywhere."
"They had a chance this year to win, but Mitchell’s ankle was obviously still injured in the 2nd round. Conley was out with a hamstring. Mitchell and Clarkson shot poorly after game 3 vs. the clippers. Denver always have our number and with Austin rivers there, the jazz are in trouble. Adding Rudy gay, paschall, and whiteside is an upgrade to niang and favors. They are definitely 9-10 deep. I’m sure Gobert will work more offensively this off-season but I wouldn’t be surprised if the jazz get 1-3 seed this year. Donavan is not on the level of dame yet(close), but if he was the jazz could be a 60-win team."
"that warriors take is hot garbage, they were trying to make a trade for another star but it takes two teams to tango. Not going all in on a Ben Simmons trade was the right idea. Otto Porter and Andre Igoudala were nice signings to help fill out the roster. They had one of the best drafts of any team this year and still have wiseman developing  in the wings. Don't know why they let Eric Paschall go but other they had a good off season   BI has  averaged 23.8/5.5/4.5, on 50/38/86 shooting splits  since coming to New Orleans and was an all star in 2020.He has clearly shown he can be the second best player on a contending team. The pelicans defintley should of gotten more in the bulls trade for lonzo but I like Tomas Satoransky, his height will allow us to play 3 guard lineups  like we did with lonzo. Getting rid of Bledsoe and Adams should be a huge boon for this team offensively and i expect BI and Zion will reap the benefits of the extra space that will be provided.  Jazz were the number one seed and got injured at the wrong time. I liked the Eric Paschall trade and the Rudy gay signing. They also have some interesting pieces they could package to improve there roster should someone they like become available at the deadline."

"You imply his reputation is all from that title run, but he was heavily praised before that because he managed to trade Rudy Gay and Andrea Bargnani for actual value."
"I have the exact opposite opinion of Michael Porter Jr. He's a huge defensive liability - it's a combination of bad defensive IQ, limited effort, and unimpressive lateral quickness. On offense he's an impressive shooter and has good athleticism, but his handles need to improve if he's going to be more than a Harrison Barnes / Rudy Gay type. He's also bad at reading the defense and very bad at passing, although that can be improved."
"1. Kyrie Irving is the most offensively talented player in league history. His offense is so good people sleep on his defense. He is actually a great defender. 2. James Harden is supremely overrated his jumper is inconsistent af but i think he plays way better defense than he gets credit for 3. Draymond has been the best overall defender in the league for years but has regressed so much on offense he may as well be matisse thybulle  4. The Lakers roster is awesome i loved every move...shame they couldn't get Rudy gay tho 5. The bucks don't get passed the second round next year and the sun's getting bounced in the first 6. The Cavs are going to compete for a play in spot next year 7. Bol bol is being under used and under developed under Mike malone 8. Phil jackson is the most overrated coach of all time in any sport 9.  Hakeem is the ""best"" center of all time regardless of rings 10. Larry bird would be joe ingles in today's game"
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"They are all in the same ballpark as far as age is concerned. The point is that it is very possible to still be a high-level player at age 33 and beyond. Nobody is saying that Conley is anywhere close to the level of those other guys because he obviously isn't. But LeBron, Curry, CP3, Westbrook and others are all similar ages to Conley each with injury histories of their own. The worry of decline due to age isn't unique to Conley and should be a factor when ranking several teams above Utah as well. Particularly when Conley is the 3rd or 4th option most nights and those other guys are the 1st or 2nd options.   If you want to doubt them because of other reasons you listed like a lackluster playoff history, lack of a wing stopper (hopefully addressed by adding Rudy Gay) or lack of perimeter defense (hopefully fixed by just having a healthy Conley / Mitchell and added guard depth behind them), that is totally reasonable. Like every team listed above them, the Jazz have their flaws and they've tried to address them this offseason. Just don't count them out because Conley is 33 is what I'm saying.  The Jazz will absolutely finish higher than top 9 when the regular season ends and are better positioned for a deeper playoff run IMO. They are better than people realize"

"It was the standard for stars, especially in the playoffs. You're saying you grew up in that era and yet are acting like efficiency was a relevant metric. All of those players I mentioned had efficiency rating at or just below league average, especially in the playoffs, because offenses slowed down and isolation frequency increased, with little to no spacing.   I'm saying you're lacking nuance because each one of your takes...lacks nuance.   You say the Knicks weren't very good. Absolutely no analysis of how they were consistently one of the most injured teams in the playoffs with several key players routinely missing games and Melo being the only one to actually produce. You're lacking nuance because you're disregarding team context, health context, ALLL context to push a narrative that doesn't exist statistically.   Like in your very next paragraph you say melos trade prevented him from getting a star guard when we've already shown how your imagined history was impossible given contract situations and the lock out, and the contracts they had on the books. You're inventing an impossible scenario and judging Melo for it not happening, even though, again, what Melo did was and is ROUTINE for all star players. It's what Paul George did, it's what Kawhi did, it's what Anthony Davis did, it's what Jimmy Butler did, it's what Westbrook did, it's what Kyrie did, it's what Harden, did and I could really go on. You know why none of them get judged for that? It's because it's a teams job to make those decisions. Blaming a star for what a team chose to surrender in a trade is foolish. Blaming a star when the guy he went to play with breaks down is extra foolish. Your argument would be akin to blaming AD if Lebron tore his Achilles and came back with the impact of Rudy gay. But you've been fed a narrative for years so it's easy for you to lean on that as opposed to actually critically analyzing.   Like let's be real here. Your argument is Melo wasn't a winner because he couldn't carry a less talented nuggets team over the spurs and lakers in his early 20s. He's a diva because he asked to be traded like virtually every other star. He's not a winner because he didn't adjust his game for a mediocre point guard who would turn out to be a back up for his career. Because the knicks managed themselves into a corner and key players to the roster were incapable of staying healthy. Your takes aren't built off statistics or actual basketball analysis. It's off tabloid journalism."

“Rudy Gay your gay” - Kyle Lowry 2009
"I went to a Warriors/Kings game a few years back and sat a few rows behind these two guys sitting together wearing Rudy Gay and Boogie Cousins jerseys, short shorts, and rainbow wigs. Not sure if they were Gay Cousins or not but I chuckled a little bit ngl."
"Someone brought up a fair point a few years back   Rudy gay could have won 5 MVPs and 10 championships in a row, he'd still have trouble getting his jerseys sold"
Probably Rudy Gay
What was it about Rudy Gay that you guys were so much better without him? Was it just certain guys getting more minutes?

"Eh, I remember at the time a lot of people were scared of Bargnani not being able to rebound in Italy and wanted Rudy Gay (whose biggest knock ironically was that he didn't want to be a scorer badly enough) or Brandon Roy (while acknowledging the medical risks were beyond our knowledge).  Don't remember much Aldridge love weirdly enough even though he went #2, though there were Tyrus Thomas stans as well."
We need a guard defender more than a wing defender. O’neale is very good against wings and we also just picked up Rudy Gay. We’ve been destroyed by small quick guards for years though.
Controversial: Rudy Gay would have different career.

"I mean... Yeah we'd do a Wiggins for Rudy Gay trade, sure."
"Here were the players drafted ahead of JJ in the 2006 NBA Draft:  1-Andrea Bargnani  **2- Lamarcus Aldridge**  3-Adam Morrison  4-Tyrus Thomas  5-Shelden Williams  *6-Brandon Roy*  7-Randy Foye  **8-Rudy Gay**  9-Patrick O'Bryant  10-Mouhamed Sene  &amp;#x200B;  The players that ended up being better than JJ (imo) are bolded.  Although I hesitate to put Rudy Gay ahead of him because of the playoff appearance discrepancy.  Brandon Roy is italicized cause he had a higher ceiling than JJ, but it was never actualized due to injury.  For a few years (2007-2011), JJ Redick was considered a bust, and people were quick to label him that given his reputation at Duke.  But he turned it around mostly with a super great work ethic, falling into the ""white guy tries hard"" athlete stereotype.  His consistency and impact on a game are uniquely spectacular.  I don't think that being on 13 straight playoff teams was a coincidence; those teams were good because his off-ball movement added a dimension to the team's offensive game.  After a weird start to his career, which included an injury, DWI and abortion contract, his fortune seemed to turn around in 2009 during the Magic's surprisingly deep playoff run.  He played a good series against the Celtics and his future head coach Doc Rivers, who would appoint him the starting 2-guard of the Clippers in the following years, was the opposing coach in that series.  The mid 2010's Clippers are historically overrated in the sense that they should have won a title.  That is mostly because they never made a conference final.  I am a Warrior fan and I feel strong about this.  Their roster was sick though, and it was fun to watch them.  The last point I want to make about JJ is that he was kind of a cultural icon for white basketball players around 2003-2006.  Many (white) players sported buzzcuts on the AAU circuit those summers, wore ankle socks and worked on their jumper."
"?  Kawhi went full nephew and forced a trade  Rudy Gay was never even close to a ""core player"" lol he was a random role player that decided to ring chase after his stint here.   LMA was washed af, no team wanted his sorry ass so we bought him out and he went ringchasing  Neither demar nor the spurs had any interest in bringing demar back so he signed somewhere else  Patty went ringchasing  Parker wanted playing time but there was no playing time with Patty and Dejounte ready and better than Parker at that point of his career. he retired a year later  what you're missing is that players get old and eventually move on"
&gt; Maybe Rudy Gay if he is spritely enough to unlock some small ball lineups  Not really the Rudy G at center that the Jazz are used to lol
Not sure if the Jazz have one   Maybe Rudy Gay if he is spritely enough to unlock some small ball lineups
"Great write up OP - even if my biased opinion is the Jazz will be a top 3 team again this year. My HOPE is that Rudy gay will solve a lot of the Jazz small ball issues, and that our perimeter defense issues in the second round of the playoffs was majorly attributed to Donovan and conley being injured against the clipps. I see a road where if the team remains healthy and Rudy gay contributes, we can be a contender.  Ingles and bojan are where I see dropoff more than anything as they continue to age, along with possibly nagging hamstring issues for Conley. Agree that whiteside will probably not help this team, and fear he may be as useless as Ed Davis was when we brought him in.   I can see the Suns being the 1 or 2 seed this year, and if Murray comes back by end of year near his old self they are 100 percent contenders. I just don’t see the Jazz falling behind the mavs, or the Nuggets regular season  I’m of course commenting on the primary team I follow only but overall this is very insightful and in depth for the entire WC"
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
"Rudy Gay, Wes Matthews? Wes was also still a great defender after the achilles"
"I think the mavs step in and trade for the Boston core of KG, Pierce and Rondo all at once.  Nets pivot and divide their assets to add Rudy Gay and Kevin Martin, Jason Kidd is fired mid season without the veteran Celtics leading the team on the court. Raptors do not improve that season, Celtics don’t get an amazing asset haul, Nets remain mediocre with the potential for a top 5 offense Mavs manage to be slightly more competitive this season, but move forward with a clean cap that puts them in position to sign Hayward"
Marc Gasol   Mike Conley   Rudy Gay   Ja Morant   JJJ  Dillon Brooks   Desmond Bane   Kyle Anderson   Deanthony Melton   Brandon Clarke   Xavier Tillman   Ziaire Williams
"You’re saying Drummond isn’t the worst player in the league. Advanced stats clearly say he is.  Has no post game, no jumpshot from mid or deep, turns the ball over at an all time worst rate for post players, is a defensive liability because he can’t guard the perimeter or anyone with a bit of explosiveness, got traded for a 2nd round pick even though he was an “all-star”, everyone in Detroit started to hate him for padding his stats in the first half of games then disappearing for the 2nd half, can’t run a pick and roll to save his life, is barbecue chicken for elite big men like Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, Nurkic, KAT, Valanciunas.   He is horrible, I watched Pistons games when he played for them and they were a bad team, but then again that’s everyone’s excuse “you don’t watch the games” yes I do. I’m an NBA fan. Obviously I’m watching the games or I wouldn’t be on this subreddit. My favorite player all time is on the Jazz btw. Rudy Gay. Hope he shines off the bench for yall."
Demarcus Cousins was struggling to make the all star game when Mike Malone was the coach and he and Rudy Gay were decimating teams by themselves damn near.
The last 30 seconds of the game is his him and Rudy Gay exchanging potential daggers.
"Just the many unknowns on our team.  Our defense plummets when Gobert sits, but we got Whiteside to hopefully replicate at least 25% of Rudy does. He might drive Quin, Ingles, and Conley crazy on offense though.  Last year we lacked size at the 4, we got Rudy Gay to help with that but he's old and still considered a tweener 3-4. I don't have any expectation from Paschall tbh because while he looked good in the Warriors tanking season, it was just that, a tanking season and we probably signed him more likely cause he's Donovans super close friend.   Playmaking/age/health: We have Conley, Ingles, and Donovan as our playmakers but Conley is rarely healthy for a full season, and Joe has been looking washed more and more often the past 2 seasons. Depending on Donovan too much might lead to the ankle situation all over again."
Rudy Gay!!!!
"royce oneale or rudy gay  gobert almost never guards AD, at least historically, the lakers have always had some guy like gasol or drummond or someone on the floor  royce and bojan did all of the AD guarding last year"
Used to be Rudy gay for me
Rudy gay
"Maybe this doesn't count because he never played in the NBA, but long-time college coach (and one time NBA assistant) Rick Majerus [didn't care much for Rudy Gay at UConn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RXaERVhNuU)"
"its rudy gay, nnooooooooo"
We've just signed Rudy f'n Gay.  League fucked.
That trade was a KO but I will also give Vasquez the credit that he was part of the swing in 13-14 that turned us from a tanking team to a perennial Playoff team when we traded Rudy Gay to Sactown.
Rudy Gay
"When I was a kid, I went to a raps game and watched them play the Knicks in one of those years Melo took the Knicks to the playoffs. The Raps at the time were allegedly led by Rudy Gay who left the game in the first with an injury. I remember thinking that we were screwed. Well, the rest of the game Alan Anderson took over for the raps, trading buckets with a prime Melo down the stretch. Prime Melo who finished second in scoring that season dropped 37, Anderson put up 35."
"Reminder: Diaw was stuck on the Bobcats for 4 years, including the 7 win season(Rudy Gay: You have 7 wins. This is everybody's house.) It is a miracle that he could still deliver sick passes and play defense on the Spurs after that stint."
Rudy Gay if he wants to do it and retires soonish
Every year I kept waiting for rudy gay to be a top NBA player
"I didn't think about the possibility of marketing to the High School Freshman demographic with ""Sexton"" jerseys. I suppose Rudy Gay had a similar bonus value to NBA teams."
"Rudy Gay is my reason why I watch NBA. In my country his name means ""Ginger gay"", so I was in junior high school and it was very hilarious for me. I looked up NBA Grizzlies highlights and it clicked almost immediately."
"Vince Carter, he had some bad press and mever made the finals, it's a bit similar to Melo, where he was the best player on some decent teams for a long time and then took a role player position later. Skills and stats wise he was a killer.  Arvydas Sabonis too, just came to the league late and spent his whole career in a non championship level team. Wasn't utilized as well as he would be today.  I could see Rudy Gay being underrated in the future because he wasn't a huge star."
Love this trade! Welcome home Big Spain :)  Hope he retires as a Grizzly. He also gets to witness Tony Allen's number being retired with Conley and Rudy Gay.
Where's Rudy Gay?
"Every time I am watching a game with Rudy Gay and he touches the ball, I hear ""NO! NOT THIS GUY!"" in my head"
"I personally was thrilled when Rudy Gay, Hedo Turkoglu, and Bargnani left"
I hope this gets to the top. Anytime I think of Rudy Gay I remember this clip
"One of the best gifts I've ever gotten is a signed Grizzlies Rudy Gay poster.  Fuckin Rudy Gay, man.  Edit: Motherfucker. Now I have to go watch the youtube cause this shit is cut off? I guess the username fuckin checks out."
Jesus christ its rudy gay
"Honestly, would Houston have been better off with Rudy Gay or Battier?"
Best highlight of Rudy Gay. What a great commentary job by that fan!
This will never fail to make me laugh. I hope Rudy Gay has seen this clip.
"For more context, I also remember that Rudy Gay hit a very similar game winning shot a few games prior to this. Hence the reason of the fans reaction when he sees Rudy touch the ball at the top of the key."
Rudy is a darn good Gay.
"There was very nearly a straight up Rudy Gay for Paul George trade. It was before PG was showing signs of superstardom and when Rudy was hitting his peak in Memphis. Looking back on it, I wish we had pulled the trigger."
"I downvoted your post because you cut out ""fucking rudy gay man”. Shame on you u/OutlandishLaziness"
"I'm so glad I get to say ""Fucking Rudy Gay, man"" a lot this year.  Hopefully in a positive light, though."
Prime Rudy Gay was like that
Rudy Gay was a killer. This clip is evergreen
"Rudy Gay could be 0/20, but god damn he is hitting that game winner."
"""Fookin' Rudy Gay, mang!"""
Hey you cut off the “fucking rudy gay man”
This is a classic video... Fucking Rudy Gay man
"Not just years, he had needed the right guidance and people around him.  I kept the article saved on my iPhone 5 on how Masai gave him a stern heart to heart conversation. He told him how he'd bounce team to team throwing a clipboard to illustrate that. He'd get probably a 3M contract and be out of the league in a few years instead of 10M which was he more than capable of doing.   Chauncey Billups compared his career in Detroit similar to Lowrys and after the big trade of Rudy Gay, him and Demar really took strides.   Probably biggest what if moments if James Dolan didn't walk out of the trade last second. Fans and media already gave him shit for getting outdealt with Bargnani and Melo in Colorado."
"History could repeat itself. In 2013 Masai traded Rudy Gay to tank, but the team started winning. The East is much more competitive this season but it's still the East. Outside of top 4-5 teams there are plenty of chances to pick up quality wins."
"Rondo, Millsap and Rudy Gay to name a few. Best is definitely LMA, pre injury Roy or Rondo though"
This like that time Rudy Gay gave my friend the stank eye at Top Golf cause he said hi
"I don’t know everyone who used their MLE but those were top 6 bench vets for the season behind Batum, Mills, Tucker, and maybe Rudy Gay. So if over half the league used their MLE they’d use it on those 2. The reason they don’t rn is luxury tax or more importantly there aren’t any MLE level vets available, the best player on the market is Boogie Cousins who hasn’t shown much in the past 4 seasons."
I wanted Rudy gay to be better. was a big fan of his at Uconn and he's had a good but underwhelming career
"I understood this narrative, frustratingly when they were winning games on the back of derozan and Aldridge, 2 guys who are good players but aging and not exactly guys who will be on the team for more than 3 years.   but now? I don’t understand the narrative. Their lead players are probably 24 year old Murray, 21 year old Keldon Johnson, and the elder 27 Derrick white. If they’re a playoff/play in team again, it likely means one of their young players had a break out season and became a young player worth building around, what’s exactly the difference between them and say Memphis if this happens? And if they don’t get better, there’s no derozan or Rudy gay to bail them out and win games. It’s sink or swim with these players"
"For the Spurs, a really good example was Rudy Gay. He's been unbelievable for the Spurs during his time here. My feeling is that this sort of player is really important for small market teams.  Second, players talk. Younger players listen to vets. If someone is thinking of coming to the Spurs as their next stop, will they talk to Rudy, Derozen, Aldridge, Mills. Hell yes they will.   Looking after veteran players is even more important for small market teams, they need every advantage they can get."
"They got Hassan Whiteside. Also Rudy Gay can play some Small Ball 5, something OP of the inital comment asked for."
Rudy Gay never gets any love for his hairline.smh
"Mitch Richmond was traded in 1991.   &gt;When the Kings hired George Karl in 2015, Rudy Gay reportedly greeted his new coach with, “Welcome to basketball hell.”"
Jazz  PG: Conley  SG: Mitchell  SF: Bojan  PF: Royce  C: Rudy  Bench: Ingles / Clarkson / Gay / Whiteside / Paschall / Butler / Hughes
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
Right beside Rudy Gay and Terrence Ross
"They didn't have the big wings to run a small ball lineup against the Clips.  Clips were out there with three guys who are 6'8"" or taller.  The Jazz's two biggest wings were Bojan and Ingles and they were already getting destroyed.  The Jazz's lack of size at the wing position is probably the main reason they went out and got Rudy Gay.  He finally gives them a multi-positional 6'8"" or taller guy who can play small ball center."
"That wouldn't make sense though. Jazz would sooner put Royce O'Neal or Rudy Gay on Davis and let AD light them up for 36/10/5 than cede a huge scoring advantage to Lebron and Russ. There's very little you can do to slow down Anthony Davis and Lebron James, so you used the same strategy the Bucks used on KD this year and numerous teams used on Harden on the Rockets: make the stars work hard for their points, and focus on locking down the less reliable and more containable supporting cast."
FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN
That was Rudy gay
"Every time I hear about Rudy gay I'm like ""not this guy!!!!!"""
"Reggie Evans ripping down rebounds, Swaggy with 3 triples in a row, Kenyon Martin with the lockdown D on Rudy Gay the end, man.   Clippers really are great at giving epic 1st round matchups. Just usually goes to shit after that lmao"
"&gt; I'm 100% sure they would have rather sent out Rudy Gay.  yes, but Danny Green wouldn't have even been on the table if it wasn't for those once-in-a-lifetime set of circumstances  I agree anyway, just my 50 cents"
"Rudy Gay.  Everytime I come across his name, im like ""Oh wow, he's still in the league"""
"This is just not true. They had Patty Mills and Rudy Gay making basically the same money, the Raptors chose Danny Green. If the Spurs had a choice, I'm 100% sure they would have rather sent out Rudy Gay.  Edit: wording"
"That’s pretty interesting. I love Conley at this point, but as a fan of those Grit and Grind teams in Memphis, it seemed they were always hoping that Conley could make a big jump to super stardom. It kind of reminds me of Ben Simmons now (although Mike Conley was never really disliked), but so far as it was an era whose success was dictated (at least as the media portrayed) by the improvement of one player. You knew what you were getting with Gasol, Randolph and Allen, but it always felt like they were one perimeter player away. If I’m being fair, Rudy Gay was even less consistent, but he was known to be inefficient even then.   I always think of that era as pretty fun to watch based on how different they were from good three point shooting teams like GSW and the Spurs. I know this is a total tangent, but unless the Sixers figure something out, I feel like I am going to look back at the Embiid dominant Sixers similarly. Just an inch away.   Going back to the original discussion. I forget how old Lowry is given the fact he did spend all those years with the Rockets."
"Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala, and Josh Smith the GOATs"
Add Rudy Gay to the list and you win this round of bingo.
"Doesn’t count, but Rudy Gay only has an All-Rookie 1st team."
"Lmfao and it comes full circle. Because the very first game between the Clippers and Grizzlies in the playoffs, the thing we've been talking about, was our crazy comeback from 27 down at the end of the 3rd. We were up 1 on the final possession, Grizzly ball. They give it to Rudy Gay, who ISO's, and gets locked up by.......[KENYON. FUCKING. MARTIN.](https://youtu.be/P_XF-2iJWg8?t=206)"
Forgot Rudy Gay went to the Jazz and was wondering why Rudy Gobert would have mattered here lol
&gt;Rudy Gay.  NOOOOOOOO!!  NOT THIS GUY!
If it's an iso play for the last shot then maybe Iso Joe or Rudy Gay.
"I get FTJ but how do you have mavs and nugs over the Jazz? Nugs won't have Murray for arguably 75% of the season, Mavs didn't really get much better in the off season, and the Jazz are running it back as the former #1 seed replacing Georges Niang for Rudy Gay"

"When the Raptors were ass for a long as time and one of the worst teams in the nba. Our record was pretty bad and we were losing alot. At that time we had Aaron Grey on the team and were rocking the camo jerseys from time to time.  Eventually the Rudy Gay to Sac trade changed the franchise forever (we got Vasquez, Patterson, and Salmons) and the pieces just clicked together and we made the playoffs. From there on we went a playoff streak year after year which was pretty amazing."
"&gt; Drafting Bargnani with the 1st overall  Only forgivable because that draft was awful. LMA ended up being the best player, but he wouldn't have been able to play next to Bosh and who knows what kind of trade package they could have gotten for him based on whatever limited minutes he played. After that though...Rudy Gay had a decent career but was definitely not a #1 pick type of guy, Redick is a great complementary piece but not a #1, Brandon Roy's knees died, and the rest of the lottery were either complete busts or journeyman roleplayers with Thabo Sefelosha being the most successful of them. Rondo and Lowry went late in the first round and then Millsap went at 48...but that's fucking it. It was just a really terrible draft and they did eventually swindle the Knicks into trading for Bargs."
"The season after sucked too, we had all that cap space and didn't get a single quality free agent that off-season, not even Rudy Gay or Carlos Boozer"
Team B and it's not close  Team B has the best player in Lebron  The best closer in LeBron  The best playmaker in LeBron  More offensive options  A better second option in Middleton  Yea team A has very very good defenders. But they lack any kind of shot creation outside of Rudy Gay.
"Team B, Lebron is the way better player on both ends.   Team A lacks offensive shot creation, Rudy Gay with no spacing = tons of contested fadeaways, and at thag game he's not close to Middleton"
"3's, dunks, little bit of handles all you need. Throw out him derozan and Rudy gay at once and it's over"
"Yup. We really don’t have personnel to go small (a huge reason we went and got rudy gay this offseason), but even just try favors which is not going small, but entices teams to try in the paint. Generally when we sub in favors other teams attack the basket, and they score easier than on Rudy but he’s still decent at rim protection. This could have led to some missed paint shots, or at the very least, clippers score 2 instead of 3 each drive.  And then there’s the whole lack of adjustments by Jazz on offense I outlined absolutely no one seems to bring up. You don’t give up 25 points in about 12 minutes without completely fucking up on both sides of the court."
"that's how it is on RealGM too, it's not just a reddit thing, and it pre-dates the Raptors being a relevant team the last several years. They've had a big presence on message boards when their franchise was built around DeRozan and Rudy Gay. The Raptors have an entire country behind them."
Rudy Gay  Tobias Harris  Prime Melo
"In 2006 first pick was Andrea Bargnani.  LMA, Rudy Gay, JJ Reddick, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Paul Thrillsap were 2, 8, 11, 21, 24, 35 and 47, respectively."
rudy gay. harrison barnes. jayson tatum
"I feel like Wiggins, Green, and Rudy Gay are variations on the same player, perpetual potential and athleticism-wise."
"Great trade for both teams. Aquaman doesnt need to be fed the ball like the Yeti does. JV gets to whet his appetite while Zion is gone and gets a bag that the Grizz didnt have room to give him. The younger Grizz (Ja, Jaren, Bane, Melton) can split the shots that JV isnt taking (a lot like the Rudy Gay trade for Tayshaun Prince that the Grizz made in 2013). Freeing up shots that one guy is taking, redistributing them among the rest of the remaining team.   Love to see JV still feasting."
Just wait till Rudy Gay is available for small ball. Deep bois!
I saw DeRozan chillin with Rudy Gay at Jones Assembly in OKC. I walked up and choked out a “…DeMar?!” walked away and continued with my life.
"Funny you mention classic teams. 2k has completely neglected its classic teams since inceptions. There are teams this year that have 6 real NBA players. They didnt renew their license with Brandon Roy but kept his Blazers team. Rudy Gay is for some reason in the game as a modern player but absent from the classic Grizz team where he was their best player. The Knicks Linsanity team doesnt have Lin!  2k gameplay is fine but its constantly tweaked for the benefit of playing as MyPlayer rather than pure NBA basketball.  For the past two or three years players seek to just stand around unless you call plays. But Play Calling is extremely complicated.  Way too much relying on button timing, which sucks bc of online lag, rather than strategy. Madden has flaws but you can see they are actually trying. 2k has made it clear they give no fucks about anything that isnt pay to win."
Early returns from Whiteside have been promising. The entire fan base last year cringed every time Rudy went to the bench.  Once Rudy Gay gets on the court we’ll see whether he can be a legit small ball 5 for us as well.  On paper we’ve filled the holes in our roster from last season. That and a bit of injury luck would put us in legit contender status.
"Rudy fucken Gay when he was on the Spurs, seemed to give the 18/19 Lakers the WORK every damn time we crossed paths"
"Ah, in that case, the defensive scheme is harder to plot for.      Yeah, in terms of defense we probably need more flexibility. However I do believe that our defensive system right now is the best way to fully utilize Rudy while he's still with us. Having Gay as a possible small ball 5 is an exciting idea, too."
"To be honest, 1 trade could swing them around to being a mid pack playoff team.   They have a good defence, and have good players, and so far this year have been missing their best player all year. If the Raptors could manage to land a 5 that fits their roster, or get a primary scoring option then it could completely turn their team.   When the Raptors traded Rudy Gay everyone thought they were going to start the tank, but all the depth they added turned them into one of the best teams in the east. Stuff changes quickly in the NBA, and the Raptors have a lot of good players, just a few holes and missing that primary scoring option."
"We've got better bench pieces (kind of). While there's doubts about Whiteside, he's looked real solid the past two games. Rudy Gay hasn't played yet but he's a tried and tested vet coming off the bench (+ small ball potential) so that's pretty cool. Plus we could probably give our main ball handlers (Conley and Ingles) some rest throughout the regular season to give Forrest and Butler some experience.      All in all, we're probably better than last season, especially if Gobert's improved finishing (that we've seen the past two games) turns out to be consistent. While we most likely won't get as favorable a matchup as a Kawhi-less Clippers, I do think that we might not have to be."
Favorite players all time for me are Rudy Gay and DRose. Outside of them Id probably say Iso Joe Johnson and LaMelo Ball.
"The Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Kenneth Faried triple flop is up there too"
"I think the Grizz are a sleeper. Won the global Beyond Sport Award a while ago, ESPNs franchise of the year one year (fwiw), have gotten recognition for a number of their community efforts that involved mentorship, St Jude, and the civil rights museum. Treat players pretty well even when they deal them off: Conley, Gasol, JV, Grayson, even malcontented Iggy. Have re-signed all their own FAs they have wanted to keep dating back to Rudy Gay. They seems to have transitioned from one good locker room culture to another pretty rapidly, too. All thats missing is experience and wins."
Rudy Gay.
"I'm so glad the days of raptors signing washed up stars us over. Jermaine oneal, hedo turkoglu, Rudy gay"
"Yeah I disagree with the Tyreke one but Boogie isn’t really arguable…Boogie had flaws and made some bad mistakes but we surrounded him with Rudy Gay, IT/Darren Collison, and no one else lol"
So far this is looking like what the Rudy Gay trade was for the raptors
"Don't sleep on the Wizards, they legit improved during the offseason. That Westbrook trade got them depth kinda like the Raptors years ago when they traded Rudy Gay"
rudy gay dropping 50 on him MINIMUM
"There's as many guys who are loyal to teams as there are guys forcing their way out.Ja Morant. Lillard. KAT.   In fact, there are likely more. It's just that most teams trade them away before to long.   Just ask Jose Calderon, Tayshawn Prince, and Rudy Gay, who ALL stayed with the teams they started with and who were ALL traded by those teams in the same trade!"
"Maybe deepest, (although it's hard to rank ascending players vs. guys whose careers are over).    Some potential that is going to be unrealized is baked into how we perceive certain players today thouhgh. It's hard to look at past players with the same lens. For instance lets say you asked this same question in 2007. Your perception of Brandon Roy, Rudy Gay, Danny Granger, Monta Ellis, Al Jefferson, and Ben Gordon would probably be a lot higher than the prism from which we view them now.    It's likely a good chunk of the players listed above fizzle a bit due to injury and other factos."
Rudy gay now that’s interestinf
"That would be:  Mike, TA, Rudy Gay, Zbo, and Marc  vs  Ja, Melton, Brooks, JJJ, Adams  Honestly a toss up between two teams on the rise. I will go for the Grit&amp;Grind team though just because they proved it the year before in 10-11 by beating the Spurs while this year's team went out in 5 games in the first round last year. We *might* be better than that team was, but it isn't a sure thing just yet."
"For sure, I'm happy with our top 8 guys and though there may currently be a talent drop-off after those, I'm hoping Butler turns into our 9th guy (or higher) to really solidify that rotation. Maybe Paschall will have a mini-Rudy Gay role too.  As you mentioned, the Warriors' depth should come in handy to keep the team healthy for the playoffs. At least if your rotation takes care of business, you should have a decent chunk of minutes available for development."
"Ja-Bane-Dillon-JJJ-Adams  vs. Conley-TA-Rudy Gay-ZBo-Marc Gasol  Boy would that be fun to see. TA trying to lock up Ja, ZBo v. Adams, Dillon getting all up in Rudy's business, no idea who guards Jaren in that line up but feels like I'd favor Jaren against either of Gasol or ZBo. I'd probably give the edge to the 2011 team, but 2021 has way more outside shooting."
"Winning a championship in Milwaukee is a lot easier when your first season as GM you have Giannis scoring 27PPG and Middleton at 20PGG. Masai came into a team where our franchise record win total was 47, and then every single season up until the Fuck Tampa Bay Season we beat that. The franchise ""centrepiece"" was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay.  Is it an accomplishment? Yeah, it is. Winning any championship is a major accomplishment. But when you just walk into a team that already has your franchise centerpiece and his second guy on the team, that is the two most difficult things to build a championship team already done for you, all you gotta do is just build around them. Which he did, which is more than many other execs can say. Masai had to trade Melo during his first season as the Nuggets GM, then two seasons later had a team that won 57 games which is more than any Nuggets Melo season, then came to Toronto where our franchise centerpiece was Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay and our team never won more than 47 games. We then beat that 47 game mark for the next six seasons, flipped Rudy Gay for bench pieces that helped spark the team into making the playoffs, exceeded all expectations in the mid to late first round + second round drafting players such as Siakam+OG+Northman Powell, kawal the Knicks into giving up a first round pick for Primo Pasta Bargnani which became the 9th pick Jakob Poeltl who was then traded for Kawhi, build up our scouting + player development staff into arguably the best in the league which has given us players like undrafted free agent Fred VanVleet + developing players like Siakam, OG, Northman Powell, etc. I think that in its totality is more impressive than what Horst has done so far.  And Masai isn't the GM he is our team president. He was promoted to Team President in 2016, then Jeff Weltman was GM for one season then left to become the Orlando Magic GM then Bobby Webster was promoted from Assistant GM to GM which he holds to now. Toronto Raptors General Manager Bobby Webster won a championship at the tender age of 34 years old."
Rudy Gay and Eric Paschall could provide that versatility.
"I’m not sure it’ll be enough to get to the finals, but we essentially swapped Favors and Niang for Hassan Whiteside and Rudy Gay while also adding Eric Paschall and Jared Butler. I think the changes are a better fit for our roster and what we’re trying to do but we’ll have to see how it plays out obviously. I certainly don’t think the roster is any worse than last year. Almost all of the guys playing significant minutes are back."
Rudy gay and toronto apparently
"1-3 most likely, their floor is really high unless Gobert gets hurt,they just generate wins with that system. Rudy Gay will be helpful in the playoffs,they don't even need him for the regular season. Like the EP addition too."
Jazz are absolutely 1-5 material. The Jazz got Rudy Gay. That alone is more improvement than the Nuggets and Suns made combined. And for the regular season really the Lakers have gotten worse if it takes them a couple months to figure it out.
"He really wasn’t a ball hog. If you really paid attention to games the triangle relies on Kobe getting into his position off-ball. Ball-hog =/= shot happy.   I’d argue the likes of Melo, Dominique, Monta Ellis, Rudy Gay, Ron Seikaly, Wilt Chamberlain (minus the time he lead the league in assists) are more of a “ball hog” than Kobe. There are more examples but I think you get the point. (Hopefully). Was he the most unselfish superstar? No. Was he the most selfish? Also no.   Pay attention to the X’s and O’s instead of cherry picking a few periods where Kobe was too shot happy."
There’s also an argument that The Jazz made moves this off-season to counter the 5-out picking up Rudy Gay and Eric Paschall who can play small ball 5 and defend the perimeter if it’s necessary.
"I don't think Rudy Gay is on the level to recruit players for the Jazz  Also why would the Jazz need him, when the 11 man rotation is already set"
"Ah yes, the era where teams got better after trading Rudy Gay"
Rudy Gay - He's rude but happy.
Rudy gay
Rudy Gay has entered the chat
Rudy Gay
"Collin Sexton, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Denzel Valentine, Jonathan Kuminga because lol"
Rudy Gay - Favorite movie is Rudy
"Agree 100%. Without them trading their entire bench for Rudy Gay, I don’t know if the Raptors golden era would have kicked off"
"I think they need another big wing who can defend, I loved them getting Rudy Gay, think they just need one more player like that.  I’m done with the idea of Bogie being a starter on a title team, his defense sucks too much. Bogie Ingles Clarkson should all be role players off the bench.   I like the Conley Mitchell ONeale Gay Gobert 5, but I’d want them to get somebody like Thad Young so they could also have the ability to play small if necessary."
Lol Den was an all-star and Joakim Noah is a first team all man with a top 5 mvp finish. Rudy gay was a 20 point scorer don't think they really meet the criteria of the question.
But where does Rudy Gay come out of?
Luol Deng and Joakim Noah  Rudy Gay - just wasn't a star  Avery Bradley  Nene
"Reports of Jaren Jackson's demise were greatly exaggerated.  I don't know if we are high enough collectively on him tbh.  The shot looks better than ever on a very high attempt rate and percentage.  The rebounding is way up.  The fouling is way down.  He looks noticeably longer and stronger, and most importantly, he looks 100% healthy.   I honestly think the Grizzlies are going to regret not giving him a 5/$125m or whatever he must have been asking for, and will instead end up making the full max 5/$173m.  Similar to Rudy Gay way back in the day.  Or possibly even the Rose Rule 30% max if that's still allowed (I can't remember the timeframe for signing those)."
"I wasn't aware any of them have been inducted. I also wasn't aware that Leonard was on their playoff roster.   But while you're on this troll train of thought, how come the Wizards didn't win it all with the greatest player of all time? Why didn't Lebron make the playoffs as the 2nd greatest of all time in 03-04? Why were the Lakers so bad with Kobe at the end of his career? Why didn't the 09-10 Grizzlies make the playoffs with a roster of Allen Iverson, Z-Bo, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, and Rudy Gay? How did the 07-08 Heat only win 15 games with a roster of Wade, Alonzo, Penny Hardaway, Shawn Marion, and Shaq?"
"I’ve been thinking that the Jazz have an exceptionally deep team, with the top two sixth men from last year, and now Rudy Gay and Hasan Whiteside, but I am a Jazz fan."
"Lol, “elite role players”. Name another team that made it to the playoffs in the west in recent years with a single borderline all-star and a bunch of role players? They literally had no second option on offense. It was Aldridge averaging 20+ a game and the 2nd highest scorer was the ghost of Rudy Gay at 11.5 ppg. That’s a straight up clown take."
"Donovan is definitely a draw for free agents and I think everybody knows you're just missing a few pieces, not so different from Milwaukee a few seasons back.   IMO you just need one more wing player after the addition of Rudy Gay, somebody who can kick Bogie out of the rotation. If I were the Jazz, I'd be doing everything I can to get my hands on Thad Young.   The ability to go small with Gay and Young at the 4/5 would give you a much needed different look defensively when Gobert is on the bench instead of trying to run the same defense with a shitty backup like Favors was last year or Whiteside is in general."
Dunno. I’m from Texas. I’m just a Rudy gay fan.
Rudy Gay fan here. Rudy turned his ankle or something and got substituted out. Think he was holding Klay fairly well. Whoever got subbed in for Rudy just immediately got torched within 2mins of him stepping off the court.
"Given the departures of vets like demar, Rudy gay, and Patty mills, there’s a lack of clear rotations and on ball roles for the team, and they have to work that out. Pop has been experimenting with various lineups all preseason, and given the plan with Primo is to start his development in the g league it’s perfectly fine that he’s not part of this season’s rotation plans, even though he could quickly play himself into the lineup"
"Except that’s a little incorrect, what really shot the raptors into becoming a competitive franchise was the Rudy Gay trade"
"Scottie ""That Guy"" Barnes.   Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay"
"The 21-22 Jazz. Second round exit at best. Not really contenders. It’ll be the same as last year, just with Rudy Gay."
"I work at a coffee shop in Downtown Dallas that happens to be across from the hotel that all NBA teams stay at. No in-depth interactions, but little convos here and there with Joe Ingles, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gay, and we see Mavs guys a lot (Boban, KP)"
"I mean you are more or less furthering my point. Giannis maybe wasnt a top 5 player then until he reached that level or the other plays around him got injured. Thats not the case with the Jazz.   Aint nobody scarred of the Jazz defensively which is their supermax calling card outside of Mitchell and Clarkson chucking 3s and praying they go in. Which opposing stars do you think  Rudy Gobert is slowing down? You really think Rudy Gay is stopping anyone?  They might fluke out and all the other contenders get injured. I mean, that's something I suppose"
"Cunningham - Ceiling: Luka, Floor: better passing version of prime Rudy Gay  Green - Ceiling: Drexler/Kobe without elite defense, Floor: Taller Monte Ellis  Mobley - Ceiling: AD, Floor: Jarret Allen (with better passing) ironically   Barnes: Ceiling: Magic Johnson lite, Floor: Draymond with slightly better shooting and transition play  Suggs - Ceiling: slightly worse Brandon Roy but with better defense, Floor: slightly better shooting version of prime Fat Lever"
"I always thought your signings were weak af, foh. Remember when you all thought you were getting Derozan, Rudy Gay, and Patty Mills?"
"I like the lineup versatility Gay and Paschall compared to last season give them but this sort of upside necessitates a bunch of things: Their older players (Mike, Ingles, Gay...) can't regress due to ageing, Mitchell needs to continue his incremental improvement as a creator, the Nets need to implode because that's what will blow the league wide-open...  They also failed to upgrade their perimeter defense and that absolutely destroyed them against the Clippers, regardless of how many people wanted to use Gobert as a scapegoat. This is steal what I fear the most, because a team that can play 5-out with multiple ball handlers are rare but you probably will have to face one if you want to win a title. And you are not going to close with a player of Gobert's level on the bench.  That small lineup can give you an extra jolt (not that this team doesn't like to bomb 3s in transition anyway) and an opportunity for this team to play something other than Gobert pick and rolls, which is very good offense but if you spam it enough people will make you have the ball forced into Rudy and live with him trying to beat them.  I think the Jazz will be a beast of a team during the regular season and they did update themselves a bit on lessons learned from the Clippers defeat. But not enough to make them significantly more of a contender, and the Bucks did have a considerable amount of gained versatility between during the season that ended in a championship."
"&gt; The Jazz found out before tipoff that Houston demolished an embarrassment of a Sacramento Kings lineup, which was missing DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo, Rudy Gay and its three other top scorers.  &gt; That eliminated Utah from the playoffs.   https://www.deseret.com/2016/4/14/20586672/kobe-bryant-delivers-one-final-blow-to-utah-jazz-in-101-96-lakers-win"
"Because all star teams are popularity contests? And there are plenty of people that make all nba/all star teams because of defense, for example Gobert last year. Or like Ben Simmons, who averages like a 15/7/7. Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green are all guys that have gotten all nba honors based off of their defense.   Guys like Thybulle and Roberson don't get on their because there are players like them that are also better on offense, i.e. Kawhi/PG13/Butler/CP3. Same reason that guys like Rudy Gay or CJ McCollum or Malcolm Brogdon aren't making it despite having 20+ppg scoring. There are players that do what they do better plus other stuff better"
1.Carmelo Anthony  2. Monta Ellis  3. Jamal Crawford  4. Nate Robinson  5. Rudy Gay
Fucking Rudy Gay man
Gay Papi could get Rudy a lot of endorsements I guess.
Rudy Gay as well
Rudy Gay is a quality defender and healthy Conley is fine.
"How's this for a twist: after Masai took over in Toronto, he started making his team, which was no big deal since the existing roster was not doing much. After having moved Bargnani to the Knicks in the offseason, his first move during the 2013/2014 season was to trade Rudy Gay, not because he was bad but because him and Demar overlapped too much and they were looking to tank. The Ironically, the Raps looked a bit better in their next few games. A month or so later, the next move was to trade Lowry to the Knicks. That deal was done. Lowry was packing his bags.  But at the last minute, the Knicks owner, James Dolan, called off the trade, fearful of being embarrassed again after the Bargs trade. It was too late for any other trades, so Masai smoothed things over with Lowry, told him that he should take this as a wakeup call to change his attitude, and suddenly the raps surged into the playoffs. The rest is history.  So basically Kyle Lowry is Kyle Lowry because James Dolan is a fool."
"Rudy Gay called it basketball hell, if anything it’s too high based on history."
&gt;Rudy Gay fan  &gt;Not very happy  Doesn't check out
"Very happy to have hung around in this one with no Rudy, Donovan, bojan, Ingles or Rudy gay"
No clue how to get player flair. Rudy Gay fan. I give 0 fucks for the Jazz org.
"As a Rudy Gay fan that follows wherever he goes, the kings were cooking that year, Rudy and Demarcus were the highest scoring duo in the league through the first 20-25 games of the season, Boogie got meningitis, got shut down for like the next 2 months or something, kings went on an insane losing streak because the team sucked outside of rudy, boogie, and collison. Malone fired. Kings doomed to mediocrity."
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
I'm takin Rudy gay
&gt;DeMar DeRozan? Gone. LaMarcus Aldridge? Gone. Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are gone   but Joshua Primo has arrived
"&gt;  He also isn’t a jack of all trades since the guy isn’t a ball handler or a layup artist.  When the Rockets got him they didn't even understand WHY he was good. Morey's internal data was just telling him that Battier lineups were way better than they ""should"" be iirc so they traded their 1st round pick for him(Rudy Gay)."
Jazz should be: Signed Rudy Gay
"Rudy Gay has to be on this list for me. He was damn near elite in his prime, but what couldn’t that guy do good, even if he wasn’t great at anything."
Rudy Gay.
Rudy Gay
"Someone had compiled a list a few years ago about what the rosters would look like if every player went to their hometown team, and the Wizards (which would include the entire DMV, and Baltimore since they don't have a team) would have looked something like: Durant, Ty Lawson, Carmelo, Rudy Gay, Roy Hibbert, Michael Beasley...it would have been crazy how stacked that team was"
ah the 2014 Raptors that turned it around after trading away Rudy Gay
"I feel like all things considered he's got a decent amount of competition at the backup 5 spot - Whiteside, Paschall, Rudy Gay if they go small"
John Wall absolutely destroyed his legs but still has blazing fast speed. After Durant and Rudy Gay as well I think he will be fine. I think we’ve hit an age of sports medicine where these injuries don’t crush people’s careers as bad.
I’m from east Chicago lmao. I’m just a Rudy gay fan.
"LeBron. I also really love watching Westbrook, Kawhi, Rudy Gay, and Giannis"
Rudy Gay was FILTHY in 2k. Him and Iggy. &amp; Steve Novak from 3? Sheesh.
"I got an 95 Rudy Gay in MyTeam in 2K22. Speed and quickness are phenomenal.   Dude had the athleticism, length (ridiculous 7'3"" wingspan), and skills to be much more than he was IRL. Really could have been the next T-Mac, without the injuries. He was averaging 20/6/2 as a 20-21 year old in his 2nd year in the league, and then went on to average roughly those same numbers for the next 9 years, but never went to that next superstar level, and never got an All-NBA selection or even an All-Star berth."
"Rudy gay, Hassan Whiteside, Jordan Clarkson, Jared Butler, Joe Ingles. Oh wait. That's the Jazz's 2nd team... Damn we're deep"
Rudy Gay was basically LeBron and Kobe combined in the old 2ks
He needs d-wade release 1 and Rudy gay release 2 and he’ll be aight
That Memphis team with Rudy Gay and OJ Mayo was beastly. I destroyed folks online. Then they traded for Randolph and he clogged up the middle and was so slow it messed me up.
"2k11 grizzlies with conley, OJ Mayo, Rudy gay, z-bo, and Gasol were dirty"
"sure but he's sharing the ball with LaVine, Vucevic, and Ball instead of Dejounte Murray and Rudy Gay... his stats will 100% see a drop this year rather than stay level or go up.  I could see him upping the efficiency as he picks his spots better though."
Rudy Gay was one of the most OP players in 2K during the early 2010's to mid 2010's.
"The best 2k experience I had with Rudy Gay was probably the 2k10 or 11 game. My friends and I used to do fantasy drafts all the time when we'd play. One time I had put together a really decent young roster, but it really went over the top good when the a.i randomly offered me Rudy f'n Gay in exchange for Adam Morrison straight up in a trade. I took that deal with no hesitation and never lost once against my friends squad, then we went on to win a couple of championships.  Rudy Gay can't accept that he's the vet in the locker room now lol."
Ibarbo and Rudy Gay. Legends
[This reminds of of the classic Rudy Gay meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg)
"I mean, there's no obvious answer for fixing the team. You guys have had some rosters that should've been decent.   That Isaiah Thomas/Rudy Gay/DeMarcus Cousins roster with Michael Malone coaching should have turned into a playoff appearance."
"yeah i guess that favs trade is the worst one then. i forgot we had to use a first to get rid of him. good trade in short term, probably not gonna be fun when we have like a number 18 pick that year or something  niang was a free agent, and even if we still had him, rudy gay still would've gotten all of his minutes so that doesn't matter anyway"
The Rudy Gay trade. I still think him and Derozan would’ve been a nice combo
"We didn’t get better lmao. We thought we would, but we ended up spending the next five seasons bouncing from SF to SF looking for another Rudy Gay. Trading Rudy was a mistake and to this day it’s a hill I’ll die on."
Wish we had Rudy Gay :(
"Nah I don't like that narrative. ""11-9 in a weaker Eastern Conference"" but let's look at their L's in that period.   They lost to the Boston Celtics twice who were 2nd in defense that season along with maintaining their big 3 core. Paul ""Shitting don't make sense"" Pierce was still leading his team to a 56-26 record.  They lost to the Hornets who were spearheaded by prime CP3 and had 6 scorers averaging in the double digits while also being in the top 10 defenses.  They lost to the Utah Jazz who had the interior dominant presence of Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson along with a prime D. Will and the jackknife defender AK47.   They then lost to the bully ball Memphis Grizzlies with ZBO and Marc with Rudy Gay being the up and coming 20 point scorer. Not to mention they had Mike Conley and Tony Allen which made them a perimeter nightmare.  After the rodeo in the west they came back east where they got beaten by a Pacers team with a prime Danny Granger, the chonkosaurus defensive presence of Roy Hibbert, and the consistent backcourt of Collison and Dunleavy.   Then they lose to the big daddy Dwight Howard team who would go on to have a record of 52-30. They had 9 players that season averaging double digits and Dwight was still in his dominant prime.  And finally, they lose to Dirk ""The Mullet"" Nowitzki. Their team wasn't just top 8 in both defensive and offensive rating, but they had Jason ""Wife Beater"" Kidd along with Terry, Marion, Butler bringing up the rear.   That '11 Heat team wasn't losing to scrubs and more importantly, they won the match ups that were clearly in their favor. This Lakers team has been losing to random people and a situation where you have Westbrook, AD, and Lebron and LOSE to a Kings team should never occur."
Nah I just think of Rudy Gay as the main Rudy because he was on the spurs for 3 years. Didn't even think about Gobert.
This is the year he takes the leap!  Nah dis dude is Rudy gay
"Fucking Rudy Gay, mannnn...."
He's been 7ft tall and playing like a guard since highschool - - that's going to take a toll on your body over the years so he's a little more beat up than most. He needs to figure out how to slow his game down just like Russ and LBJ do. Play more like a Rudy Gay or LaMarcus Aldridge. Less dribble moves and more purposeful shots. The role he is in right now is perfect. Catch and shoot or catch the lob. Lessen his iso load so he can have more energy to do more team oriented things.
"Similar to how Rudy Gay and DeMar were such a bad fit together on the Raps, people just assumed they were two inefficient ball-dominant checkers and probably hadn’t noticed the ways their game had improved since those stereotypes of their games were formed. I’d include myself in that, I was skeptical they’d work out."
Old ass Rudy Gay is probably still better than both
Rudy Gay was better than all the others. No way he's just average
"Nicholas batum, Reggie Jackson. The Morris Brothers. Jeff Hornacek derrick fisher. Rudy gay"
"Reminds me of that Rudy headline...  ""Raptors get Gay in threeway"""
Getting Rudy Gay was such a great choice by the FO
His ceiling is Rudy gay
Rudy Gay was brought in to be a small ball 5 come playoff time.
"Its so weird for someone to recognize how good a defender gobert is but also say ingles is solid. Ingles and bogdanovic are the worst wing defenders in the league who get actual minutes. We need to close with rudy gay and hope gobert, o’neale, and gay can cover up for mitchell"
I'm not joking but I was at a free concert for my college about 10 years ago and two doods were standing in front of me wearing jerseys. One a Rudy Gay jersey and the other a Kevin Love. Together they were Gay Love. I chuckled a little
"Is Jason Tatum this generation's Rudy Gay?      I ask without comparing stat lines (but I would bet money they are close). Rudy Gay wouldn't be considered a superstar, even in his prime. Just very good. But Gay had these moments when playing against a superstar/HOF like Kobe, where he would consistently take his game to another, almost MVP talent level. Then against normal talent, would revert to average NBA offensive play.      Am I off here in thinking that? Similarities in their height, build, and even playstyle would suggest I'm close."
Rudy Gay too.. I never understood how one comes back from that shit.
"Closest to Kobe, he makes Tatum look like Rudy gay"
"If Rudy gay can play small ball 5, Barnes can too. There’s a bunch of traditional 3s getting 10 mins at center right now.   Barnes prob isn’t as good as tobi, but who cares? They’d play very well together. I’m comparing his defense to like furk lol. He might be the sixers best wing defender against length (probably still tisse tho).   I think you’re misreading my point. He’s simply a role player that doesn’t really have any exploitable weaknesses. Look at most role players, most have a real weakness. He sucks at like shot creation and dribbling, which is almost irrelevant as he’d be like the 12th option lol.   He’d be the sixers 6th or 7th best player. He’s not *good* at defending lebron, but having another guy with his tools is insanely valuable in the playoffs. The suns had their damn center tryna guard giannis in the finals. Versatility is key in the playoffs.   My main point is that if you could clone tobi, or get a poor mans version, you should do it!"
You could pull Mitchell for Rudy gay right now and win
Rudy gay shouldn't have gotten pulled man
The new Rudy Gay
He's the new young rudy gay until he figures things out.
No! It’s Rudy Gay! No! No! Not this guy! Not this guy!! Noooomygod! You fucken asshole!!!
Rookie Tyreke Evans? Rudy Gay? Lol I don’t even know off the top   Maybe Isaiah Thomas. Or feasibly one of Haliburton/Hield/Barnes/Holmes. I really don’t know
"Donovan, Gobert, Conley, Clarkson, Bojan, Joe, Royce for sure. 8th spot probably Rudy gay? Maybe Butler if we’re prioritizing youth"
"I would love it if he wanted to, and don't blame him one bit if he doesn't want to.   It was a wonderful journey starting from the day they traded Rudy Gay."
dont forget rudy gay
Rudy Gay. Jersey with Gay on the back murdered his jersey sales. At least I think that’s what he means.
"Not every bust can be compared to Bennett tier and I'm tired of being people dense about this   You don't draft a player at number 1 for them to be a productive role player or a good starter, imagine if like Kelly Oubre Jr. Was drafted with the number pick?    Andrea Bargnani was a productiveish player for like 7 years and still considered a bust not all bust are the same there's levels and when you haven't made a single asg, all NBA team and only been in one playoff series and only really a productive starter and you were considered to be a lot more and you turn into Rudy Gay (who was drafted 8th in his draft) idk man"
Raptors made the playoffs in 2014 as the 3rd seed after trading away Rudy Gay (and Bargnani to the Knicks) so I'd change that to 2005-2013 tbh
"&gt; Get Rudy Gay/Otto Porter Jr instead of Nunn.  I think they tried, OPJ didn't want to play for them or preferred the Warriors. OPJ was offered the MLE by other teams but took the Warrior's minumum offer instead.  &gt;Sources: Otto Porter Jr. turned down the midlevel exception elsewhere to play for the Warriors at the minimum.  https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1422410903954235399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"
"Trade Dennis, KCP, and THT for Lowry at the deadline last year, extend.  Kuzma, Harrell for Buddy Hield if they both preform badly, I actually thought Harrell was nice for the regular season and Kuzma is an underrated defender, maybe Lowry would’ve helped out his offensive woes in the playoffs.  Get Rudy Gay/Otto Porter Jr instead of Nunn.  Bing back the 🐐 Alex Caruso."
"Rudy Gay is so important to this team, Paschall and Whiteside are great but if Gay can be a solid 4/ and smallball 5 option he opens us up to so many different looks in the playoffs"
"Rudy Gay is my lord and savior, amen."
Rudy Gay
This is like a Rudy gay or Shane Battier type deal
Rudy Gay
"Monta Ellis, Rudy Gay, Corey “bad porn” Maggette basically any one dimensional fringe (i use the term loosely) all-star type of guy."
"Basically the entire offensive scheme relies on pick and rolls with Gobert and kick-outs to shooters on the perimeter if it doesn't work.  Look at the [highlights of the last Hawks game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4PEmdyTEI) vs the [highlights of the last Jazz game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVITmKho_K8). The Jazz tried some new stuff with Rudy Gay on the floor (he has size nobody else has) but aside from a couple plays with him, Rudy screens and rolls in pretty much every single non-transition play.  His roll gravity is what opens up our shooters. Without him, nothing we do works."
"Conley’s impact this year has really shown up when you look at the lineups. The Jazz essentially runs three different groups each half- the starters, then a Mitchell-Whiteside led group, A Rudy-Conley group-Mitchell-Whitside again and then the starters to finish.  That third group so far has basically always had Rudy Gobert, Eric Paschall (though probably now Rudy Gay), Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson. The difference between have Conley with that group vs anyone else is staggering. These are the lineups with those 4 (Rudy Pashcall Ingles Clarkson)  Conley- +11.3 net rtg (113 min)  Butler -4.3 net rtg (21 min)  Forest -12.7 net rtg (21 min)   Mitchell -64 net rtg (8 min)  Conley’s ability to floor general that unit in particular is so incredibly valuable."
Nooooooo that’s Rudy Gay!
rudy gay is like jeff green if jeff green was good and not a complete mirage
RUDY GAY YOU FKIN ASSSSHOOOOOOOOOOOOLE
"My Grizzlies Rudy Gay jersey is older than half the commenters on this sub, and this dude is dropping 20 on 7/8 with a new team."
"But if he plays with Gobert you get... Rudy Gay? No, wait."
Rudy Gay is so good but will almost assuredly be one of the forgotten stars of the era. His college highlights are fucking LIT.
"Well now that's just Rudy Gay.  Although with the way he played last night, he might lose that distinction too."
Rudy Gay is one of the most over-looked underrated players in the league. I've always been a fan of his.
"Yes I know, I am a Jazz fan. And Hassan’s playing well but it’s not blowing me away nor is it raising our playoff ceiling. His impact declines the moment the playoffs start because Rudy will play many more minutes.   I think that’s where Paschall finds more minutes, that and just resting Gay some nights. We’re gonna have to get reps in for the guys who actually give us versatility and flexibility because they will both be needed come playoffs. Hassan too, but at inherently diminishing returns."
OH NO ITS RUDY GAY!
"fucking Rudy Gay, man"
RUDY GAY is still a great player underapreciated on every team he’s been on could’ve been an all star many more times. Not just in 2k but in real life this guy is unreal would’ve liked to see him with LeBron as a teammate some time
Joe Johnson has over 20000 career points but his career high is only 42. I believe Iso Joe has the second lowest career high among all 20K point club members (Robert Parish - 40). Rudy Gay also has nearly 17K points and his career high is only 41.
We are loving Whiteside and rudy gay!
Is there a better player with less accolades than Rudy Gay?
"I think Rudy Gay to the Jazz was one of the most overlooked additions this off-season, no cap. They've got a lot of weapons but have struggled to find an X-factor.   My man Rudy is another weapon, and he can be a damn X-factor"
Clarkson on guards. Ingles and Gay on forwards. Whiteside to replace Rudy if we need
Rudy “not this guy” Gay
This game was close until the Jazz realized they were bigger and better than the Raptors. Rudy Gay looked like a difference maker. He killed the switch defense and made every correct read.  Also Chris Boucher is one of the worst players I've seen this year. What the heck is wrong with him?
"Lots of positives from tonight for sure, excellent ball movement, Gay being like Paschall but actually good, Rudy being a bully on both ends.  Still a little disheartening to see Mitchell and Gobert inexplicably have literally zero chemistry in the pick and roll despite playing together for 5 years. Theoretically it should work but it just doesn’t."
Rudy Gay checked in again
"Awful showing by the Raptors. Is it too early to hope we get a good draft pick? Pascal the tank commander?  GG Jazz, that fucking Rudy Gay man..."
What an opening game for rudy gay!
"you know, that rudy gay hater was right all along"
Rudy Gay would be the leading scorer against the raptors after coming back from surgery
"OP should have the following title "" The Toronto Raptors loose to Fucking Rudy Gay man"" lost opportunity there"
Fuckin RUDY GAY man!
I'm here for the Rudy Gay express. Choo Choo if agreeee
I’d like to see people try to deny God exists when they just saw Rudy Gay raise Ingles from the dead before their very eyes.
Rudy Gay is KD? 👀👀
It Rudy Gay can shoot 88% from the field every game we’re going to be tough to beat.
Everybody loves Rudy Gay
Friendship with Jordan Clarkson over. Rudy Gay is 6MOY now
Fucking Rudy Gay man
Is Rudy Gay the greatest player of all time
Rudy Gay shooting like 2k11 Rudy Gay
Pretty good way to make a fanbase love you immediately from Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay is killing it
Rudy Gay is taking us to the promised land
You can tell Rudy Gay tries to be unselfish sometimes but I think it's best if he just looks for his own shot lol
Looks like changing my flair before Rudy Gay made his debut wasn't a bad move after all
https://ifunny.co/video/nooooo-it-s-rudy-gay-not-this-guy-you-f-fUK6jl6v8

"Rudy Gay in his first 7min on the Utah Jazz: 9pts on 3/4 shooting, 1pt, 1ast"

fucking Rudy Gay man...
RUDY FRICCIN GAY  Holy shit this is better than I expected
"say what you want, i like rudy gay (especially when he's not playing for the raptors these days)"
"A totally random Rudy Gay story is how ESPN originally censored his name on their website. Every time he was mentioned it was ""Rudy \*\*\*."""
Rudy “You fucking asshole!” Gay
Rudy Gay says visits to rodman clubs inspired him during his NBA career
Oh no! Its Rudy Gay
"NO ITS RUDY GAY, NOOOOOO!!"
Patty mills and Rudy gay are two of the best bench scorers in basketball
"For me, it really hit when I was watching that clip the other day of the tie game years ago in Toronto when Rudy Gay hit the shot and the guy was like “noooooo, not this fucking guy”  There’s no substitute for having a crowd when the game’s on the line like that and the place is brimming with energy. It adds another element to the game."
“bodies Rudy Gay hard !” Sound a little......you know
god I knew he'd be fuckin good. i wished so badly for the Spurs to flip rudy gay or someone for mid to late first to grab Poku and Maxey. lol Tyrese is gonna be in the NBA for a decade with his mind for the game.
Rudy Gay still had a pretty good career.
I always thought Rudy Gay was going to be what Melo was a great scorer. He could never live up to his potential despite having a good jump shot and crazy athleticism.
Damn Rudy Gay used some ancient stranglehold technique to hurt AD's adductor
"""No it's Rudy Gay! NOT THIS GUY!! YOUUUU FUCKIN' ASSHOLE!!!"""
"He's not getting as much run as I'd like and he's coming off the bench and not getting many touches since Rudy Gay &amp; Patty Mills in contract years are chucking it but he's been awesome. He's knocking down the 3 and his defensive instincts are unreal even at the NBA level, he just knows where to be and he's got so much potential."
Is Rudy Gay like the most likeable player to other players in the league?
FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN
"Stunning offensive performance by the Spurs and LMA specifically given all the hate he's been getting from Spurs fans.   Their distribution of scoring and the depth of scoring options they have is pretty incredible, reminds me of Miami of last year in that way, 7 different players averaging double digit PPG.   Furthermore, I just really like their roster construction right now, they have a clear 10-man rotation that just makes sense in the way the pieces fit together and they have the right combination of youth and experience. I like the balance of having 2 vets in each of the starting lineup and the bench, as well as the fact that they have each of their promising two-way wings in the starting lineup (Johnson) and bench (Vassell) . I'll definitely be watching more Spurs games from now on, that's for damn sure.   Murray / Walker / Johnson / DeRozan / Aldridge - 5 out offense, gives max spacing for DeRozan and Murray to operate.  Mills / White / Vassell / Gay / Poeltl - Mills + White is a really good backcourt pairing, skills complement each other well, Vassell is good backup for Keldon, and Rudy is a good backup for DeRozan, and Poeltl gives them something different as an energy big that can rim run."
What if the Lakers took it seriously and body slammed Rudy Gay then created a malice
"NO NOOOO NOT THIS GUY, THATS RUDY GAY WITH A STEEL CHAIR"
Noooo not this guy.. Not this guy... Nooo... Fuckin' Rudy Gay man.
"Fucking Rudy Gay, man!"
***~~FUCKIN RUDY GAY MAN~~***
I mean if you leave Patty Mills and Rudy Gay open they rarely miss.(Actually Rudy has been missing a lot of open looks lately)
Things started to go downhill for the Lakers once Rudy Gay put Antony Davis in the Kata-Hajime and put him in danger. /s
Rudy is super tall with long arms for how mobile he is even at his current age. I'm still mad we never got to see a Dejounte Murray - Danny Green - Kawhi Leonard - Rudy Gay - LaMarcus Aldridge lineup
I was thinking the same thing. I think Rudy Gay low key can fight lol
Rudy Gay mad at Lakers as if they’re the ones that poked his eye
"Rudy Gay can still get up, just not very often these days"
I see you're also a fan of Rudy Gay and Collin Sexton
"Vassell hasn't been playing a lot other than preseason and last game. But man, oh lord he's good. You might not say it by just looking at the stats but his defensive instinct and team defense is crazy and already elite. It's crazy how much this guy play team defense and help everyone get in position and slow down a lot other team offense. In Preseason nd Last Game he showed that he has no fear to let it fly when it's his time. He scored crazy clutch points against the Clippers! In Preseason he was gettin more touches and now less but it's nice since Pop prolly prefer to let guys like Patty Mills and Rudy Gay shoot more than a rookie but when it happens to him he has no problem and let it fly. Yeah he still needs to improve but he is already a nice role and bench player. Once Derrick White comes back I think he will see his minutes decrease or even totally disappear, unfortunately, but he has a long way, especially next year since all our vets finish their contract.  What about Jalen Smith man? I wanted him sooo badly since he has the perfect skills and everything you need from a center nowadays and it's one of the position we need to improve the most."
"Here’s a few that come to mind: Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Rudy Gay"
The Rudy Gay and Bargnani trades were definitely not signals of a tank but aight dude.
"&gt;If the raptors wanted a top 5 pick they'd have to fully commit and all im saying is they won't  They're not even trying to tank right now and they have a bottom 2 record.  &gt;They're not going to be bad enough despite what this start indicates  *citation needed* because we have seen nothing to show that they will magically turn it around into the team from last year. They have no playable C's, they have no depth, Pascal and Fred are hit or miss and Kyle can't play 40 mpg all season.  &gt; And nothing of this teams history suggests they'll make moves to purposefully be bottom 5.  The Rudy Gay and Bargnani trades were trades by Masai Ujiri to signal a rebuild. He got lucky that the pieces he got back were better.  They made an effort to trade for SGA in 2018 while specifying nobody was untouchable, yet another signal that they were leaning towards a rebuild shortly before the Kawhi deal opened up."
You thought Rudy Gay was exceptional? If you thought DeJounte was Rudy the whole game I understand but if you know who's who I don't.
Is it just me or is Rudy gay continuously slept on. This man is so good
He pushed Rudy Gay too on that out-of-bounds call that went against the Spurs  This is why we hate Pat Bev
Doesn’t matter. Rudy Gay
"Pat Bev gets away with so much, and I think it's because of who he is. He already fouls so much already that the refs are hard-pressed to give him more. I also think it's because he has a reputation as a scrappy dude, so refs see some of the more controversial shit he does as just part of his game that can be accepted; they only call it when it goes toooo far  He sometimes can bump into players, bark in their faces, push them, etc., and not get called for it... and yes, I already know he gets called for a lotta fouls already, but he'd get more if he got called for them.  He just had a clear loose ball foul on Rudy Gay when he extended his arm to push him off balance and throw the ball outta bounds vs at the end of this game, yet it went uncalled. He got away with a few"
Rudy gay missed a wide open dunk
"Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard were exceptional for the Spurs"
fucking rudy gay man
Oh no it's Rudy Gay!
" Spurs, almost 8  DeMar DeRozan 21.3  DeJounte Murray 15.0  Keldon Johnson 16.2  Lonnie Walker 12.7  LaMarcus Aldridge 12.0  Rudy Gay 12.2  Party Mills 12.3  Derrick White 9.0 almost"
"Reminds me when kings had cousins, IT, and Rudy Gay"
"We could offer Rudy Gay straight up for Bagley + filler, that's probably enough to get him"
"The Spurs went long stretches trying to go small with Rudy Gay matched up against Gobert.  It went about how you would expect.  It's a young team and exciting to watch, but they don't have enough size without Aldridge to compete consistently.  Utah was absolutely red hot from three.  Utah had 63 points off of threes compared to 18 by the Spurs."
"The grit n grind Grizzlies with Mike Conley, Gasol, Zach Randolph, Rudy Gay and Tony Allen were legit. Gasol was basically playing like a PG at the top of the key at times. Also had a great 3 pointer for C back in those days."
Rudy Gay
*Kyrie/KD and Derozan/Rudy Gay swap confirmed after heartbreaking loss to washed Westbrook and co.*
"Just need a Rudy Gay trade next, GayLoveSexLand with Andre bringing up the rear"
I used to play 2k all the time growing up. I think it was 2k13 or 14 where the Raptors had Rudy Gay and Demar DeRozan.   For some reason both those guys were like prime Vince Carter dunking on everyone all game. They were the most fun team to play as by far.   I've been a Raptors fan ever since
Try Rudy Gay base with jumpshot 91.
I think Rudy Gay and Wes Matthews are better comparisons with the advancement in medicine and similar age range
Rudy Gay and Colin Sexton
Rudy Gay and Kevin Love
What do Memphis fans think of Rudy Gay now that he is in his twilight years. Could he have been better? What was the missing ingridient?
so op rudy gay was broken in that game
Except Rudy Gay never won or came close to winning DPOY?
Rudy Gay seems like he has been around a lot longer than he has.
Finger Rudy gay
"Most players named here have accomplished way too much to fit the mold of the question in my opinion. The perfect player that fits the bill is Rudy Gay, he could finish his career with 20k+ points while not having any real accolades. Ultimate role player, borderline All-Star early on in his career but nothing very memorable, just a very solid and respected player who will be forgotten pretty easily."

"Watched the whole game and my takeaways:   (1) AD shooting 3s is just insane. A 30/10 Big with every move under the sun, great positioning, and has gravity both inside and outside?   (2) LeBron's 2nd gear is legendary. Man will slow and steady control the whole game, never falling too far behind, then will just close out the game with a 9-0 run to make the scoreboard look like it wasn't close.   (3) Lakers shooters need to keep the pressure on. You don't want to see Matthews taking only two 3s in a game. The man was running and affecting the game, it just looked like he wasn't getting his screens. Lebron was playing a bit too much free safety to be honest, saw too many 5 on 4 plays by the Spurs in transition they gobbled up freebie layups with 15+ seconds on the shot clock.   (4) THT is something else, plays insanely confident for a 2nd year player. Loved his spin move highlight, I think in game where LeBron turns it on a little earlier, THT could be trusted to hold a lead with the bench unit and play 20mins.   (5) Kuzma was a dog for sure this game, the missed 3s nearly all looked good and in the context of the play. If he was 6-11 from the field and 2-4 from 3 I think he'd get a lot more positive press from this game.   His late putback on LeBron's layup definitely altered the mental side of the game. The Lakers defense was revitalized for the final stretch off that move. His foul trouble was insane, at least 2 of those could easily have been play-ons, but whatever it happens.   (6) Gasol was uncharacteristically quiet, I really wouldn't have thought the box score would say 8 rebounds, 3assists, 2 blocks. I feel like I remember it as 5/1/1. Just wasn't hearing his number called I guess.   (7) Harrell had some good moves, but eye-test, I felt like he was a walking turnover this game. Shocked he only had 2. It felt like every pass he made was poorly angled or too hard. He was alive on boards though, can't take that away from him.   This Lakers team will just destroy with rebounds.   Spurs side, they played like the Borg. I never feel like any 1 player is trying to show off much.   (1) They just seemed to return every 3 with their own 3, and in transition would just casually hit the layup with 18 seconds left on the clock. They were a machine. I think the minutes spread shows this philosophy a bit.  (2) Rudy Gay felt silent for me until his big block in the 4th. He needs to get to the FT line more. I like him but he needs to force the issue and get his 20 pts. It's important to the team.   (3) DeRozan was just a monster. No turnovers, everything felt like it went in. I think he undershot as part of the system, but Patty Mills felt like the #2 on that team last night and that's just weird. Felt like I wasn't seeing Murray and DeRozan overlapping correctly. Like they'd both be on the court but they were side by side, not together.   (4) Johnson put on a clinic, no other way to say it. I didn't even realize he made 9 attempts, it felt like he went 5 for 5. He had a jigglypuff sing effect on the Lakers for real. Although he was -12, it felt like the Lakers just couldn't stay awake within 5 feet of him. 2 steals, 1 block, 10 rebounds, 9 looks from 3. A man on an island for sure. Spurs fans, is he always this good? I feel like he wasn't on my radar correctly.     (5) Murray can't be this quiet. I really could have believed he was DNP-Coach Decision this game. He needs to get to the line.   (6) I think the Spurs kind of just coincidentally didn't get to the line much because they were destroying so well in transition that they weren't even getting enough defense pressure to cause a foul.   At times though, it felt like they were taking heat checks 3s way too early on the clock. Like they would destroy in transition, or hit a massive open 3, but got heavily dissuaded from trying the paint against a set defense. I think this was mostly an Anthony Davis, would really like to see this team with Aldridge available in the playoffs. They play the game very well visually."
"I think it just gets eclipsed by ""Rudy Gay kills Boromir"""
A Rudy Gay sighting!
"There are examples of teams subtracting a higher production player due to poor fit and getting better even with lower production players. An example would be the 2008 and 2009 Nuggets. Chauncey for Iverson may not be the only reason the Nuggets got to the WCF, but the advanced stats say that Chauncey was a way better fit than AI for Melo. Memphis in 2013 also traded Rudy Gay for Tayshaun Prince and got better. From a team perspective, it's harder to replace what Dragic brought to the table for the Heat in 2020 than it was for the Cavs in 2015 for Kyrie. The other players are valid arguments because it represents how a team could compensate for the lost of player. LeBron evidently could compensate better for the loss of Irving than Butler could for Goran's absence. I'm not arguing that Irving is better than Dragic in a vacuum because he is, but if we're arguing what the impact of a loss is to the team then it's definitely a factor if a team could make up for lost production.  In the same vein as 2015 Thunder, the 2020 Warriors lost Steph and Klay to injuries and missed the playoffs. Jrue definitely had it worse than Dame, but there were injuries, nonetheless. I don't argue 2015 had it worse, but that it's not an extreme fluke as you're making it out to be. I mean to be fair, in every series both the Lakers and Warriors played it's valid to say that upsets would be more possible due to injuries. The Lakers had 2/4 series affected with significant injuries or illnesses (WB and Heat)  and 1/4 with a minor injury relative to situation (Dame), the Warriors I'd argue had 2/4 series affected with significant injuries (Pels and Cavs) and 2/4 with either injuries that didn't also last the entire series (Memphis) or an injury to a relatively less significant player (Beverley). The 2015 Warriors had it luckier, but it ain't that far.  And all I'm saying is that the 2016 Warriors were closer to the 1996 Bulls had they won, because the playoffs aren't the only thing that matters and considering the injury and suspension situations, 15-9 has a lot of context to it. But they didn't win, so it's really no contest."
yeah your big man rotation at 4/5 these games has been Keldon Johnson//Rudy Gay and Poeltl//Eubanks. That's just a bit rough.
Fuckin Rudy Gay
He got some real 'FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN' energy on that one
fucking rudy gay man
My favorite part about the end of this game was countering AD/Bron w/ 4 SGs &amp; Rudy Gay. 😅
Nah its definitely not a foul when Rudy Gay elbows LeBron in the head. But hey the Spurs might just be good enough to be a first round exit this year.
too bad he was frozen out in fourth quarter in favor of the big 6/16 rudy gay show lmao
"Lebron was mauled multiple times prior, they let it all go. Rudy Gay smacked Lebron in the head on that ""Jump ball"""
Another season in Austin and an expiring contract in Rudy Gay and Lamarcus Aldridge
"I honestly believe the officiating was terrible both ways. What comes to mind is of course the no-call when LeBron fouled White, then no call when he got fouled right after  The Rudy Gay and-1 which should have been waved off, the possible goaltending through the underside of the rim against THT  and more on both sides"
I mean we still do and Rudy gay gets in but Lebrun doesn’t
Who needs Kawhi when you have Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay is so underappreciated. Man is TOO consistent.

When you hear “the basketball player Rudy G.” do you think Gobert or Gay or Giuliani
"Like Rudy Gay said, it sucks that this even needs to be said. I'm sure given the opportunity, women can become fantastic coaches in the nba."
"The study was mentioned in this article: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/)  What I found crazy is of all the players to come in and out of the NBA in the past 3 decades only 45 (including Boogie) have torn their achilles. I wasn't able to get all of them, but I can list a few off hand:  Kobe Bryant   Isiah Thomas   Dominique Wilkins   Brandon Jennings  Anderson Varejao  Chauncey Billups  Wesley Matthews  Patrick Ewing  Rudy Gay   Demarcus Cousins (not included in study)"
"I thought the same thing! I got most of my information from this article: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/)  From what I can gather on the surgery and the Achilles Tendon as a whole, it can really come down to how the individual 's body reacts to the the fascia or graft used to restructure the tendon. The Achilles is one of the strongest in the body, but also one of the most prone to injury b/c of the lack of blood flow to the area. But because medical and surgical technology has excelled with these injuries, they may be able to decrease chances of re-rupture altogether afterwards. Rudy Gay has looked good since his surgery and KD looks promising now, but again I am intrigued as to how he looks, and his PER is by games 10-20."
Finger Rudy Gay? Chill out man it’s 10:00 in the morning
Thats not it they're just lazy. Have you played with the grit and grind Grizzlies?   They only have 4 or 5 actual players non of which are Rudy Gay who is still in the NBA.
Heat are one Jae Crowder replacement away from making a second run. They miss his switchability.    * Rudy Gay? * Doug McDermott * Otto Porter * Danny Green * Bobby Portis  I don't know but they need that gap filled and then it's all gravy.

He's fine. A lot of their players haven't played for 2 weeks like White and Rudy Gay. Devin Vassell still isn't back from COVID protocols/conditioning.
"If he doesn't play that stupid 4 guard + Rudy Gay lineup in the first half, we might have won this game"
There was another where Rudy Gay did it too and got the call
"Spurs would possibly be really good in the early 2010s. DeMar, LMA, and Rudy Gay"
We’ll probably play small ball with Rudy Gay.
"Also the transition to the athletic and larger Small Forward swiss army man.   Even lower tier teams like Memphis with Rudy Gay was in the mix. But LeBron and Durant were having an outsized impact to teams looking for wings that could pass, shoot, dribble, drive, post, dunk, run the half court, run the fast break, complete ally oops...   Throw a smaller defender on them and they were getting either shot over or backed down, put a big and they were blowing by for monster jams. It was great with coaches and players struggling to keep up with these amazing guys except by the opposing guy defending.   * LeBron vs. Paul Pierce * LeBron vs. Paul George * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. LeBron * LeBron vs. Iguadala * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. KD (sadly didn't get to see the full picture) * LeBron vs. Jimmy Butler  More too, but these were some gems.   It was a great blend of some teams still having their Bigs (Memphis, Dallas, Duncan) and pace + space vs. more complex creating open shots (mostly 2's), switching defense with also some heavy grinding defenses.   One of my favorite times as. a basketball fan: 2008-2017  At the same time I will say that in the playoffs, a lot of teams try to just jack up 3's and it doesn't work as well."
Correct. The only player to remain the same after such an injury. Rudy gay was another recent “star” player with the same injury and he gave been the same. Durant has yet to play a full season. For some reason I really feel like the odds of him staying healthy are low. The over use of the uninjured leg really creates a problem. It seems to happen all the time. That’s what happened to bougie and klay. And with Kyrie. He’s just a time bomb. It’s always something with him. By far one of the most fragile players ever. I don’t think he’s played 70 games in a single season.
"Lots of them could. Tons in fact. He had some decent players around him man   Hell he had IT and Rudy Gay when both were 20+ ppg scorers at the same time  You can't tell me the roster Dame had last season was worse than those kings rosters. And cousins didn't even come close to the playoffs. They weren't just bad, they were terrible"
Rudy Gay made one of the greatest moments in phone highlights ever.
Memphis Rudy Gay was in a whole nother league than Harrison Barnes tho
One of the most disappointing players to come into the NBA right along with Rudy gay
He’s his generations Rudy Gay  You want to be Memphis the team selling high on the idea of him as a player not Toronto actually buying in on it
&gt; I now wonder who said the “not him” video of Rudy Gay.  [For the uninitiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg)
well i have heard flight say that rudy gay is a top 10 small forward in nba history lmao
It’s a really weird collection of players lol. Never heard Rudy Gay and Michael Jordan typed in the same sentence.
Correct the 1984 finals  The athletic has his name and back story: His name was Donnie Beardsley. He was the ‘Celtics are the balls!’ guy  https://theathletic.com/2096693/2020/09/27/the-celtics-are-the-balls-donnie-beardsley/?source=user_shared_article  Cant be meme level popular without someone hunting you down.  I now wonder who said the “not him” video of Rudy Gay where the guy is fully I nested
"POR is a 5th seed with CJ, Nurk and Zach out. They would easily be higher next season. I don't see HOU being better than DAL especially after an offseason where DAL will want to start contending for a title. EIther Porzingis remains healthy and they make a push or he gets traded and they retool. I can't imagine Luka in his 4th year would not drag the team to the playoffs in a worst case scenario.   SAS has Rudy Gay and LaMarcus coming off their books. I reckon they will resign DeMar who is quite possibly having the best season of his career and I can see him continuing with them considering his evolution as a playmaker. With a core of DeMar, Dejounte, Poetl, Keldon and whatever FAs they can get a hold of, I would not bet against a Pop led Spurs to miss the playoffs.   I don't watch much of MEM so I won't comment on them but Pels I watch from time to time and they can be very good if they make the right roster decisions with the progression of Zion, BI, Lonzo and Hart. Pels are definitely my wildcard for next season.  You are right, I haven't watched much of Rockets since Harden left. I thought the system Silas ran was surprisingly good but got the feeling it wasn't sustainable. Maybe I am wrong, since I obviously don't watch them as often. But I do watch the rest of the teams I mentioned and feel they have a way better chance at making the playoffs."
Rudy Gay
"You're right, Spurs don't generally make mid-season trades, so no one on our sub is holding our breath on it.  I doubt we make any roster changes at all tbh. We'll probably just adjust our lineups and rotations a bit more and wait for everyone to get healthy.  But some sleeper picks for potential trades are imo Rudy Gay and to a lesser extent Trey Lyles. The Heat were apparently interested in Rudy since they need to fill their PF depth, and both Rudy and Trey can do that plus their are fairly cheap."
"We're shopping our vets who're on expiring deals like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge and potentially Trey Lyles as well.  I'm not expecting any of them to be getting traded, but those guys are on the table.   Spurs on in the middle of a rebuild, so makes sense to shop our vets. Patty and Demar have been excellent for us, so doubt Spurs will move them unless some irresistible offer comes along. Rudy and Trey Lyles are pretty useful pieces for teams looking to bolster their wing depth. Lamarcus is washed atm, so doubt we'll move him."
Nooo not this guy! Fucking Rudy Gay man!
Rudy Gay is from Baltimore
NO!! NOT THIS GUY!! ^sorry ^rudy ^gay
Is Rudy Guy related to Rudy Gay?
Rudy Gay slander will no longer be tolerated!
Rudy Gay
"Nope. Keldon, Rudy Gay and DeMar missed games too"
" Conley, Tony Allen, Rudy Gay, Pau, Marc  Shareef ""OG Curry"" Abdur-Raheem, Mike Miller, Shane Battier, Zbo, Big Country Reeves is the second unit."

"I don't trust these all-in-one metrics. Last year Kyle Lowry was ranked 12th. This year he's ranked 94th, between Rudy Gay and Raul Neto. What am I supposed to make of that?"
Rudy Gobert gonna turn into Rudy Gay
"Yeah I feel like everyone here is forgetting we were not a playoff team with Rudy on the roster, then all of a sudden after we traded him we started to turn things around. Trading Rudy gay changed the trajectory of our franchise. I really don’t consider him part of that we the North era at all because he wasn’t involved"
~~Light skin Rudy Gay~~ Longboy James Harden
Ppat and Gay never played on the raps together. When Rudy was on the Raps that was definitely not a fun team. They became fun after they traded him
Rudy Gay
"Curry is a PG, Wade is a SG. This is like saying Rudy Gay and Tim Duncan play the same position."
Fucking Rudy Gay man
"He was a double agent, though. ""NO, IT'S RUDY GAY! NOO! NOO! NOOO!"" etc"
Wasn’t Patrick Patterson one of the guys received from the Rudy Gay trade or was acquired after??? Or am I just misremembering.
"He gave me temporary hope cause he came in and hit a game winner very early into his tenure as a Rap. It just became clear that as they were at the time, DeMar and Rudy just couldn’t share a court for a winning team.   Now that Gay has transformed himself into more of a bench guy and DeMar has become a whole different monster, it’s another story."
Rudy gay is super good friends with Kyle and demar too
"He was also a great locker room guy on the Raptors. He's close friends with Kyle and Demar  That was an underrated era of the Raptors, Amir Johnson, Demar, Kyle, Rudy Gay, TRoss, PPat. Surprisingly fun team."
One Rudy Gay
Noooo its Rudy Gay
If Rudy gay reached his potential he would’ve been tatum
Who's the dipshit that called him light skin Rudy Gay lmao
"Active:  LeBron, Kawhi, Westbrook, Rudy Gay, Jrue  All time:  Bron, Penny, Tmac, Kawhi, Westbrook"
I only watched the last 5 minutes of your season. Is Rudy Gay still good? He looked good.
It's finally over. I was remembering Demar and LMA's crappy performances in Denver Game 7 cause of this game. Rudy Gay was also the one who was bailing them out.
"yep, def thought he was gonna clank it and then grizzlies legend rudy gay gets fouled on a made 3 leading to a spurs W"
I think this is the summer they finally blow it up I think Derozan and Rudy gay are gone
"Watching the game, rudy gay was actually good though"
Rumour has it Rudy Gay is still pulling up from midrange
"Rudy gay really tried to carry though, respect man. Hopefully your young players make a leap next year and Derrick white is healthy again"
"Congratulations to Memphis, and shoutout to the Spurs for giving such a huge fight, kept it close all the way down to the wire. Rudy Gay with some clutch shots.   Whoever Memphis will play for the next play-in game is gonna have a hard time, not looking forward to it if it's the Warriors. Gonna be tough"
Rudy fuckin Gay man.
rudy gay trying to carry derozan to friday
rudy gay should starting driving a manual after being this clutch
I might be gay for Rudy Gay
Nooooo! Not this guy!!!!!   Fucking Rudy Gay man...
Fuckin Rudy Gay man
RUDY GAY ABOUT TO GO TMAC ON THE GRIZZLIES
"Couldn’t think of an answer that others already didn’t say for the last 5 years, but I always felt like Rudy Gay was going to take a leap but it just never happened"
Rudy Gay is carrying the Spurs right now. Imagine if Demar ever developed a 3 point shot.
Rudy Gay is just a fucking killer
Rudy Gay is still so clutch! Surprised how far he's fallen off
RUDY GAY NOOOOO
Rudy Gay is making up for that bad ref call earlier
MY GOD RUDY GAY
fuckin rudy gay man
NOOOOOOO THAT'S RUDY GAY NOT THIS GUY
Fuckin Rudy Gay man...
ITS RUDY GAY FUCK

OF COURSE ITS RUDY GAY
kinda weird that no one mentions rudy gay was the grizzlies' franchise player at on point lol

That shot by Rudy gay might’ve been the dumbest shot I’ve seen
Rudy Gay is my dad
Fun fact: Rudy Gay was drafted in 1968
Fucking Rudy Gay man
RUDY GAY FOR 3
Rudy Gay killing us like usual
Rudy Gay cut to the basket!
"And all of us will say   ""IT'S RUDY GAY NO NOT THIS GUY NOOOOOO NOT THIS GUY""  ""Fucking Rudy Gay man"""
Rudy Gay has been in the league so long he's personally witnessed juvenile homophobia flourish and then recede from polite society.
Rudy Gay needs to channel his NBA 2K13 self for this 4th quarter
NOT RUDY GAY
"Rudy Gay is like 40, right?"
FUCKING RUDY GAY MAN
Rudy Gay has really turned into a chucker goddamn
Rudy Gay plays like KD if you told someone in the park to play like KD off memory
"The whole ""Tatum is lightskin Rudy Gay"" thing is actually true, because Rudy Gay plays exactly like Tatum would if he was bad"
Is Popovich sleeping on the sideline or something?? This is the worst play calling I’ve seen from him in a long ass time those Rudy Gay isolations were terrible
Hot take but I think the Spurs would be better with LeBron James and Steph Curry instead of Rudy Gay and Patty Mills.
Rudy Gay is ass
Rudy Gay needs to hang it up
That Rudy Gay fadeaway might've been the lowest success % shot I've ever seen
"Man, Rudy Gay taking some tough shots"
You got Rudy Gay and Deebo chucking long two’s 😬
Rudy Gay shouldn’t be getting significant minutes for a NBA team in 2021
Rudy gay playing scrappppy ong
Held Rudy Gay then smashed into Demar and glared like it was Demar's fault
 HES FUCKING HOLDING RUDY GAY WHAT THE FUCK
Watching derozen and Rudy Gay jack up contested midrange shots is just brutal. I'd rather have patty mills shoot 25 shots
"Nah they actually weren't over the limit, Rudy Gay fouled Valanciunas at the end of the half and it was a side out."
The Rudy Gay revenge game or the Kyle Anderson revenge game. Gotta love the storylines within the storyline
"anybody else remember when rudy gay used to be with the griz but got traded cause z-bo and marc gasol popped off. fun times, forgot rudy was still in the league."
Rudy Gay
"I assume there was more to this trade than this in order to make the contracts work. The griz had just been swept in the first round for the third straight year, and there were a lot of gasol trade rumors at the time, most of which involved a bad contract.  Even though Gasol didn’t get traded during the 2006 draft, his teammate Shane Battier did, for the draft rights to Rudy Gay. After watching Battier get worked by Josh Howard in the playoffs, Jerry West decided he needed an athletic wing with star potential. He did get an athletic wing.   Battier would later rejoin the team and hit a three pointer to clinch the franchise’s first playoff victory, while an injured Gay cheered from the sidelines."
"A lot of times I forget that Evans came back and had a second stint with the team for a few months as part of the Cousins trade.  Coincidentally (Not bringing this up to contradict you. You're right. I just think it was interesting), I was listening to the audiobook for Built to Lose by Jake Fischer while mowing the lawn today, and there's some stuff about how immense the pressure Vivek put on the team during those early years was. Malone thought he was gonna get two years of leeway and then be judged on results in his third year, but there was pressure to make the playoffs immediately. Chris Jent mentioned acquiring Rudy Gay was a result of that and adding a player of his caliber only dialed up the pressure even more."
"Cousings, IT, Tyreke Evans, and Rudy Gay"
he’d be what rudy gay would be if rudy gay had a goat tier work ethic
"It’s not about the scoreboard, it’s about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It’s pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."
"[Fuckin Rudy Gay, man...](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg)"
"Much respect to Pop. 2 moments stand out to me in regard to my team, the Grizz, the (before 2011, at least) woebegone Grizz.   In 2011, after having bitched about the Grizz' Pau for Marc trade, he conceded it was a misjudgment/mis-assessment when the Grizz upset the Spurs, and went to the Grizz locker room to congratulate them at the end of the series. I know that meant a lot to that team and the organization, after a franchise history of 0-12 in playoff games. They all held/hold him in high regard, so him knowing and showing appreciation for the occasion and for obstacles guys like Zach and Marc overcame was classy.  Then he upped it up in 2016. The record-setting injury season for the Grizz. They had started the season great, getting to the 2nd best record in the West, then an avalanche of injuries to everyone and everyones backups. So they limped to the 8, but could have phoned it in and tried for a good draft pick. Even though the Spurs swept the Grizz in the 1st round, and it wasnt even that close except for maybe 1 game, Pop made a special note at the press conference to recognize the effort of the remaining players on the decimated Grizz roster to not tank, and still get to the playoffs.  After the 2011 series, Pop and the Spurs dominated the Grizz, until around 2015. The wins were far and between. He and they were the standard Grit and Grind tried to measure itself against, the reason the Core 4 wanted to stick together with the Grizz. If only we could have found and kept a serviceable SG shooter and a PG backup for Conley. I think thats where Buford should get a ton of credit, identifying talent deep into drafts to attain and maintain excellence, and why the current Grizz FO gives fans hope-- we have seen what good deep draft decisions can achieve with the right coach because we got our butts kicked by Pop and the Spurs. And Jenkins is of the Pop coaching tree.  TLDR: Basically after their 2011 upset, the GnG fans were the Raptors fan and Pop/Duncan/Spurs were Rudy Gay when he received the ball at the end of the game. Not these guys. Fuck the Spurs, man."
Rudy Gay for the Raptors
Fucking Rudy Gay man
What about Rudy Gay??
"Of course, I meant contenders, not playoff hopefuls, you know what I mean? Rudy Gay has been wasted playing for us when he could have been a valuable piece on any of these other contenders the last few years."
I saw Rudy Gay in an Apple store
"The Spurs need a Center more than they need a PF, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson play that position well imo."
It used to be Rudy Gay.
Maybe they can get Embiid and Curry for Patty Mills and Rudy Gay too
"Hahahaha. Pretty sure it would take Murray and White for them to trade. They don’t really have anyone to trade. They have 3 players that have contracts past 2023. Murray, White, Vassil. That’s it. They gonna sign Rudy Gay to a 4 year 30million dollar contract? I’m sure Rudy’s 34year old ass is down. But are the Sixers?"
"I think you seriously lack reading comprehension. Those big men allow their perimeter players to defend the 3 better because they don't need to worry about drive-bys. Are you really this dense? Also last time I checked, Jae Crowder, Ben Simmons and Rudy Gay aren't big men."
"You’re psychotic, I’m sorry. Kawhi would talk every now and then when he needed too, like with that story of him in the locker room during the ECFs, but Kyle has been THE team leader since Rudy Gay got traded in Kyle’s second season here.   The Raps played excellent ball when Kawhi was kid managing, but we looked absolutely lost when Kyle had to sit. He was the leader on and off the court."
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: Dāvis Bertāns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting Bertāns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
"I mean, we turned Rudy Gay into a 60TS% scorer, then DeMar the following season."
"if he's maximized he can be an elite role player, but I don't think he thinks that, which is the problem.  I'm not against it because he can be our new Rudy gay, I guess, but not for 15+ a year."
[rudy gay vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84AKrZ1Fy1E)
"Absolutely not. The Process was one of the most pathetic things a front office has ever done. They spent 4 years publicly declaring their intention to lose games to collect good draft picks, but all they did was instill a losing culture on their young players causing them to whither. Guys like MCW, Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel actually started off looking like good players before they realized their team had no intention of developing them.  The Raptors tried to tank for Wiggins in 2014 by trading away Rudy Gay. But the players we got for him started us on a winning streak and Masai just went with it and kept building on it instead of trying to shoot for a jackpot player in the draft."
You could swap Tobias for Rudy Gay and I'm not sure the production would be any different. But your cap sheet would look a lot better.
I agree.   I feel the same way about Rudy Gay.
Derozan is a player I have a huge difference of opinion on with a friend. I think he is in the best possible situation with the Spurs where they’re actually willing to let him thrive at his best parts of his game when so many teams would now try to force him into a certain role. Same with Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay
"I still hate that we didn't even try to get anything for rudy gay, patty, or DeMar and all three could leave if they wanted to. I think smart teams maximize their assets and it's frustrating when a guy like Rudy Gay who was awesome on both ends should have been worth a late first or something. the Kawhi trade still hangs over this franchise for choosing DeMar over a young player, and he could just leave for nothing after missing the playoffs yet again,  meanwhile zero assets have gone to waste for the Thunder for like four years. lol"
Rudy Gay right?
Light Skin Rudy Gay and Flat Top Jeff Green
What do you know? RUDY GAY is obviously more clutch than Kobe.
"I got downvoted last time, but Henry Abbott has been a 🤡 for literally more than a decade.  He tries to ride news waves - he was very much a proponent of the ""Kobe is not clutch, Rudy Gay is clutch"" train back in the day and says things that will low key get under people's skin to boost his clicks up.  It came a decade late after the massive hit jobs he used to put out Kobe from 2008-2010, but I'm glad people are seeing him for who he is now."
"Carmelo and Rudy Gay are definitely the loudest names being rumored to the Lakers, yes."
Yeah I had to look up to confirm that Rudy Gay had never made an all-star team.  Dude was a 20 ppg scorer on solid efficiency as well as being a do-it-all small forward in his prime.
Surprised about Rudy Gay tbh
"You've shared on a number of podcasts the Lakers have veterans lining up to sign with them. Who are some of the free agents in consideration? Any word on Carmelo, Rudy Gay?"
Did Crawford never make an All-Star Game? Him and Rudy Gay seem really surprising to me
Noo it’s ~~Rudy Gay~~ Ben Simmons! Noooo! Noooo Not this guy! Not this guy! Nooooooooo
Rudy Gay &gt; Jakob Poeltl
"The raptors traded Rudy gay for what seemed to be a bunch of scrubs including Vasquez, Patterson  and most importantly Chuck Hayes but turned out much better then expected for the raptors"
1 time all star Gordon Hayward aint on the list dawg.  Khris Middleton only had 2 good seasons in the decade too.  Joe Johnson and Rudy Gay should be on here.
Rudy Gay is fools gold.
"Have you heard of the Rudy gay effect? whenever a team trade Rudy, the get better the next season."
"I would like to see Rudy Gay on here. I don't know if I could remove anyone to put him up here, and I understand he never got an all star last decade, but he had like six or seven straight 1000+ pt seasons and was pretty great in Memphis.   I don't know. Maybe it's just personal bias."
"When it came to the Grizzlies, the had Conley/Grievis Vasquez and Tony Allen/ Oj Mayo in his way, along with Rudy Gay/Shane Battier at the 3 spot. Despite that he still was able to play 28 games through December , start 16 averaged 5.6 points. Injures his knee and it’s sore the rest of the year where he only plays 10 games, then in his 2nd year he injured his ankle and missed half the year, didn’t put up huge numbers and went to NOLA where the same thing happened : injuries piling up"
"That's Rudy ""hit a game winner over prime LeBron James"" Gay to you"
Rudy Gay level historic qualities. That's my conclusion after putting this stat into context.
"If Rudy Gay changed his number to ""1""..."
"Isaiah Thomas is the big one. And cousins was looking great in NOLA pre-injury.  But also we had Whiteside become an actual NBA player once he left (after some time in China or whatever), Bogdan who’s looked much better on the Hawks, Seth Curry before he became Steph v2, Gary Trent Jr...  There’s also guys that just seemed to sandbag a bit for us.. Rudy Gay, who wasn’t bad but not what we had expected, we had the worst version of Rondo, bad seasons from DeWayne Dedmon, Arron Afflalo, Ariza, and pretty much every 37 year old vet we’ve brought on (although it was pretty cool to have Vince Carter for a season)  It’s hard to say how much of it is the organization and how much is the players/bad luck. But after 15 years, it seems pretty clear to me that we are in fact Basketball Hell as Rudy Gay so accurately put it.  Luckily we seem to have turned a new leaf with Monte McNair, it’s only been a season and some change but it’s looked a looooot better.  So yeah in terms of who’ve we drafted, nobody’s gone on to have an all-star type season besides IT. But I wouldn’t at all be surprised to see Bagley make a huge (double) jump once he leaves Sac. Or Buddy for that matter"
A Lineup of  Russ Buddy Rudy Gay LeBron AD  Is the best team from both sides of the ball.
and later he got dunked by post achilles oldman rudy gay in the bubble
Tatum being called light-skinned Rudy Gay and Brown being called flat top Jeff Green.
"Browsing a few old Ringer draft guides...  Tatum was compared to Pierce, Granger, and Rudy Gay. That holds up ok.  Doncic got a lot of Harden comps... I can't think of anyone better to compare him to now so I think that holds up.  Josh Hart got compared to Wesley Matthews and that turned out ok, I think.  Robert Williams was compared to Clint Capela."
"Assuming wizards don't look at moving off Westbrooks contract (say if Beal behind doors says he doesn't see them together long term)   Not saying they do/should nor we (spurs) do/should (since I want DJ being primary ball handler this season) but    DDR, DW for Westbrook, 15/Deni seems like a possibility lol    DW, Beal, DDR, Rui, Gafford is fun at least...    If wizards can get Rudy Gay too that would be decent."
I gave weed for free to Rudy gay and Charlie Villeuva in college when they tried to buy some.
"Kemba: career being derailed by injuries   Jeremy lamb: career derailed by injuries  Shabazz Napier: went from lebrons favorite rookie to a journeyman, currently playing in russia  Rudy gay: old but doing his thing   Amida Brimah: got a 2 way deal   Drummond: lol  Bouknight: on track to be our first lotto pick since lamb and first top 10 since kemba"
"Definitely overrated because of press coverage… but Morey does have a long track record of good teams even with out a title. Harden trade damn pretty good… Rudy Gay for Battier also good. Westbrook and Paul not so good. Morey has been dealt a pretty good hand with rosters, but Horst had it good as well… he wasn’t GM when Giannis or Middleton were drafted."
"Masai Ujiri has never had a fire sale. When he was forced to trade Carmelo Anthony when he was with the Nuggets, he got a huge trade package. Then two years later they had their best season ever.  When he started with the Raptors, he traded the best player at the time, Rudy Gay, and then proceeded to have the best season ever shortly after.  Masai is always looking to compete immediately. It's not in his philosophy to tank."
Dude pulled the 10th seed in a competitive west with a slew of injuries+two best players of demar derozan and rudy gay but he drops a couple games with team usa cause the players are just isoing and chucking and suddenly he's bad? That's whack lmao
"no shit lmao we sure could use a cam reddish right about now, as that's exactly the player archetype we're specifically missing. high upside 6'8"" with good defense. sure that's what everyone wants but we don't even have Rudy gay anymore lol"
"josh smith in atlanta  aaron gray, rudy gay and landry fields in toronto"
Get Kevin Love and Rudy Gay on that roster ASAP
"Feel like we wore the tams before the sounds. Distinctly recall Rudy Gay in a tams jersey and obviously Barnes, Carter etc in sounds jerseys"
https://youtu.be/o4hMBvsGgn0  Another hilarious pitch by Rudy Gay lmao
"&gt;Replace chriss with rudy gay  I want to be realistic. Gay might go for the MLE, and what connection do we have to him? I don't want to ask for 4 FA vets, that's impossible.  We've been linked to Batum heavily, K-Love is close with Draymond, has a history with us and fits us better than the Nets, with Mills as the only one we have no connection to."
Replace chriss with rudy gay
Rudy gay was an absolute cheat code in 2k
Rudy Gay. He's been one of the best backup 4s in the league for a few years now imo.
For a second there I thought you meant Rudy Gay and I was like...he's not 7+.  But yeah....def true for Gobert.  Part of the reason Diesel keeps ripping on him.
What do you propose that they should have done? They traded away Bertans because of Morris who decided to break an agreement to sign with the knicks. Was there trade value for Rudy Gay or Patty Mills? Gay and Mills are also free agents this offseason.
Lol Giannis would make prime Lebron look like Rudy Gay
For a couple years ya he was I'd say 2014-2018 when they got rid of rudy gay and zbo was kind of aging out he averaged 17ppg on that period mike Conley also averaged 17 ppg but gasol averaged slightly more shots
"Can we finally stop the narrative that you can get quality centers for absolutely nothing?   Granted, JaVale McGee didn’t sign for a ton of money with Phoenix but at the end of the day if you’re looking to be a contender you’ll most likely need a competent center rotation.   You can obviously get guys for close to the vet min that can soak up regular season minutes but those guys are obviously going to be exploited hard in the postseason to the point where you better have a backup plan.   So Phoenix coughed up more than a vet min for McGee and while Utah got Whiteside for a vet min, they also signed Rudy Gay who you’d hope can work as a small-ball 5 if Gobert gets played off the floor"
You guys used your MLE on a *much* better player in Rudy Gay.
"Agreed, those are all positives but Jeff was hugely important to the point that I feel like not filling his role (missing iggy, Otto porter,Rudy gay) is a miss"
"Im a photographer so I work with celebrities regularly. Basketball players I’ve bet  Cole Anthony   I took photos of his draft party last year  Rudy Gay  I met him while setting him up for an interview at HypeBeast  Obi Toppin  A friend of mine knew him since he was a kid, is good friends with his father. I met him when he got drafted.   A few others but I got NDAs so I can’t reveal that yet"
Rudy Gay too. He did it a year or two before KD and he's still good
Rudy Gay is almost as good as he was pre-injury and he did his before KD
Klay is a dude that didn’t rely on athleticism he was a shooter that would drive to the rim occasionally  All the guys that have torn their achilles have also been bigs or players that relied more so on their athleticism (also Rudy gay has had a good career after this same injury so have others so it’s really not a career ender)   Your acting like he lost his leg he tore an ACL and an achilles yes he’ll still be able to run around the court come off screen and shoot the lights out of the ball like he did before  If these 2 injuries happens to someone like Westbrook or someone like him who’s a freak athlete then this would be a completely different conversation
"Yeah, I’m a big fan of Mt. Hood too.  Was hoping he could recover from the injury but he looks like such a shell of himself last year.  Maybe another year and he can get back to some semblance of self (like Rudy Gay)"
"Lol DeMar and Kyle don't develop into the players they are without masai heading things up. Kyle said in an interview that masai pushed him to be the player he is, saying if you don't get your act together you will bounce around the league and never make a big contract; he then rewarded him each time he was a free agent, even though other teams didn't want to. Masai oversaw the creation of the G-league team and one of the best development programs in the league. He changed a team that headlined Andrea bargnani and Rudy gay to a deep team with very good role players.  Raptors made the playoffs for 8 years straight and still continued to improve Their younger players; that's very difficult to do in the NBA, which is why so many teams fall in the mediocre first round exit cycle.   Siakam was drafted late in the first and everyone criticized the pick. He's picked lots of great players. Turned Vasquez into Norman and OG. Picked up Fred undrafted. The kawhi trade wasn't a simple deal and most people thought it was a stupid trade, and stupid to pursue kawhi. The Marc gasol acquisition was a pristine move.   Masai hired many consultants to help with replacing Casey and even though most people pushed for hiring bud, he didn't do it and instead hired Nick Nurse... Which wasn't an obvious move at the time; it wasnt very popular at the time either.    Tbh you don't really know what you're talking about with this criticism. To every long time raptor fan who has seen true pain, seen Loren woods starting at center for the entire season, seen Chris Bosh walk away for nothing because we couldn't retain jack shit for year despite having a solid player.... Ffs we our pg positions one year were rafer alston and milt Palacio. Masai is easily top 5 executive in the league, and I think that's short selling him."
I think the bulls can have a hawks/Miami like run in the playoffs with some luck. Aka if the nets and the bucks somehow find themselves on the same side of the bracket again.  Dark horse title team: I still believe in Utah for some reason. As a Spurs fan I think the Rudy gay signing was quite underrated. Hopefully Mike Conley stays healthy. I would say warriors but I’m not sure they qualify as a dark horse.  Dark horse playoff team: is it too easy to say pistons? Cade lives up to the hype and that’s certainly a play in team
"He had Rudy Gay running the 3 next to him, it wasn't all scrubs"
NOOOOOOO IT'S RUDY GAY NOT THIS GUY
"I would not say Rudy Gay became a ""shell of himself"". His role with the Spurs is what it would've at that point in his career pretty much anyways, not to mention that he showed explosive burst routinely."
"He also spent almost 4 years in basketball hell. If there's anyone who would be willing to give up some money to be in a situation where he's comfortable and happy, it's Rudy Gay."
"The Jazz have two sixth man of the year finalists, Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Jared Butler."
 &gt;Rudy gay  Lol what?   The only time he lost money was signing an extension the year before the cap spiked.
really rudy gay ? what the backstory on his
"This is a recurring story. Rudy gay, Latrell sprewell. All lost millions being greedy and misjudging their market"
"If Whiteside doesn’t perform he’s gonna be stuck behind Dok in the depth chart and we’ll probably give more small ball 5 minutes to Rudy Gay.  He has a chance to get a solid 15-20 min per fame if he’s motivated plus some spot starts if Gobert sits, but could easily be the last guy off the bench too."
Signing Rudy Gay was huge imo. Gobert won’t be on an island this time.  No one is talking about them because they aren’t the Lakers or Nets.
"Rudy Gay was from the MLE, this was from our TPE from the Tony Bradley move last offseason, Whiteside was a minimum, Conley we had his bird rights."
"they lost demar, rudy gay and patty mills though"
"So you concede that there are basically no defenders in the NBA who could perform the defensive responsibility that was asked of Rudy in that position.  And that's Rudy's shortcoming? You don't think that can be pinned in any way on Quin Snyder, for having a scheme that results in a defender being asked to do something impossible?  Rudy not being able to guard the perimeter is a dumb meme that hasn't been true for at least four years now. [He's fine to good on the perimeter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/), and has figured out how to use his length to help recover against quicker players that beat him successfully. The problem in the Clippers series wasn't that Rudy couldn't defend on the perimeter; it was that the Clippers could reliably manipulate Quin's scheme in to pulling Rudy inside to challenge a drive to the rim, then could kick out to Rudy's man - which, as we just discussed, no defender in the league could reliably cover.  Anyway, the team knows that it needs a plan B against smallball units, which is why they signed Rudy Gay."
Mitchell / Conley / Rudy / Royce / Bogey  Jingles / Clarkson / Gay / Butler / Dok or Whiteside  So at best he's their 11th guy.
"In fairness, I don't think Quin had any options. That's why the Rudy Gay signing is huge."
"1. Stay healthy in the playoffs  2. Pray and hope one of Hassan or Udoka can play backup center minutes better than Tony bradley two years ago  3. Pray rudy gay, plus a healthy Don and Conley provides them enough wing defense to not get totally hacked by small ball"
"The Rudy Gay pickup is one of the best signings of the offseason, but the Whiteside pickup is one of the worst. Jazz fans are going to lose their minds when Whiteside is on the floor."
"Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall and Hassan Whiteside are great replacements for Niang and Favors minutes, I like it. Not to mention the Donovan-Paschall connection."
"The Jazz need someone that can maybe be a small ball center. It's gonna be either him or Rudy Gay, maybe a lil bit of both. plus he's cheap and our front office is done throwing big money around this year. Add to that he happens to be best childhood friends with our franchise superstar and it makes a lot of sense."
"that's what the rudy gay signing was for. don't think paschall will crack our top-9 rotation. i think he's 11th behind the starters plus whiteside, butler, gay, ingles, and clarkson."
They bring back the same team but replaced Niang with Rudy Gay and drafted Jared Butler who I’m pretty high on as an immediate rotation guy. Plus Mitchell could take another step forward.
"Utah has been low key killing it this off-season. Kept all 5 of their starters, both their 6MOY candidates(so far) replaced Niang with Rudy Gay, replaced an aging Favors with Whiteside, and just got Paschal(one of Donovan Mitchell’s best friend) for practically nothing."
How are Jazz signing people without losing cores? They were also able to sign Rudy Gay
I agree but I do think we’re seeing more guys come back better from the Achilles. Durant is the most well known but Rudy gay was the first guy who I thought of when Durant was recovering as encouraging of someone that came back pretty well. Now David nwaba also came back well and players from other sports have been.   I wouldn’t be surprised if Klay is never the same but at the same time I don’t think it should be shocking if he does come back well
"Spurs betting on their medical team to rehab his value (as they did in the past with Rudy Gay and Boris Diaw). If they succeed, they have a lottery talent on a cheap contract. If he gets injured, they can just not pick up his options."
"Might be well known, but Kyle Lowry was drafted to the Grizzlies, then was traded to thee Rockets three years later. He spent his first six years in the league on the non-Raptors. With his new 3-year contract, he'll likely spend just as much time on other teams as he spent with the Raptors.  &amp;#x200B;  (This is just a personal, fun one, but I started getting serious about basketball around 2013. It's really hard for me to get out of my head that Rudy Gay is not a Raptor's staple, he was barely on the team. That period just sticks out to me a lot)"
"The Jazz got a little mixed up and thought we were all doing confusing first names, so they got Rudy Gay to pair with Rudy Gobert"
"The Jazz have to be up there, went from paying Favors 9M to paying Whiteside the vet min and IMO is an upgrade, I think Hassan is a better player today.  Rudy Gay is an upgrade over Niang  Jared Butler was a steal  Ryan Smith has shown he’s willing to be a tax payer"
He’s one of those rehab projects the Spurs love taking (like Rudy Gay or Boris Diaw).
"Raptors are following a Masai retool pattern.   **First GM gig on Nuggets**  - trades best player: Carmelo - gets roster balancing pieces - almost right away they become a 57 win team, and best season in franchise history  **Second GM gig on Raptors**  - trades best player: Rudy Gay - gets roster balancing pieces - almost right away creates a 50+ win team, and best in franchise history  **Third go at roster building**  - sign and trades best player: Kyle Lowry - will get roster balancing pieces - hmmm  Masai has never purposely tanked. And this Raptors team will be better than you think."
"Rudy Gay is a Jazz legend, put some respect on his name"
Rudy Gay will be the small ball 5 in the playoffs.
"Four of their top seven scorers from last season are gone, and they are getting nothing in return for them.   The Spurs really fucked this up.   I understand that there would likely be no takers for Rudy Gay, and even at the beginning of the season, none for LMA.   But Patty Mills and DeMar are certainly guys they could have shipped out for something."
"Rudy gay, even in old age is too skilled of a player to be written off as exclusively a stretch 4. At the very least he brings positional versatility on both ends"
"I think Jazz will be 1st seed, I believe you guys didn't lose anyone and even added Rudy Gay?"

"pretty happy with the jazz  operating over the cap, but able to bring back conley and get rudy gay  seems good clap"
"Wait hold on, whose made the huge moves in the West?   The Lakers yes. The Nuggets yes, they added a starter in Aaron Gordon last season. The Clippers no. The Suns re-upped. And the Jazz, no, Rudy Gay and Mike Conley don't seem like they're enough to get em over the playoff hump.  I think only two teams could say they got better, with the Suns, Grizz and Mavs probably banking on internal growth to get them to the WCF/finals. Of course, the best out of these teams is the Suns."
"Masai was ready to blow it up since he started with the Raptors.  Trading Rudy Gay was a rebuild move lol.  As was the proposed trade to the Knicks for Lowry.  It's happened before but we just went on an epic run despite all of that between 2013-2020.  it's been an awesome 7 years, but all good things must come to an end."
"Days? Try minutes. After the Carushow left, we lost patty mills and rudy gay, you guys went hard at us. And fake fans were going hard at Pelinka."
Lakers wanted Rudy Gay but now all they gonna have is Bengay
"Good thing Rudy Gay left, otherwise Aminu would have vetoed the trade"
"Rudy Gay and Conley are reunited. C'mon Big Spain, you know what to do."
Rudy Gay isn’t near as physical or as strong as PJ.  Not every small guy can do what him and Draymond do
"Well, this and the Rudy Gay news means the Warriors have basically struck out on everything huh?"
Rudy Gay Bear
"Derozan and other names that were connected to us like Rudy Gay are all gone, and we signed the rest like Melo so who is even left at this point? lol lol"
"bruh if he takes our core and somehow gets us to the playoffs in the next two years (pipe dream I know but let's say for arguments sake that DJ becomes Ja Morant lite, Derrick becomes McCollum 2.0 with better defense, Big Body becomes young Rudy Gay, Jakob puts up 15-10 and one of our second year/rooks can provide current DJ level net positive floor impact)... I feel like he at least goes for that. Leaves the team in good hands. Leaves with the future bright bright."
Pop does not really want Rudy Gay or DeRozan to sign with the Lakers.
"Yes, Rudy Gay is one of my favorite players!   Which is weird, but I've always liked him."
[NO IT’S RUDY GAY! NOOOOO! NOOOOOO NOT THIS GUY!](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg)
No but it might have had something to do with Rudy Gay and Patty Mills 🤷🏽‍♂️
"NO, NO IT'S RUDY GAY"
"Suns are being massively slept on. I get that they got an easy road to the Finals due to all their injuries, but they kept all of their core players, and all those players will be better off due to the experience they just got.   The Jazz are also being slept on as well, they weren't healthy in the playoffs, Conley's injury prevented us from seeing what they're capable of, and Rudy Gay was an astute signing.   IMO those 2 teams will be the Top 2 seeds again in the West, they have such a high floor with their backcourt + center combination.  Blazers will be the most improved team from last year to this year, the coaching change was badly needed, they have continuity with their team, their starting 5 is really fucking good, they will be a home court advantage team next year, maybe the #3 seed."
"im just saying, it might be a bit of a mixed opinion, but I think they're similar. patty was super hit or miss. some games he goes nuclear and other games he's a nightmare eating up shots every time he touches the ball. much like Rudy gay.   underrated on defense as a real pest. does that Steve Nash thing where he drives all the way under the basket and pulls it back out with a switch. i think both teams got what they wanted. Monk is more athletic so I think the Lakers need someone like that."
You could say the same for Rudy Gay who went to the Jazz  or Otto Porter Jr who went to the Warriors.  This is like the first signing Nets have done all offseason. They lost Jeff Green to the Nuggets  I haven’t seen any moves this offseason where you can say there’s a market advantage (outside of maybe Tucker)  Lowry is close to Butler  Ariza/Dwight are both laker guys  NY only got Fournier. They struck out on all the star.  Let’s calm down
"Same as a Jazz fan, here's to hoping a 34-year-old Conley and 35-year-old Rudy Gay can hold up"
"If people think you're the favorites, they'll hype anything you do. This would be the reaction if they got Rudy Gay as well, but since Rudy went to the Jazz he's not MVP caliber like Patty Mills suddenly is."
We missed Rudy Gay and Mills lmfao and AC. If a LA fan says this Free Agency was still a success please mock them
"Don't forget about Utah, best record in the league the whole year, they weren't healthy in the playoffs, and Rudy Gay was an astute signing."
"Agreed, who do you think makes the finals next year in the West?   With the LA teams being out of the equation due to Kawhi's injury and Russ being Russ, it's really open.   Part of me wonders whether Phoenix might just make it back there again. I also think people are overreacting to Utah's playoff exit, they're still a damn good team that wasn't healthy in the playoffs, and Rudy Gay was a low key really good signing.   Don't really know what to make of Denver, I'm not really a fan of teams that have a key player who is returning from injury mid-season, it seldom seems that those teams have playoff success.   Dallas is sneaky, if Porzingis gets back to the player he was 2 years ago, they will be a legitimate threat."
"I don't think of it as a punt - we're definitely not going to be tanking. Instead it's going to be that middle space where a team like the Blazers sit - not a true contender, just a 1st/2nd round playoff team. We will be relying on young players a bit but I think it's important for those young players to finally sink or swim - Langford's been injured so much that he's only played 50 out of 144 games and it's his 3rd season, and finally he has an offseason where he doesn't need to rehab and can work on his game. Nesmith looked totally lost at the beginning of last season and racked up a ton of DNPs, but once the game slowed down for him at the end of last season, he was averaging 8.5/4.5/1 in 19.5 MPG shooting 51/44/91. Everyone knows about Timelord's potential already, it's about proving he can stay healthy and if he can make strides on defense.  I'm very okay giving these players more minutes to prove themselves in expanded roles.  But in the end, it's the same situation as if we had kept Fournier, traded for Delon, signed Rudy Gay, etc. That team would be looking for our young players to grow in leaps and bounds and even then we'd still be heavy underdogs against the Bucks and Nets."
"Would’ve never expected Rudy Gay to become a really solid player off the bench late in his career but he’s become really solid, good pickup for Utah"
It saddens me this clip doesn't come up more in the Rudy gay memes conversation
Rudy Gay
Gobert^(Rudy) \+ Rudy Gobert Gay + Gay^(Rudy)
"KD, Curry, and LeBron are all over 33. Pair them up with old times like Horford or Millsap, and I'm sure they'd be odds on favs.  It's about talent, not age.   LBJ, Anthony Davis, and Westbrook are obviously an amazing core. Questions about chemistry sure, but you throw in Dwight, Gasol, Ariza, and maybe Carmelo and Rudy Gay... old or not, that is some fire power.   The back-up point guard is what I'd be most concerned about. Wish they still had Rondo."
(Gobert + Gay)^Rudy
Rudy Gay eh?
"I wouldn’t want the deal to happen. Joe did way more for the Jazz than play wing. He was Utah’s backup PG essentially and did a hell of job doing it. We just picked up Rudy Gay, I’d rather stand pat and develop Oni more for that wing defense. He’s a solid defender he just fouls too much"
Curse Rudy Gay and his money grubbing!!
Rudy gay to Utah….just as we all expected
"The only way the Jazz avoid paying tax this year is if they completely blow up the team, which isn’t happening. You’re getting a lot of upvotes for being completely wrong.  With the Conley and Rudy Gay signings, plus Jared Butler’s rookie deal and a couple vet minimums the Jazz will easily be paying $30-40M in tax this season.  Joe clearly lost a step last season and the Jazz would be dumb not to seek out improvements if they’re available. Trading with another luxury tax team also isn’t going to save us much if any money since both teams have to take back salary in any transaction."
"I like Rudy Gay (who's signed with the Jazz it's been announced) but Mills would be the biggest free agent get for us.  A truly competent, veteran point guard who has post season experience and is skilled? To take a role that's been more or less vacant since Shaun Livingston retired, a true backup to Steph?  Inject that into my veins.   If Porter stays healthy, if they land Mills, all of a sudden I'd be feeling like a strong return from Klay by the end of the season would make the Warriors a dark horse favorite to upset some teams and maybe have a deep run."
"How exactly do you propose that the Jazz get athletic wings? The Jazz are tied financially and can only make moves around the edges. They also have very few assets so outside of trading Joe or Bogey they can't hope for much. Rudy Gay is cheaper, can play small ball 5, defends well and hits 3s at a good clip. He's a massive upgrade over Niang and positionally more useful than Favors. This is a great signing in what has overall been a really solid offseason for Utah"
It’s actually not a specific year - it’s at least 2024 if not later but they didn’t say you get X year’s pick.   I mean I think it’s pretty clear that if you have to move a salary you give a pick. They also just signed Rudy gay after re-signing Mike Conley. Imo it was a move to make the team better not quite Derrick favors is trash and they need to move on. Favors would have put them more in the luxury tax which they don’t want to pay.
"Rudy turned into one excellent defender off the bench for the Spurs. That, combined with his already great scoring? Utah is going to be very happy with Gay."
"Rudy Gay just signed, take him off the board"
Yep. I don't like what is happening to my Jazz this off season. We really need athletic wings but instead we shipped out favors and signed Rudy Gay...
Anyone would be an upgrade over Niang. Rudy Gay at this point in his career isn’t a great wing defender anymore and that void was the Jazz’s downfall in the playoffs.
Is Rudy gay a good or even average defender anymore? What they need more than offense or bench depth is a good defender. They lost in the playoffs cause of bad defense.I would have thought they would have tried to sign a better defender with the MLE.
Is Rudy gay a good or even average defender anymore? What they need more than offense or bench depth is a versatile good defender. They lost in the playoffs cause of bad defense.
If the Warriors signed Rudy Gay they would have 10 wings lol he was off the table after Otto agreed
"More details on the contract:  &gt; Rudy Gay is signing a two-year, $12.1M deal with the Jazz, with a player option, his agents Raymond Brothers and Sam Permut said.  Source : [Shams](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1422579092197609474?s=19)"
"No, why would this mean that? They're not running Rudy Gay at point forward lol"
YOU FUCKIN ASSHOLE!!!!! NO!!!! FUCKIN RUDY GAY MAN... SHIT
rudy gay just became provo's most eligible
NOT THIS FUCKIN GUY.... NOT RUDY GAY!!!!
"Lmao the off-season isn’t even over so you can’t say anyone had a good or bad offseason until the smoke settles. The Lakers have been linked to Patty Mills, Melo, and Rudy Gay so to say the Lakers are done after signing 2 shooters is you being willfully dense and ignorant lmao"
"It depends on demar, but if he walks, The Spurs were all ready a 10 seed and had a losing record, I struggle to see how swapping demar/Rudy gay/Patty mills for Doug McDermott/Luka Samanic/and Tre Jones or josh primo doesn’t make this team quite a bit worse. And Derrick white, who just cannot stay healthy gets hurt again, this is probably a bottom 5 team"
Carmelo Anthony   Rudy Gay  Jabari Parker
"Luckily for them, adding Rudy Gay will help them greatly for when teams try to go small. He played a lot of 5 for the Spurs and was really good. But they still gotta figure out perimeter defense better to be successful in the playoffs"
Kings isn't actually horrible:  Demarcus Cousins Bogdanović Rudy Gay Patrick Patterson Rajon Rondo
"Well, I’m 5’10, stocky and white as snow so I’m definitely not the son of Rudy Gay"
Are you implying Rudy Gay is my dad?
Rudy Gay dominates my birthday.
"Mitchell, Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson.  So best we’d have available is Royce O’Neale, Joe Ingles, and Rudy Gay."
rudy gay and kyle lowry on that grizzlies squad
"No that's exactly the point I'm making: given their tax implications it doesn't make sense to spend unless they can find one of those tipping-point players. They had a list early in guys like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, or Nic Batum. All chose to sign elsewhere."
"Come on do the fun ones that will get you in trouble, Rudy Gay, James hard-on, Kevin love"
"Not totally related, but I confused Miles Bridges and Mikal Bridges for the longest time  Also back in the day I always confused between Sean May, Randy Foye, and Rudy Gay"
"The usage and playing time voids created by the departures of DeRozan and Rudy Gay are substantial. However, based on the data from last season, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, and Derrick White are the most likely beneficiaries of that void."
LaMarcus Aldridge   Tracy McGrady  Vince Carter  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Paul Millsap  Rudy Gay  Marc Gasol  Kemba Walker  DeMar DeRozan  Shawn Marion  Dwyayayayane Wade
Do Rudy Gay👀
Now do Rudy Gay
Rudy Gay - He's a .....  never mind
what about Rudy Gay ?
Poor Rudy Gay...
Rudy Gay luckily has too poor of eyesight to read this
Can you do Rudy Gay
Steph looks more like Rudy Gay
What about Rudy Gay and Kevin Love?
Rudy gay
Do Rudy Gay now
Rudy Gay
Rudy gay has had a pretty good career
"Honestly even forgot that Rudy Gay was even there. He played like 50 games and left.   One thing is for sure, young Rudy Gay was a crazy athlete. Dude always looked like he was floating when he jumped."
"Same. Rudy Gay was one fo the best players in the game and that Raptors squad after the trade with Gay, DeRozan, and TRoss could dunk on anyone. 2K MyTeam started that year as well and Gay and Gerald Green were great budget options that played so well. That Memphis squad the year prior in 2K12 with Gay, Gasol, Randolph, OJ Mayo, Tony Allen, Conley, and a washed up Gilbert Arenas was so fun to play against other teams online."
Its a good day to be one of the 10 Rudy Gay fans left on the planet
You know Rudy Gay is old when players say 'they use to play with him on the Raptors in 2k' when he actually had 7 years before that when he was on the Grizzlies.
Rudy gay on the kings in 2k12 or 13 was money. I got drafted by them and he got me 10 assists every game
Bro 2k Rudy Gay back in the day was something else
Rudy Gay and Thad Young are two players I've always wanted GS to sign. Rudy Gay signing with Utah really hurt
"I always feel bad for that poor guy, the Raptors were pretty bad around that time and you'd have to be a real one to know that about Rudy Gay"
In my head Rudy Gay wasn’t on the Raptors to long ago…
That Rudy Gay had the sweet free throw line dunk animation.
"Bro I remember Chandler Parson in 2k12 was literally the white Lebron. It was unreal, you could absolutely destroy people with him.   And yeah Rudy Gay was my 2k favorite for a long time. Loved those grizzlies teams where you could just slash with him and Tony Allen"
The 2k versions of Rudy Gay and Ross were so fun.
Rudy Gay was a problem in 2k12
Rudy Gay is like Lebron and Curry combined on 2k
"T Ross, Demar, Rudy Gay lineup was great in the game. Fast breaks and dunks all game"
"Every athletic SF that can somewhat shoot were basically Lebron lite from 2k12-2k14.  Iggy, Josh Smith, Rudy Gay were the holy trinity of hidden 2k gods."
"Real ones remember that 2k12 Grizzlies team, and How fucking BROKEN rudy gay was in that game lmao"
"Just yell, ""No! It's Rudy Gay! Nooooo! NNNNOOOOO!!! Nooo! Not this guy! Not this guy! NooooOOOooooOh my God! You fucking asshole!"""
"If it's Steph curry talk about how his ""gravity"" lets other players get open looks.   Yell ""moving screen"" every jazz pick and roll  Mention that luka doncic has elite deceleration whenever he has the ball  Talk about how sick Rudy Gay, Derrick Rose, DeAndre Jordan used to be  Reminisce about Greg Oden. He would've been bill Russell come again.   Say the officiating is ruining the game.   If randle or siakam drive to the rim, be ready with a beyblade comment Incase they make a spin move.  Go nuts when Caruso does anything  I have passed on all knowledge I have young nephew, it is up to you to carry the flame"
"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
Rudy Gay
"Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Rudy Gay, O.J. Mayo, and Marc Gasol. Thats basically the legendary grit and grind lineup -Mayo +Tony lol. And the worst player in hindsight there is O.J. who was a second year player coming off of an 18,5 ppg rookie season lol"
"Of anything, JJJ is the Rudy Gay of this next generation of Grizz. The first domino. Technically, it was DB, but he was a second round find. They dont make bank.  After years of doubt whether the Grizz could retain their own players, they resigned Rudy, setting in motion a string of successful signings that retained their core for 7 seasons.  They will likely do the same, here. The trades of JV and Grayson also signal the opening of cap space for the teams future deals, including JJJ."
Bruh fr Rudy gay is not better than Tatum come on now
"Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard were picked immediately after Fredette and Robinson too... Kings could've been in contention with a lineup of Dame, Klay, Gay, Williams, Cousins.  Or they could have got Klay and Kawhi and had Tyreke, Klay, Kawhi, Rudy, Boogie."
"I agree. I don’t think health changes that series either. Just saying I think it’s a better likelihood of improvement than going tit for tat small ball 5 w Rudy gay.   I had also stated in the end there’s no excuses for losing to a kawhi less clippers squad up 25 at half. It’s inexcusable. They need better focus, better coaching, better execution, period. And while I’ll be rooting for them, I find it completely understandable if other fans around this league have no faith in the Jazz."
"&gt;If you bench Gobert, what are you left with? 4 bad perimeter defenders and Gay playing the 5? Doesn't matter what principles you have at that point.  Well, no. I'm saying that I think a large part of the the perimeter defenders playing so ""badly"" was that it was the scheme of the defense: if opponents wanted to drive, let them. Taking Gobert off means you're playing an entirely different defense, which (presumably) means different principles. Now, it does matter whether your man gets by you, because it's not as sure a thing that he'll be properly challenged at the rim.   Again: if you're playing a non-Clippers team, then the smartest thing you can do is to let players get by you if they want to go to the rim, because Rudy will challenge them better than anyone else could. The Clippers were just able to have 5 shooters on the floor at all times, which mean that drives inside could be kicked out to an open man, since Rudy was always going to drop inside. Other teams wouldn't have 5 shooters, though, so Rudy's dropping inside didn't hurt the Jazz, since the rest of the Jazz defense could cover the dangerous shooters.  I'm putting quite a bit of stock in those 3pt statistics I cited earlier. The Jazz perimeter defenders were clearly doing some aspect of their jobs well, because opponents only rarely shot 3s, despite knowing the lane wasn't an option, and the 3s they did get off weren't good shots. To me, that points to that area of the defense strategically lacking against the Clippers, rather than simply being incompetent at their jobs."
"My point is that playing ""shitty"" perimeter defense *was* the right principle for the scheme that Quin wanted to play. If someone tried to drive on you, you'd put up a cursory effort but let them go, instead of challenging them all the way to the rim on their drive. The idea was to keep perimeter defenders on the perimeter as much as possible, to take away the 3 while Gobert took away the interior shot.  It wasn't until the series against the Clippers that that scheme started to break down, when the Clippers would simply overload the side of the perimeter that Gobert's defender was on, so they could always generate an open shooter when Gobert dropped inside to challenge the drive. Like you said, the ""better"" defensive principle would have been to stop allowing drives inside so easily, but the scheme had worked pretty well over the previous 80 games, and it's hard to completely uproot your entire defensive strategy in 3 games.  I still think Gay is a little preferable on defending the outside. Gobert's one-on-one strategy against quick guards has been to keep a respectful distance away, and use his length to overcome his lack of quickness if and when he's beaten on a drive inside. He's not someone that will go fully out on the perimeter and be able to interfere with motion that guards want to run, and it remains to be seen how well he'd be able to manage a switch-heavy defense.  Anyway. Point of all of this is that it'll be fascinating to see how Quin does use Gay going forward, because he's definitely a piece that the Jazz haven't had before in the Gobert era. Maybe Gay plays as a smallball 5, taking Rudy out of the lineup entirely against teams like the Clippers. Maybe Gay is just a secondary rim protecting 4, who can serve as an OK replacement for Gobert if Gobert is dragged outside. Either way, he opens up options."
"I don't think Rudy Gay at the 5 is that at all. He's worse than Gobert at every aspect of defense. Even if the task was to guard Steph Curry 1 on 1, I'd rather have Gobert out there than Gay. They need to do all the things you think they will do with Gay with Gobert. I wish it was simple as putting a worse defender out there to motivate the other players to actually play defense.  To your point, these defensive habits were built over the RS and multiple years the Jazz have employed the same system. If you let guys walk past you all year long, and it works, you're probably not going to be able to flip the switch and start locking guys up mid series. Same goes for off ball defense. If all you do is stay home and never leave your guy, you're not going to have the instincts to rotate and recover.  The simple presence of Gobert shouldn't automatically make everyone else play shitty defense. They need to have the right principles regardless of whoever is on the court with them. That is how they can succeed. Having a stretch 5 does literally nothing for them if the principles don't change."
"&gt;Jazz have to get out of their gimmicky defensive system  I mean... yeah. Playing Gay at the 5 *is* that. Instead of playing a leaky perimeter defense that doesn't give a shit if a perimeter player starts to drive, assuming that Gobert will cover the lane, now the Jazz can start switching, so the 5 comes out of the paint to challenge Jackson if Jackson manages to beat his defender, and the rest of the defense can rotate accordingly.  Also, I think there was an element of Quin instilling in the perimeter defenders that the non-Rudy defense stay outside at all times, so if an opponent got a step on a perimeter defender, the Jazz would just let that opponent go inside. The Jazz [had the 2nd best 3pt% defense in the league and allowed the 4th fewest 3PAs in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html#per_poss-opponent::9), and they also allowed [by far the fewest corner 3s in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html#shooting-opponent::30). We've always known the Jazz defense was designed around allowing only the midrange game, but the stats really bear that out. The perimeter defense was so focused on disallowing 3s that they stopped caring about interfering on drives to the rim - why bother, if Rudy will just swallow them all up?"
"Small ball 5 does nothing. Seriously, what does that actually help with and how does Rudy Gay solve any of the problems that the Clippers caused us defensively?  Does Rudy Gay solve the situation where Reggie Jackson walks past our ""best"" perimeter defender? Can he protect the rim and the paint at the same time? Gobert could not, Gay cannot, and nobody on the planet can either. Fact is, the Jazz have a sham system that works in the RS because Gobert is great, but it's impossible to have a one man defense in the playoffs.   Jazz have to get out of their gimmicky defensive system, stop relying on Gobert to do everything, and reestablish their principles to play defense as a team and not 4 statues around Gobert. Small ball 5 on exasperates the problems faced."
"Gay is there specifically because he can play the role of a smallball 5, which wouldn't overlap with any of Clarkson, Ingles, or Bogie's responsibilities. Against the Clippers, Gay would probably be the primary 5 over Rudy, assuming that LA rolled out the same smallball lineup that worked so well last year.  Gay ultimately may not move the needle that much for the Jazz's defense, but he can't be much worse than what the Jazz showed last year by games 4, 5, and 6."
&gt;how are the Jazz gonna gameplan for that 5-out attack?  Rudy Gay. That's why the Jazz got him.
"The Jazz's problem last season is that they had no one - *no one* - who could play a role as a smallball 5. Favors was the backup there, and he couldn't get out of the paint any better than Gobert could. Not every team has the personnel to run an effective full-time smallball unit, but the Clippers do, and because of that, they were able to take advantage of the Jazz.  The Jazz went out and got Rudy Gay for that reason. Now - whether you think Gay moves the needle at all or not is definitely up for discussion. But the move does shift the Jazz from being a team with absolutely no plan B, to one who has one.   The Jazz's offense is still going to be just as good, most likely, unless injury problems arise. The key is that now they aren't as beholden to Rudy's strengths and weaknesses on defense, which should help."
"I don't think he'll ever be a top tier ball handler.  But he can go from well below average to decent, like Rudy Gay.  MPJ with decent ball handling skills would bes dangerous."
"Rudy gay is not going to lead the jazz to a title lmao. The lakers and nets will smack them. The bucks will smack them. They lost to the clippers without kawhi, the jazz arent going anywhere, especially as long as rudy gobert is worthless on offense."
Rudy Gay is straight  John Wall is a human person  Tim Duncan shot a lot of jumpers and layups  Kevin Love only likes a lot of people
"And last year, Rudy Gay was the straightest player"
Rudy “Nooooo not this guy” Gay
Why did I read Rudy Gay as Rudy Gobert 🤔🤔🤔
"DRAPTOR pretty much always favour interior players over perimeter guys. There's a reason that they listed Rudy Gay as almost a top 10 defensive player last year, while Dejounte Murray was a net zero defender - and it is absolutely not that Rudy is the better defender.  There are a few exceptions, but thats basically how it goes.  Do you really think Drummond and Gasol were muchbetter defenders than Lebron last year?"
"in no order top 5: chris paul, steph curry, kelly oubre, ben simmons, paul george  &amp;#x200B;  honorable mention: jayson tatum, jaylen brown, serge ibaka, rudy gay"
"He looks cuter with the cut, but I agree. He's in the top 5 players in the league when it comes to looks.  Why doesn't Rudy Gay get any love for being handsome?"
Rudy gay was long gone by the time the warriors became anything
Eric Bledsoe--&gt; Marcus Banks  Paul George--&gt; Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard--&gt; Gerald Wallace  Nic Batum--&gt; Rudy Gay  Serge Ibaka--&gt; Shawn Kemp  --------------  Marcus Morris--&gt; Al Harrington  Reggie Jackson--&gt; Robert Pack  Shawn Kemp and Scottie Pippen would be an amazing duo
Rudy Gay  I legit thought with his athleticism and ability to score he was going to be a superstar.
Idk . Apparently Vince Carter/Rudy Gay was Wiggins's draft comparision according to nbadraft.net
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
Maybe Rudy Gay wasn't the problem
A chucker that was the #1 on some pretty good teams. This sub likes to compare Melo as a glorified Rudy Gay and it's wild. The Melo hate is weird.
Fucking Rudy Gay man.
"Yes, but not terribly. Wouldn’t have been worth his salary plus the tax to keep him. We replaced him with Rudy gay (yet to play) and paschall minutes and athletic d and hustle is more needed then another shooter.   I certainly like niang a lot and glad he found a team alongside other defensive hustle players where he can just shoot til his hearts content"
Tbf in the offseason no one was touching the Nets so could you blame him? Not like Rudy Gay to the Jazz or something.
"Patty-Danny-Demar-Kawhi -Aldridge  still have Rudy Gay, Slow-mo and Bertans"
isn't Rudy Gay only two years older than Westbrook?
"Russ is this gen's Rudy Gay where they put up flashy stats, but each team is better off without them"
No not this guy Rudy gay
"They brought in Rudy Gay as a solution to small ball but he's injured.  They brought Whiteside in to replace Favors to rectify the fact that the Jazz had the biggest gap in the league in defensive rating when Gobert was on the court vs on the bench, and it's working."
Even Rudy Gay would be an extremely positive recovery time.
I was trying to say he can be an athletic point forward like Lebron James and Andre Iguodala. Those were the 2 most athletic small forwards of the 2010s. Rudy Gay would be next after that.
"ha ha I do love me some chicken.  My wife is not a fan of replacing thanksgiving turkey with chicken - she just doesn't get it.    I have to say, whether the narrative of utah is true or not, I love the shift we're seeing with Donovan mitchell and D-Wade coming here and embracing the place.  Mike Conley and Jordan Clarkson sign new contracts with us and we recruited Whiteside and Rudy Gay.  No one wants to shed the idea of us hating on black people more than the average fan who just appreciates good dudes playing good ball."
"I’m not sure it’s specific to basketball. I think it’s just guys with congenital heart defects that go unaccounted for until it’s too late. It’s more surprising to me that guys like Rudy Gay (or was it Jeff Green?), Channing Frye, or Aldridge can go through college, combine, and nba medical evaluations without it getting caught until later into their nba careers."
"I'm both extremely hyped and think it's funny to have a flair for someone who hasn't actually played for our team yet (not that I'm going to change it after he debuts, because I'm already ride-or-die Rudy Gay.)"
Rudy Gay in 2k11 was your poor man's Lebron.
Ooh already got that Rudy Gay Utah flair up. I’m so ready
I literally screamed at my TV “don’t let Danny dribble the ball! Nooooooo!” like the god damn Rudy Gay guy
"That team had IT, Cuz, and Rudy Gay... so sad, but that's why the Kings have been shit for so long. Bad ownership thinking they're smarter than the people they hire.  We're hurting right now despite a decent record on the hardest SoS because Fox has been down so far this year. I don't know what to expect of the team, they are playing much better defense on average. Whatever happens I just hope its fun. GL!"
"Goddamn, I forgot Rudy Gay was on there too. I remember really liking that team. Such a bummer, dude. I hope the Kings luck changes soon. Good luck tomorrow, don't beat us too bad, we kinda suck rn lol"
they slid when cuz got meningitis i think. they were off to a good start. all the players like malone. rudy gay resigned primarily because of malone.
Not Rudy gay!!!
"It depends on the game, my mood, etc. That last game vs Orlando I just shrugged off since it was second half of back to back missing Conley and lots of traveling. I do have games occasionally that bum me out quite a bit though, usually when a player gets injured  Edit: I think the most bummed I got was actually the last Jazz game before the covid shutdown. We lost to the Raptors and Ibaka called Rudy Gobert Rudy Gay, and I was so mad because that was such a creative burn lol"
"[Quite a few](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=who+are+the+active+players+with+at+least+14%2C500+points+all-time), dwight, Lou will, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy gay, steph curry, demar derozan, and Dame"
"The thing is that he's not the only Jazz shot creator. Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and Rudy Gay when he's healthy are all guys that can create their own shot. And then we have Ingles who can create for others."
"Present?? It depends. But Bogdanovic is obvious to me.  Past?? Pau Gasol Memphis years.   Boozer since they went out of Chicago  Dwight Howard  Calderon (not Toronto fans, they love him)  Shawn Marion  Strickland  Rudy Gay (guy averaged nearly 20/6/2 with decent percentages for 700 games)"
"Rudy ""Rudy Gay"" Gobert"
Rudy Gay?
The Jazz signed Rudy Gay in the spot/salary that would have gone to Niang. His defensive versatility was more needed for a deep playoff run. Jazz are trying to win it all now.
"[Rudy Gay?! NOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOO, NOT THIS GUY!!!](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg)"
"Not much of a dropoff?  He's a career 30% 3 pt shooter, that's like a 10%+ swing from Niang.     Also Rudy Gay is our Niang replacement.  As long as we can get to the postseason with Gay healthy, whatever Paschall gives us is gravy."
"Reminds me of when we flipped Rudy Gay for Patrick Patterson, John Salmons, Grievus Vasquez, and Chuck Hayes lol     We lost the best player but actually became an NBA team again, and led to us acquiring what we needed for the run that followed.     Ended up flipping Grievus into Powell and OG."
"Rudy Gay, Aaron Gray, Quincy Acy for Patrick Patterson, John Salmons, Greivas Vasquez, Chuck Hayes.  Rudy Gay was the bad contract."
RUDY GAY!
Tacko Fall in the 70s   Rondo in the 80s   Rudy Gay 90s   Dejounte Murray Early 2000s   Okafor Mid-Late 2000s
"The Heat played at their absolute best and barely won. The Jazz haven’t peaked yet. We’re shooting subpar from 3 and don’t have Rudy Gay on the floor yet, who would’ve made a massive difference. Settle this in the finals, hopefully"
"Utah is stacked with their starters and 2 main bench pieces. Then Hassan Rudy gay and paschall.  Warriors got pieces too but all of their centres are fringe rotational players on most rosters which hurts their idea of depth. Then off the bench they got kuminga and moody who don’t play, so I might as well throw butler and Hughes in for Utah if I count them. Otto, Toscano, iggy, Lee and bjelica. Utah’s bench is 100% better and their all around starting lineup might be better. We’ll see though if klay returns and is his normal self right away and Poole off the bench and maintain his play"
Nothing against paschall but I’m excited for Rudy gay to take most his minutes
I have a feeling this would've been a good Rudy gay game
Too bad we won't have Rudy Gay back by the 20th
"Between this and Rudy ""Gay' Goberts heel injury  my fantasy team is reeling with phantom injuries"
Buss kids being cheap asf cost us this man. Shoulda signed Rudy gay on the MLE not a shit guard who gets benched in big games
"I don't know much about Rudy Gay. Whose minutes will he be taking when he is finally healthy? Paschall? He seems to be playing pretty well, so how big of an upgrade would Rudy Gay be over Paschall?"
"They’re a regular season team, Gobert got exposed by the Clippers and they don’t have another elite scorer besides Mitchell, and Rudy Gay is not the difference maker for a team being in championship team contention ☠️"
"Jazz made some good pickups in free agency, if Rudy Gay can do his thing they plugged a lot of holes."
"Jazz added a bunch of pieces and I think Jared Butler has the talent to become a legit 2-way backup. Basically swapped Niang and an underperforming Faves (2 worst playoff performers) for Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Whiteside who's filling his role very well."
Rudy gay in the playoffs&amp; play-ins
and to think rudy gay hasn't even suited up yet  *sheesh*
I cannot understate how happy I've been with Paschall and Whiteside. And we haven't even seen fucking RUDY GAY in action yet.
Rudy Gay is on the Jazz???
"Jazz injury report:  Donovan Mitchell,  Royce O'Neale  Hassan Whiteside  Rudy Gay  Jared butler   :/ feelsbadman"
"rudy gay and eric paschall for small ball improved that. whiteside &gt; favors, basically gobert lite. stfu nerd."
"lol they added hassan whiteside, washed rudy gay, and eric paschall. at least 1-2 of them won't even be in the playoff rotation. + the jazz will never be real contenders with Gobert as their 2nd best player"
"Eric pascall, and Rudy gay are pretty good additions…. Eric pascall in particular has impressed me on perimeter"
I miss the days of lightskin Rudy Gay and Flattop Jeff Green
But even cp3 was stupid athletic in his prime lol. Constantly the fastest guy on the court unless John wall or drose was playing on the other team.   Cade has more of a Rudy gay type athleticism (at least right now from what I’ve seen his first two games) but none of the height lol. If he ends up being a superstar he’s going to be the most cerebral player in the game.
3 team trade for Rudy Gay?
Yeah we was supposed to be Tracy McGrady not Rudy Gay.
"Depending on how well Rudy Gay plays when he's back and 100% maybe nothing, O'Neil is an excellent defender in the paint but he does seem to struggle rotating from that to the wing. and he's primarily a defensive part so when the jazz are struggling with shooting then he doesn't add enough to the offense, Paschall is a great add but he's still developing and getting used to the jazz scheme  Right now that's a weakness the jazz need to think about resolving for the late and post season. Jazz can rotate small at the PF as well but if they do they wear out JC and Ingles. I think Gay will fill that missing role really well but otherwise I would say that jazz should give Paschall more minutes when they can and try to continue developing his perimeter defense."
"We've got Rudy Gay recovering on the bench, so he probably starts if Royce can't make it"
Not Rudy Gay
I know O'Neil has had good games already but today was not one of them. Jazz are going to need to figure out PF and they got a lot riding on Rudy Gay when he returns
We are still waiting for Rudy Gay to play too
"We'll have to see Rudy Gay when he debuts, but Hassan is gonna be the difference maker this season/postseason"
Rudy Gay with the Eddie Murphy pants
"We're looking good but not great, which is honestly a pretty good spot to be in at 5-1. Soft schedule, but taking care of business and still looking like they could be a lot better.   Donovan has just been okay, he can and will definitely be better as the season goes on. JC has been shooting pretty poorly, Bogey to some extent as well, Rudy and Mike both look solid. We have one of the better offenses in the league iirc which is crazy considering we're shooting so bad overall which hopefully means it'll only get better.  Whiteside and EP have been great, they're looking like real solid acquisitions who bring a lot of good energy and have fit into our system well. We haven't even seen our biggest acquisition, Rudy Gay, play yet, so that's exciting. Our bench is spooky atm, honestly one of the best in the league.  Butler looks good, but hasn't gotten many results. Seems to still have some nerves out there and lacks some experience in decision making, but just from the eye test he still looks promising. Plays with more poise than a lot of rookies taken as late as he was so I feel like it's just a matter of time before he settles down and starts showing better results."
"whiteside lookin nice, hope he keeps the effort all season. stoked to see rudy gay come back and see what he brings. eric paschall is been pretty decent in his minutes also, seems like he has more intensity on the defensive end than what i saw from him on the warriors.  jared butler is in his own head right now i think, he has potential and looked like he'd be nba ready. by mid season i could see him finally showing his true potential and be a key rotation for the rest of the regular season to keep conley rested"
"A very random one but I think it's pretty interesting - Tyson Chandler and Boris Diaw to the Raps for Calderon  In hindsight, Raps may not have been able to trade for Rudy Gay -&gt; which turned into the ""rebuild"" -&gt; which led them to the title"
"I was referring to several teams. Celtics aren’t really a threat to top teams  in the East anyway .  The narrative on Utah is funny… like they had an o.k. Season and beat the Thunder with KD and PG to go to the second round when Donovan was a rookie… then two more o.k. Seasons with first round exits because they had injured point guards Rubio, Exxum… they lead the league last year but lose Conley to hamstring in first round, Donovan rolls ankle in first round… clippers series Donovan rolls same ankle but plays on it with no drive &amp; kick game..no Conley…   This year they upgrade from favors to whiteside, who looks like the same version Portland had and fits perfectly  Upgrade from Niang to Rudy Gay who shoots as well from 3  and plays solid D Add Paschal who is thriving on the team  Last years DPOY, 6MOY and the 6moy runner up.  Deepest team in the league, continuity, elite shooting, elite Defense, solid chemistry, but because it’s small market white bread Utah the rest of the NBA fans dismiss them as frauds.  I’m just saying, don’t be surprised to see this team touch a championship in the next 3 years or less.  But tell me how the Celtics are better"
Rudy Gay behaviour
Masai thought we were rebuilding when we traded Rudy gay to the kings and was one second away from trading lowry.. the rest was history. GUESS HE WRONG AGAIN
Notice I didn’t mention that we didn’t have Rudy Gay either? Yeah because Im talking about how we missed our 3rd best player. It’s not the “my team wasn’t fully healthy” card. It’s the “our third best player who was an all star last year was out” card
"Both the Yeti and the Apology were up for bags we couldnt give them. And both deserved those bags. The financial cases for trading them are obvious.  Grayson Allen was not much better than Bane offensively. And Bane is better defensively. Bane is also on a rookie deal for 4 years since he was the 30th pick.  JV needed too many touches, touches freed up with Steven Adams. See the Rudy Gay ​trade for Tayshaun Prince. That freed up touches for Zbo, Marc, and Conley. JV was also exposed as a defensive liability in the playoffs. So Steven Adams should give the Grizz what they need."
Fkin Rudy Gay man…
his minutes got distributed to hungrier players is part of it.   reminds me of when raptors traded rudy gay.
Remember the last time Masai tried to tank by trading away Rudy Gay. He's just trying to replicate that.
"Rudy hasn't played yet, and I don't expect to see him play small ball 5 very much in the regular season. As shocking as it sounds, Whiteside has been great for us. I don't mind him eating up minutes at center so that both Rudys can preserve their bodies for the playoffs.  The real test will be how Gay and Paschall perform against the Clippers. We brought them in for that matchup."
"Rudy Gay gave me a lot of faith, actually. I brought him up a few times when KD was hurt and mentioned him and Brianna Stewert as recent people who were able to play well with modern medicine and rehab"
I miss Rudy Gay
"This Jazz team might be good. Finally the Jazz have a backup center  Last year Favors looked washed, 2 years ago Bradley didn't even try to play defense. Whiteside is a perfect back up center to play when Gobert is on the bench  Also last year the Clippers won because the Jazz didn't play much perimeter defense. Since the Jazz added Paschall and Rudy Gay, that might not be a big problem"
"ha you fools disrespect the legend Rudy Gay who came back from his Achilles injury and was actually a better more useful player than he was before.  but yeah, KD had the best comeback, I'm not gonna lie lol"
Rudy Gay out here dressed like the Very Hungry Caterpillar.
Seeing the ball in Lambs hands for those 2 games I felt like that guy watching Rudy Gay draining the winner. It was ineveitable.
rudy gay as the grinch for halloween?
This team reminds me of the Raptors after the Rudy Gay trade. I think they'll continue to do well
"The data is currently adjusted to total jump balls, which would be a better threshold for sample size. Otherwise, you got guys like Jayson Tatum, Michael Porter Jr., and Rudy Gay who all have 100% jump ball win percentage despite playing 60+ games each. They only have 3, 2, and 6 jumps respectively compared to the 40 minimum for the players presented."
"I loved him when he was on the Raptors as well. He was in a tough spot when he joined the raptors, since Bosh had just left for the Heat and the organization was dysfunctional. Him and Amir Johnson were both high hustle players in the front court that I thought were gonna grow together until he was part of the trade package for Rudy Gay.   I was happy that he had a chance to shine with the Blazers and picked up some fans along the way"
Toronto Raptors’ Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster. The Rudy Gay deal. The Kawhi deal. Scottie Barnes.
"Jeff Green and Rudy Gay  So far into his career, Frank Ntilikina"
"Rudy Gay on the raptors, moreso because it was the last time anyone considered him a real difference maker"
and rudy gay isn't even back yet
rudy gay should be pretty serviceable too still
"absolutely wild to me that a guy like derozan, who was touted as the next kobe as a prospect and played SG basically his entire career next to guys like rudy gay and terrence ross, is now playing the 4 consistently"
"health will always play a part, and we have rudy gay and pascall to help guard 5 out.  Our roster is better than last years"
Azuibuke is our raw big man prospect at 6’10”  Bojan is a 6’7” SF.  Rudy Gay is 6’8”.  Rudy Gobert is 7’1”.  Joe Ingles is 6’8”.  Hassan Whiteside is 7’.  We’re ok on size.
we'll see how rudy gay plays first
You see by getting rudy gay it allows the jazz to run the rudy squared line-up. This will ensure not only that the magnitude of Rudy's impact is greater but that it must be a positive impact*.  * assuming that rudy is real.
"Not bleeding points whenever Rudy is on the bench is an amazing feeling. And we haven't even seen what Rudy Gay can do with us, this is very exciting."
"Don't even have Rudy Gay yet, there's going to be some good players getting fuck all minutes when we're healthy"
This isn't even the Jazz bench final form. We still have Rudy Gay.
"It's like when the raptors traded Rudy gay for a bunch of solid players and were way better after, plus they got rid of westbrick. Double positive"
Same with Rudy Gay
Would way rather have patty and rudy Gay but Melo will suffice.
Announce Rudy gay to Brooklyn cowards
PLEASE WE NEED RUDY GAY AND KING PATTY MILLS
The Hield trade is just such a long shot. I don’t think Schroeder or the Kings want to do the Lakers any favors.  You are expecting one of Patty Mills or Rudy Gay to take a vet min when there are teams offering them the MLE at least?  You might get DeMar for the MLE. That one is actually reasonable.
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
Party is not taking vet min. He's still good for another decent contract. Rudy Gay though might join Lakers on something cheap like that.
"Why do people insist on proclaiming the Lakers a finished product when most of their big free agency moves still have yet to be decided on? Maybe this is the finished roster or maybe by this time tomorrow they have Buddy Hield, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills and THT added to the team, or maybe DeRozan signs for the MLE. It's literally a huge incomplete for much of their roster right now.   We should at the very least wait until 24 hours into free agency have passed before making judgements about teams. Things are going to change wildly for a lot of teams tomorrow and over the next week. Free agency didn't end when everyone went to bed on the first day.  This would be like saying the Clippers look awful because right now Kawhi and Reggie Jackson are gone. Let's wait and see what happens before passing judgment on anyone."
"God could you imagine?  Allstar Youngbrook, Scoring Champ Melo, 280 lbs Lebron, DPOY Gasol, Laker Dwight (lol), rookie AD, Not this guy Rudy Gay, and bunch of solid players off the bench"
"Dude, yes. The problem for me is actually seeing the other 2 starters. Kent bazemore, Rudy gay, Trevor ariza.. None of those guys are starting caliber players anymore. Bazemore may be younger but I've never ever been impressed with his game."
I predict we start wheoever the MLE goes to (maybe Rudy Gay?)
"I'd be pretty stunned if they ended up with Mills, not sure why he is even being mentioned when he's going to have many offers over the mini-midlevel. Rudy Gay as well seems like a reach but less than one."
"Agreed unfortunately there’s basically no chance of that now. Seems like the Lakers FO wants to avoid the tax as much as possible.   Gasol AD Bron Bazemore Russ   Would be my guess for the starters on opening day. If they can also sign Mills, Wes Matthews, and Melo (tho Rudy gay would be so much better) I think they have a pretty good shot to win the title."
"Warriors has space for 3 players or 4 at-most, thier targets pretty much have been batum, patry mills, milisap, rudy gay and to an extent iggy. So far except batum all players are available. Bazemore was a backup plan anyways, with OPJ signing bazemore is expendable"
"This is the exactly correct analysis. Oh btw, KCP’s role has already been replaced by Kent Bazemore and Trevor Ariza. They could still sign a patty mills or Rudy gay."
"Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gay, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard  Early 2010's cheat code, and then AD came not long after, with Ariza and Marc Gasol off the bench too."
Artest/rondo/Seth/Rudy gay
"brooklyn was favored few hours ago, not it all depends on patty mills and rudy gay"
aight but whats Rudy Gay up to
If they some how get Danny Green and Rudy Gay  re-sign Markieff and THT and they’re set. Maybe take a run on Otto Porter.
"T-Mac to Tom Haberstroh : ""Say it. Say you'll take Rudy Gay over Kobe in the clutch""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGk8Mqt26iY"
I’m thinking it’s going to be Rudy Gay. We need 1 more wing. Otto Porter would be a great fit theoretically but injuries

Give me Rudy Gay instead
When I was in third grade I thought yall would sign rudy gay
Rudy Gay?
Someone call Rudy Gay
Mills and Rudy gay better be coming for losing AC
thats not rudy gay
"They weren't going to stick LBJ w/ a ballhandler of Wright's stature. Westbrook is far from ideal, but he definitely takes a ton of pressure off Lebron, which at his age, he needs. Lakers are in salary hell anyways, if they somehow pull off some combination of Patty Mills, Otto Porter Jr, rudy gay Malik Monk, etc, this could work well, but right now I would bet this is going to be a mess. Lakers shouldve trusted what they had was enough w/ minor tweaks, injuries contributed more to their downfall than anything (w/ shooting probably 2nd &amp; they sure haven't addressed that yet)."
Rudy Gay
"Sad warrior noises. We didn’t have many options anyway, every target was a long shot. Maybe Rudy gay…"
Rudy Gay and Patty Mills about to make the Nets Lakers finals even more spicy. Let’s see how they land between the two.
Rudy Gay?
rather have rudy gay take his role/position
Get Rudy Gay and I think yall got a squad.
Avery Bradley or Rudy Gay
They definitely need rudy gay or green or someone to start
If they can get Rudy Gay and Patty Mills it’ll be a  very solid  first day
I see they couldn't land Rudy Gay
I though Rudy Gay was a good 3pt shooter
"Sure, but that's because the Lakers won't be able to offer them more. If like Caruso decides to sign a 3 year deal for $3 million per year ""just cause he wants to stay with the Lakers"" I'd tell him he needs to fire his agent too, cause they can give him more and still keep him. Someone like Rudy Gay taking less to go ring chasing is one thing, but Payne literally could have got more money *and* stayed with the Suns. He needs to fire his agent."
"Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, Wes Matthews, Jr Smith, Isaiah Thomas, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay and Darren Collison"
yeah I am not too confident about Porter tbh. But I did not know that about Rudy Gay. I was checking his DBPM and his DRtg and they were both not great.
"They also getting rudy gay, and demar. At this point it’s just a raptors reunion"
"One time I saw Rudy Gay at Top Golf and my friend yelled ""Rudy!!"" as he walked by and Rudy gave him the biggest eat shit look I've ever seen."
"&gt;they had depth and team chemistry   You clearly didn’t watch the lakers. Depth was the one thing they lacked in 2020, in particular wing depth and point guard depth, one of the biggest talking point of the season was the lakers don’t really have the depth to win it all. It’s why everyone trashed the 2020 lakers off season.   Also Westbrook is one of the best chemistry players in the league. Every single team sings his praises and loves what he brings to the locker room. Chemistry will not be an issue this year.    &gt;rondo came off the bench so the lakers could have spacing   The lakers were also starting javale. Not exactly an elite floor spacer huh?   Also rondo couldn’t score, rebound, or run in transition as well as Westbrook. Westrbook has flaws but he is far superior than 2020 rondo and capable of scoring 20+ a game. Something the lakers desperately need.    &gt;how the hell do the lakers find spacing and defense   Patty mills. Rudy gay. Otto porter jr. melo. Dwight. All dudes at the top of my head reportedly looking to take a vet min or the mle to join the lakers. Finding shooters who can hit open corner threes is not that hard. Getting the third star made the lakers a far more appealing free agent destination by all reports. There are tons of shooters on the market and the lakers can still sign and trade schoder for someone. Why write off the team before it even built?   Spacing is just the new casual buzz word. The 2020 lakers and 2021 bucks were hardly spacing juggernauts. It turns out there’s more ways to score than just chucking up three pointers and praying you hit enough by law of averages."
"Is it me, or is every single rumor being re posted 3-8 times ? Between this and Rudy gay I’ve read the same thing way too many times"
I agree the floor would be not getting a rookie extension at all as a top 5 pick.  Green is intriguing though he played in the G-League and played extremely well for an 18 year old against much tougher competition than the NCAA.  He is probably more ready for the league than other 1 and done players his age.    I think a more realistic floor is probably more like a Rudy Gay type scorer and his ceiling could be as high as leading the league in scoring.
There’s already a list of free agents very interested in taking discounts to join the lakers now. Westrbook puts them over the top as a free agent destination by all reports. Rudy gay/melo/party mills are all solid gets who are reportedly interested
Rudy Gay needs to stop fumbling this bag and come to the Nuggets.   We have a rainbow jersey.  Mans would be the top-selling jersey of all time.
They got rid of 3 dudes who don’t produce in the playoffs and also gained a lot of interest from free agents. Rudy gay is an upgrade from kuz. Melo/Patty mills and others are also solid vets they can add for cheap
And we shouldn’t be. We need Ellington Patty Mills and Rudy Gay
Did I say that? I said I think the market for him be less than what people in this thread think. He will command more than an MLE but I don’t think he will get a long term deal.   DeMar is like this generations Rudy Gay. He’s thought of vastly differently by NBA people and basketball fans in my opinion.
" The Los Angeles Lakers will need to round out their roster following the agreed-upon trade for superstar Russell Westbrook.  It appears San Antonio Spurs forward Rudy Gay is leaning towards joining the Lakers.  “Gay is thought to be leaning toward the Los Angeles Lakers,” wrote Tony Jones of The Athletic"
"Fuck Yes. FUCKIN RUDY GAY, MAN!"
"Next years Heat Roster will include:  Lowry, DeRozan, Danny Green, Nic Batum, Rudy Gay, Harrison Barnes, and Kelly Oubre."
"Man Spurs really should have traded Rudy Gay, Mills and Derozan in regular season. Atleast they should trade one or two."
"Melo is 37, is a career 35% from 3, and is an absolute liability on defense.   Otto Porter is aggressively mediocre (I know more than most) and hasn't played more than 50 games in a season since he was a Wizard, and his defense is overrated as fuck.   Rudy Gay is also a career 35% from 3, 34 years old, and hasn't played in more than 70 games in a season since what, 2013-2014? Also has shit defense.   Good luck with all of them. I know I'm taking the Nets 10/10 times."
Uh yeah no I don’t but I know we can get guys like Melo Otto porter and rudy gay who have shot 40% from 3 before
"Batum, jeff green, and rudy gay are all guys i'd really want to play the 4."
Rudy Gay
"Batum or Bullock on the mini-MLE is my #1 realistic wish.  I'd prefer we pass on guys like Oladipo, Mcgee and Iggy and instead look at Rudy Gay, Dwight, Jeff Green and perhaps even Melo. OPJ is also a name that would be decent as long as he can stay healthy."
"From what I’ve seen from the million+ players linked to us. Here’s what I think.  Dennis will be hard to move I’d love to try to expand to get Hield sense it seems the Kings are down to ship him out but ain’t no one wants Dennis.  As far as free agency, Rudy Gay for the mid, Melo, Dwight, and like 2 pure shooters just to get some offense. Than being back Caruso and THT.   This team will be very hefty in tax money but IMO this is best case scenario."
Lol I remember there was a joke years ago about Jaylen Brown being flat top Jeff Green and Jayson Tatum being light skin Rudy Gay
This is DeMar and Rudy gay all over again
Rudy Gay would be fantastic we're light on actual 4s.
rudy gay still in the league??
"1. It hasn’t died completely yet. I admit it’s not probable but still definitely possible. Tomorrow when free agency opens, they are legally allowed to add Schroder to the deal, he signs and trades to Washington where they keep KCP and the pick, Kuzma and Harrell go along with the two second round picks from Washington to Sacramento, Lakers get Westbrook and Buddy. Kuzma and Harrell were already linked to Buddy, they get 2 second rounders in addition so it’s something they would want. Wizards have already admitted they are shopping those two and they want to keep KCP. They need a point guard as well after losing Westbrook. Everything actually does make sense, and there’s a lot of talk around the league about they’re already being a deal in place before the Westbrook trade was announced, but they need to make it look like there wasn’t, so what happened to the Bucks last year doesn’t happen to them. Definitely a conspiracy but it makes sense so once tomorrow passes we shall see, but like I said unlikely, but not dead like you said.  2. I doubt Batum stays, I’m honestly expecting him to go to the Warriors and not the Lakers but it’s still a possibility. But if he doesn’t come, maybe someone like Otto Porter Jr., Rudy Gay, Danny Green, someone like that would replace him at the 3&amp;D spot for the MMLE.  3. I can’t agree about Bradley, still think he is a great defender and can hit a shot, but if not him, maybe replace them with another three point shooter like Matthews.   So Westbrook | Matthews | Gay | LeBron | AD"
Rudy Gay and Carmelo I can see it already
Doesn’t iggy suck now? I want Rudy gay on the lakers.
"Report: Lakers also have ‘strong interest’ in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Statue of Liberty."
Awww man no Rudy Gay on the list anymore?
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
"is batum like a let’s not even try going after him he’s going back to the clippers type deal? cause him next to bron and AD would be amazing   jeff green is good if he can shoot, dwight as a backup C is nice, carmelo i’d avoid.. rudy gay would be good, avery as well"
"Rudy Gay would be such a good fit for the Lakers, it's crazy."
How's your depth at the 4 right now? Is it just Keldon and Samanic? (Assuming Rudy Gay leaves)
If Rudy gay wants to forgo salary to join the Warriors in pursuit of a title I am not against it.
Ellington rudy gay ariza and you win the chip
If you put Melo on the bench and put Rudy Gay as a starter then they'd be unbeatable
"It's not the Lakers who leak this stuff, it's the agents of the players. It helps create leverage for them in contract negotiations if teams think it's a real possibility that they could miss out on DeRozan, so it encourages them to offer more money.   The Lakers don't gain anything from always being linked in this shit. DeRozan is using this ""he's from LA, he is willing to take a discount to win a ring with his hometown team"" angle to just make other teams afraid that he'll actually do it. But nobody actually takes discounts like that. If someone else makes DeRozan a big offer, he'll take it.   Melo and Rudy Gay might go to the Lakers, cause they probably won't get huge offers. But DeRozan is almost certainly not joining the Lakers."
Rudy Gay still plays
As of right now it’ll be WB THT Wes Lebron AD. We prob get Rudy gay and melo. Then it’ll be WB Wes Gay Lebron AD. With Caruso THT Melo rookie Marc coming off the bench. Rookie and Marc move out of the line up for the playoffs.
Noooooo NOT RUDY GAY NOT THAT GUY!!!!
Wouldn't hate it but if it comes down to Melo or Rudy Gay give me Rudy every time.
TIL Rudy Gay still plays basketball
That's kinda Rudy and Gay
Fucking rudy GAY man
Rudy Gay I think was already on our list we were looking at. Could work
Rudy Gay instead plz
"What pay cut for Melo? I think he's been making literally the least he could make as a veteran.  Rudy Gay is at the vet minimum level of his career. It would be a big pay cut from what he made last season, but not a big cut for next season and beyond.  DeRozan? He would be taking a big cut. Just depends if he wants to win or not, ultimately. I'm never mad at a player taking the money. However, LA could turn around and then sign him to a much bigger one or two year deal after the season. Plus, that LeBron fella knows people who knows people. A couple $3 mill TV/movie roles where he says half a sentence makes up for the lost player contract money."
Rudy Gay just released merch that says “22” “San Antonio World Tour” so that little lie from Fischer is already squashed lol
"He’s also got Derozen, Rudy Gay, and Carmelo locked in a basement until they sign with the Lakers for the minimum."
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""Gay Love Sessions Favors Lebron."""
Even Rudy Gay isn't exactly washed IMO. Hes a good bench vet now.
"I just don't see the problem. Every team wants to build the best possible team. Also, whether or not this team is a super team is entirely dependent on how you view Russ. Old Melo, Rudy Gay, and DeRozan don't make this a super team at all lmao."
"lol, it always sounds like he didnt even know rudy gay was in the building until that play."
RUDY GAY NEEDS TO STOP FUCKING AROUND AND COME TO THE NUGGETS.  RUDY GAY + RAINBOW JERSEY = #1 SELLING JERSEY
Rudy gay is pretty much sought after by every contender at this point
Bring Rudy to GSW with a healthy Thompson curry and gay would be unstoppable.
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""LeBron Favors Gay Love Sessions."""
"Wait what? I mean I totally buy Rudy Gay and Carmelo on vet min, but DeRozan is gonna take the MLE instead of 75/3 he could get from another team? If that's somehow true, the players' union is gonna have a word with him."
"With Russ and Rudy ""Not this guy"" Gay,"
"Rudy Gay, not this guy!"
Rudy Gay would be the best option for them out of that group
Rudy Gay still in the league?
Rudy Gay has done more for the spurs than Demar Derozan
"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Melo shot 40% from 3 last year and Rudy Gay shot 38%…the two biggest names linked to the Lakers currently. And that was just off the top of my head lol"
Lol it’s funny how that moment is forever linked to Rudy Gay.  Next 30 for 30 episode for sure.
Wouldn’t even hate Debo or Melo for joining.  These two are the most deserving of a Chip.    PS why do they keep putting Rudy Gay name to this list.  Did he become Memphis Rudy Gay again or did I miss something ?
Rudy Gay is still playing?
[Rudy Gay killed Boromir](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lGJhj2IE8i4)
Melo and fucking rudy gay maan..
they need rudy gay if they expect someone to play defense
"so a whole squad of aging guys with tons of miles on their bodies? Rudy Gay is 34 (will be 35 in 3 weeks), cant really play d and has historically been an inconsistent 3 point shooter.  Carmelo Anthony is....Carmelo Anthony, a 37 year old that isnt known for his defense, with a ton of miles on his body, that has been an average 3 point shooter.   Derozan is going to be the young guy out of this bunch at 31 (32 in a week or so), who has tons of miles on his body, and has never been known as a defender or 3 point shooter.   But Im sure it'll work out. Especially with a 37 year old Lebron, a historically injury prone PF, and a 36 year old Marc Gasol as your starting center. Westbrook will be able to corral these guys together at pg with his great 3 point shooting, right?  Im not trolling when I say this, are Lakers even going to make the playoffs? Jesus"
[DEFENSE! NOOO ITS RUDY GAY! NOOO!! NO!!!! NOT THIS GUY!!!](https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg?t=20)
DeMar isn't signing for the vet min/mini mid-level Rudy gay would be an awesome signing for them though as a Spurs fan.
It’s a different MLE now that they are above the tax apron (if I recall correctly). It’s only 5.9m now. Definitely more see Rudy Gay in that salary than DeRozan
Rudy Gay and Carmelo I can see joining. But I reckon that Derozan ship has sailed...
"Rudy Gay, stay in Texas bby"
Rudy gay would be pretty great for them tbh
#RUDY GAY
Patty Mills and Rudy Gay. Hope we bring back Fournier too
Patty Mills or Rudy Gay would be nice for the Nets
"How many true 3 and D players are there in the league though? Klay, KCP, Danny Green, PJ, Rudy Gay are decent examples I guess. Then you have good shooters who are shitty defenders like Robinson and Bertans. It's pretty rare to find both for any team"
The hobbits couldn't play good enough defense to keep him from killing Boromir. Fucking Rudy Gay man.  https://youtu.be/lGJhj2IE8i4
"I can't remember if the Lowry thing was just rumors. I don't remember the return either so i won't comment on that but i don't remember it being bad. I also remember Lowry not being the all star and engine of the team that he is now back then. It's pretty normal for a GM to come in and blow it up when the team isn't good enough. If you remember, we just got pretty lucky when the Rudy Gay traded happened that the team started playing well after he left. Otherwise it was going to be a full rebuild.   ""Masai let PJ Tucker walk"" - OR PJ tucker wanted to go play in Houston??? I don't know why people blame GM's for losing players that obviously want to leave.   DeMarre Carroll in hindsight is a bad signing because he's a shithead.  but at the time it was decent.   Nothing Masai has done except drafting Bruno screamed bad move when he did it. And even then, the Bruno pick is whatever. He gambled on a high potential player but nobody in mock drafts supposed to go at that pick panned out either."
Rudy Gay would be a nice veteran pick up.
CARMELO ANTHONY and RUDY GAY
Yeah I def think they should have kept Rudy as a dynamic wing but having him playing a star player type role was wrong. When he got to Sacramento and took the sidekick role to Boogie he was playing the best basketball of his career. 2015(?) Rudy gay on Memphis would’ve been a championship team imo.
I like the sound of Rudy Gay as a laker
Rudy Gay is nasty in 2K
"In 2k12 MyCareer, the Knicks traded Carmelo for Rudy Gay once I got drafted. Sucked. I love them both though."
"Rudy gay, Dwight, Reddick, Melo, Iggy,  Cousins, Mathews, Green, Oubre, Otto. doesn't sound that bad to me"
I’d love for us to get Rudy Gay. I used to kill people on 2k with him lol he’s still solid
Rudy gay would be good
"I'm so bitter about Rudy Gay. As a zach Randolph fan.  Memphis had every chance to have multiple great runs and they kept running their offense as Rudy as the focal point,  when it should have been zbo the whole time.  It wasnt until he sat for and they gave zbo the keys that they made their deepest run.  At least conley is having success on his team again.  After CP3, I think he is the only other textbook PG and hes criminally underrated"
If they have to pay Rudy Gay they will have the water boy playing SG
why is Rudy Gay?
Let’s wait and see if they get a player back for Schroder. And then Rudy Gay and a number of ring chasers are on the way.
"Fuckin' Rudy Gay, man."
RUDY FUCKING GAY MAN!
Read this headline as Rudy Gobert and read way too many comments in search of the math making sense. Rudy Gay does make a lot of sense.
"I always felt bad for Rudy Gay because the Raptors success followed immediately after he got traded. I think I even saw an interview where he said he has to reflect because it feels like teams improve after they get rid of him. Really made me root for the guy, so if the Lakers pick him up I'm definitely going to be hoping they at least make the finals."
"[Every time I hear ""Rudy Gay"" and ""loud"" in the same sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg&amp;ab_channel=IhabBanayoti)"
[Did someone say Rudy Gay? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg)
Rudy FUCKING Gay!
Rudy Gay for the MLE would be a good get
"Reminds me of the Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Luther Head, Ramon Sessions dream team that we never got to see."
"Lakers are going to land Danny Green, Otto Porter, Rudy Gay, Melo, and Dwight."
&gt;I was just a transient Rudy Gay fan.  Quite a corner.  Not even a ride or die Rudy Gay fan--he just tickled yer pickle during his early prime?
I can see Howard coming back for sure. Be nice to get Ariza and JJ maybe sign Rudy gay with the mini MLE. Will be interesting who we can get to fill out the roster
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
I'd love it if Dwight came back. I too hope the Lakers use that money on a wing. Maybe Rudy Gay?
Cauley Stein and Georgios Papagiannis. So glad I was just a transient Rudy Gay fan. I couldn’t stand Sacramento. Sorry kings fans.
Rudy Gay has been mentioned.
"&gt;They just gave up their depth and now have no cap space.  &gt;They’re gonna have to convince guys to take minimums to join which I mean, good for them if they do.  Still are going to bring back THT and Caruso, sign and trade Dennis, still have the MLE, and vet mins don't count against cap space. It was reported days ago that the Lakers had vets lined up should they pick up a 3rd star, which they did. Can expect melo, possibly Rudy gay, Dwight, and many other ring chasers to be coming out of the wood work to want to play for this team. Lebron's teams have always attracted older, still viable, former stars, the Lakers will have absolutely no problem getting people to play for this team"
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"I don’t disagree but I don’t think this draft was a sign of that lol.   Whoever we drafted we more than likely going to be a role player (at best) behind guys we’ve already committed to for a few years like Drew, Dejounte, Derrick, Devin, Jakob and Luka. whoever we drafted today wasn’t going to change our outlook too much. Now if we don’t take advantage of our cap space and sign somewhat decent talent this summer and instead sign someone like Rudy Gay level of talent to a 15M contract again I will be inclined to believe in you more lol."
"Ummm why didn't they just trade back???  The Knicks would have given them 19 and 21!!!!  And Primo is DEFINITELY there at 19  WTH the Spurs are fucked I don't think they win 30 games next season in West  They are losing DeRozan \[lead scorer\], super underrated Patty Mills AND Rudy Gay who has balls and hits shots.   Spurs are FUCKED"
i straight up forgot rudy gay was still in the nba
They should go for Rudy Gay too
