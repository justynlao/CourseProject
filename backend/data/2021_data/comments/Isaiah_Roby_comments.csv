Isaiah Roby
Isaiah Roby
You saying you don't recognize isaiah roby?
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"OKC is pretty easy - SGA, Dort, Bazley, Poku, Maledon, Hill (until he’s traded) and Horford (also until he’s traded)  Next two would probably be Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby if Horford/Hill are traded and no one comes back worth protecting... and we know Presti would trade those two immediately in those circumstances"
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that’s not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I’m perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can’t let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It’s early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that’s completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala’s three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don’t want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that’s just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn’t really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
"The guy on the Thunder trying to score, Isaiah Roby, played for the a town near mine in highschool. We played them my last 2 years and he dunked on my prolly 6 times in that span."
If we're talking 2nd rounders who look good: Isaiah Roby.
Isaiah Roby looks like Lil Mosey lmao
I'm pretty sure Isaiah Roby was drawn by Akira Toriyama.
Isaiah Roby
Poor man’s Isaiah Roby
Thunder:  SGA  Hordford  Dort  Kenny Hustle  Mike Muscala  Darius Bazley  Moses Brown  Isaiah Roby  Theo Meldeon   Why TF can't we tank. Lol.

I knew everyone out of the draft or from the Pelicans except Isaiah Roby or Moses Brown. I heard about Moses Brown on a podcast where Hollinger was talking about the best G-League guys but I've never heard of Isaiah Roby in my life.
Personally I've never heard of Isaiah roby or Darius miller either. Heard of everyone else though
"Spooky for beating a team starting poku, maledon, and Isaiah roby.  Lol"

"I just looked up Isaiah Roby to see if he is related to Richard Roby, former Colorado basketball player. They’re not related, but it turns out Richard Roby is half-brothers with Kenyon Martin Sr. TIL."
"Did they ever say anything about ""accidentally winning""? You can call it blatant tanking all you want, but OKC has made it clear to the league that the organization AND the player agreed that he would sit down because of ""player development"".  We have been playing Moses Brown, Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby, who are the young players that we gave a chance. What is the league supposed to do? Force a player to half ass games instead of letting the young guys have minutes?"
"i mean, yeah, if you're creating fast-break opportunities for Isaiah Roby and Charlie Brown maybe it doesn't matter"
"Does he project to be more of a 3 or 4 at this point? Is there any hope of a frontcourt of him, Poku and Moses Brown?  Also can someone give me a rundown on Isaiah Roby? Thanks."
"Yes, because it was a mutual agreement between him and the organization.   What’s the point of playing Horford when he’s not part of the future when we can play Moses Brown (who was a big part of our G League team), Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby (who earned minutes this season)?   If the NBA wants us to suddenly win, it’s easy, just give us the first and fifth pick."
Isaiah Roby had something like a -50 earlier this season.
"They didn't want to pay Harden in hindsight one of the biggest mistakes in NBA trade history. That aside the Front Office have made great moves. If Beverley hadn't injured Westbrook there more than likely could have had a championship. They got burned by KD and learnt from it, trading PG, Westbrook, CP3 for great returns as well as the role players Adams and Grant. Those players that you name have passed through at different stages, I think the way the Thunder handled the transition from Westbrook in particular who was a cornerstone of the franchise was really well done. Both sides were in agreement, Westbrook was keen to re-unite with Harden and the Thunder were eyeing up a rebuild. When Shai was traded for PG we had a new face for the franchise. I think the fan base is excited for our young guys with an eye to the draft. We have got Dort if course and now the euro sensations Poku and his fanny pack and Maledon. Throw in some good energy bench guys like Kenrich Williams, Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby and the future is looking bright."
"How many more healthy people can the Thunder sit? They've practically got a starting caliber team and 6th man warming for fuckin Charlie Brown, Roby and Maledon.   Isaiah Thomas should try out for the Thunder because they'll start just about anybody at this point to tank"
Isaiah Roby = Lil Mosey
"In the salary cap era you really just can't expect to beat a team able to convince Ty Jerome, Darius Bazley, and Luguentz Dort to join one big superteam, and STILL have salary left over for Isaiah Roby. That's just unfair."
What a beast. Dude locked up Isaiah Roby and Darius Bazley 🔥

"how about Porzingis, Brunson, and Josh Green to OKC for Al Horford, 2022 FRP, 2023 2nd, Pokusevski, &amp; Isaiah Roby? Or another scenario where you send him to IND along with J-Rich, Tyrell Terry a 1st and Brunson for Brogdon and Turner?"
"I think the biggest thing with the Sixers is that they handed over the reins to a bunch of guys to play huge minutes and lead their offense, who were not only unqualified to do so, but what’s worse is that they had no intentions of having those guys as future pieces of the franchise. Look at the dozens of guys who littered through the Process Sixers.  But this year I think the Thunder did well to give a lot of opportunities to guys they actually envision as part of their future. Or at a minimum they found out of guys deserve more time. Guys like Maleson, Bazley, etc. earned/were gifted huge minutes this year because of OKC’s situation. I think both of those guys will be on the team in 2-3 years.   ***  In contrast you have the **2013-14 Sixers** - their top 5 minutes leaders were:    - Thad Young (not with PHI following year)   - MCW (in season trade following year)   - James Anderson (not with PHI following year)   - Evan Turner (traded mid season that year)   - Tony Wroten (played 38 more games for PHI after 2014 season)  **2014-15 Sixers**  Top 5 minutes leaders    - Nerlens (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15)   - RoCo (finally someone they developed and held onto long term)    - Mbah a Moute (gone at end of season - why did they play a 28 year old vet 29 mpg to score &lt; 10 PPG on &lt; 40% FG)   - Hollis Thompson (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15, but this is exactly the type of young player they should’ve been playing, not known value vets like Luc)   - Henry Sims (gone at end of season)  **2015-16 Sixers**  Top 5 Minutes leaders    - Hollis Thompson (lead team in minutes, but then only played 31 games for them the next year)   - Jerami Grant (played 2 games for PHI following year)   - Isaiah Canaan (didn’t play with PHI following season - but even though he wasn’t in their future plans they had no problem letting him score 11 PPG on 36% FG)   - Nerlens    - RoCo  ***  Obviously, you never know what’s gonna happen, but this year the following were the top 5 minute-getters for OKC:   - Maledon (OKC acquired him in Horford deal and promptly signed him to a 3 year deal with a 4th year team option - ie they invested in his future)   - Bazley (used first round pick on him)   - Dort (signed through 2022-23 with OKC)   - Kenrich Williams (acquired via S&amp;T, signed through 2022-23)   - Isaiah Roby  With SGA and Poku rounding out the top 7.  Did sitting Horford make them less competitive? Of course. But let’s say, even if they didn’t have their own draft pick, sitting Horford still would’ve been the correct decision because realistically he is not a part of their future."
“How do we let Isaiah Roby get his?”
So…  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don’t grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don’t think they will?
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"I think out of our roster the tradeable guys that teams would actually want are probably Bazley, Maledon, Ty Jerome, Kenrich Williams and maybe Isaiah Roby  Would be fine with any of those for Lauri tbh"
"The Thunder can fix some of those issues. Kemba Walker, Isaiah Roby, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams and the Houston picks for Simmons. Jerome shot 43% on 5.3 3PA last season, some of those were pretty deep and he's a legit backup point guard. Kenny Hustle is a do it all forward who also shot above 40% from outside last season, he also has a wet mid-ranger. Roby is another decent 4/smallball 5 who can score inside and pass the ball. Isaiah's not perfect but dude is tough. With those three players, Philly fills out their bench with decent, productive contributors on cheap contracts. Kemba is another effective outside shooter who can provide perimeter creation. It is breaking a dollar into quarters but Philly get better as a team with this move."
If you live in North OKC/Edmond and don’t live under a rock you’ll see guys all of the time. I’ve seen Michael Cage and Isaiah Roby out in the past few weeks for example.   My favorite Thunder player story: Kendrick Perkins was ahead of me in line at a burrito place and paid for everyone’s food behind him. He has some hot takes nowadays but he’s a solid dude.   OKC is weird. Sometimes it feels like a mini Dallas with just enough traffic and sprawl to become irritating. Other times it feels like the world’s biggest small town where you’re constantly running into people.
"Starting should be:  Giddey (if healthy)  SGA  Dort  Bazley  Favors  Bench: Theo Maledon, Kenrich Williams, Isaiah Roby, Mike Moose Muscala, Poku (probably be starting by season's end)"
"Nice high effort post!   I'd probably move Wiseman to 30th and Birch to 27th, but everything else I think is pretty much 100%. There are so many players, so who knows how the upcoming season will look.  Only things I would disagree with would be putting Wiseman that high, he was one of the biggest overall negatives for a starter in the league and he tore his meniscus. And put Khem Birch that low, he's a bit small and he's more of a bench player but Isaiah Stewart and Isaiah Roby are both pretty raw."
Isaiah “Hakeem” Roby
"&gt; Powell might just be our best big lol  Which is sad. So many fans don't realize this but Powell is arguably the worst starting Center in the NBA right now. The only other team that rivals the Mavs for worst starting center is OKC with Isaiah Roby. If you think of another one go ahead and mention it, Ill be waiting."
Isaiah Roby is a starting center for a NBA team
Send him to the Thunder for Isaiah Roby and 15 2nds
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
Isaiah Roby for a pick who says no
