Yurtseven and Marcus Garrett
Anyone watching this Lakers/Kings summer league game? It’s been fun watching it the past few days. Marcus Garrett is gonna be a beast on defense for Miami soon.
"Really? I don’t think we need wing depth, we just need one more wing.  Lowry | Dipo Duncan | Herro Butler | Strus for now, also KZ is available PJ | Keef Bam | Dedmon  We don’t need depth, just one more would be enough to complete the puzzle. I’m worried about the Gabe Vincent minutes till Dipo comes back more than anything lol. Marcus Garrett could also be used"
fuck yeah marcus garrett was great at KU
"If it was preceded by Bam, Tyler, and Duncan continuously not putting in the effort needed to win, so much so that he took Caleb Martin, KZ Okpala, Omer Yurtseven, and Marcus Garrett in practice and bodied the shit out of the aforementioned starting players, and then those players didn't have an ""aw shit he's right we gotta be better"" moment but just doubled down and got defensive and called him a locker room cancer?  I would then say ""Damn Jimmy deserves better"".  Thankfully I don't have to worry about any of that in Miami as they all feel the same way as him and care more about winning than their fragile egos."
No Gabe is on the permanent roster this season and so is Martin. Our two way player is the rookie Marcus Garrett
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
