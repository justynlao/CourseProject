"Firmly in the spooky category but they actually have a chance at success unlike say, the Pelicans.  I think they're a great wing player away though. They have a TON of guard depth and they're slotting some of the bigger 2-guards at the 3 to get minutes (i.e. Desmond Bane, John Konchar) - I'd look to cash in on a couple of those guys if someone interesting becomes available."
Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
"The one left out, John ‚ÄúJitty‚Äù Konchar, had some absurd highlights while the game was still at stake too. He had an absolutely beautiful block, a feisty dunk, and he basically only produces good minutes when he gets the chance.  The Grizz are playing really good team basketball, as expected by a team coached by a Pop/Bud acolyte who actually knows what he‚Äôs doing. The bench is the most devastating part though, Ja aside. There are so many crazy dangerous dudes on that bench, and they work so cohesively, not to mention the guys like Justise Winslow, Jontay Porter, and Killian Tillie, who haven‚Äôt played a minute for the team yet. Obviously Justise is a bigger deal than the other two, who were UDFA darlings, and the idea of Justise Winslow fits so well with what the Grizzlies are trying to do. Anything positive this year is gravy, and there‚Äôs so much to like about the future potential of this squad that didn‚Äôt stockpile picks or spend half a decade tanking to get here"
And the player who didn't get double digits was john konchar. His game is to do all the little things that don't show up in the box score. And he played great tonight with his minutes
John Konchar 5x
"Nine of only ten available, and the tenth was John Konchar, who was excellent otherwise"
John konchar locking up Michael Jordan would be a sight
"Jitty, john konchar of the grizzlies"
"John Konchar, all 10 spots"
John Konchar at all 5 spots
Sorry but John Konchar is back. U bois r d00med
"Ah yes, in comes the Laker killer John Konchar"
Meanwhile Memphis has these 2 four-year college guys in Desmond Bane and John Konchar who look great. Something to be said about playing for 4 years against bigger bodies
Yeah they‚Äôre getting waxed by some dude named John Konchar lmao
"Grizzlies payroll in general is pretty good. Next year, they should have around $10 million in cap space, and the only player on an expiring deal is Gorgui Dieng. In 2022/23, they'll have Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, Melton, Brandon Clarke, John Konchar, Desmond Bane, Jontay Porter, and Xavier Tillman signed. For a combined $45 million.   A lot of that unused cap space will probably be used to re-sign dudes like JJJ, Winslow, Tyus Jones, etc. But I feel like that's a pretty good group of players to have for relatively cheap."
The suns had to dump Josh Jackson because nobody wanted him and the Grizzlies let him walk because they wanted to sign John Konchar.  If i'm the pistons I would just hold him and let him play. Might turn good.
"It was pretty shocking how well the Grizzlies bench consisting of Tyus Jones, three rookies all drafted 30 or later (one of whom is an UDFA on a two-way), and John ‚ÄòJitty‚Äô Konchar, who himself is only a sophomore and last year was another UDFA rookie on a two-way, managed to play. The Grizzlies FO has done a good job of identifying hoopers to provide depth, but enough cannot be said of how well Taylor Jenkins has gotten the Grizzlies to jell regardless of personnel, which has been good enough to be a play-in team in the West haha"
He was being whooped by John Konchar and Killian Tillie at times
But have you heard about our Lord and saviour John Konchar?
"I really liked Killian Tillie and Johntay Porter pre draft, I haven‚Äôt seen them much this year. Then John Konchar (sp?) is really great for them too. They are super deep"
"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."
KP - Kristaps Porzingis   KCP - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   CP3 - Chris Paul   PG13 - Paul George   People only use the abbreviations for well recognized players on r/nba. Team subs differ. Using something like JK for John Konchar here is ridiculous as not many will recognize it.
How you gonna forget John Konchar like that?
The best player in this series Is the only Chad and Is not John Konchar.
John Konchar is the heart and soul of this team

"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
John Konchar is a Rodmanesque power forward.
John Konchar
"Fun does not equal good. And every team has guys the fanbase delusional-ly likes. Cool. But outside perspective is needed. Which is why I have no shame in saying, again, I had to google who tf is ‚ÄúKonchar‚Äù. Bro he‚Äôs a 25 year old player who just averaged 4 points a game like what are we talking about here lol Every team has a Konchar. You don‚Äôt trade guys to make room for *John Konchar* and Deanthony Melton. Those dudes project to career backups thats if they‚Äôre even in the league in a year or so.   If anything you trade for another position. If you‚Äôre  log-jammed at guard, trade for a forward.  Lol @ Memphis having to trade players bc they‚Äôre too talented üòÇ You can‚Äôt underestimate how good Morant is. He‚Äôs lifting them up. Bc pure talent wise that is arguably the worst roster in the west. And they just traded 2 starters for nothing"
"Because of things that are unrelated to this tweet.   I really don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall understand how bad Justice is right now. He‚Äôs a nice dude, but he was by far our worst rotation player, and that includes John Konchar. We lost many games because of our front offices interest in kicking the tires on him."
"surprise surprise, John Konchar does a little bit of everything"
John konchar was an undrafted guy the grizz signed to a 3 year deal and he is the most unassuming yet fluid looking basketball player in pretty much every facet of the game. I think his highlights against the Lakers last season are out there where you can see him outrebound Dwight howard.
John Konchar
"If they have John Konchar on there who was undrafted, where is Kendrick Nunn, who was also an undrafted rookie in 2019? Nunn was NBA Rookie First Team.  Edit: Kendrick went undrafted in the previous NBA season so that's probably why."
And I think John Konchar should be on it too

"It depends how many coaches he has and organizations he plays for in his first contract. Quickest is probably 2 or 3 years. But thats if you are healthy, get decent rotation minutes, and play for the same coach and organization.  John Konchar for the Grizz has an identity. He was an undrafted 10 day pick up. He has played few but consistent big league minutes that have been growing over 3 years. But he began with a lot of playing time in the G League. Those 3 years, he has played in the same system under Coach Jenkins. He knows he likely wont be a starter. Some games he wont play. But when he gets touches, he is trusted to shoot or pass, and players higher on the star totem pole know what they can count on from him."
"That's 12th man, analytics darling, John ""The Magic Conch"" Konchar baby!   https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/6/16/22535538/the-steadiness-of-john-konchar-nba-memphis-grizzlies-player-reviews"
"If [John Konchar](https://i.imgur.com/iEQ7nt6.png) walked past you, there's about a zero percent chance you would assume he's an NBA player."
