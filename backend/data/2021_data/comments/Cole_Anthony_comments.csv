"Lots of their ""scorers"" have been or still are out so that Vucevic and Ross are left as the only consistent offensive threats over like half the games this year. That causes role players like Clark, Ennis and co to be forced into roles to big for them. Also doesn't help that rookie Cole Anthony and Dwayne Bacon are your backcourt duo"
He said Cole Anthony
"this is dumb especially the top right image, i can find 4 pictures of this with teams guarding like cole anthony the same exact way"
Always knew that he had it in him. Probably sound like a broken record but Cole Anthony would have been better off playing with chopsticks in college than his college teammates back then. Really hurt his draft stock
Orlando has no PG aside from Cole Anthony and he‚Äôs still learning. Wont they consider him?
At first glance I thought ‚ÄúSince when does Cole Anthony play for the Suns?‚Äù. This season has brought out a lot of new colors in teams. Blue Bucks really threw me off.
"Quickley, Wiseman, Lamelo, Haliburton, Cole Anthony, Edwards, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, and I guess Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman?"
Lets not forget about that unreal cole anthony putback tho üëÄ
I can't wait to see Cole Anthony on JJ's podcast.
With Aaron Gordon and Cole Anthony why can‚Äôt the magic simply jump over the competition?

Cole Anthony
"2020 was the supposed ""quiet"" draft but it's really produced a ton of great rookies  the top 3 all look solid Tyrese Maxey  Immanuel Quickly  Tyrese Haliburton  Payton Pritchard  That's at least 7 solid NBA players with some of them showing star potential. Then there are still dudes like Cole Anthony, Deni Avidja, Desmond Bane. Like 10 players that might make a career is a pretty good draft. It's definitely no 2018 but the potential still has yet to fully reveal itself."
Wiseman and Halliburton as everyone else is saying. Watch out for Cole Anthony as a dark horse. He‚Äôs gonna get the steady minutes and the opportunity to run the offense - getting noticeably better as the season goes along

Man Cole Anthony can hoop
Cole anthony the guy shooting 45% ts exceeding expectations?
Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I‚Äôll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case

Orlando has had that feel since Dwight left tbh. I‚Äôm hopeful Fultz and Issac come back fully healthy and Cole Anthony progresses though
Green has 3 rings though which should matter. Also I low key think Cole Anthony might pass all of them one day. Dude's a beast already.
"Coby‚Äôs averaging like 15/5/5 this season so far  And Cole Anthony can be pretty good, they‚Äôve put out some decent role players but no high tier guys. Their recruits usually stick around for a bit, I don‚Äôt know if it has to do with Roy Williams or something."

"Cole Anthony is underrated, he has been a nice spark for the Magic"
Cole anthony was my favorite player heading into the draft. Knew we wouldn't get him cause too many guards here already but hey I'm looking forward to what he'll do  Plus he looks damn nice in a magic jersey
I'm excited for Cole Anthony I really think he's going to be good. I really wanted the Raptors to trade up and get him lol.
"Every I see their box score, I'm like Carmelo Anthony had a... Oh no, no, no, Cole it is"
Jared Vanderbilt missed two free throws to set up the game winner for Cole Anthony tonight on Magic legend Nick Anderson's birthday. Nick Anderson is perhaps most famous in NBA circles for missing four straight free throws in Game 1 of the 1995 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets.
"man idk why, but the name cole anthony just makes me think he's a rapper"
Cole Anthony is our backup pg
Cole anthony got a lot of practice with buzzer beaters at UNC last year. looks like he's gotten better at them.
He was legit awesome for us this year.  It was his best season of his career as a complete player.  Still can‚Äôt shoot but look at our teams energy and tell me MCW doesn‚Äôt fix that.  How bout our perimeter defense where Cole Anthony is so bad James Ennis has to guard Russell and get scorched by him.  AG is the only good perimeter defender we have left.  Notice how he was the only guy able to slow Russell down because everyone else sucked.  MCW is even better than Gordon on guards. So yeah we need MCW the problem is he needs shooters to be truly effective and we don‚Äôt have DJ this year to save us.
COLE ANTHONY TOWNS!
Fun game but a bad win.  The most notable takeaway is how bad our three point shooters are and how terrible our passing is outside of Vuc and Gordon.  Great shot Cole Anthony but learn how to throw and entry pass in the post please.  Vuc has great position on numerous occasions but Cole and Bacon and Ennis don‚Äôt know how to pass the ball.  Whatever we take those.
"I thought it was done when Fournier passed out of that 3, but Cole Anthony had ice in his veins!  Kids got a lot of potential, hopefully he develops in Fultz's absence"
Cole anthony looks wild out of place. dude's built like a 4th grader
COLE HINTON ANTHONY
My mental health is long gone Besides I like the Magic I wanna see my boy Cole Anthony play I haven‚Äôt been able to see him play yet
His defense has been awful and he hasn‚Äôt found his stroke from deep yet but he‚Äôs been finding open looks for himself by moving well off ball. A lot of people in the organization have vouched for his shooting ability so I‚Äôm sure he will get better in that regard.   Lewis hasn‚Äôt been impressive and Cole Anthony is a chucker.
"Team: Magic  Rookies: Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke  Cole Anthony has been looking rough. He‚Äôs not very efficient and isn‚Äôt a great defender  As for Chuma Okeke, I haven‚Äôt really seen him play that much so idk"
"Watching Cole Anthony fewhas solidified in my mind that he's an undersized 2 at best, and isn't really going to be a great option running an NBA offense. Markelle has great vision, and even in his poor scoring games operates as a great floor general for someone with so little games played."
I haven‚Äôt watched a ton of magic games but what I have seen cole Anthony is in way over his head.
"it was so confusing...  i turned on the game, saw Cole Anthony, and asked myself ‚Äúwe have a Guard who wears shoulder sleeves?‚Äù"
Devin ‚ÄòCole Anthony‚Äô Booker
Cole Anthony 2 first fucking 12. Nuff said.
Bruh did you see Cole Anthony on Orlando earlier ?!
"Inefficient college guard who isn't a plus passer. That's always a stay away for me. The problem is that he is a plus athlete, so teams were still enticed by him. Without that athleticism he gets drafted around where Cole Anthony went"
Hard to play without a point guard. Cole Anthony cant run an NBA offense
"They seem desperate for a good PG. With both Kelle and MCW missing time, Cole Anthony seems to be the last PG standing, but he is a 20 YO rookie who only even averaged 4 assists in college. It is really hard to win basketball games when you have no actual PGs - just ask the 2018 Suns."
Damn he almost killed Cole Anthony on that one
Cole Anthony just chucking it 2-12?
He wanted Cole Anthony to kiss him
"Terrence Ross and Julius Randle had a nice throw-off, unfortunately for Randle Ross had Cole Anthony on his side"
Cole anthony has no J whatsoever. He ain't J cole!!
Is cole anthony always this bad?
"Gordon, Fultz, Isaac, Cole Anthony and Vuc. Magic got some talent."
Cole Anthony is pretty awful
Cole Anthony has no vision for a point guard
Tier 0- Cole Anthony
"nah, they need to continue building their future, not around vuc lol. build around markelle/isaac/cole anthony/chuma okeke, hope you hit the developmental lottery."

Cole Anthony a bucket
What does Cole Anthony even do lol
Cole Anthony is garbage chucker!
"Probably the Magic for me. Vucevic, Gordon, Mo Bamba, Cole Anthony, Fultz (not anymore technically), and like a bunch is the rest of the roster just Disney characters?"
This game is winnable.  A good coach would start the 4th with Vuc and Cole Anthony on the court and try to win.  Cliff will have them on the bench and we will be down 10 by the time they come back in.  Quote me.
cole anthony is fast af off the dribble
cole anthony sucks
"Bacon... in the oven. lol wtf    magic are frustrating, they like make so many good plays that are almost there but end up blowing up. Cole Anthony seems like a guy who can be really good in a few years"
They will defend Simmons like they defend Cole Anthony. Sixers won't cause Nets big problems
Gee maybe Cole Anthony should come in now and we should be counting our blessings that Jordan Bone didn't lead us to a major deficit.
"Cole Anthony looks good, I've been watching a weird amount of wiz lately, he's the real deal. He's also younger and has a higher ceiling that Pritchard. EZ pick for me, especially since they mocked him as going to the Knicks."
How has Cole Anthony been?
The Nets do not respect Cole Anthony
All that firepower just to stop Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony has not looked lottery worthy
Cole Anthony over Pritchard wtf is NBC doing?
Cole anthony is so fuckin done with this shit lmao

Orlando maybe. Currently our pg rotation is cole Anthony Jordan bone
Cole Anthony gang gang
"maybe you chase off the 3 point line for fournier, but he gets completely [taken out of the play](https://imgur.com/a/AtM7OQQ) by bacon who isn't a great shooter.   bacon wasn't even his rotation, he should have been rotating to cole anthony in the corner. bacon just doesn't see the extra pass to an open fournier or anthony until its too late. if anything this a a dwayne bacon lowlight."

"Big apologies to Fultz, who managed 11. Cole Anthony with 6, and MCW with 6. Jokic is already creeping up on Fournier (12) and Vuc (15).   Last year Fultz had 46, Augustine 22, MCW 18."
"Without checking Google, T Ross, Bacon, Okeke, RJ Hampton, Mo Bamba, James Ennis, Birch, Fultz, Issac, Cole Anthony, MCW. That's all I got."
"Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Michael Carter-Williams are all injured"
"If they picked Cole Anthony or Toppin at 2 everyone would've lost their shit, hindsight is 20/20."
"Fultz, Hampton, Okeke, Isaac with Cole Anthony having the Clarkson-esque green light off the bench seems like a playoff team to me. I think you guys are in a great situation to pick best available as well. Mobley or Suggs could fit into that roster equally well which is a nice situation to have."
"I get overreactionary at times in regards to this especially after a loss but I do truly hate the hero ball playstyle.   You guys have a lot of young talent I like though. Loved Okeke as a prospect and think he‚Äôll be a really good starter at minimum with potential to be all-star caliber. Carter changing teams will do wonders for him, hopefully he can stay on the floor and not have injuries. If Isaac stays healthy he‚Äôs a DPOY finalist at some point, he‚Äôs the closest thing to AK47. Cole Anthony looks way better than I expected. Lots to like about you guys future"
"Dwayne Bacon, Terrance Ross and Cole Anthony hydra really feeling disrespected right now"
As a laker fan I don‚Äôt really have a good reason at all but I went to see Cole Anthony be a beast
[Cole Anthony](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/cole-anthony-stats-as-starter)
Cole Anthony
"The core is pretty clear, and I actually think we‚Äôre in a good spot rebuild wise. There was nothing we could do about having our two best young guys go out for the season, then have just about everyone else get injured as well.  A starting lineup of Fultz, Ross, Isaac, Okeke, WCJ/Bamba isn‚Äôt a world-beater, but it has tons of potential. That‚Äôs without considering two lottery picks this year, Cole Anthony, R.J Hampton, etc.  If we could get a lineup of Fultz, Jalen Green, Isaac, Okeke, WCJ, I really think we could make waves over the next few years. The main difficulty will be health in my eyes, not potential"
"Magic Fans, I know he‚Äôs injured, but how has Cole Anthony been so far? Good promise? So-so?"
Yo where‚Äôs my boy Cole Anthony
"Tier of his own: Luka  Tier 2: Trae, Shai, Ja  Tier 3: Lamelo, Sexton  Tier 4: Haliburton, Lonzo, Garland  Tier 5: KPJ, Quickley, Fultz (pre injury), Coby White,  Need to see a lot more from: THT, Theo Maledon, Cole Anthony, Jordan Poole, Kira Lewis,"
"i thought about it and i felt like Herro really is a 2 Guard, i think some players here will probably spend their careers playing the 2 guard aswell but for now it makes sense to have them on this list (Maledon, Quickley, Kira Lewis, Sexton, Poole, Coby White &amp; Cole Anthony, potentially Haliburton &amp; Lonzo too but these 2 are pretty much well rounded guards that probably aren‚Äôt your no.1 ball handler"
"thing is with THT is he is at his best with the ball in his hands, whereas players like Jordan Poole, Sexton and Coby White are SG‚Äôs in a PG‚Äôs body, arguably cole anthony and Immanuel Quickley too"
Luka  Trae  Shai  LaMelo  Ja  Sexton  Lonzo  Halliburton  KPJ  Garland  Fultz  Maledon  Quickley  Coby White  Cole Anthony  THT  Poole  Kira Lewis Jr
"For me, it goes (in order):  Luka, Ja, Lamelo, Trae , Shai, Lonzo, Kira Lewis, Quickley, Kevin Porter Jr, Coby White, Poole, Fultz, Sexton, Garland, Cole Anthony, Talen Horton Tucker, Haliburton &amp; Theo Maledon"
"He‚Äôs something like the third least efficient rookie that plays more than 6 minutes a game, after Poku and Cole Anthony"
"Not sure what the Nets signings matter to what ive said. I was just pointing out how you're objectively wrong about the Heat's bench.  Tho since you brought it up, these washed Nets buyouts are former perennial all-stars that no longer have a role in their respective teams. Lewis/Curry/Anthony/Cole at the points they joined the Heat dont even compare lol"
"Lewis, Cole, Anthony, E. Curry on the bench, pretty solid rotation."
"I mean not quite, we gotta see how Isaac and Fultz return from their injuries. Cole Anthony and RJ Hampton look promising. Can‚Äôt say much about Mo Bamba."
Cole Anthony would be ROTY
"I see what people are saying, but in the other hand it would be a good way for a confident young player to get their name out there. I could see young players going for it like they do for the dunk contest. Thing is with smaller names you don‚Äôt get as big of a draw. Do people want to tune in to watch Cole Anthony play Payton Pritchard 1 on 1? I do but the casual fan probably doesn‚Äôt care.   Or maybe they do    I don‚Äôt fuckin know"
I'm not sure you guys have the luxury of being patient with vucevic at 30 years old. I think you might be more likely to get free agents if you had more hope and excitement for the future of the franchise. It just feels like you have a great young player in cole anthony and it would be cool to surround him with some good young talent.
"[Here‚Äôs an article from June 2019](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/20/most-nba-players-produced-by-colleges-kentucky-statistics), since then UNC had Coby White, Nas Little, Cam Johnson, and Cole Anthony drafted. That‚Äôs still less than UCLA"
"orlando has bright spots w cole anthony &amp; fultz tho, ik theyve been injured but have they not been good? (i dont watch orlando too much)"
"what keeps me hopeful for the future:  * hoping the DeVos family sells the team  * understanding we made the playoffs last two years with healthier squads  * adding a potential top 5 pick in the draft and getting JI and Fultz back next season  * Vucevic continuing to improve his game  * Chuma Okeke and Cole Anthony  it ain't much, but that's what we've got to work with. we need to continue our pattern of lucking into a generational talent in the draft and then failing to build a good team around them, so hopefully we can get our guy this year."
"There's value in playing with adults, even more value when they're actually good because their voice carries more. All the young guys will learn a lot playing with him. Cole Anthony is going to be better in the long run throwing entry passes to Vuc than idk, Mahinmi or something. Aaron Gordon would be a more ideal player to trade given the clean line of succession to Isaac. Fournier too, he plays a more disposable role."
"Fultz literally missed 1 game last year, and we also have Cole Anthony who has looked promising if you don‚Äôt believe in Fultz. We also won a game both years we made if to the playoffs without our best defenders. You‚Äôre wrong. We‚Äôll definitely be better than the Knicks I can guarantee you that."
"&gt; is it worth it to run it back with this same team and essentially top out as like a 5-6 seed   No reason that 5-6 is our ceiling to be honest. We have 4 real vets on our roster. Vuc, Fournier, Ross, Gordon. One of gordon and Fournier will be moved for luxury tax reasons. That means next year our 9 man rotation will have 6 players 24 and under.  Fultz, Cole Anthony, chuma okeke, Jonathan Isaac, mo Bamba, and our pick this season. We will likely get another young player in a trade involving gordon or Fournier.   The reason to sell vucevic for picks and young players would be is if we were in need of those things, and we aren‚Äôt. If we trade vucevic essentially our entire team will be young players and we resign ourselves to multiple years of being terrible. Magic fans and ownership would much rather we be competitive with room for growth than engaging another hard reset. The minute we trade Vuc we will go looking for a stretch 5 to open the lane for our young guys because Bamba isn‚Äôt ready to start. Seems kind of ridiculous to do so when we have an elite on already on the roster.  &gt; Vuc when is value is sky high and getting back potentially some nice draft picks and young talent.  The other part is that his value isn‚Äôt going to radically change in the next year. If we‚Äôre underperforming next season we can move him at the deadline, he will still have 1.5 years left on his deal at that point."
We didn‚Äôt want an extra first in that draft because we were already going to be integrating 2 rookies in okeke and Cole Anthony.
"yeah bro uhh naw. Fultz was looking like an above average point guard before he got injured, Isaac was also a top 5 defender in the entire nba and cole anthony was a solid back up as well. Plus aaron gordon generally being good and fournier providing reliable scoring. And i‚Äôm a heat fan"
"No, we shouldn't trade Vuc.  We're still betting on Isaac and Fultz to blossom into something. Cole Anthony and Okeke are good players too. Half the roster is injured but when everyone's healthy we're a playoff team. Why the hell should we trade him? We're getting a top 5 pick with him anyway. Plus, he very clearly loves the franchise and the fans love him back. Loyalty should be a thing.  Isaac and Fultz back, Vuc playing well, Cole and Okeke continuing to improve and a top 5 pick (let's say Cade just for example), that's a playoff team from day one and if one of those young dudes blossom into an all star we become very, very dangerous. Vuc relies on technique over athleticism so he'll play like he's playing for at least three to four years, enough for one of the young players to become a star and if they don't, well THEN it's time for a rebuild again.  Vuc ain't going anywhere."
"They were missing Aaron Gordon, Fournier, Ross, James Ennis, Cole Anthony, Isaac, and Fultz tonight. There's only so much you can do with such a crippled roster"
"We need to get rid of guys that just make our team slightly better. Vooch is a guy that makes your team A LOT better. I understand he might have the most value but there are different avenues to get a franchise guy without giving up one.  So with Gordon, Evan, and  Bamba, I'd be perfectly fine going out and getting picks or trying to get a guy like Lavine. Magic are just missing one franchise player to compliment the rest of the team and we need to acquire that through a big trade or picks.  Hypothetically if we could get a guy like Lavine with those 3 (and probably a future 1st/2nd) its even better if you can get Lavine with those guys AND tank for a top 3. Now hypothetically your starters are:  Fultz  Lavine  Cade/Jalen Green / Jalen Suggs (top 3 pick)  Johnathan Isaac  Vooch  With Okeke, Cole Anthony, Bacon, Birch, Ross and whoever else on the bench. Thats a very sneaky good squad"
"I think Vuc and Magic org likes each other.   Magic has a lot of injuries, that's why they regressed. They where up and coming IMO when Isaac showed growth. Then they were winning games with Fultz, but he got injured as well... It sucked to see those guys go  down. I like the Cole Anthony pick and I think they're going to be fine, if they get everyone back.   Maybe look for the right deal with Aaron Gordon and/or Evan Fournier? I think it's the right call to be patient and wait for their injured players to get back on the court."
Cole Anthony was playing horrid. Granted it‚Äôs his rookie season
"I must be reading this wrong, but the Magic‚Äôs draft history is pretty nuts   John Issac, Sabonis, Saric, Aaron Gordon, Oladipo, Kyle O‚ÄôQuinn, Courtney Lee, JJ Redick, Varejao, Dwight, Mike Miller, Chris Weber, and Shaq. That‚Äôs what, 14 half decent players, and Kyle O‚ÄôQuinn, in a 30ish year history? And I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and call Cole Anthony a steal also  So yeah, trade the dude for picks."
Some other \#15 picks in recent years:  2014 Adreian Payne  2015 Kelly Oubre Jr.  2016 Juan Hernang√≥mez  2017 Justin Jackson  2018 Troy Brown Jr.  2019 Sekou Doumbouya  2020 Cole Anthony  I knew very little about any of these guys before they were drafted. The one guy who I had seen some of was Justin Jackson because of the ncaa championship.
"He did draft Cole Anthony, so either long boys or shot happy PGs.  Kuminga at 5, Moody at 8, Thor at 33, sounds good to me.  Not sure Moody fits the mold, but if he is drafting for need (and Moody is one of the longest guards out there)."
Notable longboi Cole Anthony
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
"PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Payton Pritchard  SF: Terrence Ross  C: Domantas Sabonis  PF: Jerami Grant  Bench: Mike James, Isaiah Hartenstein, Nigel Williams-Goss, Terrence Jones  Btw we counting guys like Kevin Love?"
"""How dare you not get in the playoffs with Mo Bamba and Cole Anthony. You're fired!"""
markelle fultz  cole anthony  rj hampton  chuma okeke  jonathan isaac  mo bamba  wendell carter jr  top picks coming  very exciting to me
"They have RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Markelle Fultz, Wendell Carter Jr, Johnathan Isaac, and Mo Bamba which is solid"
fultz really looked good in the 6 games he played before injury. and cole anthony is dope
Cole Anthony
We are.  Cole Anthony saying thank you Denver also kinda hurt. I'm worried we might have traded away our future sg
"I‚Äôd say Deaaron Fox and #9 this year is a better outlook than Fultz, Cole Anthony, and two picks"
"Yeah, don't get me wrong, I love watching Cole Anthony play (yes, I've seen a few Magic games this season), but he has elite role player energy to me. And that isn't as valuable to a bottom team building back up. It would be later in their development."
"Just the fact that they have 2 top 8 picks going into this year is enough for me to not declare them the bleakest future. To me, bleak future means the team is stuck in late lottery purgatory, too good to bottom out for a top pick, not good enough to make actual noise in the playoffs, and not having any stars/potential stars they can trade for a massive haul to kickstart a rebuild. Magic arent there. They're committing to a hard rebuild and just 2 top 8 picks to start a rebuild with is the exact type of thing teams with actual bleak futures wish they had.  Sure the current young players on the roster might be underwhelming but the Magic have plenty of time left before we declare them a bleak future. Like I said they have 2 top 8 picks this year and so many means of continuing to build off of that (more than likely will have another top 10 pick next year). They also have another Chicago 1st and Denver 1st (albeit a few years down the line). They have Gary Harris on an expiring who they can move for assets any time between now and the deadline (and playoff teams will definitely be interested). Ross also can be of interest to playoff teams and they can get stuff for him. Isaac has his injury concerns but we know he's legit. Fultz has his concerns as well but he still has potential (and if they get a coach like Atkinson I think he'll bring the most out of him, however much that may be). Cole Anthony showed some signs as a rookie. Wendell Carter is still a decent young piece with potential.  Hard to call their future bleak now. Obviously it depends how they use their assets and how their young players develop but as of now if I'm a Magic fan I'm feeling pretty good about the future outlook of the team."
If cole anthony is the first player you mention then the young core isnt very good lol
Oof Idk about this one. Cole Anthony looks pretty good and they still have Issac and Fultz coming back from Injury plus they have two lottery picks in this draft.
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
"Cole Anthony, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be all-star caliber but I could see him being a very high level sixth man for a long time."
Thank you sir. My mind kept thinking Cole Anthony the magic rookie
Don‚Äôt forget Cole Anthony. Kid already plays with a ton of confidence and is gonna end up a much better player than his dad ever was.
Cole Anthony
Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Joviƒá - Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokiƒá - Boban Marjanoviƒá  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?
"Isaac.  Fultz,  Cole Anthony is pretty good.  Terrence Ross.  Gary Harris is the main defensive reason Denver beat Utah in the bubble.  Wendell Carter JR so yeah, we aren‚Äôt the least talented team in the NBA.  Teams may have a better top player than us like the Kings or the Rockets or Pistons.  But overall I‚Äôd take our team as a whole over them."
"Fultz maybe not, cole anthony does have solid upside tho he was averaging like 14/5/5 for a stretch although inefficient. i jus don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd take another point guard when they have a lot of other positions of need and Giddey isn‚Äôt the clear BPA."
yeah i‚Äôm not even a magic fan but i hope this post ages like milk in 5 years when Cole Anthony is a star and they have solid depth
cole anthony has a higher ceiling than role player.
"Next lottery   Develop WCJ, Cole Anthony, etc"
cole anthony finna put them on his back just wait
Those are role players.  They are useless without somebody to be the star making them better.  Cole Anthony is the only guy on our team who has flashed even a semblance of All Star potential and I'd be stunned if he ever became one.  This is the fattest L in history.
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
Magic are my favorite team since I like Cole Anthony hope he becomes a star
Cole Anthony   Markelle Fultz   RJ Hampton   Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons
I would describe Cole Anthony more as ‚Äúhas potential to become an acceptable starting point guard‚Äù than ‚Äúreally good‚Äù. But it depends on what your definition of good is.
Cole Anthony ?
Cole Anthony and Fultz definitely are closers on our team
"polish the Orlando squad a bit more and ahe definitely could make some noise with them, specially in the East, she's great with young talent and is a players coach, Cole Anthony would probably be a MIP candidate or sum, considering how well he's already played"
"&gt;The only NBA player with an affluent background I remember of is Jose Calderon.  ? Are you not aware of the many NBA players whose fathers played in the league?  Steph, Klay, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Brunson, KJ Martin, Cole Anthony, Jae Crowder, Bol Bol, etc. List goes on and on."
"Meh, I‚Äôm high on Cole Anthony but Isaac is made out of glass."
"Right now?   1) They got underrated, under-the-radar pieces for a nice little rebuild.      Issac/Fultz/WCJ/Cole Anthony/Hampton &amp; others are intringuing.      They will also have two top ten picks this year in the draft   2) They got probably the lowest pressure HC opening on the market.      They are literally the only HC opening that's fully committed to a     rebuild (not sure what IND's direction is at the moment). Those are      good things when you are mining for a potential fresh young talent at      the coaching position. Wouldn't be surprised if they took a flier at      some G-league coach with a good track record for player development"
"I like the Dwight finals team. Vucevic is nice for us.   I've always supported Wendell and hope he's good for them.   Shaq and Penny was cool.   Everything else is whatever.  Also I knew Chuma Okeke would be good. Don't care for Cole Anthony. Terrance Ross would be more interesting on another team, kinda like Khem Birch."
"I feel like for Orlando you could say they don't have a ""franchise player"". It's probably Terrence Ross' team but they don't have that guy that is their franchise player just yet Cole Anthony and Isaac just arent it just yet"
100% facts Gobert can be replaced . I would also like to argue Cole Anthony over Isaac even tho they‚Äôre likely to have a top pick in the upcoming draft .
"Delusional Cole Anthony on Twitter: *I ain‚Äôt even gone lie y‚Äôall are mad disrespectful*  Delusional Magic fan in the replies: *This‚Äôll be their only accolades, you have championships and all star appearances to look forward to*  -_-"
That Moses Brown and Cole Anthony Archbishop Molloy team was sick
Cole Anthony not making a team is robbery
"Ain't no way Isaac Okoro, Desmond Bane, Immanuel Quickley are better than Cole Anthony."
"Cole Anthony went on to further say:  &gt;""This is all I'm going to say on the subject bro. Because all of you want to keep sliding up and saying, 'Oh you should have made it.' Yeah, I should've bro. But I didn't. So, I mean, it is what it is. The NBA is a bunch of bull----. The NBA can really suck my d--- for all I care. I hope y'all see this by the way and fine me I work in a f------ political league that's all about politics and it is what it is."""
I thought this year that even Tyrese Maxey impressed me more then Cole Anthony. Yeah Anthony put up better stats but I‚Äôd say you put Maxey on Orlando and he probably been first team rookie.
who cares if he does... I like that Cole Anthony is showing some passion
"If lamelo is ROTY on 51 games, Cole Anthony in 47 games is easily making 2nd team over Okoro"
"Okoro locked up Curry in half to go 0-8 from three during his hottest month of April. And he embarrased Trae Young, chase down blocking him 3 times.  He could be very special and while in short month of May, he got more responsibilty on offense and scored 16 PPG, which means he could have upside if he can get more involved offensively.  Cole Anthony had a good year, but people pointed out his inefficiencies, while Orlando went full on tank which is not a good sign.  Along with Okoro more available with more games played, i guess that's why he in.  Even as a Cavs fan, I was kinda shocked he got in.  I got nothing else to share."
Was Cole Anthony good this season? Genuinely asking
Cole Anthony revenge tour incoming
"So the third team is Facu, Peyton Pritchard, Cole Anthony, Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, pretty much"
"Admittedly, I didn't see much of Cole Anthony this season, but if he performed throughout the season like he did against Memphis, then yeah, he was for sure a definite snub. Never forget that second game. He was playing brilliantly."
"Ngl, if we gave him a more solid starting spot and Ant didnt have as much of a spotlight, he wouldve been an ez 2nd. Tho rn, im fine with what it is. Im slightly pissed Cole Anthony didnt make it though"
Really shocked Campazzo and Cole Anthony didn't make it. Obviously I wanted to see Quickley on first team. Oh well
Really dont understand Desmond Bane over Cole Anthony
"IMO they got first team correct, though you could argue Quickley deserved it.  Second team could have gone a few different ways. I wasn't impressed with Okoro or Williams on offense but they played big minutes and often had tough assignments on defense, so I'm cool with them getting recognition. Cole Anthony is somewhat of a snub."
Wow I love Cole Anthony now
"Cole Anthony is a better speaker than Greg lol, greg decent too tough"
"Factual I was hopeful for them until Markelle went down and Issac was already down really just destroyed them mentally and caused GM go ape shit There only real good ""developments"" have been making Mo Bamba a positive turning Markelle into SOMETHING and Jo Issac who sadly could not stay healthy to help Orlando.  Unlucky franchise even Detroit has a brighter future with Jerami Grant Magics only hope is a few tank seasons and one wild Cole Anthony who I can already see is turning into a what if story"
"You cant really do a redraft yet, we dont have a big enough same size. there are decent players who we really havent seen yet. Okongwu and Cole Anthony both spent a lot of the year injured but were both really solid toward the end of the year for example."
"Don‚Äôt u guys have a lot of guards tho? Fultz, RJ, Cole Anthony"
Cole Anthony no bias.
"I‚Äôm gonna go with Cole Anthony, Obi Toppin, and Onyeka Okongwu."
Cole Anthony
"Outside of Mo Bamba, we‚Äôve drafted really well for our position. The trades are just a separate bad move that were made except Sabonis because it was a draft night trade.  Oladipo was evaluated as the best prospect in a weird draft for us and he will end up being one of the better players from his draft.  Aaron Gordon was a good pick.  Cole Anthony.  Isaac.  All good players we drafted."
"Cole Anthony: ""I seen I had Wilt Chamberlain on me and was like ‚Äòyeah, it‚Äôs game time.‚Äù"
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
Try to get Cole Anthony from Orlando
"Ryan Saunders or Jim Boylen, I can‚Äôt remember too much about some of the others on this thread but Jim Boylen for combining atrocious coaching with the worst team culture I remember and Saunders for the most tragic and sad losses I ever remember . Check the loss to Orlando when cole Anthony hit the game winner for example. Or there was a Detroit comeback last season where Andre Drummond hit a goal ahead fadeaway turnaround 3 to win the game. Dude just attracted sadness on the court like a magnet"
"Yeah, we did that this year. We likely have 2 top 10 picks. I am not sure if we will tank hard again next year or not, I have to see what the FO does this summer and of course how we compete the first half of the season.  In terms of young gems we just got RJ hampton who won rookie of the month, we have Fultz, JI, Wendell Carter, Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke and Bamba.   So you add those picks to that mix and its a super young team. So I think full rebuild is already in effect. Plus we can sign 2 max players in 2022 if we want, so there is a lot of flexibility to get things moving in a couple of years."
Except he isn't.  I wish Charlotte fans would stop saying this.  Aaron Gordon developed big time under him.  Vuc became and All Star.  Fultz became an actual player.  Isaac developed.  Cole Anthony developed.  Chuma showed offensive growth.  Plenty of players developed under him.  Hell even Kemba did. Just because Monk sucked under him doesn't mean it was Cliffs fault.  Only Bamba flamed out under Cliff.
Non superstars only  Ja Morant  Cam Johnson  Cole Anthony  Jonathan Isaac
1. Stanley Johnson  2. Theo Maledon  3. Bismack Biyombo  4. Darius Bazley  5. Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk  6. Aleksej Pokusevski  7. Dwayne Bacon  8. Cole Anthony  9. LeBron James  10. Isaac Okoro
Is he even better than RJ Hampton Gary harris and Cole Anthony? He would be on the bench here.
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony better put respect on NBA Champ Norman Powell‚Äôs name üò§
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
It‚Äôs Cole Anthony now don‚Äôt @ me
"Richard Jefferson, Cole Anthony, Embid, Draymond Green..."
Orlando has Fultz and Cole Anthony + they're rebuilding
"I like this trade a lot. Wendell Carter is a promising center and Mavs supposedly really liked him and Garry Harris could still be valuable.   Orlando has Fultz, Cole Anthony and Hampton as guards who need minutes, and Porzingis has a lot of upside. Moreover, Isaac would be a perfect defender next to him."
"Yes.  Also no one would care that much about Kemba, about as much as they‚Äôd care about Lance Stephenson. Kemba‚Äôs high school, unfortunately, closed a couple years ago. In addition to that, most people here don‚Äôt know high school ball like that outside of really big recruits like Cole Anthony (Go Stanners) or Kofi Cockburn."
greg anthony is cole anthony‚Äôs dad
And Cole Anthony
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
Steph cant get a bucket on Kyle Anderson meanwhile Cole Anthony hitting game winners over his head
"Saw a redraft recently with Cole Anthony at 6 and Maxey at 12. Like seriously? Maxey would average 20 in Orlando. He‚Äôs my top 10 in terms of upside, next to McDaniels. He actually has all-star potential if gets consistent 3pt shot."
I had 8 with Cole Anthony and Dick O'Keefe
The two Cole Anthony buzzer beater probably boosted their numbers this season.
1. Isaac 2. Fultz 3. Chuma  4. RJ Hampton 5. Cole Anthony 6. Wendell Carter Jr. 7. Terrence Ross 8. Mo Bamba
"I don't think they will do it tbh. They blew up their roster on the deadline to rebuild around young players and pairing him with Cole Anthony will not be a great fit. If they need a vet, someone like Dinwiddie would be more ideal (and cheap)."
Lebron has been laying this all year. His ankle comments saying he‚Äôs never gonna be healthy again and now this. He just wants to use this garbage to say he‚Äôs the best when really we all know the GOAT is Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony is far from superstar potential lol
"You wouldn‚Äôt, y‚Äôall already extended Fultz and have Cole Anthony who has superstar potential."
I got Cole Anthony because I‚Äôm delusional
"Magic backcourt gonna look spooky in a couple years. Cole Anthony, Fultz, Hampton, and probably top 7 draft pick this next year."

Idk how a rookie team doesn't have Cole Anthony.  Even Chuma should be second team.  Cole certainly first team.  Him Haliburton Lamelo Edwards and Bey were the best rookies.
"This is my pick  ROY: Lamelo  First team all rookie - Lamelo ball, Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Halliburton, Saddiq Bey,  Immanuel Quickley  Second team all rookie - Jaesean Tate, Isaiah Stewart, Desmond Bane, Cole Anthony, Kenyon Martin jr."

I still can‚Äôt believe you guys have tank commanders deep in the pocket when need be.  Him and Scrubb.  Impressive.  We should take notes but all of our good players are injured anyway so it‚Äôs just Cole Anthony and a bunch of tank commanders.
I'd trade Jaylen Brown for Cole Anthony straight up.
Cole Anthony &lt; Carmelo Anthony
Cole Anthony Towns god damn it
Shoutout Cole Anthony!
I swear Cole Anthony is DJ Augustin 2.0 and y‚Äôall are going to be hating on him the next few years when he doesn‚Äôt turn into a good player
"not even quickley or cole anthony? Been liking Anthony more as the season progressed, dude is pretty versatile"
"Cole Anthony, good job. Maxey, stop it!"
Does cole anthony sell weed in the park on his off days?  &amp;#x200B;  I swear I know him from somewhere.
"How does dumping Vucevic help us rebuild? We already have fultz, Cole, Isaac, Gordon, okeke, Bamba, and a likely top 5 pick. What's the incentive to trade Vucevic and Gordon for worse players? Is Romeo Langford and late draft picks going to help the development of Cole Anthony more than Vucevic?"
"I remember getting downvoted into oblivion around draft time for saying Cole Anthony will be a bad NBA player as a shoot first PG who can‚Äôt shoot, pass or defend.   NBA reddit ‚Äúhe can shoot‚Äù."
"Damn Cole Anthony was supposed to be up next.  I think he was #1 high school recruit for a while before the final rankings.    Ended up 4th in the class behind Wiseman, Edwards and Isaiah Stewart.  He'll probably be decent.  He was just unfortunately thrown into the wolves too early."
"While I like Malachi Flynn, it sucks seeing players I was also high on do really well for other teams like Theo, Cole Anthony, Zeke Nnaji."
"it is though, they've had all 4 starters out for significant time (Isaac &amp; Fultz for the season, AG for a month now and Fournier spent a month on the sidelines) as well as the following backups out for significant time: Aminu, MCW, Ennis, Okeke, Cole Anthony. Hell the PG situation was so dire with all of Fultz, Anthony and MCW out they signed Frank Mason who got injured 4 minutes into his first start."
Well I think it was preferred to use Cole Anthony before him.  I don't understand how his form has got worse every year since his ROTY.
"And  a rookie Cole Anthony as pg, then frank mason, then chanson randle...  We had James Ennis running point for 2 games recently too"
"First of all, Wiseman didn‚Äôt get a decreased role as he is playing the same amount of minutes as he always had. You keep bringing up he‚Äôs getting benched but in reality his role is still the same bc he still is playing more min than Looney who is the starting center. 2nd, his numbers are as good as they appear and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an anomaly to me that he‚Äôs playing so few minutes. I understand that in bad games, he should play little min but why is he playing so few min in good games as well? My main point is that Wiseman playing so few min is not his fault. You act like it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs not playing so few min when I disagree heavily. I think he‚Äôs performing better than rookies that are averaging more minutes than him like payton pritchard, Saddiq Bey, Cole Anthony, killian hayes, Isaac okoro, etc. I really think that the only rookies performing better than him that are averaging more minutes are Lamelo and Haliburton. I don‚Äôt see how Wiseman is playing so bad to the point where he deserves less minutes than those other guys."
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
"The reason i said to trade him for nothing is because i would love a younger option (Cole Anthony) to start at the 2 next season.  Fultz  Anthony  Isaac  Gordon  Vooch  A disgusting, young lineup for the future"
"I know injuries are a part of the game, but take a second to look at whose been sidelined this season for the Magic  Fultz   Isaac  Fournier  Carter-Williams  Cole Anthony   Aminu  Okeke  Frank Mason  Gordon  Some of these guys have come back, but Isaac, Fultz, Gordon, and Fournier have missed significant time along with Cole Anthony. That's their entire core minus Vooch...and they're still 13-18"
"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
"They've been decimated with injuries. They're a lot better when they have fultz, isaac, and gordon. Cole anthony was starting to come around a little bit too before he got injured. Just awful luck.   And this is not a knock on the magic, but I feel like they're ok just getting to the playoffs every year rather than blatantly tanking. And vucevic is a player that can lead you to the playoffs in the eastern conference. So unless they get an absolute haul for vuc, they probably won't trade him."
"He's legit. Only 16.7% usage rate, averaging 5.2 assists and only 1.6 turnovers, and only 57.9 touches per game (just ahead of Hield/Barnes and well below Fox.) He's averaging the third most touches among rookies, behind LaMelo and Cole Anthony, and is seventh in points per touch among the fourteen rookies playing more than 20 min per game."
"Malachi Flynn has looked really nervous. He‚Äôs got good movement, makes some strong reads on his passes and gets great shot opportunities but has a case of the yips I think. We sent him to the Gubble and he‚Äôs been dominant (with a couple inefficient games).   Not ready for regular rotation minutes on a playoff team just yet, but his game is just so solid in all areas that you know he‚Äôs going to be a great contributor long term. Could probably stand to put on a few pounds to unlock his impressive defensive instincts as well.   In games I‚Äôve caught of other rookies, Pritchard, Haliburton and Cole Anthony have stuck out as out-hitting their draft hype/position. I‚Äôve thought that A1 was actually quite underwhelming except for that one time he devoured my team‚Äôs soul."
Cole Anthony
"I see some Kyle Lowry in Cole Anthony. Great defensive pg for his size, got a ton of fight in him."
also terrence ross can go fuck himself i hate watching him play like allen fucking iverson for no reason   gg magic im sorry about all the injury woes i really like jonathan isaac and cole anthony
I don't understand how people get hyped about high schoolers - so much could happen between now and then. Remember when Cole Anthony was the #1 guy in last year's draft?
"I think the Magic without the injuries would've been well in playoff contention this season, with the way they started and how awful many eastern teams have been it's legitimate to think they could've snatched even the 6th seed.  I think they'll try to keep Vuƒçeviƒá to try and run it back next season with healthy Fultz and Isaac (hopefully), a slightly more experienced Cole Anthony and better depth/supporting cast (Gordon will be expiring and tradable).  Imo, they should see what they can get for Bamba and Fournier this season and call it a day."
Lol we make the playoffs if half the team wasn't dead with injuries.  People like to talk about the Markelle injury but conveniently omit that MCW our other point guard also got injured around that time.  So we had to play Aaron Gordon as a backup point guard.  Even if we just have Cole Anthony with MCW I think we make the playoffs.
"Isaac üòî  For people who actually play this year its probably Cole Anthony, which is both a good mark for him and also a comment on what a shitcan this year is for us"
"That package sounds about right, except it'd be Bamba or Birch instead of Cole Anthony (Raptors need a backup big and Magic like Cole)."
"I could honestly see them moving on from him, but it would take a lot. The Magic are in a weird spot with their young guys being hurt, and their big contracts not doing a whole lot outside Vuc. They could help themselves a lot if they can package out any three of Vuc (who could bring a huge haul), Gordon, Fournier, and Ross.   I would imagine a package from the Raptors looks something like Boucher, Powell, Baynes and two firsts for something like Vuc and Cole Anthony. (Maybe? I am not quite sure how valuable Vuc or Powell are)"
"I'm with that, but Cole Anthony?"
Cole Anthony oml
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
Cole Anthony deserves a mention
Cole Anthony to the Nets confirmed
Cole Anthony of the Magic needs to pick a new first name.
Lmao Cole Anthony at 6

"It really depends on how they're going to fill out the backcourt, LaMelo easily takes the PG spot but if they shove a smaller SF onto the SG spot there's no room for Facu. Cole Anthony might also be in the mix for the other backcourt spot, so It's anyone's guess."

Cole Anthony got us
"I don't really understand how viewership figures work is that viewers per game or overall. Because fewer games hurts. But so many teams are just blatantly tanking this year and so many stars have been hurt. Plus half the top rookies have been injured for a decent amount of time which makes bad teams less fun to watch. (Wiseman, Lamelo, Deni, Toppins barely played, Killian Hayes, Cole Anthony etc.)"

Cole Anthony says hello
"Every team has had injuries a lot this year. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve convinced yourself but dlo doesn‚Äôt seem to be a winning player either l. Sure it‚Äôs pts and it‚Äôs a miss.   But look at what Charlotte has battled through.  Or the Knicks who haven‚Äôt had rose or Robinson much. Let‚Äôs keep it west. Memphis didn‚Äôt have JJJ all year. Okc has had Shai play the same number of games as dlo. Dort played same as Kat. They‚Äôve sat horford and kind of are blatantly tanking now. Magic have more wins but Cole Anthony, Ross and Bamba all played same games as KAT and fultz and Isaac all season. Traded vooch.   Tbh Ant has impressed me the most of all of em."
I think people forget some of the dog shit rosters the Pelicans had during his time. Everybody seems to think he had prime Jrue Holiday the entire time.   I was in another thread a couple days ago and somebody posted his game in 2016 that had the 8th highest game score ever in the NBA. [The starting lineup consisted of:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201602210DET.html)  Anthony Davis  Dante Cunningham  Norris Cole  Bryce Dejean-Jones  Omer Asik
5‚Äô5‚Äù here and I had to guard Cole Anthony and his crazy explosiveness in practice and also got a million floaters punted out by Moses Brown. Morning practice was a bitch because I‚Äôd have to scrim with future NBA players and then proceed to take hard ass classes.
"I mean you can literally see how Melo has influenced Randle's game. He's also trained Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Cole Anthony, and so many others."
"First it was thanks Cole Anthony, now its thanks Detroit, y'all getting chance after chance."
"Yeah they held out on the trade and got less than what was offered because LA lucked out in the lottery and then traded the 4th pick down for whatever reason. Thats just bad.   &gt; which is why they moved him for picks  I understand this, hence i said they have to move/upgrade Bledsoe and Adams with their picks, i just dont have much confidence because of all the bad moves i mentioned... Not to mention they are second round picks and pick swaps and Im pretty sure Giannis has a contract with them for both of those, but for sure for the first. (now i admit that could mean jackshit in todays age, but i dont have to explain that to you lol)   I also didnt write Kira off, i just said there were better PGs picked after him. 0 GM would pick Kira with the hindsight we have now over Quickley and I doubt many would take him over Cole Anthony and Maxey, and thats just the players in his position.  All in all, they are in a decent spot because: They got first pick, so they couldnt fuck up the draft and got AD. AD told them to trade him for the absolute by far best package out there. They got a first pick, so they couldnt fuck up the draft and got Zion. They pretty much fucked up everything else or did the bare minimum, like singing aging vets for bubble deals, trading questionably and drafting okay to poor"
Cole Anthony Davis
Isaac Okoro looks like a solid role player too. Cole Anthony and R.J. Hampton have both shined in various moments on the Magic as well. It's a very well rounded draft overall.
Cole Anthony looked like Paul Kariya after Scott Stevens laid him out...
Yeah thats true but you can't ignore early mishaps because Bamba looked bad defensively as a rookie and it's still not better.  Whenever players look bad defensively under Steve Clifford I consider that a huge red flag because he gets alot put of limited defenders.  Even Cole Anthony has turned things around defensively from early in the year.
"Lol, also what the hell was that when cole Anthony decked himself on Bamba"
"In all seriousness RJ has forever been a hell of a prospect even back to high school.   Like I get the Magic have more draft stock in Futz and Anthony, but I‚Äôm personally higher on RJ than both and I like Cole Anthony a ton."
Cole Anthony would like a word
Insert cole anthony: yeah yeah yeahh
Cole Anthony drop 2 game winning shots?
I read this as 'Cole Anthony is now the 10th....'  and was like wow... that seems quite fast.
"Crazy to think just one year ago Cole Anthony, rj hampton, and nico mannion were the top point guard prospects heading into college."
Should we play Wagner more minutes.  Or Bamba more minutes.  Maybe we just need to bench Cole Anthony and Wendell to be honest.
Cole Anthony is now instantly my favorite NBA player. That was an all time interview.
"2 buzzer beaters in a row in 2 days, by 2 heroes of our time: Cole Anthony and Ben Simmons! Unbelievable"
Warriors fans must stan Cole Anthony and Ben Simmons till retirement
I think Cole Anthony does one of these every game
"I don‚Äôt like Cole Anthony, he seems like a jackass"
Cole Anthony just got a huge fan!

Holy shit Cole Anthony is legit
Orlando doesn‚Äôt deserve cole anthony
Thank you Cole Anthony. Very Cool!
We are all Magic fans tonight at Dubs nation. Thanks Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony is so obviously going to be a good player I just want him to actually get to play on a good team
Cole Anthony since coming back from his injury has played better than Markelle ever had period.  His jumper even shaky is just a much bigger threat than Markelle even if he‚Äôs a worse defender and passer.
Thanks Magics. Thanks Cole Anthony. üò§
COLE ANTHONY FUCK YES
You're welcome Mr u/wontonf    (This is because I am 100% Cole Anthony and love the Magic)
Thanks Magics. Thanks Cole Anthony. We owe you üò§

Cole Anthony is a more fluid scorer
I mean he has to shoot on higher volume because who else will take those shots. And ant has been a playmaker for the wolves as well and his on the ball defense has been very clutch for the wolves recently. I don‚Äôt think counting efficiency &gt; volume is a good case for ROTY especially when historically it has typically gone to the rookie that has had the better numbers anyways.  Also Ryan was a great person but he was absolutely terrible lol Timberwolves should have at least 7 more wins than they do now. That Cole Anthony game winner is one example of how bad he messed up. Not to mention that kings comeback against the wolves was against Ryan and all the blowouts this season was mostly under him
You‚Äôll have a hard time convincing me a rookie Cole Anthony is a better playmaker than Kevin Durant
I thought it was ranked by likelihood lf winning. Like it's not likely that lamelo comes back but it is more likely than say Cole Anthony winning it all.
"Rest of the list:  6. Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons  7. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks  8. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies  9. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers  10. Cole Anthony, Orlando Magic  Unrankable because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair: Paul Reed, Philadelphia 76ers"

Ik how good they are I‚Äôm projecting out . Assuming good health and they all take what‚Äôs considered average steps for their development everyone I listed definitely has all star potential . Cole Anthony has the least likely chance but he‚Äôs still got it .  Like the best drafts of all time rarely go above 15 rotation players I‚Äôm confused what the expectations were
&gt; Quickley Williams Halliburton Cole Anthony can all make a all star team      I think you really need to contextualize how good most All Stars are
Ant man Lamelo and Wiseman all T1 (only reason Wiseman stock is low is because of #Lightyears)  Quickley Williams Halliburton Cole Anthony can all make a all star team   Avidja Bey Tate Bane and Stewart look like they belong in the league  A lot of interesting prospects that can develop but I won‚Äôt mention for now   Is this collection a bust compared to any other draft?
"Jonathan Isaac, Fultz, and Cole Anthony all have promise"
I like his intensity but there‚Äôs been several 4th quarters where he‚Äôs made boneheaded mistakes or instances where he got mad about not getting the ball that make me less hyped on him. Like that magic game where the coaches were begging him to get back to cover cole Anthony on after the FT attempt and didn‚Äôt. I like beasley but I don‚Äôt think his influence on chemistry is anywhere near that of dlo and ant
It‚Äôs ok you are rebuilding now.. cole Anthony is a baller though love to watch him play.

God that Pelicans roster is disgusting  For some reason they had a starting lineup of:  Anthony Davis  Dante Cunningham  Norris Cole  Bryce Dejean-Jones  Omer Asik
"sorry, after a week of being confused, i realized i told you the wrong statistic. It wasn‚Äôt defensive rating, it‚Äôs player general defense. He‚Äôs among the ranks of lebron, ben simmons, giannis and jimmy butler. for reference the players at the bottom of this list are cole anthony, kevin knox, and jordan poole. rj is 16 on this list MB is 48"
Cole Anthony got injured too?! Fuck this season üòí
Isaac is injured  Fultz got injured  Cole Anthony got injured  Bench sucks (aside from TRoss of course)  Starting lineup aside from Vucevic is booty cheeks
"Top 10 rookies this season in no particular order: Edwards, Ball, Haliburton, Stewart, Tate, Patrick Williams, Saddiq Bey, Immanuel Quickley, Isaac Okoro, and Cole Anthony. I'd also potentially put Okeke, Campazzo, Wiseman, Bane, and Maledon above Flynn for their body of work so far.  Flynn's been great for a couple weeks, if he keeps it up until the end of the season maybe he cracks the All Rookie team ahead of someone like Quickley who doesn't have as much opportunity down the stretch."
"MCW is not the backup SF, he's like the 15th man. He probably doesn't play outside of garbage time.  It'll be probably be:   * Cole Anthony  * RJ Hampton  * Terrence Ross  * Franz Wagner  * Mo Bamba  Most of these bench units are missing key guys, possibly because you used ESPN. [This is a much more accurate source (although not perfect)](https://www.nbcsportsedge.com/basketball/nba/depth-charts).  In no order: Boston, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Washington probably are the top 5."
I like Fultz but think he would do better as a 6th man. I'm  super impressed by Suggs who should clearly be Orlando's future imo. Cole Anthony is very meh
Always thinking of the future. Cole Anthony and Suggs both have super high ceilings. Why not raise the chances of getting a hof guard?
"ha, I also picked Cole Anthony for the rookie Kemba replacement. Glad I'm not the only one to see the resemblance"
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
"This post was built for me.   1. Robin Lopez has the looks to replace BJ but he‚Äôs way better than him.  2. Edwards as Tyrus Thomas size wise makes sense, but give me MKG for game fit.  3. Tobias Harris is my Boris replacement 4. Why not go Bismack to Bismack. I‚Äôd also be interested in Gafford as a replacement 5. I love Ish for DJ  Bench:  1. Cole Anthony (Kemba) 2. I wouldn‚Äôt trade anyone else they were all perfect because they were the Bobcats. May they Rest In Peace"
I think Orlando Magic would do it.   Who‚Äôs there best player? Wendell carter? Terrance Ross? Robin lopez? Cole Anthony? They aren‚Äôt winning a championship with that squad and lebron would be solid for them.
Sometimes I think Cole Anthony is a rapper
"After watching him last year and in summer league, I think we‚Äôre all trying to figure out what Cole Anthony does well too"
"Cole Anthony is hella athletic and fast with a decent handle, he regularly blows by fools and can throw it down. I‚Äôd call him a slashing playmaker. He has a good game with a deep bag and is hella clutch, definitely one of my favs from the 2020 class. Still workin on that jumper tho but i think it‚Äôll come along, i think his future in the league is as a perennial 6MOTY candidate"
"[Yeah, Yeah, YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH](https://youtu.be/N5DqG6gpdx8?t=53) is all I know about Cole Anthony"
"For this year, likely.   There team is really built around the Embid-Simmons duo, which really shows when you look at how much they rely on Curry to be a volume shooter like his brother.   I think the exciting part about the NBA is that by finding the right running mate for Embid, they can re-make this team over the course of the off-season. If I were Morey, I would focus more on ‚Äúassets‚Äù for when the next perimeter playmaker comes available (maybe Sexton, Jamal Murray if they pick MPJ over him, or Cole Anthony if he really shows out and gets crowded out of ORL)."
You only draft for fit when you actually have a star player to build around. If I have trae young I can pass on suggs. If I have cole Anthony and fultz I dont pass on suggs.
Cole Anthony &gt; Steph Curry confirmed
"This is the kind of fluff you put out there before making a trade offer to the 76ers for Ben Simmons. Isaac is basically Simmons on defense, Ross once scored 50 points in a game, Cole Anthony has so much potential."
Cole Anthony   OG Anunoby   Carmelo Anthony   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Giannis Antetokounmpo
"OG Anouby, cole Anthony, Carmelo Anthony, giannis antetkoumpo, Kyle Anderson."
"If it were up to me‚Ä¶  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don‚Äôt know where Gary Harris fits in, he‚Äôs a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don‚Äôt want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don‚Äôt want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Wagner/other prospect not named Suggs, protected pick to sixers. Had Fultz stayed healthy that would be a funny trade. Suggs and Ross for Simmons and a pick could work I guess, but I really like Suggs and think he will end up being a great player. Simmons has amazing D and shares the ball. His value is at an all time low. Even though the magic are rebuilding it‚Äôs smart to make a buy low offer that will be rejected."
Fultz  Suggs Okeke Isaac WCJ Sixth Man; Ross or Cole Anthony
"I like Suggs. Issac was always a favorite, we‚Äôll see how he‚Äôs recovered. RJ Hampton, Chuma Okeke, and Cole Anthony could be solid. NBA people love Wagner. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"I am too, but I‚Äôm wondering if he will be able to reach that potential that we saw early in this season now that a lot of the guard minutes will be filled by Cole Anthony and Suggs. I don‚Äôt know much about the Magic now that they traded their entire team, but I definitely though Vucevic was going to be big in allowing Fultz to have an excellent big that he can pass to and run the pick and roll with."
"Cole Anthony - He‚Äôs really embraced Orlando, and has an infectious personality. As a fan I love him, and hope he never leaves."
"The Magic's direction going forward really depends on Isaac and how he looks when he's back on the court. He's improved every year he's been in the league up until his injury, if he can get his 3 point shot to the 36% range while maintaining his defense he's going to be an absolute steal at 17M/Yr for the next 4 years and can be a cornerstone piece for the Magic to build around. On the other hand, if he keeps getting injured then the Magic will have no choice but to continue to tank.  This will be a development season for the Magic for sure. I'm not a fan of how they played Cole Anthony and Suggs in the Summer League, so hopefully that changes. I want to see Suggs as the primary ball handler and see how he does from there.  I don't think they're going to trade Fultz, I know it feels like he's been in the league for forever but he's only two years older than Cole Anthony. I think the Magic are doing a fine job with fixing his shot, it doesn't show in his 3 pointer yet but his FT shooting improved tremendously as he went from \~50% in Philly to almost 90% last season. I think next season we're going to see him showcase an improved 3 point shot which will really open up his game.  It's good to see them finally go into rebuild mode after treading water for the past couple of season with Vooch, Fornier and Gordon. Should be an exciting season for Magic fans as they develop their young players."
"For NBA standard 6‚Äù3, 200 (200 is very debatable, much like Durant being ‚Äú240‚Äù) and not an explosive not lightning quick player‚Ä¶.. is not an athletic freak.   Guys an unreal player and all the rest. But you‚Äôre straight up lying to yourself if you think he‚Äôs athletically gifted.   Like. You see dudes like Fox, Westbrook, Morant, Lillard, Mitchell, Cole Anthony amongst others who are a mix of fast, strong, vertically gifted or just all of the above and Curry isn‚Äôt really any.   He has great body control and coordination on all his dribble moves and driving layups. But again. He‚Äôs not a freak athlete or even close"
"Who faults a coach for playing to win games?  It's on the front office to ""tank,"" coaches are trying to play smart and instill good habits in their players, you know, win games. When coaches start throwing games or giving players minutes they don't deserve you instill some very hard-to-break losing habits in guys. See: the Jacque Vaughn era in Orlando.   And who exactly was James Ennis or Chasson Randle playing in front of? We had no healthy guards or wings, let alone younger ones who deserved time so he literally had to play those guys. RJ Hampton went from 12th man in Denver to playing 25 minutes per game. Cole Anthony started 3/4 of the games he was healthy for. Okeke was getting 18 MPG over the first 5 games of the season before he went down with an injury. Clifford has consistently given the better players more minutes. There are certainly some questionable lineup decisions, but none that are terribly egregious.   As for Khem Birch, Khem was ahead of Bamba on the depth chart when we were trying to win, if the front office didn't want Clifford to play him, they could've easily traded him at the deadline. And ultimately, they ended up waiving him like a week later anyway.   &gt;Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career.   Literally, every NBA coach, at least the successful ones, prefers to put players who help them win on the floor."
"Ya it‚Äôs an open battle in training camp since it‚Äôs a totally new coaching staff. Will be interesting because wcj is more ready now but Mo has a higher ceiling and better theoretical fit with the rest of our young guys. Suggs, fultz, Isaac, Hampton, and Cole Anthony are all shaky shooters to different degrees but all in theory would be best paired with a floor spacing 5."
"Correct. The best case scenario for us offensively is that jalen Suggs, cole Anthony, and Jonathan isaac are our top 3 options on offense lmao."
Jonathan Isaac  Mo Bamba Wendell Carter Jr Markelle Fultz  Cole Anthony  RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke
"I‚Äôm high on Cole Anthony , too"
Not in Orlando. Unless he shows significant potential now he‚Äôs getting passed by Cole Anthony. Also it‚Äôs gonna be more than staying healthy for him to be an all-star. He still needs to improve
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he‚Äôs a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he‚Äôd be an awful fit. Though I‚Äôm not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he‚Äôs a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ‚Äô for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he‚Äôs a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon‚Äôs a different story in my opinion. And I‚Äôm not even all that high on him but I think he‚Äôd work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there‚Äôs a fair few other guys I‚Äôd say the same about even if they‚Äôre not as good players in a vacuum."
Fake data that came from the nba itself? üíÄ  This is copium dude.  Collin sexton and Darius Garland are the only shot creators on their team. Cole Anthony is the only playmaker on his team.
"Thanks for the info!   Per your source, Kyrie was doubled less than Darius Garland and Cole Anthony. I think that's pretty interesting."
Orlando Magic is either John Isaac or Cole Anthony
"Ya it‚Äôll be the Magic. Our defense will be what makes our dynasty and once we pry a disgruntled star from some team next year for the #1 pick we‚Äôre getting for this year, our rebuild will be accelerated. I‚Äôm thinking Markelle, Suggs, Zion, JI and WCJ as the starters and Cole Anthony, Ross, Chuma, Franz Wagner and Mo as the bench. Sprinkle in some vets and with a defensive focus and JI healthy, I‚Äôm thinking we make a run for Bill Russell‚Äôs 11 championships."
"Except that‚Äôs not the case.  Most players were bad or did nothing before Orlando.  Tobias Harris before he got here wasn‚Äôt much.  Vuc became an All Star in Orlando.  Fournier became a starter.  AG became a great defensive player.  Markelle Fultz became an actual player.  Cole Anthony has I,proved in year 2.  Mo Bamba finally has developed this year.  Wendell Carter has been way better in Orlando than he ever was in Chicago.  Going further back than that.  Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando finally broke out. T-Mac became a superstar.  Really only Oladipo and Elfrid Payton are the only players I can think who didn‚Äôt work out in Orlando and in Oladipo‚Äôs case he was traded too early.  So you‚Äôre kinda speaking out your ass here."
"Cole Anthony hopefully, started off rough but hes getting more consistent"
"I like Cole Anthony, he sort of reminded me of a very young Kemba last season, and that's not a comparison I just throw around."

"I'll always root for cole Anthony, considering how rare it has been in the last 20 years for UNC guys to make it in the NBA."
"Yeah. I haven‚Äôt seen Fultz with a shot, for like 4 years.   Cole Anthony isn‚Äôt a great shooter either, but he has this spark plug quality that neither Fultz or Suggs has."
&gt; cole anthony is gonna be in the mix for most improved.   They don't give it to sophomores.
"I know he's actually good but I still see Cole Anthony and feel like he's a really good street baller who won a sweepstakes to play in an NBA game lol.  Also, for my die hard Hornet fans, how's LaMelo's defense? Never see it mentioned, good or bad."
"cole anthony is gonna be in the mix for most improved.   cam reddish in the mix, jordan poole and rj barrett slipping a bit."
"I want to Cole Anthony clip on repeat when this game is over, win or lose"
They surely mean Cole ANThony.
I also just think that not many other guys can create their own shot on that roster aside from Cole Anthony. Everyone else is a spot up shooter.   So with that said if he‚Äôs playing off ball minimal opportunities present themselves.   It‚Äôs pretty easy to play a team like that where you decide to just take away their main facilitator trapping them and forcing bad shots. make Cole Anthony create the offense something he‚Äôs capable of but not as proficient as Suggs would be. A product of playing on a bad team with a bunch of tweeners. Two combo guards three ‚Äú21st century big men‚Äù it‚Äôs not an ideal scenario. Roles are not clearly established. I hope he grows into his own.   Green Barnes and Duarte have the luxury of playing for more talented teams and better coaches (Duarte Barnes)
They should trade him straight up for Cole Anthony and Terence Ross if they are looking to be competitive in the East
"So as you can see, the title of the post is ‚ÄúMistaken Identity‚Äù, implying you mistake someone‚Äôs first initial and last name for someone else.   OP sees ‚ÄúC. Anthony - ORL‚Äù and thinks ‚ÄúCarmelo Anthony? He plays for the Magic?‚Äù before realizing it‚Äôs Cole Anthony.   I hope this helps."
Cole Anthony for the Magic.
that Cole Anthony dude is also spooky
"They should trade him for someone that can get a rebound, like Cole Anthony"
"We haven't seen too much of Suggs as the primary playmaker in the regular season because he's been starting at the 2 next to Cole. We haven't put him in a ton of PNRs as a result. When we have he's been with Lopez at the 5 due to having half our roster injured and Lopez has been really terrible as a roll man (he's soooo slow).  I've noticed he tends to get in the air and then try to pass out, which he needs to cut out.  As a scorer, he's gotten visibly better each game. Hit 4 3s last game (4/8) and 2 were pretty deep. He's struggled in the paint but he's really been getting beat up when he drives and he can't buy a call. It reminds me of the first half of Anthony Edwards' rookie season. Just constantly getting mauled - I think the combo of being big and strong and a rookie worked against them both because refs let defenders get away with damn near anything. 2nd half of the season when Ant started getting calls he was suddenly averaging 24ppg.  I think in both aspects the game hasn't really slowed down for him yet, which is hardly surprising for a rookie PG 4 games in. He has struggled with balancing the two, and right now you can pretty clearly tell when he's in playmaker mode and when he's in score mode."
"knicks   cant believe cole anthony absolutely shit on us and orlando won, so basically, its the good ol knicks!!!"
11. Cole Anthony  for shitting on the Knicks
Yeah why was Cole Anthony guarding him the most? Real talk I'm not familiar with Magic personnel should've been guarding him instead

Cole Anthony back to being a bum I see.
"I play fantasy basketball so every night I find myself looking at a statline like *""how the fuck did Myles Turner get 40 points?""* Or *""How the fuck did Cole Anthony get 16 rebounds?""* so it'll never not surprise/impress me when random dudes put up huge statlines.   But when the stars do it, I don't even register any emotion. Curry could get 50 tomorrow and I won't care, Harden could get a 40 points triple double and I'll have forgotten 10 seconds later lol."
"After seeing Cole Anthony last night, he could have a career as good as his dad."
"Cole Anthony is from NY and playing in NY. He had a big game with his family in the stance. He had a bunch of big moments last year during his rookie season. Whatever you make of him, you can't deny he gets better under pressure."
Cole Anthony is good but check this  Norris Cole Anthony Davis Bertans

Cole Anthony with 16 rebounds wtf
"getting cooked by cole anthony and t ross, now thats some shit"

Cole Anthony was on fire tonight holy shit lol
BING BONG BING BONG BING BONG YOU LOST TO COLE MOTHERFUCKING ANTHONY BITCHES
Best Cole to play Basketball?  Anthony Cole  Norris Cole  Aldrich Cole  J.Cole  Other
How the hell did Cole Anthony get 16 rebounds
I mean there have been calls both ways. Cole Anthony had a blatant offensive foul on robinson earlier that got called against us
Cole Anthony going for 20 boards
Orlando really more focused on developing scrubs like Cole Anthony and RJ Hampton over their top 5 pick‚Ä¶
"Nah not hating lol. It's just that anthony edwards is now 6'6, and one of the most athletic players in the league who is buckets. He's going to need the ball in his hand more.   Might cash in with dlo and get a 3 off ball decent defensive capable player like Harrison Barnes,   the hawks having alot of forwards,   Orlando having Cole Anthony, and mo bamba. (Kat not good paint defender)   Feel like the pelicans would be the type to trade ingram for dLo if the Timberwolves put a pic in there.   cam Johnson on the suns since cp3 is not getting any younger and dLo and Booker are BFF."
"Suggs looked really good last game, not sure what the Magic‚Äôs plans for Cole Anthony are, though"
he‚Äôs gotta become great to offset how bad cole anthony looks on both ends.
I feel bad for Suggs getting drafted in such a shitty situation. Maybe him and Cole Anthony can help the Magic claw their way back.
Suggs shot awful but he's way better than Cole Anthony.  We need to stop playing them together.  It honestly looks like Anthony feels threatened by Suggs whenever they are on together.  Also stop playing Wendell Carter at the 4.  And stop playing Robin Lopez.  Just split the minutes with Wendell and Mo.
Cole Anthony is the Knicks 6th man tonight
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they‚Äôre rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
" Jameer Nelson, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkolu, Ryan Anderson, and Dwight Howard  vs  Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner, and Wendell Carter Jr  Not to mention, it‚Äôs SVG vs Jamahl Mosley, who is making his debut as a head coach.   The 2022 team is absolutely fucked"
"In no particular order, Suns, Cavs, Hawks. But I‚Äôll say it, Magic have an underrated young core. Wendell Carter, Cole Anthony, Fultz, Bamba, Suggs. I wouldn‚Äôt sleep on them.   Would add OKC because of the picks."
I couldn‚Äôt disagree more as someone who‚Äôs watched every Cole Anthony game. He was billed as a black hole score only guard but it simply isn‚Äôt true. He was forced into starting point guard duties and he did fine organizing and getting us into our sets. He clearly has good passing vision you can even see some examples of it in this highlight video. He‚Äôs displayed a lot of growth in that department from start of last season until now. His handle and quickness help him create advantages out of pick n roll situations and he‚Äôs good at hitting the role man for lobs or drop offs as well as hitting shooters.   This is all as a rookie who had no summer league and short preseason who was thrown into the fire as an nba starting point guard and did fine.
"Tyrese Maxey, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Darius Garland, Rui Hachimura and screw it, ALL of Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba (BUY MAGIC STOCK!)"
I give Cole Anthony 6‚Äù for 45 minutes
lol they all have a lot of weaknesses and are all under 24  Markelle needs to improve his shooting or he will be a below average to average starting pg in this league and will really cramp the spacing for us.   Cole Anthony needs to work on his decision making and shot selection and get better as a finisher but he gets by guys with his speed and athleticsm and than throws up tough shots over the rim protector.   RJ Hampton gets in the paint but makes bad decisions since he jumps up with all the defenders and than has to force a shot up or force a pass to someone on the perimeter.  Jalen Suggs ball handling is still a work in progress and he won't be a lead creator or be efficient until he tightens it but we will put the ball in his hands and let him learn through his mistakes.  JI is injury prone but he has shown the ability to be an elite defender and I hope his shooting is improved with so much time off.  Okeke is perfect he doesn't really force shots and just is a good player on both ends.  Franz needs to get bigger and gain confidence on his shot and tighten his handle  WCJ is also a high IQ guy other than turning down some open shots and threes he has been really solid since he got here on both ends.  Mo hopefully has a career yr it has been rough past 3 yrs for him but he looked really good needs to not pick up so many quick fouls and keep his hands up.
"WCJ has shown he is a starting level center and is still only 22 with expanding range, Chuma Okeke averaged 8 ppg 4 rpg 2.2 apg 1.1 spg 0.5 bpg and shot 35% from three in his rookie season last yr and Franz Wagner will be a really good glue guy. Cole Anthony is a 6th man type of player and RJ Hampton has all the physical tools to be a really good player. JI has shown when healthy he is a top 5 defender in the NBA and is still only 24.   I agree we don't have that true superstar yet but we have really good depth and if we get a top 5 pick like Banchero, Chet, Adrian Griffin JR or Hardy that is a really good core. We can even trade some of these young guys and package them with the 1st rd picks and 2nd rd picks we have gotten from the Vuc and AG trades for a superstar or star down the line."
Chicago will be less than the sum of their pieces.   Colin Sexton may get moved.   Terry Rozier's last season was really underrated.   De'Aaron Fox should ask out of Sacramento.   Anthony Edwards is the first time KAT has had a legit co-star for more than a season.   Cole Anthony is really fucking good.
"The the Magic hands down.  Isaac is a right wing nut who is made of glass.  Cole Anthony is a great dude but doesn't have the size to be an impact player.  Suggs hasn't played a game but I'm not convinced.   Honestly if we are talking young players to be excited about, I still think RJ Hampton has the most upside of anyone on our squad. Which....is sad.  The rockets blew up their team like 8 minutes ago and they have Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, and Alperen Sengun-- all who have all star ceilings.   I'm so jealous."
"Suggs ROY, Mo Bamba MIP, Fultz MVP, Issac DPOY (blocking shots on and off the court), Jamahl Mosley COY, Cole Anthony 6moy, Magic go undefeated in the playoffs and beat the Warriors in 4 games."
Cole Anthony
All we need now is for Mo Bamba and Cole Anthony to turn into the new Shaq and Penny
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Orlando definitely is the least watchable. Absolutely no stakes and no future potential superstars to nitpick. Houston has an absolutely fascinating and erratic young core. Cade is a crazy prospect. Okc has shai but they‚Äôd probably still be 29th in watchability.   Cole Anthony is awesome but if that‚Äôs the driving case for you being interesting then eh.
"I‚Äôm going to guess no. During his year at UNC, Roy Williams repeatedly mentioned that Cole would beat everyone in the notoriously hard pre-season conditioning tests, which apparently was unheard of for a freshman.  [Example source](https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/Article/Cole-Anthony-UNC-NBA-Draft-Workouts-147388451/)"
"Near the end of last season I went to a Bucks/Magic game in Milwaukee and for virtually the entirety of his warmups, Cole Anthony just kept chucking the ball as high as he could from the corner trying to make it in."
Lol. Does Cole Anthony ever go less than full speed/full effort? Lol. Dude always seems like he‚Äôs cranked up to 11.
Cole Anthony looks like Eric Andre in this clip lol
All that rim penetration practice with Cole Anthony paying off.
We must protect Cole Anthony at all costs.
"I think the magic. I understand teams that may struggle in the Midwest or smaller markets, but your in FLORIDA.   You got high pics and did nothing with them. You chose to pick up Markell fultz as if he can shoot after his accident. You've drafted the same position for 2 straight years. Cole Anthony rj Hampton Jalen Suggs.   I don't see any player that says wow for merchandise. It's just sad. You got all the theme parks, clubs, weather, diversity that would attract any player but can't get any notable names or look to even try to.   You have the most athletic big man with the longest wing span in nba history train that dude into a faster Rudy gobert in mo bamba. Then u got Johnathan Isaac who ppl say have the potential to be the best all-round defender. But nothing..."

"With weapons like FVV, Anunoby, and Siakam, he‚Äôd have all the help he‚Äôd need to acclimate. Magic fans might be apprehensive of him cuz there are like 10 point guards itching to start, namely Cole Anthony. Magic just took BPA, which is fair when you‚Äôre in their position, but they are LOADED at guard"
"Cole Anthony really got range so far he continues being a scoring threat with decent finishing, playmaking, and defense. Actually is a hype guy, leader on the court, and brings in hustle mentality.  Honestly can see him being an AS in a few years but clearly he needs one more level but in my view its just one more level. Thats crazy for the #15 and in his sophomore year.  Suggs impressed shooting wise didnt expect lights out shooting and deep range but handles needs work, playmaking is ok. I think if he plays the 2 primarily he would be showing out in preseason honestly."
"Not really.  LeVert has injury issues so betting on him comes at a high risk.  As the Pacers I'd decide on which big I'd put my money going forward, either Turner or Sabonis and be willing to move the other one for more the necessary quality in the backcourt.  Someone like Cole Anthony or another young PG and have a core of one of the bigs, Simmons and a young PG to build around and setting up the timeline."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"I agree with you there, but if you compare Bates at this point to where Lamelo was I think Melo was more hyped. People started to take notice how much he had grown at Spire and people were comparing him to Cole Anthony who the time seemed to be the top guard in that class"
Cole Anthony would have more acting chops than those 3.
RJ Hampton isn‚Äôt a point guard.  Cole Anthony isn‚Äôt a natural playmaker.  So it‚Äôs just Fultz and Suggs and hey might be able to play together because they have size and if not it‚Äôs not the end of the move Fultz for someone who is a better fit. /thread
cole anthony is 6‚Äô2
Cole Anthony is not an amazing prospect
Hampton is a SG  Both Suggs and Fultz are combo guards   Cole Anthony seems destined to be a 6 man  They‚Äôll be fine
calling cole anthony an amazing prospect is a stretch and RJ Hampton has shown barely any upside tbh. Jalen Suggs is still far and away their best guard prospect
Cole Anthony is 6'4 and Hampton is 6'6 plus they are tanking its really nothing
Cole Anthony new fav player
"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"cole anthony is pretty one dimensional as a scorer, i don't think he'll be a good starter in the league tbh but sugge has much more potential to be"
Cole Anthony is a national treasure on social media
Cole Anthony got his priorities straight. man needs his dank memes.
"The heat had an odd offensive identity in 2011 - they spent most of their time working to build team defense that year - when you look at the players on that roster beyond their big 3 and Mike Miller  and Chalmers (who was fairly raw) it was really really barren - Mike Bibby, Joel Anthony, Erick Dampier, Ilgaskaus, Eddie House - Their ability to use multiple different lineups on offense was extremely limited by this aging supporting cast  the heat in 2012 put more focus on offense and added Shane Battier, drafted Norris Cole, Spo took the next step as a coach, and Chalmers improved - so they had more weapons they could throw at teams  - Spo began to come into his own and even played Bosh at the 5   Also Tyson Chandler in 2011 was not Kendrick Perkins in 2012 - Chander was reaching in his prime that year and was way more mobile and athletic than Perkins was at the time (he won DPOY in the year in 2012) while this version of Perkins was on the downswing and not mobile due to injuries  TL; DR: The Heat roster was really thin in 2011 which made significant lineup changes not really an option but they fixed this in 2012. Also not likely this would have worked because prime Tyson was not aging Perkins"

"Part of the reason is the difference is bigger this season is because the Mavs have added better defensive pieces to their bench in Frank Ntilikina, Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. (Not big names, but great defenders statistically over their careers)  As a result the drop-off when he is on the court is much bigger, because the bench is better than it was. To give a similarish example, Cole Anthony has one of the absolute best on-offs in the entire league right now, not because he is a superstar in disguise (although he is very good) but because our bench is horrendously bad and lacks a true PG.  On-offs tell you as much about the replacement players as they do about the player themselves."
"Morant, Bridges, Herro, Cole Anthony  This isn‚Äôt to say Lonzo hasn‚Äôt played well btw. I really think he has. The defensive intensity has been much more consistent.  Just those guys have improved a good bit more imo, and also in a way that‚Äôs more traditionally what is recognized for MIP"
"Also a slew of quality role players.  Deni, Patrick Williams, Maxey, Saddiq Bey, Bane, Beef Stew, Jaden McDaniels, Okoro, Cole Anthony etc.... it was an above draft at the end of the day."
"What did we do to deserve this? We start to get excited about Fultz, he‚Äôs a reason to watch the team, boom ACL tear. Trade everyone and Cole Anthony starts to be someone to root for and get excited, hurts shoulder and then ankle.  Wow! We got Suggs! Rough start but he‚Äôs playing a lot better, broken thumb. And this is just our PGs.   We better stop rooting for Franz."
"Reggie is stronger and more athletic and has the threat of getting to the rim to finish  Cole Anthony is also more athletic playing on a young squad and is encouraged to launch at will  Bane is not even comparable, he's significantly bigger  I would love to see Seth launch more, but there are pretty obvious reasons why his rate is lower than plenty of others"
he's been playing a bit of backup point since Cole Anthony got an ankle injury over the last 4 or so games and he's shown some awesome flashes
"Guys like Reggie Jackson, Cole Anthony &amp; Desmond Bane are all shorter guards with low releases and they all average more 3p attempts than Seth on similar to less minutes per game.  If you look at the league leaders in attempts per game there‚Äôs really no reason why Seth shouldn‚Äôt at least be in the top 50."
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony is looking like a star
"Cole Anthony had like a great first game at UNC too, for one game he was super hyped"
Cole Anthony and Evan Mobley
"Cole Anthony   #2 ranked in his HS class behind James Wiseman  His only season at UNC was underwhelming overall and he was injured and out for a month. He was one of the best players on the team, if not the best, but the lackluster season and injury hurt his stock.   Magic got lucky he fell to us. He's showing up in a big way for us whlile Suggs figures things out and Fultz is making his way back."
Cole Anthony
"Gotchu   Curry, Trae,Luka,Harden,Dame,Ja,Fox,Brogdon,Russ,Lamelo,Lonzo,Dejonte,Jamal Murray,Ben Simmons, DLo,Garland,Jrue,CP3,Lowry, Conley, FVV. There‚Äôs 21 guys I see clearly ahead.   Then you could also say Cole Anthony/Maxey/Schroeder/Dinwiddie"
Cole Anthony looks like the second best player from the draft class after LaMelo in my opinion.
Cole Anthony and Tyrese Maxey are second year players so they're basically disqualified from the conversation.
"Ok. Compared to last year he is:  +2.7 ppg, +1.1 rebounds, +2.8 assists  Miles Bridges is:  +7.5 ppg, +1.5 rebounds, +1.1 assists  Tyrese Maxey is:  +10.7 ppg, +1.8 rebounds, +1.8 assists  Cole Anthony is:  +7.3 ppg, +1.9 rebounds, +1.8 assists  I‚Äôm sorry but Dejounte isn‚Äôt even close to the improvement those 3 have."
"Caruso and Lonzo combined for 9 steals. Vuc and Coby getting their groove back. Zach being Zach.   Also D3MAR THR33ROZAN.  Hope this team shows up with the same energy against the Heat.   Sucks that Cole Anthony didnt play tonight. I wanted to see how he balls. WCJ looks thick, solid, and tight tho. I hope he does well in Orlando."
"To me it's between Scottie's, Franz's and Mobley's since they were all the best player on the floor against decent teams and got the W. But Mobley's felt the most complete on both ends so gotta give it to him.  EDIT: Actually Cole Anthony was probably the best that game so it's between Scottie and Mobley."
A consistent secondary scorer‚Ä¶Cole Anthony does great but when he‚Äôs having an off night the whole team just scores like 10-13 a piece (which is great) IF we had a secondary scorer (someone to take the scoring load for a  game
"I have been watching a few games lately. Here's what I want to see, because I'd like to win a few.  PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Markelle Fultz  SF: Franz Wagner  PF: Jonathan Isaac  C: Wendell Carter, Jr. _____ 2nd unit: Suggs, Hampton, T. Ross, Okeke, Bamba"
"Nobody you mentioned is going to be close to Melo or Ant. Wiseman once he gets healthy, he was ballin last year before he hit the rookie wall which is exactly what happened to Scottie recently.  Cole Anthony, Haliburton, Maxey and Deni once the Wiz actually give him minutes so what's your point. Melo and Ant are going to be elite not just ""special"" 2020-201&gt;2021-2022 change my mind."
"Yup. Cole anthony has improved/is overachieving, Bamba and Wcj look real solid and they have some nice pieces w potential in okeke, rj, suggs. Fultz is a solid off the bench pg and still has potential to start if he gets his shot right, and Isaac is their best player (defensive monster). But yes i do think franz is the brightest star and his growth needs to be prioritized bec i think he has the potential to be the best player on that team and be the 2nd/3rd best player on a championship team. Im high on him as well."
Cole Anthony and Franz Wagner!
Cole Anthony and Herro are the same age and he's putting up significantly worse stats than Herro lol  Cade is a question mark. He's a year younger than Herro. We'll see if he can even have a rookie year as good as Herro's considering he's shooting 34% right now
"Guard spots have become crazy competitive. Herro easily could make more but there's a lot of guys he would need to pass. Cole Anthony isn't necessarily better than Herro but he's younger and already putting up slightly better stats because his team is garbage. Cade's also played only a handful of games but already looks like a game-changer. Again, Herro could easily make more but there's a lot of dudes he's behind right now so I wouldn't want to bet on it."
"As a Magic fan ""Nick Anderson stole the ball!! Nick Anderson stole the ball from Michael Jordan!"" is definitely up there.  https://www.nba.com/magic/date-magic-history-nick-anderson-steals-ball-michael-jordan-20200507  On a personal level, in what was a miserable season for the Magic last season, Cole Anthony's buzzer beater against the Wolves was definitely memorable, maybe just because I watched it so many times as one of our few highlights:  ""Rebounded by Anthony. Two seconds left...Anthony...for the win...(GOTTTEEEEM) He drills it!! Cole Anthony gives the Magic a victory! Improbable! Unbelievable! In Minneapolis.""  https://youtu.be/YbqdYQm3MPY"
I'm not saying there's 10 *absolutely* better but it can be argued with how bad he's been so far imo  Of course you can exclude based on what position you think guys play but I'm basing it on who they share the court with as well as traditional sense.  In no order  - steph  - Ja  - Trae  - Luka  - Lamelo  - Cp3  - Harden(who's also been playing way worse than his standards)  - Vanvleet  - Brogdan  (Guys that are arguably playing better or the same)   - Cole Anthony  - Russ  - murray
"I think Cade and Cole Anthony have a decent chance, Herro and Haliburton could sneak into one or two as well but I wouldn't put money on either of them"
"Here‚Äôs a count of people who have been called potential  all stars in this thread: Duarte, Cole Anthony, Tyler Herro, Malik Bridges, Halliburton, Eric Paschall, Saddiq Bey, Cade Cunningham, Mattisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane."
Cole Anthony? Though he can and probably will be much more than that. He just looks so good
Yeah! Fuck Cole Anthony!
"The magic starting 5 have the best net rating in the league for any lineup with at least 150 minutes.  They‚Äôre only awful when they have to play their bench guys major minutes, which we had to tonight due to Gary Harris and Cole Anthony injuries."
"Totally agree there wasn't enough talent during the first cleveland run.   Miami was overwhelming talent but a bad fit.  Another power forward and another ball handler with a shaky jumper.  Guys who can shoot find another gear or see their careers extended by a couple years, players like Battier, Jones, Allen, Kyrie, Miller, Frye, Mo Williams, Cole, Chalmers, Lewis or JR Smith. True big men work too, like Birdman, AD, McGee, Anthony, Varejao, Ilgauskas and D12.    Other guard/wings who need the ball like Love, Bosh, Wade and Westbrook don't work great alongside Bron and have to give up a lot of what makes them good, especially if they aren't stud defenders.    Prime Lebron and Wade were good enough to mitigate fit issues in most matchups and win with great defense but offensive issues reared their heads until they figured out they needed two shooters around the Heat's big Three. against good defenses in Indy (106 points/100 possessions in '12), Boston (109 in '11), San Antonio (106 offensive rating in their two finals) and Dallas (107.9) they were just okay."
they need Cole Anthony
"I had no idea it was 6, I just knew it was Cole Anthony and two starters. At least it helps the tank but damn I hope you get to see the team healthy again soon."
Is Cole Anthony injured?
Jonathan Isaac  Cole Anthony   Franz Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr  Jalen Suggs  Markelle Fultz  Mo Bamba  Chuma Okeke
They're a rebuilding team that is missing Cole Anthony and (I think) a bunch of their best players. The roster they have available will just have the potential to have games like this.
Cole Anthony and the corpse of Gary Harris
if we had Cole anthony we would be winning
Cole Anthony Edwards
Just being the #1 option on your team doesn't make you all-star level though. That's like saying Cole Anthony has been an all star level player this year
"Nesmith was only the 14th overall pick, so I could see him being a quality rotational player which would be above average for a 14th overall pick, but Maxey (and Cole Anthony, drafted 1 pick after Nesmith) look like they can be All-Star(s)"
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony
"Poole, Cole Anthony, and biased for herro"
Cole Anthony?
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Cole Anthony expand his game and be more than a scoring combo guard. He plays with a lot of intensity and can shoot really well.   Maybe not superstar but I can see him on a few all star teams.
"cole anthony, future perennial all-star"
My money is on Cole Anthony
"Hes already starting to do it, but Cole Anthony."
Cole Anthony
Imagine if Cole Anthony is playing
"Defining ‚ÄúSurprise player‚Äù is kinda the crux of this whole question. To me, it‚Äôs not a surprise if Scottie Barnes becomes a superstar. He was drafted 4th overall, and had great expectations coming into the league based on his physical frame and skill level. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt viewed that way by casual fans that don‚Äôt follow the draft but anyone picked that high in a loaded draft should have superstar potential.  I‚Äôll say Cole Anthony. Was picked low in a weak draft class, didn‚Äôt make much noise his rookie year. Now he‚Äôs off to a really hot start, and I legitimately think if he keep it up he can steal the franchise starting PG spot from Fultz and Suggs. His shooting is improved, he‚Äôs still got good athleticism and seems to be stepping up his playmaking. He also has a really confident and determined mindset that will serve him well as he tries to break through. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs incredibly likely he becomes a SUPERSTAR but I also think it‚Äôs not out of the question and All Star seems to be a possibility for him. And I think if you asked, very few would have suggested that on draft night or his rookie year  Honorable mention to Rui Hachimura who I think has a sneaky high ceiling."
"Cole Anthony, but I‚Äôm also full of bias"
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony is having himself a breakout season so far.
Cole Anthony
Cole anthony
That's a lot of ifs. I didn't even mention Jaylen Brown/Khris Middleton. Cole Anthony was just a random east guard that I mentioned that has comparable if not better stats. I could've replaced his name with FVV.
Cole Anthony
"Pick 15 of the 2020 draft, Cole Anthony. From the several Magic games I‚Äôve seen (which this season has a been a weirdly high amount), he has potential to be a perennial All-NBA player and I think he will fulfill it"
Doubt he gets in. Even LaVine didn't get in averaging like 26 or Beal averaging 30 lol couple season ago  Tyler Herro - 21.7/5.5/3.9 on 18.7 eff  Cole Anthony - 19.6/6.8/5.9 on 20.8 eff  You can easily make a case that guys like cole anthony are having a better season rn too. I see this being the guard rotation for east.   (Trae/Lamelo) and LaVine starters  (Trae/Lamelo) and Harden  WC: Beal
cole anthony
"Superstar means absolute insane upside and a top 10 player with the personality/swagger to also be a huge name/brand. To me that really limits the candidates.  I‚Äôd say Cole Anthony I guess? I‚Äôm skeptical, but he was a highly rated high school prospect and if he can score a ton he definitely has the personality and swag. Honestly reminds me of Lillard lol."
Cole Anthony is number 3 with 100 and Tyler Herro is 6th with 93. [Source] (https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Period=4&amp;sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1) Pretty nice leap for both those guys.
I think LaMelo is a lock. I'd love to see JV. I got my Conley fix last year. Sleeper pick for me would be Cole Anthony.
‚Ä¶ and Cole Anthony
"I zoned in &amp; out of the game. I only remember one foul call that shouldn't have been called. It was on a 3pt shot. Other than that I thought he got those calls because he was clearly fouled.   Reffing was a bit dodgy. Cole Anthony should've gotten some calls going his way. They didn't call it. But that don't mean the calls Harden got were pure foul baiting.   If Harden decides to take attack the rim. He's going to get more foul calls, and FT than others. He's just that crafty, and that strong."

"not sure why this is downvoted. He's in consideration. Grant, Cole Anthony and Wood are probably worse though."
Cole Anthony sucks
It was so bad.  No excuses.  Harden came back in the game with 10 minutes left in the 4th.  The minute he walked to the stand should've been Cole Anthony time to match his minutes.  Also wtf was up with that random Mo Wagner 4th quarter stint.  Why is Wendell iced.  I get he was having a bad game but that hasn't stopped Mo Bamba from getting minutes in previous games or Gary Harris from playing.
"Wood probably. Between him, grant, and cole Anthony"
"Hell even Trae was snubbed of one. I would say Jrue Holiday could be an optimistic peak for him. Then again I think it‚Äôs very realistic that he and Cole Anthony wind up being very similar in terms of skill level, which sorta makes his drafting a bit of a disappointment for a pick so high in a stacked draft. We won‚Äôt really be able to accurately say for a few years though."
"I had the Pelicans taking either him or Cole Anthony last year, didn‚Äôt really like the Kira Lewis pick."
"Cole Anthony finna outplay him tn, trust"
Can‚Äôt forget Cole Anthony too
Yeah I don‚Äôt think Suggs is a bust or anything. I liked Orlando‚Äôs draft. I was just personally not super high on Suggs as like a top 5 pick and thought he should go mid-lottery. He‚Äôs shown flashes and he‚Äôll probably slowly develop. Optimistically he could be a Jrue Holiday type guard in his prime. What‚Äôs funny is I don‚Äôt know what Orlando will do if they have to chose between him and Cole Anthony who‚Äôs playing really well and looks like he has real potential too.
Even with KJ Martin and Kevin porter jr??  And T Ross and Cole Anthony and Mo Bamba and Fultz??
Cole Anthony
cole anthony is better than maxey  immanuel quickley might be better than him but he doesn't get the kind of minutes that maxey has been getting.  he might look worse with more minutes and an increased role  also devin vassell is underrated cause the spurs are kind of bad right now.  vassell is legit tho.  I don't think he's better than maxey right now but he's close enough to be in the conversation
did anyone else not have any idea cole anthony was greg anthony's son
Yeah like Cole Anthony has swag. Mo bamba got a 300 million views+ song about him. Isaac didn't kneel for the anthem so he got some heat.   The pacers are just hey we made headlines for myles turner getting hugged by Rudy gobert

"How about Orlando as a 3rd team? Something like this:  Minnesota receives: Ben Simmons  Philly receives: Patrick Beverly, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Gary Harris, Minnesota 2024 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2026 1st Rounder  Orlando receives: Minnesota 2022 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2024 2nd Rounder, throw in players to make salaries work.  It's a decent start I think"
Trying to put non-summer league level players here:  Eric Bledsoe  Cole Anthony  Kevin Knox  Ben Simmons  Marvin Bagley  Andre Drummond  They might accidentally win more than one game. Mostly guys who are good players but really do not mind losing as long as they get theirs. They'll probably beat a really good team like the Bucks for that one win. LOL
"Magic:  Fultz Isaac Suggs Wagner Hampton Anthony Okeke Bamba/WCJ  Basically all of the 23 and under core but 1 guy, leaving some decent rotation vets for grabs like Ross, Harris, and MCW.  I'd lean toward keeping both centers and leaving Cole out if a draft was happening this year, but by the end of this season we'll know if they're extending Bamba or WCJ (or both??), so the decision will be made a bit early in this case."
 It‚Äôs just summer league but it‚Äôs   Cole Anthony  Evan Mobley  Killian Hayes
Yeah.  Cole Anthony wasn‚Äôt making noise at all.
"the magic players outside of suggs. cole anthony, rj hampton, wagner looked bad"
"Have to agree with Cole Anthony as well. With Fultz coming back and the emergence of Suggs, you know he‚Äôs got to feel the pressure. This is a career role defining season for him lowkey: if he can‚Äôt play heavy minutes and be productive on a low tier team like Orlando, he will likely never got a shot anywhere else besides as a backup. I‚Äôm sure he wants to be a starter considering his pedigree"
they wouldnt beat moochie norris cole anthony davis bertans
"I believe the Magic used proprietary AI to decide who to pick in the 2019 and 2020 draft which landed us with Cole Anthony, who I think will be a stud sooner rather than later, and Chuma Okeke."
"Magic fans why isn't Okeke playing in the summer league? Isn't he a sophomore with not that much experience at this point, like Cole Anthony who was invited? Or is he nursing an injury?"
Cole Anthony has not been good. If anything his stock would fall
IMO:  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  3. Tyrese Halliburton  4. Patrick Williams  5. James Wiseman 6. Isiah Stewart 7. Isaac Okoro 8. Saddiq Bey 9.

"Probably. They have so many guards, RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony"
Cole Anthony really does not impress me. Seeing him calling for the ball all the time to run iso in summer league and brick was just bad IQ play. Super inefficient and I don‚Äôt see the tools to really become a grwat finisher.
"&gt;Cole Anthony  As a magic fan I was seriously surprised to see our rookie in the top comment, thankyou! üòÅ He's a good egg. Absolute clutch, and always hungry. Kid can go places if he can reign in the concentration."
Yeah lol as a magic fan I think Cole Anthony suck ass. He‚Äôs most likely to be the captain of the Irrational Confidence team down the line.  Nothing like having a player that thinks he‚Äôs the shit despite not being able to shoot 40% from the field.
Darius Garland or Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony. For some reason I think he becomes a 40+% 3pt shooter on high volume.
Cole  '' i suck even at summer league '' Anthony. Suggs is already better NBA player than Cole
Cole Anthony is far more likely to be out of the league in two years than making an all-star team.

Did you see how Cole Anthony and Wagner played?
dude summer league + - is completely dependent on what wack lineup gets rolled out with you. cole anthony was god awful and chucking. that's not a reflection on suggs at either end of the court. his teammates couldn't shoot. did you actually watch the game? prob not
"It was an off night for Cole Anthony. Worst shooting game he's had in a Magic uniform which included starting half the season last year, so I'm not worried about it."
"It's more that people just star gaze when they remember the knicks teams and ignore what Phil Jackson was doing to that team.  Like Phil's first year, the knicks starting line up was: Shane Larkin - Iman Shumpert - Carmelo Anthony - Amar'e Stoudemire - Samuel Dalembert  The next season: Jose Calderon - Sasha Vujacic - Carmelo Anthony - Kristaps Porzingis - Robin Lopez  Like when these bad rosters lost games, starting games with guys that would be out of the league in a year, it's easy to blame the guy you remember, because no one remembers Cole Aldrich, Quincy Acy, or Lou Amundson starting and getting significant minutes on a team fans expected to make the playoffs."
He was -22 in +/- heading into the fourth quarter.  He was playing along side Cole Anthony who looked awful. He really exploded in the 4th which really helped his final stat line.  He's definitely not afraid of the moment.  He's got the Lillard mentality for sure.  He had some shots near the end where I thought the arena would've exploded had he been able to make them.
"TIL Cole Anthony is the son of Greg Anthony, the guy on nba 2k who constantly makes corny commentary and jokes and the reason why my commentary volume is at 0."
Cole Anthony looking confused and distraught.
He really did. Crazy how much he outshone a sophomore Cole Anthony.
"If he didn‚Äôt have to play next to Cole, I would not be surprised at all if he had a triple double. Anthony is such a black hole when he thinks he‚Äôs kibe"
"Jumper wasn't there, but if we're going to forgive Cade and Mobley for doing worse, then Suggs deserves a break. Everything else was there for him; he was composed, a good defender, hustled constantly, and didn't make any rash decisions.  Cole Anthony must have been a fucking headache for him though."
Cole Anthony yikes
He played all his minutes with Cole Anthony
"Friendship ended with Darrell Armstrong, Penny Hardaway, Jameer Nelson, Rafer Alston, Elfrid Payton lol, DJ Augustin, Markelle Fultz and the black hole Cole Anthony.  New best friend is Jalen Suggs"
Thought I was the only one...Cole Anthony keeps trying to play hero ball when everyone wants the ball in Suggs' hands
Cole Anthony keeps accidentally pressing X when he's trying to press A.
Meanwhile Cole Anthony on some bs and Franz Wagner just straight trash.  I wish Kuminga fell to 8.
suggs has been straight amazing.    cole anthony has been straight dookie.
Cole Anthony
Idk how much Fultz can grow when he‚Äôs got Suggs and Cole Anthony. Maybe though.
I was gonna argue against you but then I remembered Cole Anthony has Big Chungus as his Twitter banner
"&gt;Heat had Chalmers and Cole Anthony as their key role players.  The disrespect to Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, and to Mike Miller's 45.3% 3 point shooting."
naw we all know that's cole anthony
"Im a photographer so I work with celebrities regularly. Basketball players I‚Äôve bet  Cole Anthony   I took photos of his draft party last year  Rudy Gay  I met him while setting him up for an interview at HypeBeast  Obi Toppin  A friend of mine knew him since he was a kid, is good friends with his father. I met him when he got drafted.   A few others but I got NDAs so I can‚Äôt reveal that yet"
"You know it‚Äôs the Magic. They got all those benches beat.  Cole Anthony/MCW, Suggs/RJ Hampton, T Ross/Bacon, Franz &amp; Mo Wagner and Mo Bamba/Robin Lopez  Assuming returning starters are healthy and starters are Fultz, Gary Harris, Chuma, Isaac and Wendell Carter."
[Cole Anthony:](https://i.imgur.com/ZjGZqKk.jpg)
"I realize you're using end of season rosters, but it would make more sense to use the rosters in place at the beginning of March, since the ASG was March 7 (and the trade deadline was March 25). As you've noted, this is why you get Cole Anthony instead of Vucevic as the rep for the Magic."
"I don't really see how this is relevant. My point is that at his prime he was good enough to be a starter in weaker team if given the minutes and a slot to do so. Obviously that's not what happened, but given that he's performed similarly or better to some of the weaker NBA starters when playing against or even with them I don't really see  how it's that he ""absolutely"" wouldn't have been good enough rather than that situations/fit didn't align in time.  Even if we are discussing whether or not he could have been starter at the time he played in the league, we'd have the issue that he never really went to a weak team.   I mean how much better do you think players like Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Jae'Sean Tate, Dwayne Bacon, or Cole Anthony for example are than what Nando DeColo is now or at his best?  Or you can take those guys I mentioned, do you think they would have started in Spurs or Toronto at that time? Hell, I'm not even sure if someone like Rubio or Bledsoe would have."
Im going to go with Westbrook or davis. Something about being the 3rd option in lebron system doesn't work. Also cole Anthony
"Our summer league opposition is obscenely stacked which is funny. It's the magic, raptors, thunder, pelicans. Kinda fun tbh, gonna be exciting to see how Kuminga and Moody match up Vs guys like Giddey, Suggs, Poku, Wagner, Barnes, Cole Anthony, etc."
"I‚Äôm not calling him a bust. It‚Äôs just laughable to cite him as a positive aspect of your team next year. Dude is very far away from contributing positively.   I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm your talent rankings you rank him above Cole Anthony, even though Cole Anthony completely outplayed him this season. Which is why your talent ratings hold very little weight for me."
I wanna see a Cole Anthony - Markelle Fultz - Jalen Suggs backcourt exceed expectations this year. I have high hopes for all three and if Jonathan Isaac can stay healthy y'all will be fun at the very least. So many fast breaks if they buy in on defense.
I'm pretty sure he's not getting traded. He's a cheap contract and has at least as much potential as Cole Anthony. Orlando doesn't have that many guards that they need to feel pressure to move one of them.
Wiggins if he's still on the  warriors. Cole Anthony if fultz is healthy and Jalen Suggs addition.
"Haliburton definitely has the potential to be an all star player, but I just don‚Äôt see the Kings ever having a record that allows him to get accolades like that. I hope I‚Äôm proven wrong, because I have nothing but love for the Sac fan base and they deserve some relief.   Cole Anthony and Killian Hayes are pretty volatile in my opinion, have potential to be pretty good, but could also just as easily bust. I‚Äôm super interested this season to see how they perform. Especially with Cade and Killian on the same court. Same goes with Immanuel Quickley, love that dude, I hope he continues to improve and just balls out.   Wiseman is being written off as a bust already and it‚Äôs so unbelievably premature. I think he has a ton of potential and a fantastic opportunity to improve and achieve. Of course, he could end up as a Bagley-esque player, but it‚Äôs too early, imho, to say he‚Äôs a bust.   In my opinion, I just think it‚Äôs a little early to call it for anyone, except for LaMelo, Edwards, and Haliburton. But even those three, I have a feeling, will have a sophomore slump, and any dip statistically is going to bring out the critics who haven‚Äôt been as vocal this season."
Cole Anthony
Hey we drafted Suggs and all you hear are which point guard is getting moved.  Markelle Fultz or Cole Anthony.
"Carmelon Anthony, Immanuel Quickley, Cam Johnson, Cole Anthony"
"Fultz's contract is glaringly incommensurate with what he has delievered thus far in his career. I'd have chucked him out for a future first, and I wouldn't have even gone for Suggs. Cole Anthony is the future of that team."
"Cole Anthony is not good enough to skip Suggs lol.   He really doesn‚Äôt project as a legit starter. If he somehow blows up, Suggs has the size to guard 2s and they can figure it out then. Probably not an issue though."
"Don't you like Guard rotation of Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Markelle Fultz, and Jalen Suggs?"
"To be fair, they gutted their roster.  Fultz is really the only player with questionable shooting.   Fultz / Cole Anthony / RJ Hampton / Suggs  Isaac / Okeke / Wagner  Bamba / WCJ / Wagner"
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
"All 3 of those Orlando guys were just as hyped at that age. Fultz was a #1 pick, Cole Anthony slipped bc he went to a down UNC team, and Hampton played overseas. It either of those 2 went to a Gonzaga level team they would both be top 5 picks. Saying Suggs is better is prototype shiny new thing mindset. I‚Äôm not even high on him. Me and Gilbert  arenas the only ones from what I‚Äôve seen. Just watch"
Cole Anthony was last year. RJ Hampton came over in the AG trade.
Anthony Cole + 8th to Brooklyn for Claxton
I‚Äôm more talking about the Flutz/Anthony/Suggs thing about whose the PG and whose coming off the bench it‚Äôs probably   PG: Cole   SG: Suggs - Will handle the ball a ton   6th Man - Flutz
"I mean at the 5th pick you‚Äôre taking best player available, cole Anthony isn‚Äôt a reason not to take a potential superstar. Take the best now and evaluate the situation later"
Orlando should keep Cole Anthony and Suggs (obviously) get rid of their other guards  hopefully Bamba develops   Wagner not a bad pick   maybe Orlando making a nice core
"They have RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony and Fultz big ooof indeed lol"
Is Cole Anthony on the move?
Wondering how he‚Äôs gonna fit with Fultz and Cole Anthony.
"I dont really understand how this pick is gonna work out. Fultz, MCW, Cole anthony, RJ Hampton, Harris. Are they gonna give up on Cole/RJ for backcourt?"
Cole Anthony gonna get moved
Start packing them bags Cole Anthony/Fultz.
"How does the PG rotation on this team shake out now??? Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Fultz, and now Suggs?!"
Markelle Fultz Cole Anthony and RJ Hampton stans in shambles
"Magic have a great core: Suggs, Cole Anthony, Issac‚Ä¶idk where Fultz fits in to this though"
Suggs AND Cole Anthony? Ok I guess.
Suggs/cole Anthony/Fultz?  How does that work?
"So Suggs, Fultz, and Cole Anthony backcourt rotation?"
Suggs and Cole Anthony is gonna be so good man
"Shoutout to my Magic Bros, that Suggs X Cole Anthony backcourt gonna be something serious"
Cole Anthony though?
How is it gonna work though? Fultz and Cole Anthony are already there. Gonna be a crowded backcourt.
FR you can easily flip Cole Anthony or Fultz for assets
Could Suggs &amp; Cole Anthony play together?
First surprise! Now it gets interesting -- does this mean Siakam isn't lasting long in Toronto? Does Orlando still draft Suggs despite already having Cole Anthony and Fultz?
Suggs X Cole Anthony yessir
"Thread moving so fast no one will see that Orlando Magic‚Äôs 8th pick in the first round, Cole Anthony, fucked my girl in high school. He fucking cucked me but power to my brother‚úäüèø he‚Äôs now the starting PG for the Magic!"
"He did ball tf out against the Blazers (loss), Nuggets (loss), and Kings (win). He didn't play that poorly against the Mavs either, considering he shared the ball a lot more.   I think after that strech of games, he realized the team was a lost cause for what he was trying to do (win a chip), and he started mailing it in from the Pacers game on forward. That they blew out a Magic team missing Fultz and Isaac with Vucevic and Gordon really being the only options (and Gordon didn't even play that game) starting a rookie Cole Anthony as their PG doesn't mean shit. Getting blown out by the Lakers was just the final confirmation of what Harden knew."
"Wizards have a 93 ORTG when he plays. I.e. the Wizards are the worst offensive team in the league when Westbrook is on the court. Nobody on the Wizards has a lower ORTG apart from Anzejs Pasecniks who has played 6 minutes all season  93 ORTG puts him in good company with players like Marvin Bagley, Dennis Smith Jr and Cole Anthony. Except he's a 12 year veteran and they're all young players on bad teams"
Cole Anthony is listed as 6'3 but looks shorter to me.
Watching Jordan Bone and his awkward as hell jumper for 20 minutes made me sick.  Gary Clark even more.  We stay competitive if Vuc comes in at the start of the fourth instead of riding the bench until it‚Äôs a 15 point game.  Same with  Cole Anthony.  What was Cliff waiting for the deficit to go to 20 before he puts in the competent players.
Cliff got to stop playing these rash dude for so long.  They are their to buy minutes not extend time.  Bone shouldn‚Äôt have been in this time.  The last dead ball should‚Äôve been Cole Anthony.  Why are we still giving minutes to stupid Gary a lark.  He did nothing but throw things away for us.  Tighten this rotation up Cliff. Stop being afraid to play dudes 40 minutes when we are short handed.  I hate this crap.  At least Tibs push his guys when he‚Äôs short handed and has to.
Kelly Oubre - 39.4%  Devonte Graham - 41.6%  Cole Anthony - 41.7%
"Oubre, Devonte Graham, and Cole Anthony."
"I‚Äôm calling it now. It‚Äôs too early to tell who the mvp is of course. But when it‚Äôs all said and done, it‚Äôs gonna be Cole Anthony"
"Yeah Vuc is smooth, but you probably don‚Äôt need to bother watching much of our games now anyway. Currently missing 3 starters, with 2 out for the whole season. Might‚Äôve had a nice start but it‚Äôs not looking good going forward this season. Only thing we can hope is Cole Anthony can get some good game time and development."
Yeah Cole Anthony ain‚Äôt it
Its possible if our pg rotation is cole Anthony MCW and Jordan Boone. We are basically Vucevic and a squad of G leaguers at this point.
Cole Anthony is going to come on strong with the injury to Fultz
i expected cole anthony to be better than he was in college because that UNC was bad  turns out he ended up in the same situation
"He sure as shit didn‚Äôt prove it tonight, but Cole Anthony looks like he may have a path with the injuries in that team. Halliburton otherwise. Maybe Wiseman if he keeps making improvements and the Warriors keep getting better"
Hard for Luke not to insert him in starting line-up.  The Pistons should have drafted him instead. Let's see what Cole Anthony can do since Fultz was hurt.
"I've got my eye on cole anthony, believe he's gonna rise quickly"

Using a 40 attempt qualifier:  Caris LeVert 138 from 145  Aron Baynes 37 from 45  Aaron Holiday 46 from 51  Cedi Osman 106 from 105  **Killian Hayes 32 from 47**  Markelle Fultz 103 from 104  Cole Anthony 69 from 76  Michael Carter-Williams 36 from 44  Devonte Graham 80 from 99  Ish Smith 42 from 46  Gary Harris 56 from 61  Kelly Oubre 84 from 101  JJ Redick 49 from 55  Dillon Brooks 129 from 132  Tyus Jones 59 from 63  So Killian Hayes at 0.68ppa is the least efficient shooter in the league so far this season
Cole Anthony  69 points on 76 shots
Dillon Brooks (129 on 132 shots)   Markelle Fultz (103 on 104 shots)   Kelly Oubre Jr. (84 on 101 shots)   Devonte Graham (80 on 99 shots)   Cole Anthony (69 on 76 shots)   Tyus Jones (59 on 63 shots)   Aaron Holiday (46 on 51 shots)   Killian Hayes (32 on 47 shots)   Aaron Baynes (37 on 45 shots)   Michael Carter- Williams (36 on 44 shots)   Derrick Jones Jr. (42 on 44 shots)   Sekou Dombouya (38 on 39 shots)   James Johnson (33 on 34 shots)   Kendrick Nunn (26 on 29 shots)   Jevon Carter (22 on 26 shots)
Im actuallykind of happy that Markelle Fultz got injured. Obviously I don‚Äôt want people tearing their ACLs but now cole Anthony will get a starting spot. I think he‚Äôs really good he‚Äôs my second favorite rookie behind haliburton
Cole Anthony/Mo Bamba pnr time
Mega L smh him and Cole Anthony were meshing
Cole Anthony is my only hope.
"2020 draft looks sneaky nice so far Wiseman,Lamelo,Ant,Haliburton look good already   Pritchard,Precious,Avidja,Bey,Bane,Williams have been solid and have good upside  and lastly Killian,Stewart,skinny lanky OKC guy,Quickly,Cole Anthony,whoever the spurs draft,Tyler""shooter""Terry are all project guys and I feel like a few might hit"
He wont get that spot back from Cole Anthony
cole anthony roy odds about to sky rocket i imagine
It‚Äôs kinda what I expected.  Into the fire you go young Cole Anthony.  Kinda wish we had DJ right now not gonna lie.
"Sorry Orlando. You're a good team.   Fortunately, Cole Anthony looks good."
Cole Anthony has the body of a normal 20 year old but a face of a grown ass man
"Lol no.   But they are a well coached, solid defensive team. And I like Cole Anthony. Better than some busts teams took before him (Killian ""I can only dribble one way"" Hayes)"
Cole Anthony looks so NBA ready. Dude has insane hops for his size too
"Protected: Nikola Vucevic, Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac  Best Available: Evan Fournier, Khem Birch, Michael Carter Williams"
"Hey man I'm one of the people in here saying you're a legit playoff team.   I hate Fultz, but I think you're a good team with an underrated center and a very underrated coach. I like Cole Anthony and see him developing quickly. I still think you need to make a move at the deadline."
"It's either Wiseman or Lamelo  If I wanted to take an outside pick, Cole Anthony is a good bet"
"All good, anyway, it's pretty much that. Cedi is basically our 3/4 (mostly playing the 3), and Windler was *supposed to be* 2/3 if he could play at all, I wish he was available to help out Sexton at the 2.  Also wish for Porter to be back for the 3, that one is most likely coming soon. Anyway, good game from Cole Anthony, hope to see him more!"
"Yeah, I definitely wish that we have more players available for the next game, our depth chart is looking rough:   &amp;nbsp;  [](/CLE)Cavs|**Starter**|**2nd**|**3rd**|**4th**|**5th**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |PG|~~Darius Garland~~ |~~Dante Exum~~|~~Matthew Dellavedova~~|Collin Sexton|-| |SG|Collin Sexton|~~Dylan Windler~~ |Damyean Dotson|~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |SF|~~Isaac Okoro~~ |~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~|Cedi Osman|~~Dylan Windler~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |PF|~~Kevin Love~~ |Larry Nance Jr.|Cedi Osman|~~Isaac Okoro~~|Dean Wade| |C|Andre Drummond|Larry Nance Jr.|JaVale McGee|~~Kevin Love~~|Thon Maker|   Also, unrelated, but Cole Anthony looked pretty good in there tonight for Orlando."

"More than Hayes, Cole Anthony, Kira Lewis Jr, and maaaaybe Maxey."
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that‚Äôs not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I‚Äôm perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can‚Äôt let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It‚Äôs early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that‚Äôs completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala‚Äôs three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don‚Äôt want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that‚Äôs just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn‚Äôt really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
"Really hoping Cole Anthony pans out.  I think the Magic are in both an exciting and frightening place, being so young and being a playoff team but also stuck hovering around the 8th seed the past couple seasons.  If it continues they'll be in no mans land where 6 seed is the ceiling and 8 seed is the floor -- unable to win it all and unable to get a good pick."
Pretty low for Cole Anthony considering how good he‚Äôs looked his first few career games
Cole Anthony 3rd has been so good this season
"Cole Anthony (semi srs, I think he will be up there when all is said and done)  Actually though:  Dame/Luka/KD for the last shot  Chris Paul for the 4th quarter. I've never seen anyone dominate the 4th quarter so frequently and consistently as CP3."

"Cole Anthony gets ridiculous fouls called for him. Cant break Murray down, puts his shoulder into him, Murray fouled.  Tries to throw a ball over upright Drew, foul on Drew... Wtf"
"&gt;Him, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr, and Jonathan Isaac look like legitimate building blocks for a perennial playoff team.  FTFY."
"Him, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba, and Jonathan Isaac look like legitimate building blocks for a perennial playoff team. No wonder yall didn't mind losing Vucevic and Gordon."
Great game from Cole Anthony
? They did put Cole Anthony
"If anything,  They should have put Cole Anthony instead of Bamba"
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
"I‚Äôve consider him but I have a feeling he‚Äôs going to come back to earth and end up at around 18ppg. What‚Äôs been most impressive about him is his rebounding thus far. Also have thought about Bamba and Cole Anthony but as it stands their starting 5 kinda takes turns having big games. Can agree on Bane, just wanted to throw in a lesser known guy who I‚Äôve really enjoyed this year."
Cole Anthony should be on the list too.
Lmaoo my team is pretty similar except I picked up Cole Anthony off waivers and SHEEESH he‚Äôs the 5th best player in fantasy rn!! Saving my ass
"What makes you say Trae and Luka are leaders? As far as I know they are both more ""lead by example"" types, which usually means they are just the best players but not really a leader.  If we are talking about young players though, Ja tops the list as an immediate leader. I'd also put Cole Anthony and in his own weird way, LaMelo Ball as young leaders on their teams.  I think Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes will be that as well.  I think a lot of it can be developed with experience, but it depends on locker room dynamics as much as anything. Bam wasn't really a leader when he was drafted, but under UD's mentorship he basically has become one. It's not super neccessary with Butler and Lowry there, but he's a good example of someone developing those traits."
"I was thinking MIP too but maybe people would give it to SGA or Ja Morant for the stats (but they started from a higher floor). Miles Bridges, Cole Anthony, some young Knicks could be contenders vs Herro. The Jordan Poole hype hasn't been rewarded quite yet. MPJ has an opportunity but he's squandering it for now."
Damn those are Cole Anthony numbers
Ouch. If anyone needs a confidence booster just know that you didn't trade Cole Anthony for Cade in your fantasy league like I did over the weekend.
"Orlando has a new soul, goes by the name ice Cole Anthony... and #onlyfranz is his sidekick  Jokes asside, Orlando wants to develop the young guys and Ross is looking like he doesnt wanna be there."
"Became a huge fan of Cole Anthony after he torched us (again‚Ä¶), y‚Äôall got a good one"
If Cole Anthony keeps this up it‚Äôs hard not to say him. He‚Äôs looking like an all star already
"For instance, Cole Anthony. Lol"
As a Magic fan him and Cole Anthony have both been phenomenal.
"Cole ""SWOLE"" Anthony should be in the üêê convo"
"Caught the 4th quarter last night, Cole Anthony was cookin the Wolves"
"Cole Anthony being a MIP candidate and nailing the Franz Wagner pick has accelerated our rebuild. There's a lot of hope in the air right now surrounding this team, we've had some close losses and some losses on back-to-backs.  Safe to say I'm feeling great about the future of this team. But even more so if 1. Fultz comes back and somehow can shoot again and 2. If Suggs finds his stroke.  I see a lot of growth from our players under Coach Mosely, he's the perfect coach for this young team. Very happy we blew the team up last year, it was completely necessary."
Cole Anthony over Wiseman too
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony took all of Dame Lillard's energy like the Monstars or some shit. It's hard to say Suggs will be better at this point but that is only because the bar is set high.
Cole Anthony  He was so inefficient last season. He‚Äôs taken that leap this year
Those are awful examples because of the age discrepancies.  Nunn is the closer gap and he's 5 years older than Barrett lol.  Cole Anthony is one year older than Suggs.
Cole Anthony has show more offensively than Isaac ever has.  Sad to say but offensive superstars take you further than defensive superstars.  Isaac was always going to be at best the 2nd option if he didn‚Äôt improve as a scorer.
"Cole Anthony does. He‚Äôs just much more skilled and can become a no.1/2 option and multiple time all star should he keep this up. Suggs has always had a Lowry type ceiling: solid playmaker, great defender, can score every now &amp; then but not a main scorer  They‚Äôre both equal athletes imo so their skill separates them. Suggs is more raw, which makes sense as he only committed to ball a couple years ago"
Cole Anthony looks pretty good imo
"Cole Anthony right now.  When Suggs outplays him, I may change my mind."
"Fultz will come off the bench for a few games no matter what, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to imagine Cole Anthony coming off the bench. If he stays this hot, there's no way a coach could take him out of the starting lineup."
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve had NAW in while Cole Anthony went nuclear‚Ä¶on my bench!
The Magic are plus-37 in 271 minutes with Cole Anthony on the floor and minus-98 in 113 minutes without him.
"I like this magic team. They play well together. I'm a big Cole Anthony guy too. I believe in dude. He's gonna be good, Wendell is awesome too. If I were a magic fan I'd be excited about these guys."
Cole anthony is who tyler hero thinks he is?
Cole Anthony left the Donut Club yesterday with a block!
That sub is so dumb lol they want all the credit to go to the random scrappy dudes and not the actual engines of each team. Sure his lines looked bad and he played some hero ball but a Cole Anthony contested jumper was the best shot that team could generate pretty often.
Does Fultz get his job back if Cole Anthony still playing well.
"Roy recruited Harris who tore his ACL again, Cole Anthony, and whiffed on the Keeling transfer. Not to mention Leaky Black who was supposed to be another Theo Pinson type player did not really improve at all. That team had plenty of ball handlers, just bad luck."

"I'm hearing rumors that ARode and Lore are gonna offer Cole Anthony part of their stake in the team, seeing as he already owns the Wolves it kinda makes sense."
Still think Cole Anthony is the worst passing point guard in the league?
magic low key are fun with dudes like Bamba and Cole Anthony having tremendous seasons out of nowhere!
"wouldn‚Äôt say that stat is any better at showing good passers when cole anthony is ahead of guys like bron, co3, and luka"
"Yeah this is how I feel about Suggs right now. He's tenacious on defense, but his shot isn't quite there and honestly he's the worst 3pt shooter in our starting lineup. Bamba, WCJ, Franz, and Cole all shoot the 3 better than him.  Anthony should continue to get the bulk of the shots on offense, he's by far our best offensive player. His numbers are going to keep rising IMO."
Bro don‚Äôt even start the ‚Äúwho is this guy‚Äù stuff hahaha   He Cole Anthony tho
Bruh what did this team to the Wagner family? Also Cole Anthony is insane. Magic bent us over tonight.
"People sating that are mostly people who don't watch the Magic. RJ Hampton's being pushed to be a wing, and Ross + Harris will be traded, leaving a rotation of Fultz, Suggs, Anthony and MCW - these four can definitely coexist.  As much as I love Cole, I'd like him off the bench - still getting a solid 30+ mins a game but beating up on second units and putting up scorelines like this more often than not."
Get you a big man like Cole anthony to get your rebounds
is Cole Anthony the love child of Carmelo Anthony from Syracuse days? has anyone looked into this??
he had to play against Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony been a flamethrower so far this year. Hope he keeps it up. Magic are young and hungry.
So is cole Anthony for real? I just remember ‚Äúif I got someone on a island they wasn‚Äôt gonna be safe‚Äù. I‚Äôm a fan
Cole Anthony legit put up 31/9/8 and still got outshined
He's been getting better with each game. Wouldn't worry too much. Cole Anthony could hardly do anything right the first half of his rookie year.
"I‚Äôm so sorry that Cole Anthony and Franz Wagner hate Minnesota, Wolves fans.   Wolves had lots of guys injured, but we got some injuries too  ‚Äî A W is a W.  GG."
"Like someone said in the LaMelo thread last night, Cole Anthony needs his own article in the Ringer. Give that man his flowers, Bill!"
"Cole ""Russell 'Muscle Chestbrook' Westbrook"" Anthony"
"Cole Anthony dropping  a casual 31-9-9. For as rough of a team as Orlando is, it really does seem like they are building something there, just needs more time."
Cole Anthony too according to some of our fans.
I'm conflicted do I buy into the Cole Anthony hype or Minnesota hype because when Minny pulls this shit on me
Cole Anthony is hooping
Cole Anthony is nice. I can see him being the next underrated guy
"I‚Äôm a bit lower on Cole Anthony and higher on iq, maxey and vassell and lately toppin‚Äôs looked great too. Still like Stewart and bey but they seem more like good role player with lower ceilings that the guys i mentioned"
Cole Anthony rocks the Timberwolves pt.2
Great I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Still have nightmares about what Cole Anthony did last year.
"Might be a homer for you lol   Check my flair I think Jaden Mcdaniels could‚Äôve gone #5 also, also listed Cole Anthony and Desmond Bane too."
Cole anthony would be 5th for sure
I'd put Cole Anthony over Stewart.
Desmond bane  Cole Anthony  Jaden Mcdaniels   Could all be picked at 5
"Normally I hate these kinds of comments, because they're like ""LOL x team took y player over Kawhi!!?!?""  ...but this one? Yeah, this definitely seemed to be the consensus pick. Along with several others like Vassell, Kira Lewis, Cole Anthony, Saddiq Bey...  The only defense going for this (and the reason why I've defended Jalen Smith so much) is the Cam Johnson pick that worked out so well. I nearly threw my hat in the trash when I saw his name come up in the draft and told myself that I won't be so quick to judge moving forward -- if this becomes a pattern though, then we'll have to see."
"You're kinda forgetting our 3 best players and they are also all 24 and under...  Okeke - 23 years old  Fultz - 23 years old  Issac - 24 years old  Then you go some nice role guys, also young:  WCJ - 22 years oldHampton - 20 years old  Anthony - 21 years old  The future is bright as shit.  We fielded the youngest starting 5 ever in an NBA game. Plus on top of all of that you can see the team really likes playing together. We're just super young and a few of these guys are really going to take next level steps. Cole and Mo are already getting there."
"I'd be pretty damn optimistic if I were a Magic fan.  Suggs' shot hasn't been falling, but he looks incredible aside from that. His numbers are going to look much better once those shots start falling &amp; he starts getting some calls. This season has been hard on rooks simply because the refs are swallowing their whistles more than before.  Cole Anthony looks like he's breaking out in his second season, and Wagner already looks like a starter in this league.  I had doubts about Carter Jr &amp; Bamba starting together, but they've actually been very effective as well. Bamba looks like he's far more engaged especially on the boards - still lots of things to work on in his game but he looks great so far for a guy labeled as a bust for the past 3 years.  Hampton hasn't looked good, and I have no idea what Okeke brings to the table so maybe somebody else can pitch in.  On top of that Isaac &amp; Fultz hasn't even played a single game this season yet, and they'll probably add another lotto pick to this core this season.   My only concern is how much Bamba will look to get paid this off season. If the Magic can keep him on a reasonable deal without overpaying him, they I absolutely love this core going forward. Their cap looks really clean as well (don't think anyone is being paid over 17 per year), and once this group develops to their potential they can really bring some FA and make some big trades like the Bulls did last summer to get them into the playoffs."
Cole Anthony is one of my favorite players in the nba and idk why
Cole Anthony is MVP
Of lineups that have played over 40minutes together the Magic‚Äôs starting lineup of Anthony/Suggs/wagner/Carter jr/Bamba is the best net rating in the league. All 5 starters are under 23.   We are simply bad because of our awful bench and lack of ball handling when Cole Anthony is out.   https://go.nba.com/s384  We also have Isaac and Fultz returning from injury soon and okeke who just did.
Cole Anthony has a better net rating than lamelo. You know what that means? That per minute on the floor the magic with Cole play better than the hornets with lamelo. Do you have a retort to that? Please keep the emotions out of it. Is the magic having a historically bad bench and collapsing when Cole isn‚Äôt playing evidence that Cole is bad to you?
Maybe if youre this insecure about your player you should write him an article and try to convince everyone Cole Anthony scrub ass tanking stats make him remotely comparable to LaMelo
Nobody paying to watch Cole Anthony
Thanks to ish smith lol. Lamelo only played 24 minutes and was -7. Ish smith played 24 and was +16. Cole Anthony played 35 and was +10.
"&gt;Cole Anthony is currently balling and looks like he's poised to be the Magic's lead initiator  yes to the first part, no to the latter. He's not a real pg, neither is Suggs. Cole is what everyone dreams for in a 6th man, Fultz starts at pg and Suggs at SG. There's not much to work out here lol."
"Never seen this much hype about a guy averaging 19 on well below average efficiency and very bad defense.  Cole Anthony is having a better season so far, where is his article?"
"Jonathan Isaac, Cole Anthony, Jalen Suggs, Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr"
Melo and Ant. I also think Cole Anthony will be an all star in the next 5 years.
I Stan for my boy Cole Anthony. 17.7/ 7.4 boards/  5.3 dimes on 44.4FG% (42.2 3%) and 81% FT. Our team is just bad bad.
The one year UNC got a top 3 recruit and the whole team sold.  Probably why Cole Anthony fell so much in the draft.
I like the idea of Cole Anthony off the bench in a Jordan Clarkson role. He can create his own shot better than Fultz.
Cole Anthony rebounding like (last year‚Äôs) Josh Hart
Cole Anthony averaging 17/7/5 on 44/42/81 shooting splits so far
"It's horrible defense. Cole Anthony missing a free cut by Franz because Cade lost track of his man: https://i.imgur.com/bMWd30i.jpeg  Then bit hard on a spin move, but Franz didn't take the uncontested 10 foot jump shot: https://i.imgur.com/P8t84Pj.jpeg  Franz Wagner proceeds to play black hole hero ball while losing the ball."
Man that‚Äôs gonna be a really solid lineup in a few years. I‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt a big believer in Cole Anthony but he‚Äôs been playing great.

I think Pat is better than Cole Anthony but yeah the draft is rough. It's not as bad as advertised but it's mostly just full of roleplayers or starters and not all stars like 2018.
Damn the 3rd best player from that draft right now ain‚Äôt even on that list (Cole Anthony)
"Cole Anthony again with a double double in rebounds... listed 6'2"" probably shorter"
"Hes not on the level of any of these guys, but Cole Anthony has very smooth handles.  it feels very subtle and refined compared to the flashy handles you see from someone like LaMelo"
"Not sure if Cole Anthony was considered a bust his first few years in the NBA. I just remember he was great in college, then I forgot about him for 2 years and poof im hearing about him again."
Cole Anthony might become the best player from the 2020 draft
"Cole Anthony, u casual :)"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
Cole Anthony by a decent margin
Cole Anthony.  He took such a jump to the point where he is able to make shots that guys like Dame Lillard can make.  He has to be better at finishing and getting to the line if he wants to make a superstar jump but he's a borderline all star as a shot creator now.
"Suggs is ass so far, Cole Anthony by far"
"Cole Anthony handles most of the offensive workload but Mamba, WCJ, and Franz Wagner have all played well. The team is so young that it‚Äôs one of those things where the best player can extremely vary depending on the night."

Us take away cole Anthony and we are winless this year.
Ehh Cole Anthony
The ease with how Cole Anthony is able to move Mo Bamba should be concerning to Magic fans
cole anthony is a bad man
Cole Anthony has been surprisingly good
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
I think Cole Anthony will be a much better player than his dad.
"Orlando has had breakout seasons from Cole Anthony and Mo Bamba, and are still short key rotation players, including Isaac. They are gonna be a late season nightmare for some teams who don't realize how rock solid they are. Nobody elite, but if Suggs starts coming around late season, with Anthony, Isaac, Bamba, Carter, Wagner, and Hampton could really be a ""late season hot team that people look at next year like they could be a player"" situation."
Cole Anthony is pretty fun
"I caught a random Orlando game recently (the one where Cole Anthony had a couple of really nice clutch buckets and I think 30+ points) and I really liked his vibe in the postgame interview, during which MVP chants were discussed and he acknowledged the presence of the home crowd. Really nice wholesome moment to watch."
Cole Anthony.
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
"Lamelo , cole anthony, and Anthony Edwards bring so much fun to the game with their personalities"
"The Magic. Cole Anthony is a stud, I'm rooting for my guy Wendell &amp; I'm still waiting for my Chuma &amp; Fultz stock to take off."
Moochie Norris Cole Anthony Davis Bertans

I mean. I don't know about that.   Devin Vassell is looking good. Then there's Halliburton and Cole Anthony.   Bane is making a case for most improved.   Then got guys like Sadiq Bey and Quickly who are growing  and contributing and putting up solid numbers.   I think the draft is looking pretty average.  But I wouldn't call it rough just yet.
"Can we talk about how nice that pass was by Cole Anthony, goddamn."
Cole Anthony looks like JarJar Binks
"I remember Cole Anthony was ranked as a top 5 prospect before college, but he got injured"
Cole Anthony?
"Cole Anthony?  Also he won't win, but Harrison Barnes is randomly having a career best season in almost every stat category."
Cole Anthony
JA or Bridges or Cole Anthony are the leaders right now.  Jordan Poole's got a lot of work to do if he wants to be MIP.  He may be avg more points but he's doing so strictly on more volume.  Currently he's shooting 43% FG 31% 3PT.  Lucky there's still a ton left in the season for Poole to find his groove.
How dare you leave Cole Anthony. He is MIP in my heart
Yeah if Cole Anthony isn‚Äôt in the discussion then Maxey shouldn‚Äôt either
"RJ usually guards the best Wing not best Guard. So if you look at our games, guys like Tatum and DeRozan had rough games due to RJ guarding them but Ricky Rubio and Cole Anthony looked like Steph and Kobe with Evan and Kemba guarding them"
"Nah they overall play better. Example, when we played the bucks the other day the starters put us in a 24 point hole if I remember correctly. Thibs literally left the bench in the entire 4th and they almost brought us back.   Another example is against the magic, the starters did nothing to contain Cole Anthony and Terrance Ross, when the bench comes it they played a lot better  The Cavs is another example too. The starters are playing like dogshit"
Cole Anthony in the under 6‚Äô3 category he goes out to obliterate the rim
Cole Anthony &amp; Mo Bamba borderline all-stars right now (Probably a stretch)
"Cole Anthony got 16 boards against the Knicks, as well - coincidence?"
We gave up 16 to Cole Anthony as well
Cole anthony too
"There's an argument, Cole Anthony is pretty damn good though"
"If you don‚Äôt think Cole Anthony having a break out season, mo bamba finally looking good, and Franz looking like an amazing rookie idk what to say. Along with that we are missing 2 starters."
Mo Bamba / Cole Anthony
"Idk, Herro is probably still ahead in voting right now.  Strictly talking sophomore players, him and Cole Anthony are leading the pack though."
"**Best:**  - Sweet Franz making our whole sub look stupid.  - WCJ becoming our most reliable player.   - Cole Anthony showing glimpses of superstardom.  - Being a fun team with loads of potential.  **Worst:**  - Suggs being awful.  - Terrence Ross forgetting how to shoot.  - Being very young and experienced, and consequently getting blown out of the building every other game."
"Twolves, Pacers, Bulls, Nuggets and Magic all have 5s who shoot.   Trades could be:  Twolves - Beasley + Russell + Pick   Pacers - Brogdon when he‚Äôs allowed to be traded  Bulls - idk I wish Zach Lavine was worse so it could happen   Nuggets - probably no deal here unless they wanna sell low on MPJ and the Sixers want 2 guys with injury problems   Magic - Jonathan Isaac and cole Anthony? Idk"
"It‚Äôs a Cole Anthony world, knicks just living in it"
Cole Anthony. It‚Äôs a toss up between those two. I‚Äôd personally take maxey because he‚Äôs done work on a legit contender.
Cole Anthony
"Hey man at least you have Cole anthony to look forward too, he‚Äôs playing out of his mind this year"
"Not on the level of Lavine/WB, but I've been surprised by athletic Cole Anthony has looked this year. Gets major ups on rebounds and tries for vicious dunks"
"Cole Anthony would be even better as the 6th man once Markelle &amp; J.I. come back. Our bench is a disaster, and having someone who can initiate the offense and actually shoulder the scoring load on a consistent basis would give us a chance at winning a few more games this year. Don't get me wrong, his play this year is amazing, and he should probably be our starter in the years to come, but to help us this year, he should come off the bench."
"He obviously means for the position that D'Lo plays and has played for his entire career. Even then, if you look it that way D'Lo isn't even the best guard in his own team.  By the way, names like Beal, LaVine, Jimmy, Jaylen, Mitchell, Booker, CJ, Ant and SGA help the cause, so D'Lo is a Top 25-30ish guard in this league depending on whether or not you think he is better than guys like Hield, Cole Anthony, Klay and other names i didn't mention.  He is an average guard, point guard, combo guard, school guard, whatever he is average."
and Cole Anthony and Grayson Allen and Terrance Ross and the entire Toronto Raptors
It‚Äôd be really dope if Cole Anthony would rattle off over 15.5 points soon
Cole Anthony
"Cole Anthony been lighting it up, one to watch"
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
Anthony Cole
Cole Anthony for MVP
OP gave MIP to Cole Anthony
"C, you're sleeping on soon to be 2022 Finals MVP Cole Anthony"
"I dropped Maxey, bad decision, but I got Cole Anthony after he was dropped by someone else, good decision"
"Mo Bamba, Wagner and Cole Anthony‚Ä¶"
Cole Anthony FMVP
"Luka, Trae, LaMelo, Ja, Cole Anthony, Tyrese Maxey, a lotta dudes COULD win mvp but I don't think a point guard is actually gonna win any time soon, too many wings and big men are staying dominant in the league"
The Jazz are lucky Cole Anthony doesn‚Äôt play for the Hawks!
"Right now I'd say LaMelo, Edwards, Cole Anthony, Haliburton, and Saddiq Bey are better. I'm also buying all the Wiseman stock still, he wasn't up to expectations but wasn't as bad as people think he was. We haven't seen him yet this year and Maxey has taken a leap so Maxey ahead of him but long term I think I'd take Wiseman"
Cole Anthony gonna be so good man
"I mean outside of LaMelo (who is clearly the best) and Edwards (who is clearly the 2nd best), he could reasonably end up in 3rd.   Currently, he's competing for that 3rd place spot with Cole Anthony, Tyrese Haliburton, and Desmond Bane (Patrick Williams would be up there too but he's hurt)"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy. The 4-10 spots haven‚Äôt really had a breakout player (poor Pat‚Ä¶), and Maxey is joining Cole Anthony on the possible ‚Äú2nd year break out‚Äù club. I‚Äôd say his chances of being a good starting PG is pretty good."
"Check on the homie Cole Anthony before you jump to any conclusions. Suggs has passed the eye test, lock down defender and gets to his spots the shots will fall eventually."
Yes his name is Cole Anthony
I‚Äôm wondering how bad was garland in his rookie year bc I remember a lot of ppl being low on him after his rookie year. And with Cole Anthony killing it early on kind of reminds me of sexton starting off well last year. Basically just wondering if the magic could find themselves in a Cavs-ish position in the future. Maybe the pure scorer ends up winning out this scenario
"It's harder to be a PG in this league than anything else. You need to have basically no weaknesses to even be an average PG or you need to be elite in some categories. You can't be, for example, bad on defense and ok at everything else. You can't be bad at shooting and ok at everything else. That skillset will have you near the bottom of the league.   Especially for these PGs who come in and don't have great players around them or a mentor ahead of them in the rotation I've found they tend to struggle a lot early on.  PGs tend to either immediately look like future stars within a couple weeks (Luka, Ja, LaMelo) or they really struggle early on and build their way into a good player (look at Cole Anthony this year for example)"
**Cole Anthony**  20.2 PTS / 7.1 REB / 5.2 AST   on   44 FG% / 41.3 3FG% / 84.2 FT% (58.8 TS%)
"brown averaged 7/3/1 on almost league average efficiency. he didn‚Äôt play a lot but he was a decent backup as a rookie, while suggs is more in the mold of the high minutes/usage, shit efficiency rookie like ingram and cole anthony"
Suggs isn't really even the lead ball handler thus far though. Cole Anthony has been great initiating offense for Orlando.
"Or in their 2nd, 3rd year, like Cole Anthony, Jordan Poole etc. It's way too early to tell, some people are just not good in their rookie year."
"Both Isaac and Fultz have been out for a long time, especially Isaac, and the starters are killing it right now, so I expect the two of them to come off the bench initially. After that probably Isaac will be a starter, but the guards situation is more unpredictable. It really depends whether Suggs has found his shot by then and if Cole Anthony had come back to Earth, so far he's been shooting like a prime Dame off the dribble."
Cole Anthony / Evan Mobley / Gary Trent Jr
"Thanks, Captain Obvious.  My main point is that his on/off is very close to that of 3 of the other starters and the one standout from the group is Cole Anthony. And in fact, when I looked at the data, in the minutes the other 4 starters have played together without Suggs so far, their net rating has been -13.8 due to a massive drop off defensively. Yes, small sample size, but still his impact defensively has been huge statistically and the eye test confirms it."
"Not really, his on/off is 4th among our starters, just slightly worse than Wagner and Wendell Carter Jr.'s and slightly better than Bamba's, the only starter that stands out in on/off is Cole Anthony, who has an absurd +35.2 so far."
[Cole Anthony last year](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerExperience=Rookie&amp;DateTo=01%2F14%2F2021)
I just searched Cole Anthony stare and I‚Äôm now slightly uncomfortable.
I love Cole Anthony
I thank god for the Kemba signing which allowed the Celtics to pass on Cole Anthony
We learned last night from Cole Anthony that RJ Hampton‚Äôs real name is Roderick.  Or at least I didn‚Äôt know that.
"Its been 10 games lmao. With your stupid take it would mean that Harrison Barnes is better than Embiid as well, or that Cole Anthony is better than Damian Lillard."
1.	Lamelo  2.	Anthony Edwards 3.	Cole Anthony     ‚Äî‚Äî  1.	Luka Doncic 2.	Ja Morant 3.	Zion Williamson 4.	Trae Young
Cole Anthony is my favorite player that I've never actually watched play
"One of these players doesn‚Äôt belong here.  We have a set of top picks, some with the capacity to be generational talents. And then (because presumably you‚Äôre a magic fan) we‚Äôve got Cole Anthony. He‚Äôs had a nice start to the season, he isn‚Äôt in this conversation yet."
"y‚Äôall can save this comment‚Ä¶ cole anthony should have been on this roster, and will be a top 15 PG in the league within the next 5 years."
"Well this was their Finals opponent's lineup  F Haslem, Udonis  F James, LeBron  C Bosh, Chris  G Wade, Dwyane  G Chalmers, Mario  Backup  Battier, Shane  Anthony, Joel  Cole, Norris  Miller, Mike  And the GOAT  Jones, James"
"I mean, they‚Äôd have to give up 5 and something, even if it‚Äôs just 5 and cole Anthony, You‚Äôd still get more just taking him and getting something extra in exchange with Orlando. Even if they go full hard ball mode on the pick."
"Are you suggesting my roster of;   PG - Cole Anthony  SG - Cam Reddish  SF - Josh Jackson  PF - Marvin Bagley  C - Skal Labissiere  Isn‚Äôt going to win 5 straight titles?   But yeah in all reality, so many guys that are just athletic 6‚Äô7 or taller guys are dominant high school players because no one can match their size/speed. Once they play higher level and everyone is that fast/big it‚Äôs more based on their skills, so how good they were compared to other 16-17 year olds doesn‚Äôt matter."
"Their last drafts have been fine.   Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke, Jonathan Isaac were all good picks. Bamba, maybe not."
"Very interested in Bagley, Cole Anthony and Nassir Little"
"KPJ, SGA, Cole Anthony, Grant Riller, Pat Will, Okoro, Kira Lewis, Poku, Jalen Green"
"We dominate the role player game. Ellington, Bullock, Cam Johnson, Barnes. We also got some young studs in Coby and Cole Anthony"
I'm from NYC and hes from the area considered the NYC metro area. It's just that his facial expressions remind me of some of my friends I grew up with. Its complicated but even the way he stands and has his arms idk it just makes sense.  I think it's easy to identify people from this region. For example first time Cole Anthony opened his mouth I knew he was from NYC.
Magic have Fultz and they just drafted Cole Anthony
"Since they‚Äôve had access to this they‚Äôve drafted Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, and basically rj hampton (organization wanted him, ended up trading for him). All good picks, all probably outperformed their draft position. Early to tell for sure but I‚Äôm pretty happy as a fan"
"well since we have like, no scorers, i'ma go with Cole Anthony, has to put up 20+ PPG simple because *someone* on this team has to... right?"
"Immanuel Quickley 6MOTY  Cam Johnson, Jonathan Isaac, Nassir Little, Cole Anthony take huge jumps"
Yk who also averaged 10 in highschool cole Anthony
"Orlando :  Cole Anthony, Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Isaac, Sabonis"
Our bench is unbelievably bad. Cole Anthony +15 in 35 minutes and the rest of the team -22 in 13 minutes.   Cole has a positive net rating despite our team as a whole being mind bogglingly shitty -12.4. We desperately need Fultz back to stabilize our bench. RJ Hampton ain‚Äôt a point guard and Suggs isn‚Äôt ready to lead good units.
They looked great last night. Suggs is starting to come into his own. Cole Anthony is awesome. Wagner looked solid too. They're going to be giving teams trouble even if they don't win that many.
yea I been watching a few game and that kid got game plus very unicorn-like mobility for being 7footrr‚Ä¶with him and cole anthony they got a nice young squad there
"I‚Äôm fully on the ‚Äúcompete and build good winning habits and see what happens‚Äù rather than the ‚Äúlets not try to win for 3 years and hope and pray we get a high pick‚Äù Magic have solid pieces, I really like Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony"
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."

Cole Anthony is the least photogenic young PG in the NBA
Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
Did you just George Paul Cole Anthony? LOL
Y'all did real good this year. Suggs is a slower burn than Mobley or Barnes but he'll be great nonetheless and Wagner is a solid role player at worst.  Bamba finally panning out means a hit on all the lottery picks (plus Cole Anthony) from the last three years.
"Cole Anthony is making a leap. If he can improve his shot a bit, he‚Äôs going to make them competitive."
"I'm happy to see it tbh, I wanted us to trade up and grab Cole Anthony badly in that draft lol. Glad to see him panning out"
That timeout near the end where you guys looked like you were about to score... Even Cole Anthony was like cmon bruh
"good defense poking the ball loose, followed by boneheaded attempt to steal the ball that he had no chance of getting, which led to Cole Anthony getting a clean look (although from half court)."
"Lol, that was just a meme from something Cole Anthony said."
"Man, Cole Anthony is really good."
Cole Anthony confirmed real #3 pick of the draft.
A portion of our fanbase hates him because another portion constantly talking about how ‚ÄúSuggs is also great!‚Äù  Like Cole Anthony had a great game for the Magic and this dude is still talking about Suggs.
You're right about Suggs but I've never heard anyone talk about Cole Anthony?
Who was ever going to say anything about Cole Anthony? He‚Äôs irrelevant to Raptors fans.
Got PTSD from the Jeremy Lamb game winner when Cole Anthony took the shot üò≠
Cole Anthony may be playing the 3rd best basketball of the 2020 draft right now.
GG  Cole Anthony was fucking legit
Cole Anthony is a fucking problem.
"Anthony Cole blew that final play but man, he has flashes of greatness. He will get there."
"Raptors fans better not say a fucking WORD about Gary Trent Jr, Cole Anthony or Jalen Suggs after this game lmao."
"If that last shot went in, I think I would have went for a long long walk. Great game by all the rooks. Cole Anthony lit us the fuck up."
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
"Well it's official, after tonight's game we can stop the debates and declare a winner... Cole Anthony is better than Malachi Flynn"
OMG Cole Anthony is DYING STOP THE GAME
is cole anthony always this banging
Cole Anthony is a certified Raptor killer
Cole anthony looks so much like his pops lmao
I wasn't expecting Cole Anthony to make a huge leap. Thought he'd be just your prototypical decent backup PG.
I love Cole Anthony
At least Cole Anthony has looked really good for the Magic
You‚Äôre sleeping on what Cole Anthony did too. 16 rebounds for a 6‚Äô2‚Äù lad
Zion Morant  Cole Young  Lamelo Anthony  Trae Edwards  Anthony Doncic
"1) Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Cole Anthony.  2) Luka Donnakick, trae young, Zion Williamson( assuming he‚Äôs the 27 ppg 60% fg beast he was last season) and ja morant."
You existed yesterday I'd say :-) Wish you guys didn't that loss sucked for the Jazz. Cole Anthony is a baller.
Cole Anthony is a bucket. I really hope he has an awesome career in the league.
Give it to Cole Anthony you cowards
"I'll keep saying. No matter how the Magic do as a team, Cole Anthony will ball out this season."
"Cole Anthony isn't an outlier though. There are currently other players that are more deserving of MIP, who aren't sophomores."
"""Facts üëÄ"" - Cole Anthony."
&gt;Cole Anthony currently leads the league in pull-up threes  He's tied for 8th in the league in pull up 3PM. Garland has made more at a higher percentage in fewer games.  https://go.nba.com/ijz8
Tough looking at this knowing we lost to the magic yesterday. 7 games in 9 days all in different cities tho. Oh well. Props to Cole Anthony
How on earth did Cole Anthony get that many rebounds what the hell.
Cole Anthony looked great when the Raps played Magic. Dude has been balling out.  Def a possible MIP candidate in my books.
"Not going to lie, on draft day I told my friends Cole Anthony was going to be a huge bust."
I had no idea Cole Anthony was Greg's son!
Cole Anthony is shooting like prime Steph Curry and Draymond is shooting FTs like prime shaq
"COLE ""FACTS"" ANTHONY"
Elfrid Payton for Cole Anthony who says no?
Stone Cole Steve Anthony...
Jermaine Cole Anthony
"If Cole Anthony keeps balling like this, I think he deserves to be in contention.   There are cases where a 2nd year player has won it due to not being on the radar in their rookie year (Monta Ellis is one example I know from memory). I think this can be one of those cases."
Cole Anthony is avg 20 7 and 5 like prime Scottie Pippen out there.  Facts.
Wtf I love Cole Anthony
We want SGA and Cole Anthony in the game and not taking no for an answer NBA

Cole Anthony
Lol I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve discovered the magic of Cole Anthony post game interviews.
"I love cole Anthony. No matter what happens for that team, he's gonna ball"
Last year‚Äôs draft class. Seems like having a ‚Äòsophomore slump‚Äô doesn‚Äôt apply to them.   Especially for Cole Anthony.
Cole Anthony or Logan Murdock?
I wish my girl would stare at me like Cole Anthony in a post-game interview
Cole Anthony is my favorite NBA player outside of the Knicks? What?
Cole Anthony
And to think I picked this man from free agency the second day of the season. Him and cole Anthony are feasting
"Indiana has to be the least covered team in the league by a HUGE margin. Even with A player like Sabonis I don‚Äôt hear a single thing about them ever. Like, even the magic get some coverage for Mo Bamba and now Cole Anthony."
Because he's not Cole Anthony.
Cole anthony is dame lillard
"Lol, you can tell who‚Äôs a casual when they say Edwards is funnier because he has more chuckles per interview. If you look at chuckles/36, Cole Anthony is way more productive."
Cole Anthony is averaging 20/7/5 in his second year. He could be the superstar Orlando has been missing since Dwight.
"The on/off for the Magic is all messed up due to the team having no legitimate backup Point Guard.   Basically, whenever Cole Anthony goes off the court the offense completely stops functioning and their offensive rating drops to an unbelievably bad 82.3."
Cole Anthony is pure BDE
"Bridges for sure as of right now, especially since the Hornets will be in the playoffs conversation, but Cole Anthony is going to have a case if he keeps this up."
Cole Anthony has been playing incredibly well
Because Cole Anthony is hooping.
Cole Anthony is a superstar
"and that's the bottom line, coz Cole Anthony said so!"
Cole Anthony is now my favorite player
"It's simple, they all shoot better than Suggs right now and they're all decoys for Cole Anthony anyway."
"Mo Bamba 2.0 for the Magic. Cole Anthony is just playing too good right now, just like how Vuc became an all-star caliber player right after drafting Bamba."
Cole Anthony is your favorite players favorite player
"He's been pretty unreliable so far to be honest. Also, Cole Anthony is currently playing like a star which doesn't help his case."
"Glad to see him playing so well. He always had the talent but for some reason it was never really utilized in Chicago, or he wasn't really given the opportunity.  The front court match with Bamba is looking real nice too. Orlando is gonna be spooky once Isaac is back, especially with how good Cole Anthony is looking"
[Anytime I see Cole Anthony](https://streamable.com/hs5v4f).
The Jazz are lucky Cole Anthony and the Magic reside in the Eastern conference or else there would be more first round exits for the Jazz.
There was a redditor that posted multiple times about Cole Anthony sleeping with his HS GF. Cole apologized tho and I respect that that‚Äôs what I did with my homie.
Speaking of Cole Anthony comparisons how‚Äôs summer league legen Malachi Flynn doing?
"[Cole ""Wallid Ismail"" Anthony](https://youtu.be/R2teGs2K51A?t=259)"
I still kinda wish we had Vuc and Fournier.  This Cole Anthony is what we were missing ironically all those years
Cole Anthony is nasty. He was on fire when we played earlier
"You might wonder how I found myself in this predicament, it all started when somebody said ""Cole Anthony is worse than Elfrid Payton"""
This Cole Anthony guy is pretty good
Cole. Anthony.
I found out last night that Cole Anthony is Greg Anthony‚Äôs son from 2K22‚Äôs in game commentary.
Cole Anthony

Cole Anthony
"Cole Anthony is my favorite player on this team for sure, and by far the funniest dude in the NBA."
In Cole Anthony we trust!!!!!
"Cole Anthony is playing like a legit all star, it's bananas"
"Love watching this team, dope to see Coach Mo get his first home win.  Cole Anthony and WCJ, just a couple bad men, love to see it"
Cole Anthony is a mad brotherfucker
Post Cole Anthony getting MVP chants
Cole Anthony
Cole Anthony
"Jazz were clearly tired, but fuck man we should have been able to hold that lead.  Cole Anthony is a baller and I feel like that was a character building win for the young Magic squad"
Cole Anthony
If Cole Anthony doesn‚Äôt slow down he might find himself on an All Star team.
Cole Anthony is an all star. What a fucking ending.
Don't compare Cole Anthony and Payton Pritchard again
Cole Anthony is the real deal
Cole Anthony is gonna be a star!
Cole Anthony is a mfinhg baller
Cole Anthony is a bad mfer
Cole Anthony is pretty good
Cole Anthony has some ups!
seriously i didnt know much about cole but ever since he absolutely shit on the Knicks earlier this year I love cole anthony
Strengths: Cole Anthony  Weaknesses: basketball in general
Meh. Id put Cole Anthony over mo
"Cole Anthony has impressed me as a Magic fan. Even though he's a second year guy and a leap is somewhat expected, this dude has really been consistent as a scorer and an incredible rebounder for his position."
