That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.

Been looking at All-Star lists on Twitter and lots of people are voting for Collin Sexton so I think he could potentially get in.
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
Collin Sexton. Dude’s different.
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Wolves just don’t have a lot of eyes on them. Plus there’s already a crowded field of candidates like Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, SGA, and Jerami Grant taking up most of the mip discussion"
Collin Sexton would like a word.
"I agree with everything you said. But I also disagree with the original poster's implication that one guy's opinion was inherently better because I watched the games. Many people probably aren't watching Cavs games this year, but if I said that Collin Sexton was a top 5 guard many people would (rightfully) think I was crazy. There were legitimate reasons for concern over Lamelo's NBA prospects that were shared by both casual fans and more serious scouts. The main thing that I think was wrong with the linked thread was how disrespectful everyone was to him for his take, not that he was correct and they weren't."
If you haven’t already: go listen to Collin Sexton on the Lowe Post. Interesting guy. I really enjoyed the interview
Lmao Jamal Murray with that Collin Sexton two for one defense
"East is loaded though. You still have Harden, Kyrie, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Collin Sexton is improving quickly.  Not saying RJ has no chance, but good chance is a little optimistic imo  Though the Knicks do have a ton of fans so it’s possible he gets voted in"
FWIW nets pick ended up being Collin Sexton
Nets pick turned into Collin Sexton

"I hate having to defend Payton, but there is logic in all this. Payton actually does play good defense against starting PGs. He tends to keep opposing PGs below their averages. Collin Sexton scored 17 tonight. He's also played well against Steph Curry and others. He's taken the pressure away from IQ from having to face elite players as he adjusts to the NBA and gives him freedom to do his thing against bench players. I think it's allowed IQ to adjust faster than normal."
"Don't get mad at me , I wanna ask that if  Irving-Harden-Durant is the best trio , so why is Collin Sexton able to beat 'em all twice single-handedly ?"
"As long as Collin Sexton is an all-star, I don't care who else gets in."
Collin Sexton tamed them...............
Trae will most likely win the fan vote. But Collin Sexton is averaging 25+ and the Cavs are 6th in the East tied with Atlanta. He should get consideration to be a reserve at least and if you don't think that you haven't been watching basketball.
Vote Collin Sexton or die :)
Collin Sexton will start his own team and play them 1-on-5.
"Lamelo, Anthony Edwards, ja morant, Zion Williamson, SGA, Collin Sexton, the Celtics superstars (Brown and Tatum are both near superstars), Embiid , Ben Simmons , De’Aron Fox , there’s so much talent in the league rn you can go on and on ."

"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"Sexton 7-8 at half but is turning it over way too much, drummond is 1 board away from his double and has 4 first half steals. lots of hustle from drummond tonight, but we have our typical problems with turnovers. Hopefully Collin keeps shooting lights out and Drummond doesnt give up, and Allen(no boards) can get himself going."
I would like to start my campaign by saying that both Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner definitely deserve all-star spots.   Malcolm Brogdon should get consideration. Probably either him or Collin Sexton should be the last guard.
"Disagree. Top 25 refers to who, in this moment, is playing the best in the league. You don’t seem as stupid as the other guy, but just to clarify, I didn’t say KAT was top 25. He’s played 4 games and he hasn’t been particularly impactful. There are other guys who are balling rn (Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and Collin Sexton to name a few) and deserve to be top 25 right now."
I must get Collin Sexton a nod
"my bad, you are right. Kyrie is still averaging less than Sexton...I guess I'll have to wait till the sample size gets bigger, but the future looks bright for Collin and I am happy for him."

COLLIN FUCKING SEXTON
"Hindsight is 2020. Collin Sexton is looking great though, and so is Garland. LeBron coming back soon haha"
"I think Collin is doing good this season. With that said, why do you think he got robbed? They already have a lot of guards and they are adding 2 new ones in Ja Morant and Trae Young to the pool. Do you think Collin Sexton is better than either of them? I don't."
"&gt; Collin Sexton is good, but He's no Kyrie Irving though  Considering all of the baggage that comes with Kyrie, and with how injury prone he is, I'd take Sexton over him right now."
&gt; Collin Sexton has a TS of 61%. You'd see that and think oh he's pretty efficient but nothing crazy   27ppg on 61 TS% is pretty crazy though? It lines up with the best scorers in the league.
"If it was only Collin sexton sure but we were able to get prince, nance,Allen and Drummond cuz of this trade also"
"listen, I know Cleveland feels good since they beat the nets twice, but I promise you, that trade package for Kyrie was horrible. Don't let recency bias tell you otherwise. Collin Sexton is good, but He's no Kyrie Irving though."
Collin Sexton robbed smh
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Collin Sexton BIG TIME I been keeping an eye on Collin Sexton ever since Lil Yachty first mentioned him in a song. (Yachty and other ATL rappers shout out Sexton a lot)  At Alabama he was an absolute beast. Can get a bucket instinctively. Plays hard all the time. Has a mf engine boy don’t ever get tired. And He can shoot and get to the CUP easy.  Then he got draft by the Cavs he played really well as a rookie and got really high Usage. He is not Lebron as a rookie but Kylie is comparable. If Luka and Trae Young player Kyrie rookie season he wouldn’t see no ROY trophy either.  Now fast toward two years later he has had leaps of improvement in shooting efficiency, he’s automatic at the line and defense went from none existent to an occasional appearance.   Collin drops big offensive numbers all the time he’s becoming a better playmaker and he’s just fun to watch. Also he’s a bucket on 2k21.   Collin  Sexton is a future star in this league   The only guys on this list close to his potential is Ayton, Jackson, Sabonis, Collins in that order them other guards he not on his level Murray is closest."

"&gt; Sexton’s ascent is the story of self-improvement through sheer will power, the idea that play can upstage politics and old-fashioned hard work can get you anywhere.  &gt; Over the course five months, he went from unranked to the No. 9 overall player in his class, according to ESPN.

Again, I hope he proves me wrong bc thats what its all about, but we'll both find out in time. Thanks for chatting with me and have a nice week :)))"

SEXTON RIGHT DOWN EUCLID! CONVENIENT BANKING HOURS FOR COLLIN SEXTON!
“Collin Sexton should be a 6th man”
"And an interview from the Nets Pick himself, Collin Sexton."
"The Nets will have nightmares about Collin Sexton tonight, in which they will need to guard him."
What if I told you Collin Sexton had an outstanding game and we should be giving him credit for what he did instead of bashing the Nets for what they didn't do?
collin sexton treated kevin durant guarding him how kevin durant would treat collin sexton guarding him what the fuck
"realistically:  Nets big three debut SPOILED by young Collin Sexton! 42/5/5, 20 straight, 2 OT THRILLER"
Or Collin Sexton
Am I late to the party? Is Collin Sexton legit and I was sleeping?
This thread is over reaction city. The only logical conclusions from this game are that Collin Sexton is a very good young player and the New look Nets need more than a game to figure things out
"If you like a gritty underdog story with incredible highs, devastating lows, and lovable young knuckle heads coming together to strangle any bit of recognition and attention from the star studded league there is no better choice than the Cleveland Cavaliers   You'd be walking in at an opportune time as well seeing as how our storylines and narratives are all fresh young and twisting and turning as we speak, it may seem unpredictable at times but we always BELIEVE in CLEVELAND   Though you may want to scuttle in now while the iron is hot- the KPJ Saga might be coming to a close and we just beat a super team after our #2 Young Bull, Collin 'Sexman' Sexton just achieved his next level of power to put our old superstar #2 Kyrie irving and the Nets to bed in a double OT  Imo we're easily one of the most gripping teams to watch, they won't fail to keep you on your toes (hell of an emotional rollercoaster to ride sometimes though)  Well come on then! Join the fight! For glory! For honor! For some God damn respect plain and simple! All for one and one for all! Go Cavs!  (This concludes my teaser for the Cleveland Cavaliers anime; season 50 ⚔️)"
poor mans collin sexton
"Yeah SexLand is kind of the vision of the future, of course predominantly leaning on Sexton's talents while Garland is set to be more of an Orchestrater (with a nice scoring kick once his nerves harden up)   The original vision seemed to be along the lines of a rough, fast, hardworking squad that utilizes a lot of team play   (which is kind of where Garlands style falls into play.)   The plan was definitely to be a more dangerous offensive force but if KPJ has really been waived than I don't know how deep we're gonna go in that direction.  Plus Sexton has this bad habit of 'tensing up' in tight situations. When the pressure is on the ball gets sticky glued to his hand;   (probably since he's been a carrying force his entire career up to this point where he's surrounded by NBA level talent)   Garland's more fluid style helps alleviate that some and helps get and keep guys like Cedi, LNJ, And Drummond hot since Bickerstaff is aiming for that team approach. Thinking about now yeah the bigs definitely wouldn't benefit as much if we went back to just Sexton, plus I think he's melded into SG nicely   In short: Collin is the Heart, Garland is the Brain"

Luka was already amazing at that point in 2018.  Ayton was a double double machine already.  JJJ averaging 1.6 blocks in 36 games of his rookie year.  Trae Young in 36 games averaged 15.6 and about 7 assists.  And Collin Sexton averaged 14.7 points in 37 games.  &amp;#x200B;  It's safe to say that there isn't much upside potential yet with this class compared to the previous two classes.
Fr this has huge jinx potential after that Collin sexton players tribune article
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
It’s all on context. Look at how much his usage and ISO’s spiked since he went to Cleveland. They’ve given him free reign to post up and ISO which he cannot do whatsoever. You take out the fluff from his game and he’s a great lob finisher. He’s one of the better lob threats in the league and he’s never played with anyone that draws as many defenders as Luka (he’s played with Reggie Jackson and Collin Sexton most of his career). I think he’d kill it with Luka
"I mean in that scenario we also have Collin Sexton, which would have fit the Jays timeline pretty well. But yeah, in the short term we absolutely would have been worse off.  Alternatively if Kyrie could have kept his ego in check during the Bucks series, maybe we make a finals trip."
Collin Sexton often stays on the court after games to practice putting up shots.
Did Collin Sexton and Jaylen Brown die? They definitely make a good case this season as well.
The same was said about Collin Sexton previously
&gt; Can't wait to watch Collin Sexton instead of Harden or Kyrie or Anthony Davis  LMFAO this alone destroys OPs idea.   I like the effort from OP though.
Can't wait to watch Collin Sexton instead of Harden or Kyrie or Anthony Davis
"Mitchell-Sexton is basically a tossup in my eyes. Sextons a tad more efficient while Mitchell’s a bit higher volume. Ultimately I went with Sexton since I think being in the jazz system helps Mitchell out a ton while every Cavs opponent is laser focused on stopping Collin. The numbers aren’t particularly close on any of the other guys though.   Idk if I underrate jazz players, since I’d go to bat for Rudy as a top 6-7 player above Lillard and Doncic. I just happen to think a big part of why Rudy is underrated is because Mitchell is overrated, like most leading scorers on defensive teams tend to be, from IT to AI to Derrick Rose. The latter two were great players but should never have won MVP and Isaiah didn’t make all nba either of his title winning seasons for a reason."

Yeah if he doesn’t make that trade people would clown him for passing up kyrie because he wanted Collin sexton. By all accounts it seems like kyrie wanted to be there until he woke up one day and just didn’t
Collin Sexton
Just imagine having Collin Sexton on his rookie deal right now instead of Kemba Walker.  They’d probably be one decent big away from having just as good of a chance as Milwaukee or Philly rn
"&gt; the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie  You'd (maybe) have Collin Sexton instead of Kemba. I think Sexton would have paired really well with Smart, since his weaknesses are playmaking and defense."

and it's not even like the second option needs to be a superstar. Just a high quality scorer that lets Simmons shine at what he's amazing at.   Someone like Collin Sexton / SGA who can spread the defense and hit 3s. What would worry me most is their 3 best scorers all operate close to the basket which fails to maximize each players skillsets. Simmons would be so much more comfortable on offense if there was a guard that could regularly create their own shots at a high rate. It would also make Seth Curry more valuable since any defensive shift becomes a dangerous situation.  If they could find a way to add a player like that the Sixers would be unstoppable.
"Bron needs to learn from the GOAT, Collin 'The Young Bull' Sexton, take the Nets to 2OT and hit a bunch of clutch threes them to win the game."

"Ignoring his first Cleveland stint (that team was not remotely talented enough without him), neither Miami nor Cleveland 2.0 collapsed because LeBron left. Miami was set up perfectly well for life after LeBron but Bosh had to suddenly retire due to his blood clotting issue. Any team who just has to axe a third of its cap is done for full stop. Cleveland 2.0 literally sucked itself dry year after year while he was there, that team HARD mortgaged the future for those 4 years. Of course it was going to collapse, it was a house of cards built on no draft picks between Wiggins and Collin Sexton and the fucking of the books to pay LeBron's guys like JR and TT. That team had no young assets to build off once he left, and a lot of bad money on the books (highest payroll in NBA history at that point they were so far into the luxury tax - may still be highest). Disingenuous to say ""LeBron's teams have become bad when he left"" and ignore the context behind why. Only 2010 Cleveland had a fair shake at rebuilding post-LeBron and they bungled it."

"Idk man. I dont think zaga or Baylor would stand a chance vs the 4 best from almost any team in the league.  NBA players knock down contested shots at a higher clip than college players hit open shots. One superstar in that game and its fucking over.  Hell, Collin Sexton nearly won a 3 on 5 for Alabama"
Idk man i saw Collin sexton coming back against a 3v5. Switch Sexton with Lebron and the other two guys with AD and Kawhi. They definitely win. But then we’re talking about a 4v5 so now you add in KD and its over lmao.
Give present day Collin Sexton two guys and let him take on Gonzaga.. he'll kick their ass
Collin Sexton is the 2nd best player from the 2018 draft class
Injured midget and Collin Sexton the sex in sexland
Collin Sexton easy
"yeah I know I don't mean he plays the point. but I mean long term he is short, so you need to try him at point, but he can't pass for shit so it won't work. The Cavs already went through that whole process, and thus now start Garland, who is actually good. if you want to start a SG who's 6'1"" in the playoffs be my guest but woooooowwwwiieeee will it not work.  The next good CLE Cavaliers team will not have Collin Sexton on them. His absolute peak is 6MOY, he is basically Lou Williams  it's ok CLE fans, you can just debate, you don't need to downvote immediately. lol."
The whole article is about who you take long term. I’ll gladly make a bet any day that RJ barrett is a dramatically better player than Collin sexton at his peak  Those ast numbers from a PG are terrible and he’s too short to be a true SG so I don’t know what to do with sexton long term
"To this day, I still can't believe Collin freakin Sexton beat KD, Kyrie and Harden by himself. Unbelievable"
League wouldn't handle it. Unless it's Collin Sexton of course
"Citing two 50 point games, which were sporadic and only happened in the bubble, is like the ultimate example of a player being inconsistent. If you have to point at one or two massive games to defend a player’s quality, that player is not consistent. 21ppg this season (less than guys like Collin sexton and Jerami Grant) speaks for itself."
"Fucking hell him and Sexton have so much potential but I'm still convinced you can't win with two 6'1"" as your starting backcourt. My heart wants it to work but my brain tells me Sexton comes off the bench and wins 6MotY like 6 times.  We will have a shot at the first pick that year we gotta take Cade and I think he's immediately our starting 2 guard because of his length. I just hope Collin has enough confidence to know what this is all about and that he'll still get his minutes and his touches."

"He definitely knows how to suck up to the media. Every game he follows the same script. Look up their best/most popular young player and heap praise on them in the pre game interview. But to make sure to basically write their headline for them with a quote.   Tomorrow it will be ""Collin Sexton is very underrated. He is one of the top young players in this league"". And all the local media and fans will love him.    Then two days later...  ""Anthony Edwards has a little bit of DWade. He's going to dominate this league for a long time."""

"This. Drummond’s PGs the majority of his career were Reggie Jackson and Collin Sexton, quite possibly the worst passing starting PGs the league has seen in a long time. Deandre Jordan’s numbers fell off a cliff the year Chris Paul got traded and Beverley was the PG. did he magically get washed up that year or could possibly - now bear with me here - the playmakers you play with actually have an impact on a lob catching center?"
I remember when RAPTOR said that Collin Sexton was the worst player in the NBA.

Lmao Nets still can't best Collin Sexton 😂😂
Been doing a 2k season and Collin Sexton is a legit 30 ppg player at this point in it if that means anything  Could probably be 40 if they didn't draft Wiseman to play with Drummond and Love to eat touches lmao
Except Collin Sexton is still there
"Just to be clear, tweeting is not a ""job for professionals"". Paying someone thousands of dollars to post for you is as stupid as letting your idiot brother post for you.  Here are the two rules for social media if you are a celebrity   1. Don't post anything that would fumble or jeopardize the bag in any way   2. If you can't follow rule one, just don't be on social media  I fully believe Collin Sexton is capable of following one of those rules."
"Regardless of who did this “like” from his family, this falls entirely on Collin as it’s representing his name as a Cleveland Cavalier basketball player and when this type of shit happens, it causes nothing BUT drama. Big or small doesn’t matter. The potential is there. If I was the coach or GM, I’d pull Collin aside immediately and tell him to either close his social media or run it himself and take on the true responsibility to its fullest.   Sexton is a hell of a baller and upcoming, but as a Cavs fan, I don’t want this silly immature shit swirling around the team. Too old for this type of drama.   Plus, blame Dan Gilbert for the contract as it was us who offered it to Love for some reason. (I love Kevin, but I wouldn’t have resigned him to that amount)"
collin sexton is 22. this is the kind of shit ppl do at that age.
Damn Collin Sexton dgaf
Laughable that people in this thread actual believe Collin fucking Sexton could Bri g the Cavs a chip.
"When Collin Sexton wins a championship for Cleveland, then he can talk shit about Hall of Famers."
Oh SHIT!!!  Who the fuck is Collin Sexton?
Kevin Love is probably thinking “Who is Collin Sexton?”
collin sexton should go fuck himself then
Collin Sexton has stated before that he doesn't like social media and his family members run all of his social accounts. Now I actually can't confirm if it was him or a family member who liked this tweet but this is a pretty important information lol.
hahaa i love it. Collin Sexton is going end being my favorite player.
Well Collin Sexton would love if Kevin LOVE CAN ACTUALLY PLAY instead of being out during the games.

"Scoring isn’t the same as it used to be, even just ten years ago. KD was the scoring champ in 2011 with 28ish ppg. That would be good for about 7th in the league this year. Guys like Collin Sexton average more ppg a year than Stockton/Nash ever did in their careers. Not to take away from Zion, he’s great, but to see him proclaimed as a better version of Shaq is just asinine."
"Young Bull aka Collin Sexton, my b"
"Exactly, with scoring and pace going up PPG is weighted less heavily, more emphasis on two way players, 3pt shooting and switching. 16 players over 25ppg and another 22 above 20ppg. 38 players over 20ppg and a good chunk of them shouldn’t be in the all star game. Guys like Fred VanVleet, Khris Middleton, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Collin Sexton."

lol you have no idea what you are talking about. Russ may have averaged a few assist but that was just because he had KfreakingD.  Coming out of UCLA and even throughout his rookie season Russ played a lot of shooting guard because he was not a good playmaker and was a guy that only put the ball in the bucket. Similar to Collin Sexton or...get this.... *Anthony Edwards*.
They should really just rest up to play Collin Sexton on Sunday.
"The only trade for a superstar that’s ever even possibly on the table was swapping Jaylen Brown for Kawhi a few years back. And given that was during the peak KD Warriors years, I think holding onto Jaylen for potentially the long term was the move.  There has never been a star trade on the table that didn’t involve either Brown or Tatum.  Also all of this is forgetting that the Celtics did use a pick from the Nets that later became Collin Sexton to trade for Kyrie."
The disrespect. Collin Sexton is *the* Nets Pick.

2018 first round pick wound up being Collin Sexton?
"Smh, all this just to beat Collin Sexton"
"Here's my list:  * DeMar DeRozan - It feels like he has fallen off a crater since being traded away from Toronto. I think he's obviously good, but if he's your best player or two your team doesn't go anywhere. I predict he'll have a sneaky great back-end of his career if he takes a steep pay-cut (maybe can take up the Rudy Gay role in some outside contender back East?)  * Andrew Wiggins - I thought Wiggins sucked in Minnesota and was a volume scorer. Now it looks like his efficiency numbers have gone up with the Warriors. What's there plan with him? Do Warriors fans like him? How does his role change with Klay back?  * Collin Sexton - He's a guard I loved out of college at Alabama but I don't know what to make of his scoring numbers on Cleveland, and I can't imagine the ""I'm the #1 on this team"" mentality can be good for a young player given some of the stories Russillo has told about his shoot-first game.   Any team fans that can provide insight would be much obliged"
They all play against Cleveland only to get spanked again by Collin Sexton

"Yeah I guess so, but there are plenty of guys who score efficiently but they don't have much help so they are the only one who can score well, it doesn't mean the stats are empty, cuz someone needs to score points.

They all score efficiently and in bunches but their teams are below average or bottom feeders, but they aren't empty scorers. I think jerami is for sure not more than a 3rd option on a championship team but he is with us and helps keep the team from getting blown out every night"
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is?

Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
"Are you seriously criticizing him for giving up the Brooklyn pick for Kyrie? So, everyone says Ainge doesn’t pull the trigger on big deals but when he does, he should’ve kept a pick that turned out to be Collin Sexton instead of trading the pick with some okay players for one of the best PGs in the game with championship experience?  That’s gotta be one of the most ridiculous things I’ve heard all week. Try to hide your bias a bit better when discussing stuff like this, you’re embarrassing yourself. I’d make that trade for Kyrie every damn time."

I don’t want to hate on Westbrook because it’s kind of overblown how “bad” he is. But it is obnoxious when he gets all these headlines about his triple doubles but has a losing record combined with 5 turnovers a game on terrible shooting. 5 turnovers a game likely equals 6–12 points for the other team off of his mistakes alone. So even his clutch numbers are a bit suspect because he often commits turnovers in clutch minutes. These numbers are also a product of the team playing around him since he can’t play any other way than like 30% usage rates.  I just think with his usage rate and turnovers it’s a bit hollow to trumpet his crazy triple double numbers. It’s like when Monte Ellis or Collin Sexton average 25 a game but are barely above 0 on VORP or +/- stats.   To me Westbrook has value but he will never contribute to a winning team if he’s the first or even second option. Still love the guys tenacity and passion though. He just makes terrible decisions multiple times a game.

"Can’t necessarily give sources but if you poke around enough you’ll probably find- most people know about hawks players strong dislike for playing with Trae and his play style, but the same thing is happening in Cleveland with Sexton. mentioned in passing on the mismatch or Simmons pod last ep that players on other teams would tell cavs teammates “you know Collin isn’t passing you that sh*t quit getting ready to catch” stuff like that.

Someone on a team that nobody cares about.     Collin Sexton for example.
This right here. Kyrie has played as many games since leaving the Cavs in 2017 as Collin Sexton. Collin Sexton was drafted a year later. Let alone KD abd Harden aren’t always healthy either
"I mean he’s as good as any of em but Trea and Luka, SGA  Michael Porter jr, Collin Sexton and Ayton are all pretty similar. Ayton is just more defensive focused then the rest"
"Collin Sexton already showed his true colors by liking that tweet shitting on KLove. They don't like him, how is he supposed to deal with that?"
"&gt;??????????????????????????????????????????????? 2nd BEST?????????????????????  I would take, trae, Shai, Ayton and Mitchell Robinson over him. He would just beat out MPJ and collin sexton slightly."
"Man as a Cavs fan I’m with Collin. No player says a word when Love legit just gives up, but Sexton who’s a SG scoring efficiently is the problem. Gtfo. With Garland out there’s 0, legit 0 other scorers and no other PG. he had 8 assists last night and should’ve been way more but the team sucks. Starting to think it’s all Love"
"From my eye test I think Collin is a better scorer from the 3 and at the rim than Garland; I also see him being the leader of the team. Garland is great, and just like Sexton, they are still improving. Garland is a great floor general so far, but he isn’t as aggressive at the paint like Sexton. It seems that although both are small, or “undersized,” Sexton has made efforts to bulk up and doesn’t back down from a challenge; which is another great thing about him in my opinion.  Sexton puts in the work and isn’t afraid of failing, or simply put, he doesn’t back down from a challenge. This I think is important to the Cavaliers. I don’t live in Ohio, but I can obviously tell NBA players don’t like it and would prefer not to be there. It is hard getting free agents to come to Cleveland without LeBron, and considering we’re and average team with the coaching, it will always continue to be hard. Sexton, so far at least, has shown he doesn’t mind being in Cleveland. He doesn’t mind being the guy to lead our abismal team since we drafted him, I believe sometimes he is even happy to be in Cleveland and enjoys the city/state which leads me to Allen.  Allen, of course, is a great defensive piece that would help any team; you can see this by how much Lakers’ fans want him on their team even though he will be an RFA. However, since he has arrived at the team he hasn’t really looked happy to be here. His effort on the court I would say has even been affected because he doesn’t want to be in Cleveland; at least during this time period where we’re a lottery team. Obviously if you have played for the Nets and were a playoff team, and possibly a championship caliber team, then you’re not gonna be happy going to the Cavaliers. However, you put your head down and keep grinding through with this new group of people. You want to leave in FA? Do it, but until then fulfill your contract and give it your all. He plays a different position than Sexton so you cannot compare the two apart from leadership and long-term team success contribution, but I truly believe if the Cavs could only have one, they would choose Sexton."

If Shai was taking 20 shots a game and playing primarily ISO ball like they do, his would also dip. That's why it's so impressive when the elite players put up a crazy amount of shots and still maintain the 60%+ TS.   I do understand what you are saying. However, I do also still think Shai's scoring would dip a bit if he was surrounded by even average players lol. Scoring is just never all that impressive on bad teams. (i.e. Collin Sexton)"

What about my Cavs's Sexland.  Collin Sexton with efficient high volume 24ppg at his height.  And Garland with potential to be a walking double double with 40% 3pt shot.
"Collin Sexton is averaging 24/4/3 on 48/37/82. Those are closer to Trae's numbers than Trae's are to Luka's. And if I tried to make a case for why Sexton was anywhere near Trae right now, I would get laughed at. Trae is nowehere close to Luka. He's not a little bit better, he is several tiers of star better. And it is ridiculous to pretend otherwise."
"I agree with everything you said. My argument or question? i guess is that like he’s not obviously better he’s better right now, I’ll admit that Luka is better. But we know he’s better because we’re fans of this granular nonsense.  Obviously better is Gobert versus Steven Adams, I used Collin Sexton earlier. Luka is obviously better than Collin sexton, I don’t really need to make much of an argument because it’s obvious.  It’s just reductive and annoying to see “well Luka is obviously better” at the end of a post that calls into the question whether he even IS obviously better. I think it’s worth reanalyzing that assumption."
"&gt;	Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam??  There isn’t much evidence that Bam is a better defender than capela and Turner. Bam can’t rim protect like those guys can, which is the most important part of center defense. Jimmy has been a better defender than Bam this season too.   &gt;	Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw.   If you wanna believe that go ahead. You’d be hard pressed to find any good evidence for that tho."
"Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam?? Lmao now you're just saying ridiculous things and then when people point out how ridiculous they are you just respond with ""you're a Heat fan so you're biased and it doesn't matter.""  Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw. If you disagree it doesn't matter because you're literally just a biased Celtics fan."
"""So Collin Sexton, look into that camera right there. Now make a plea for Lebron to stay in Cleveland"". He was like ""umm I guess im a good player... and we uhh we could play good together."" lol shit was all jokes"

"I just watched Cavs game, I think Collin Sexton is fine. Anything I miss from that?"
"We all love trae and will stick by our guy till we die. With that being said ... obviously we missed out on luka.  I had on my pre draft board 1. Luka 2. Trae 3. D. ayton 4. J^3 5. Collin Sexton 6. Miles Bridges 7. WENDELL Carter Jr.  I'm sad we missed out on wonder boy, but I'm so fucking happy with trae. The trade also allowed us to get DeAndre Hunter w the 4th pick and allowed us to snag Reddish as a project w the 10th pick. Thats our 2nd best player and our 2 best wing defenders. Call it a rare win/win."
ben simmons for collin sexton
Imagine Collin Sexton with Ben Simmons body.
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
Jaylen Hands and Collin Sexton were like a HS mixtape debate rivalry in 2017
"bruh the fact that you compare scoring + defense (from the PG position lmfao) and Trae STILL has a higher career high even though his biggest strength is his playmaking. Sexton is not even CLOSE to Trae's playmaking level. Collin is great though, don't get me wrong. But other than scoring he's nowhere near Trae."
"I got to watch him twice here at Arizona before he got drafted. I fell in love with the ease the game came to him. They always knocked him for being ""lazy"" but he was just always the best player on the court, and I saw him play Alabama with Collin Sexton! I was so excited to watch him in the NBA, and even more excited when the Suns took him."
"Collin is a tiny shooting guard though, he'd probably average 32 in this team, but looks like he'll succeed more from coach el pee, that coaches gameplan, was run pick and rolls, trae and john/clint all the time, and let trae do anything he want, that the type of system sextons wants as well imho. sexton gonna not lead the hawks to the 5th seed tho, at best 7th or 8th"
You would give Collin sexton this team and the freedom that trae has and he would be better. Or at least the same level. Trae is literally a traffic cone defensively
Same way Collin Sexton wants a max
"The best players often make shit coaches. Even more often they make shit general managers. So why are we still pretending that their opinion on the value of players is any good whatsoever. If Collin Sexton came out tomorrow and said Deni Avdija should've won rookie of the year, it would be just as dumb of a take as if anyone else said it."
"Which of the following players are you taking Bagley over?  Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter, Collin Sexton, Kevin Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Briges, Michael Porter JR"
"I don't see Collin Sexton on Team A so I guess we know the answer  Also why didn't you call the other team ""Team B"""
Collin Sexton and Kevin Love for CJ and a pick.
Collin Sexton
Collin Sexton is still treated that way despite scoring with remarkable efficiency at 22
Make a package deal involving KP to Cleveland for Kevin Love and Collin Sexton.   Trade with Boston for Marcus Smart.
"True, but he could have had JJJ instead. So Luka, Trae, JJJ. Then there’s Shai, MPJ, the two Bridges and Collin Sexton all in the next twelve picks.       Unless Bagley has a humongous career turnaround it was a historically bad pick."
Just how good is Collin  Sexton?
Collin Sexton
"We drafted Collin ""The Young Bull"" Sexton with that pick."
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It’s not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
"Yeah people don’t realize it but Atlanta/GA is one of the hotbeds for basketball talent. Dwight, Jaylen Brown, Lou Will, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick Favors, KCP, WCJ, Jae Crowder all currently in the league...then you have Shareef Abdur-Rahim World B Free, Horace Grant, Josh Smith, just to name a few historically"
"Every single player, including every GOAT candidate in Jordan, Bron, and Kareem, all talk about how playing at the Garden is the Mecca of basketball, how the crowd is just different...  Did you watch any of the Hawks games in MSG? It was the loudest crowd I've ever heard. What Knicks game did you go to? I realized MSG was different when I went to a blowout loss against the Cavs where Collin Sexton dropped 30. Even in a blowout loss against the fucking Cavs in a season where we had like 20 wins and Fizdale was the coach, the crowd was still ROARING. You're missing that that isn't normal."
Don't let this distract you from the fact Boston traded the nets pick for 2 years of Kyrie that has turned into Collin Sexton.
"I dunno about #2 option specifically, but if the Cavs are legitimately considering trading Collin Sexton, that would be an interesting pairing.   Plus he’d come cheap early, and would have bird rights.   I’m not sure what kind of deal cleveland would make though, I don’t know if Dallas has the draft picks to entice cleveland. And I’m not sure the mavs would wanna take on a bad contract either"
"So when the the Cavaliers don’t win anything by the time Sexton retires or leaves, am I allowed to say they didn’t win either? Since that’s apparently the only relevant metric in determining who won the trade? Or am I allowed to say that since Kyrie was better in his time in Boston than Sexton has ever been that the Celtics won the trade? The 2018 ECF banner means literally nothing, unless you want to convince me that Sexton played a large role in it or that it wouldn’t have happened with Kyrie on the roster. If we want to count non-title achievements then we could discuss Boston making it to the ECF with Kyrie on the roster as well. News flash, it’s completely possible for neither team to be the “loser” of a trade. It’s unfortunate that Kyrie turned into the largest diva of all time, but I could care less that the Cavs got Collin Sexton out of it considering they won’t win anything in the duration of his career anyway."
I mean Collin Sexton looking like a stud
Where did you even draw that from? You are the one talking about hindsight to analyze your trade in a good light. Like sorry buddy but you traded IT and Collin Sexton for nothing and ruined your goodwill with all players in the league.
The Cavs delegation once again requests the nomination of Collin Sexton  We will not be silent

Yea...Sadly he's a slightly better Collin sexton

"The Cavs and Nets are like sister teams man we have had so many common players over the past few years not to mention the infamous Nets ""Collin Sexton"" Pick"
"19th most FTA per game in the league. He’s getting an amazing whistle this game but he isn’t known for respect from refs so much.  Random players that are above him include Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Collin Sexton"
Remember when Collin Sexton put him in his pocket
"100 + possessions per game, somebody has to get the points man. Empty stats are legit. On teams without much talent it frees up a lot of opportunity for dudes to get shots. Collin Sexton putting up 24 points a game on around 20 shot attempts night is pretty ridiculous. Not to say sexton isn’t talented, but I’m fairy doubtful he puts the numbers on a contending team"
"2018 Draft had a lot of talent  1st Pick: DeAndre Ayton - Defensive anchor, future all star  2nd Pick: lolkangz  3rd Pick: Luka Doncic - HOF potential, Generational Talent, Perennial  MVP Candidate  4th Pick: JJJ - Solid Starter  5th Pick: Trae Young - HOF potential, Elite Scorer, Future scoring champ candidate  ...  8th pick: Collin Sexton - Future All Star Potential  ...  11th pick: SGA - Future All Star Potential  ...  14th pick: Michael Porter Jr - Future All Star Potential  ...  34th pick: Devonte Graham - Solid Starter"
"Yes. Collin Sexton. The Nets player. The single nets pick that turned into a player, let’s forget Jaylen and Jayson. Cause they don’t exist."
Jerami Grant and Collin Sexton come to mind too
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here’s just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De’Aaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D’Angelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Only 5 separations between Jerry West and Jayson Tatum. Who the hell is Kermit Washington? He connects   Jerry and a lot of people together.  Edit: 4 connections between Collin sexton and Kareem is wild.
"Luka was 1 tech away from suspension, and got a flagrant 2 for his tussle with collin sexton. He did not get suspended. So I think they are distinct"
Sexton hate is overrated. He's averaged more assists than Jaylen Brown every year since he came into the league.  Actually:  Jaylen Brown -&gt; 5 seasons -&gt; 591 total assists  Collin Sexton -&gt; 3 seasons -&gt; 697 total assists
"Collin Sexton is not the 36th best player in the league.  MPJ is far too low, MPJ at 51 should be a criminal offense."

Yes but Collin Sexton is the best player on the best 22 win team in the Eastern Conference
Yes and Collin Sexton should be 1st Team All NBA /s
Donovan Mitchell and Collin Sexton have extremely similar stats.
"Collin Sexton. If the NBA was an anime, Collin Sexton is the protagonist. He is the hardest working player in the NBA. He doesn’t get the respect he deserves but he’s too humble to care. One day he will rise to greatness and save us all when we need him the most. Collin Sexton should be your favorite NBA player."
"probably Collin Sexton, he's progressed 3 straight years despite the Cavs being as dysfunctional as they have been, still gets no respect whatsoever."
"He has been a terrible tank commander, went to the media about Collin Sexton being selfish, and has lobbied for a trade despite having no valuie."
Yeah Collin Sexton was originally a Nets pick
This bum talked all that shit about Collin Sexton and he hasn’t done anything in years. Time to hang it up.
It doesn’t merit a discussion. Want to deep dive why Collin Sexton will not be as good as Allen Iverson?
"Is it just me or is Kevin Love not kinda getting scapegoated a bit here by the rest of the organization?  The problems with Colin Sexton early in the season went far beyond K-Love to the point we started to see Love acting out on the court, but there were reports many people had issues. The Cavs young players felt attacked and had started to band together a bit as a separate unit.  As one of the oldest and highest paid guys who signed on to be a leader, yeah it's his responsibility in a sense, but he was also probably told ""You need to keep these guys on track"" and the entire team thought Sexton was constantly going off-track and ruining the team dynamic.  https://cavaliersnation.com/2021/05/02/report-cavs-teammates-frustrated-with-how-collin-sexton-hogs-the-ball/  there were tons of these reports early on. And by early on I'm talking about going back to when Sexton was drafted.  Why is it just Kevin Love who's the bad guy now?"
"recency/nostalgia bias.  for recency: calling a player underrated/a top 5 whatever after one good game. ex: collin sexton getting MIP talks after a good run early in the season, after which he completely dropped off the radar; tyrese maxey, who dropped 39 and promptly got shoved into the ROTY conversation, etc.  nostalgia bias: when people have a top whatever list that they REFUSE to change, no matter what young player is starting to rise. ex: people saying giannis isn't top 25 after 2 MVPs, a DPOY (during the MVP season), one of the best finals runs ever, and a possible ring. also people who definitively say that luka will NEVER be better than MJ or Lebron no matter what he does."

"Knicks are signing Dame Lillard, Collin Sexton and Lonzo Ball apparently. For an organisation who have been lacking in the PG position for years and years, we sure are stocking up lmao."
"collin sexton has literally never been double teamed  he was the pg until everybody hated playing with him   why is it that nobody else can hit shots for Sexton, but Delly finds 7 assists in 20 minutes and Garland doubles his assist output most nights?   3pters made by a rookie sounds great if you ignore all context  and why do all those teams win with those great players but the cavs can’t even sniff the playoffs?"
I will happily trade up for Green lol.  Can I interest you in a slightly used Collin Sexton perhaps?
"Choose Collin Sexton, you virgins."
"Different Era. 25ppg back then is as good if not better than 30ppg now, especially on the efficiency Dirk had. I mean, look at how many good, but not quite great guards put up ~25 ppg this season: Collin Sexton, Deaaron Fox, SGA, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, etc.  Those numbers were a rarity back in the day only the best of the best could reach"
"Sexton is a less than lateral move for us. Sexton has no defense, no real passing that we have seen. As mentioned in previous comments Embiid is in his prime NOW. That may only last 2 more years. We don’t have time to wait for our number 2 player on the team to hopefully get better. I’m working off an assumption that you feel Simmons value has decreased to the same amount of value that Collin sexton currently has which is not the case. Simmons playoff performances are abysmal and I have no defense for them. However he is a top defender in the league, having been in second for DPOY and being on all nba defensive teams. He is also a 3x all star. This by itself is value. Maybe his problem is just Philly, maybe it’s the coaching staff we have, maybe it’s just the environment he is in and surrounds himself with, but he has skills to put up 20+ points if he really wanted to. The ultimate hope would be that some coach WILL make him do that instead of coddling him. He’s also on his max deal and will be locked into a long contract to help any other team he would be put on develop and rebuild. Again the plan would be for him to start scoring because, as important of a part is in for the nba, it’s the only thing he doesn’t contribute to a team.   Going back to what I said about sexton, he currently ONLY contributes to scoring. We would take a huge hit defensively, and lose our #1 facilitator, and we don’t even know what sexton would be like playing next to Embiid who is our first scoring option.   Don’t get me wrong, Sexton is not a bad player and if his stats stay similar, come 2-3 years down the line he will be a top asset people will want to trade for but for the current position Philly is in to win now he is not the move. What may make the trade work IMO is if there was a third team and picks involved OR we were also trading Tobias to get maybe not an all star, but someone solid who could pick up what Sexton currently lacks.  Also Osman contributes nothing to the bench we already have so I didn’t even consider him as a real asset."
*Collin Sexton has entered the chat*
"I mean that's the only way I see it. 76ers do not want any of those assets unless their trading them elsewhere. And therein also lies the problem of which wants to trade their fringe All-Star? Maybe Collin Sexton could be someone of interest, if Cavs don't want him?"
Ben Simmons is an overrated trade.  Collin Sexton is an underrated trade.
you really included tj warren? collin sexton dropped 24ppg
If only Collin Sexton

"absolutely. Which is why I would decline the Heat trade for precious and Herro.  Herro is nice but he's just a 3pt sniper and offball threat, which isn't bad but Collin Sexton has more offensive bag with more efficiency, a good knockdown midrange shot, athleticism, and top 12th in FTA/game.   And again with the PF depth, Precious is not worth trading away Sexton. Especially if we draft Mobley"
"League average TS for Lou Will's 51.3% TS was 54.4%, for a -3.1% rTS. For Sexton's 57.3% this year, league average was 57.2%, for a 0.1% rTS. I don't care about mealy-mouthed excuses about playstyles or whatever, we can compare relative to the league at the time and we'll see that Collin Sexton was and is better, period.  That's the thing with Sexton haters that I just don't understand. You keep saying he's a sixth man and you keep trying to put him in that role, but he's better than that. He's better than Lou Will, or Jamal Crawford, or Jordan Clarkson, or any of the other guys that perform amazing in a sixth man role but otherwise struggle as a starter. He's better than them by a fairly significant margin.  That's the issue. You don't think he gels well with Garland? Fine. You don't think he'd fit well with who we're likely to pick in the draft? Sure. But stop trying to make him out to be worse than he is. He's a very good young player that probably doesn't have superstar potential but, at 22, has already elevated himself to fringe all-star level and has shown the ability to take over games against the best teams in the league. He's worth more than Toppin Knox and a first."
"Collin Sexton, as a 22 year old who has improved massively every year he's been in the league and clearly hasn't even come close to reaching his prime, was better this year than Lou Williams has ever been. Playing on a team that was decimated by injuries practically the entire year.  22 year old Lou Will scored under 20 ppg, shot under 40% from the field, and had a TS of 51%. 22 year old Collin Sexton scored nearly 25 a game, shot 47.5% from the field, and had a TS of 57% -- again, on a team with virtually no cohesion. -- If your basis for considering Sexton's value is that he's a facsimile of Lou Will, you're just wrong. Period. Sexton is a tier above Lou Will and that isn't really debatable. They both do similar things, Sexton just does it far better."
Are the Knicks really one Collin Sexton away from an all-in year? They had a great season but I’d worry about those contracts handicapping the team in the long run.  Sexton would be a good trade on his current contract but I feel like he has enormous potential to be one of those “gave him the max because we had to” guys that becomes an albatross.
"It seems like everyone knows Collin Sexton is a efficient 20-25 ppg scorer, while at the same time acting like it doesn’t fucking matter for some reason. If Sexton were in a big market like Chicago or New York he’d be an All Star."
Garland reads the floor better than Sexton. Maybe that’s because Collin is wired to get buckets—something he’s very good at. But if the Cavs are going to pay a backcourt big money then it should be on a tandem that won’t be played out of the floor when the team is already playing meaningful games late in the season.
"[https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-players-get-taunted-by-opponents-who-tell-them-collin-sexton-wont-pass-the-ball-per-report/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-players-get-taunted-by-opponents-who-tell-them-collin-sexton-wont-pass-the-ball-per-report/)  Watch the games and you will see at least once a game a player letting it slip and their frustration that Sexton didn't make the pass. It was more visible and louder when he first was drafted. It seemed to cool off, but I think it was quieter as he did admittedly improve on this aspect. Not enough though."
"Thank god reddit isn't the GM. We should no pay Collin Sexton. He individually improved, but we can't play basketball with his style as our leading scorer. In NY his role would decrease a bit. Right now he has our offense by the balls and it isn't good to watch or for other players on the team. Get him out of here and watch the team game flourish."
If they let Lonzo walk and get Collin Sexton then it works out
"The New York Knicks reportedly continue to explore a potential deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers for guard Collin Sexton.  [Shams Charania](https://theathletic.com/2703448/2021/07/13/sixers-opening-up-ben-simmons-trade-talks-knicks-interested-in-collin-sexton-plus-more-nba-news/) of The Athletic reported Tuesday the Knicks are the ""most aggressive trade suitor"" for Sexton, who's eligible for an extension this offseason before the final guaranteed season of his four-year, $20.2 million rookie [contract](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/collin-sexton-26974/)."
Final piece to the Knicks puzzle? I didn’t know they were Collin sexton away from being a contender
"Nah you’re good. Yeah the feeling is that if it’s certain we aren’t paying Collin (which apparently he’s seeking the full max, and I love him but I just can’t swallow that myself), then trading him now is the best option.   Majority of non-Reddit Clevelanders are all on board trying to find a suitor for a Sexton+Love trade.   Many of us also see how much more of a future Garland has.   Love Collin, but just unfortunate circumstances for a team trying to rebuild to a contender - can’t put all your eggs in a single basket and that’s what Sexton would be."
They need to get Collin sexton
"W for the Knicks…only valuable thing Knicks are giving up is the 2021 first rounders  Cause Toppin? Bust, Knox..Who?  But Collin Sexton is going to want the max, I don’t know if he’s worth that yet"
"Yea the Timberwolves are most likely not getting Ben Simmons, and we really shouldn't even be a main focus point of discussion. There are better trade scenarios that could be had without the Timberwolves being involved such as:     \-Malcom Brogdan  \-Kemba Walker  \-Lowry S&amp;T  \-CJ McCollum/Damien Lillard (unlikely)  \-Mike Conley S&amp;T  \-Collin Sexton     The only thing the Timberwolves truly have to offer is DLo, but even then I have a hard time figuring out why the 76ers would make that trade, unless they value the scoring aspects of DLo and are willing to look past his defensive struggles."

"Collin Sexton and Donovan Mitchell have extremely similar stats.  I’m not saying they’re equal players, but I’m saying Collin is great."
So what does this mean for my boy Collin Sexton?  Is his offense good? Should this take away all those trade rumors? Or at least help strengthen his value?
Trading collin sexton and Kevin love for a 1st and a young 4 to that compliments garland
"1. That's more value than Wood has. Warriors might offer *one* of those two picks for Wood, but they're not offering both. 2. San Antonio accepts that if DeMar is dead set on going to LA, just so they get *some* value out of him. The alternative is that the Lakers find somewhere *else* to dump Kuzma's salary and the Spurs lose DeMar for nothing. 3. I genuinely don't know what Simmons' value around the league is right now, but I feel like they'd prefer to take back a role player along with CJ rather a pick, since they're trying to contend with Embiid right now. More likely something like CJ and RoCo for Simmons and George Hill 4. That's a good deal for the Heat, especially if they want to actually contend while Jimmy's still in his prime, but I'm not sure if they're ready to trade Herro just yet. 5. I think the Cavs can get more value out of Sexton that. 6. There's no way in hell moving down *one* spot from #4 to #5 gets you *another* top 10 pick *and* another valuable FRP. This draft isn't *that* top-heavy. 7. I'm not sure a team that already has huge defensive issues has much reason to trade for Collin Sexton and Kevin Love, and they're gonna have salary issues *real* quick with that roster."
Lmao that Cavs Pels one is so bad. Hayes and 2 firsts for the right to max Collin Sexton is such a massive L
That’s crazy man. I hate how every decent young player gets a max. Like Fox gets 144 million?? Collin Sexton will probably get it. It’s crazy
Jason Lloyd and his ongoing vendetta against Collin Sexton. A tale as old as time.
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
Collin Sexton all star   Especially if he gets traded to a better team
young players that are about to get paid their dues get shit on constantly on this sub for years. john collins and collin sexton are the victims this year  jamal murray and jaylen brown are also recent examples

"Garland. I think he'll be a better all-around player than Sexton in the long-term. Plus, with this upcoming draft, the Cavaliers may very well replace Collin Sexton."

Collin Sexton and Nassir Little
Ill go with a young one. Collin Sexton
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"
cmon bruh how is collin sexton a “literal basketball god in atlanta” but nique not on the list 😭
Hold on Collin Sexton ?
"Atlanta and Georgia *love* basketball, just not the Hawks. Lenny Wilkins, Bobby Cremins, Stephon Marbury, Spud Webb, Collin Sexton, Shareef Abdur-Rahim. Literal basketball gods in Georgia, but consequently we know when a team isn't very good. Hawks over preformed, but we're paying attention. Need Trae to play better defense."
Collin Sexton for his first 2 years were full of empty stats.
Collin Sexton. Volume scoring on average efficiency with zero defense or playmaking ability is worth little. Its why he's on the trade block.
In 3 seasons Collin Sexton has 52 different teammates and 4 head coaches...
"Darius Garland, RJ is a way better defender but on the offensive, I think Garland is better at everything with shooting, playmaking,finishing, and ball handling. There is a reason cavs are keeping him and letting their best player in Collin Sexton be in trade talks."

Stacked af def a conference finals team atleast probably better than every team aside from maybe the Lakers and Nets   Maybe Clippers but we saw them struggle against just Luka so it’s over if he gets help  Also add Collin Sexton to the bench
*Collin Sexton has entered the chat*
KD to the Cavs for Collin Sexton incoming.
If you think Morey would give up Ben and picks to get Collin fucking Sexton you’re off your rocker.
Luka did sack tap Collin Sexton for no reason. I'm getting Patrick Beverly vibes from Luka.
"Not true. I know who she is. She's the person who ruins draft night every year by asking stupid  questions, like when she asked Collin Sexton to pitch Lebron to stay."
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland’s Damian Lillard or Washington’s Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland’s Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
"Let me guess Fake News.  https://cavaliersnation.com/2021/05/02/report-cavs-teammates-frustrated-with-how-collin-sexton-hogs-the-ball/  &gt; “Various Cavs players still grow frustrated by the way Sexton dominates the ball, and opponents taunt them by saying during games, ‘you know he’s not going to pass you the ball,'” wrote Vardon."
I’m not on this “Tyler Herro is overrated” wave that a lot of people seem to be on but this comment makes it seem like He’s somehow better than Collin Sexton and that’s just not true.   His defense is below average and so is his passing those aren’t things you can attach to Herro as if he brings those skills to the table at an elite or even very good level
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"
"also forgetting Daughtery, Mourning, Smits, Sabonis, Divac, etc, all who were skilled offensively   there’s also dudes like collin sexton who can’t pass a lick and dudes like fultz who can’t shoot a lick playing point guard in this point guard era   i think bad post players is still more fun to watch bc you’re getting 50% of the shots to go or there’s a blocked shot   i hate watching point guards shoot 32% from 3 and then flop around trying to get to the line"
"-Locks: Trae, Ayton Luka -Wouldn’t surprise me: JJJ, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ -Not max but big deals: Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Kevin Huerter, Lonnie Walker"
Who sack taps Collin Sexton? He's a brat.
This is something not generally appreciated about our FO: we didn't mortgage our draft future like the Rockets and Clippers did. We replaced our own 2018 first-rounder with the famous Nets pick (which became Collin Sexton at \#8) and the 2019 first-rounder we traded to get Kyle Korver turned into second-rounders.  Lakers seem all kinds of fucked now.
Collin sexton would be an MVP candidate if he was on a contender
"In that scenario, the team with 3 players actually almost overcame a double digit deficit to win against a top 20 team, with an absolutely incredible performance by Collin Sexton. They played better 3 on 5 than 5 on 5. Haha."
As a Cavs fan people keep telling us that you can’t play with Collin Sexton and Darius Garland together on the same team cause it might be like CJ McCollum and Dame.  ...how fuckin cool would it be for our young guys we develop to be as good as CJ and Dame???  That would be AWESOME
"Being a shitty team with upside is nice.  Like we’ve got Collin Sexton, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, they’re exciting.  But right now I have no stakes in the playoffs.  I’m rooting for Ty Lue above anyone else haha."
why is collin sexton get so much of this press when he'd be one of the only things that would excite me for the future as a cavs fan.
I actually think Collin Sexton will and it will be problematic
Where’s Collin Sexton?
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
Collin Sexton is missing and has 779k.
"I didn't say it was. Literally my entire point has been that it's not Collin Sexton for a single first round pick and that brushing off the rest of the trade is silly. If the haul isn't good, don't do the trade, but guys not fitting the roster doesn't mean they don't have value elsewhere."
Lol a regular season game. Collin Sexton also had a great game against them. Doesn't mean much.
"&gt; he and Simmons meshes better since Garland is a solid outside threat  Collin Sexton is a career 39% shooter from 3. If that's not ""solid outside threat"" I don't know what is."
This is why I dont listen to the garbage most people here and NBA media say. Collin Sexton has those moments where he seems like the only person on the court to give a shit.
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"sexton is a better scorer without a doubt, and their passing isn’t that much different  glad Jamal finally had 1 year around Sexton’s efficiency, but i doubt he would keep that up as a #1 option as compared to the 2nd/3rd with Jokic and MPJ.   if murray can increase his free throws like Collin did, maybe we can debate it  but Murray is two years older so idk, especially with the injury"
Collin Sexton would like a word
need an argument for why you should take Murray over Collin Sexton
"Idiotic trades all around.  Especially when the ""rumors"" are now that Cavs are working on an extension with Sexton.   not to be confused with the ""rumors"" before the draft that they were trading him, but this was before we picked up Mobley, which makes all the trade talk about trading our #1 scorer and best player on the team moot.  ""Evan Dammarell of Fear the Sword and WKYC Channel 3 is reporting that the Cavaliers have put extending Sexton as a plan back on the table. More importantly, according to his report, Sexton wants to stay in Cleveland and continue the work that he’s doing with Darius Garland, and Jarrett Allen.""  from last week: https://factoryofsadness.co/2021/08/11/cavs-rumor-collin-sexton-extension-offer-back-table/"
"Was Collin Sexton better than Kyrie last year because Kyrie wasn't the best player on his own team? Do you not see how dumb your argument is?  But yes Middleton played like a superstar against the Celtics. Not even a lock he was better than Giannis tho who was dominant on both ends.    But none of that has any relevance to Giannis vs Embiid. Giannis was better in the regular season and playoffs, fact. Aka he was better than Embiid overall."
Pretty sure Collin sexton isn’t outperforming Kyle lowery in almost every statistically category
"Collin Sexton, Westbrook, and Beal had some epic performances against the Nets. If they join forces they might lose in 6 instead of the usual 5"
Not if Collin sexton has something to say about it😎
"Clearly, Collin Sexton must be better than Kyle Lowry cause points."
Luka  SGA  Collin Sexton  Ayton  Mikal Bridges  MPJ  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Trae Young  If the Kings rejected a 1 to 1 swap of any of those players I would riot.
"Just like Collin Sexton choosing to wear #2 for the Cavs after Kyrie Irving got traded to Boston. Imo, I think the Cavs will eventually retire Kyrie’s #2 Jersey."

Darius Garland and Collin Sexton in the 3pt contest please 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
Honestly don't get why people keep saying Trae in this. More like Ben Simmons without playmaking vs Collin Sexton. Trae has way more to his game than just scoring so it isn't a fair comparison.
Collin Sexton isnt a PG  Mobley isn’t a 5 (yet)
"His ceiling is a 6'4"" Collin sexton, which I would take"
Collin Sexton
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
"I don’t understand what you expect from Kyrie then. The only time he didn’t have an all star on his team was his first 3 years in the league when the cavs were a poverty franchise. That’s your sample size, him at 20 years old playing with a trash team. It’s basically like penalizing Collin Sexton or Kevin Porter Jr. because they aren’t winning all on their own, while their team is abysmal.   I’m also curious what your definition of a “winning player” is. Kyrie has done very well for himself as a second option, and certainly played winning basketball in the 2016 and 2017 playoffs. Is it only when you have 0 other all stars and do it by yourself that you are a “winning player?” If so then there’s only been a handful of those in history"
Collin Sexton &gt; literally every garbage heap player that was reported to have been offered in trade for him.  No I'm not over it. Fucking Kevin Knox and a 2nd for Collin Sexton. FOH.
"Collin Sexton and Darius Garland will be two of the best guards in the league in 5 years time. You can call me a homer all you want but i’ve seen all but probably 10 Cavs games over the last two seasons and those two are something different. The main thing that sets them apart is their work ethic and mentality, they’re always working accepting of their flaws and willing to work at it. I’m not sure if they can both reach their full potential together, but god i fucking hope so."
I like Collin sexton.   I don’t want to go on a tirade but his game where it was a [3 v 5 (Alabama v Minnesota)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W5gz3vIIhkw) just makes me think he’s got the drive to be great.

"According to some Knicks fans, Collin Sexton"
Collin Sexton is a better player than Darius Garland.
I don’t see how anyone could think that Sexton is the problem. Maybe I don’t watch enough cavs games but when I do it’s because I’m a big fan of Collin. I think he’s heavily underrated

"Top 5 best chances, in order (imo):    1. Lonzo Ball 2. RJ Barrett 3. Jaren Jackson Jr. 4. Patrick Williams 5. Collin Sexton"
"&gt;irst, you are flatly wrong. That Nets pick turned into Collin Sexton. It was 8th in the draft.  You're right, that's my bad.  Still, give me the option of taking Kyrie or the 8th pick in the draft I'm taking Kyrie. Every time.   &amp;#x200B;  And Terry Rozier was more than happy to stay in Boston, they could've just paid him. They didn't ""need"" to get Kemba."
"First, you are flatly wrong. That Nets pick turned into Collin Sexton. It was 8th in the draft. That is a valuable asset, even more so before you know where exactly it would fall in the lotto.      Second, the Kemba pick up was a direct result of Kyrie. Him leaving left them needing to spend the money and Kemba was pretty well the only option for them."

"You can’t just decide to spend more money on players in free agency. There’s a big gap between the (soft) salary cap and the tax line. The only way to spend a significant amount on taxes is if you’re re-signing your players to big contracts using their bird rights. Most teams don’t have players that are good enough to be worth spending into the luxury tax for.   Cleveland could max out a backcourt of Darius Garland and Collin Sexton. That plus Jarrett Allen and the rest of the team would put them into the tax, and it would also be a terrible basketball move because once you’re in the tax you can’t easily improve the team and that team isn’t even necessarily a playoff team"
Cavs fans have led me to believe Collin Sexton is a good answer here
"how about jarrett allen and collin sexton for Siakim? sure it wouldn’t make sense for Toronto, but my team wins so i’m gonna go post this in the toronto sub"
Collin Sexton
"Eh I don’t really give a shit.  At the end of the day if I have make a Pascal Siakam flop compilation to convince you that a completely different player doesn’t flop then nothing will change your mind. And you know that.  LeBron was what, 26th in the league in FTA last season? Like 10 spots below Randle and Collin Sexton iirc. Must be a terrible flopper."
I’m gonna do this every time Collin Sexton has a good game even though I know there’s more nuance than that and you guys can’t stop me  My god I will be so POWERFUL
"I know that I, and many others that I personally know, managed good grades with ADHD.   I'm also fully aware that even if I was considered to have a learning disability, I was not given near the same amount of attention or leniency as college athletes in my classes like Jerry Jeudy, John Petty, Mac Jones, or Collin Sexton. They were breezed through exams and projects without a care in the world.   So for Simmons to be the star jewel of LSU basketball and actually get all Fs, that's extraordinary even if he was legitimately illiterate."
"High: Derrick White, I think he’s kinda under the radar for how good he is, he’s a pretty good defender, can buy a bucket and mans the point well  Low: Collin Sexton, I used to think he was underrated but now I think he’s a bit overrated. He’s good but at this point he really hasn’t shown that he can do much more than scoring at will. I think Garland is the better guard for the cavs"
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"Collin Sexton would be an awesome 6th man. He’s overqualified for that, but if the league ever contracts to 16 teams or something, sign him up."
"As a Knicks fan, I'm jealous of the secure PG situation both the Heat and the Nets have. We love D. Rose but we don't wanna make him play 40 mins a night. I'm still hopeful we get Reggie Jackson, Jalen Brunson or Collin Sexton (for cheap)   Besides that, we're pretty happy with our situation."
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
"&gt;just paid more money to retain the same team  That's how re-signing guys who played well works...  I said this before but IDK why everyone was acting like this was some crazy FA crop. Some guys (thankfully a minority) in our sub were seemingly obssessed with going all in on middling stars as if it was going to propel us anywhere, instead we signed deals that are flexible and moveable while getting better even if only slightly. Fournier on &lt;20M per year is great value despite people acting like it's a sure-fire albatross.   All the talk was about getting an offense running PG and in that sense it was really, Lonzo, Lowry, Conley or Paul. Paul went back to PHX for disgusting money, Conley got a re-sign deal e.g. I'd feel tentative about giving him that money as a new addition and the other two just didn't go for us if we made much in the way of an offer at all.  I personally am quite pleased to see our young guys continue to develop while holding the flexibility and assets required to make trades if we feel the need. The one thing I feel I was a little against the grain on in terms of proposed deals was us trading a haul for Collin Sexton, the price some dudes were proposing seemed like too much to me idk."
"Another player 24/4/4 on 50/38/80 at 22. And that player is Collin sexton. Both are in losing situations.   Stats don't always tell the story. I'm just saying the narrative on a player changes drastically once they get paid.   Look at DeAngelo Russell, De'aron Fox, pascal siakam, kemba walker. All these players were considered no-brainers for a max and now they get shit on because they aren't carrying teams.  Just saying look for the narrative to change if the team keeps losing."
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
"basically the only players we have developed in the past few years are Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro... they're all developing well?  Okoro could be better but he's not bad.  Idk wtf you want from us.  Are you upset Dylan Windler isn't good enough???"
This same team wont pay Collin Sexton and this is their grand plan for their $$
"""Per sources"" the Cavs have already traded Collin Sexton to a number of teams for a large haul  - r/NBA July 2021"
Collin Sexton??
"**Colby White** \- when he's moved off of PG and can just focus on his game as a scoring guard, I think he will surprise some folks.  **Collin Sexton** \- not 'given up' on, persay. People know he's talented. I think he'll be on the up and up though.  **Obi Toppin** \- I know he's a little raw right now, but he's athletic as hell and with a little more development time could be a very solid player.  **James Wiseman** \- bigs take long to develop. He's a raw prospect, he gotta brew. Has a lot of physical tools though. And even as a raw prospect, I've seen him drain threes and go coast-to-coast.  Other sleeper possibilities: Marvin Bagley, Luke Kennard."
"Probably Lebron, because I grew up watching him. But beside Lebron, my favorite player is Collin Sexton"
"Well there are multiple kinds of expiring contracts that have different valuations depending.  Also, Love is not an expiring contract as it currently stands. With 2yrs 60mil left, it is a current albatross. Love would be desirable for a team looking to clear space for a possible 23 FA run.   But you say “how does that help the dumb cavs stupid”?  Well, the answer is that depends on the market and where the current 22-23 cavs would stand (or any team in a similar position). It could allow them to flip love for either a 2-3 year deal for players that the rebuilding team wants to clear who are of reasonable quality OR players coming up as RFA who the team isn’t sure about paying big money too OR a salary dump for bad contracts with draft picks attached.   But of course, the other type of “expiring” contract is the one mentioned in part 2 above. The RFA that the team may not or would not be able to match. Jarrett Allen is an example from last season. Collin Sexton is becoming one for this. This also occurs when the Supermax comes into play.   Although the value of expiring contracts is cyclical due to the large jump in the cap in the mid 2000s combined with the newer trend of elite players to take the “hometown pay increase”, and although this trend is leading to decrease currently in said value, to say they don’t have any value is not entirely accurate."
You think thats bold?  Go find the dude with broken legs klay and collin sexton over him
"I admittedly don't follow cavs all that much, but didn't he [have a good relationship](https://cavaliersnation.com/2019/10/09/kevin-love-collin-sexton-great-relationship-texted-throughout-offseason/) with Sexton?"
Hehe Collin Sexton has specifically called him out as being someone who really helped him. Has he had bad moments? Of course. But I wouldn't call him an asshole either.
"So did LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Isaac Okoro"
"So Simmons had a terrible series, obviously... he is still much better than Collin Sexton, not to mention how Sexton would destroy our backcourt defense and would swap the only competent playmaker in our starting five for a ball-hog."
Garland and Rubio aren't gonna be on the court at the same time. Rubio is DG's backup. He'll probably run the 2nd unit with Sexton while DG rests. This move doesn't (or at least shouldn't) affect Collin at all
"No team has offered an all star.  Which team did the Sixers turn down that put an all star on the table?  An all star is worth more than the Cav’s core, which was one of the worst teams in the league last year.  As much as this sub denies it Simmons is worth more than Collin Sexton and Garland"
"Collin Sexton, Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, and a couple lottery protected picks"
Cleveland ended up with Collin Sexton. Boston ended up with nothing
There’s a good chance Collin sexton will get a max lol. Almost everyone who’s good gets paid in the NBA.   Lowry is good but the way people talk about him would make you think he’s a top 5 PG of his era
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"Because there's more to being a starter in the NBA than scoring. All Collin can do is score, there's literally nothing else he can do other than that. I trust Okoro to develop into an all-around better player than Sexton and Collin won't have any room to complain about being benched since he has financial security and profiles best as a 6th man. At some point, Collin has to start helping the Cavs in other ways outside of scoring. The ""leading scorer"" argument won't have legs for long, especially if he re-signs here."
"Because it's easier to send Sexton to the bench when he has a new deal and long term financial security. I also think Okoro will develop into a good enough offensive player that he'll be a better fit with Garland in the backcourt because of his defense. All Collin does is put up points and nothing else. If Okoro can be consistently competent on offense, he'll be a better player and far better fit with Garland than Collin. I'm also assuming the Cavs will get an NBA caliber wing at some point to justify moving Okoro to the 2 and making Sexton the 6th man we need"
&gt; the guy who's putting up 24/5/6 on a 62 TS% at age 22  Collin Sexton?
&gt; the guy who's putting up 24/5/6 on a 62 TS% at age 22  Collin Sexton?
&gt; the guy who's putting up 24/5/6 on a 62 TS% at age 22  Collin Sexton?
I’m going to come out and say it… that pick ended up being Collin Sexton with 2 of the next 3 picks being Mikal Bridges and SGA himself. Really wasn’t a bad trade package with a decent amount of salary filler to make a deal work
"Lol you don’t understand basketball. I watched Collin Sexton and Alabama almost comeback and win a game when most of their team got suspended and they had 3 players on the court against 5. They lost by single digits. Yes having extra bodies helps but ultimately you have to put the ball in the hoop, you can still find ways to account for the extra guy on defense (Zone) and on offense you can still score if you spread them out. Doubling the best player leaves other scorers with a 1 v 1 matchup, maybe on a smaller defender. Having one extra guy does no guarantee victory by any means ."
"Collin Sexton is a good shooter and pretty athletic, he might be the quickest guy in the league"
A lot of people are going to say the height and defense even though shai isn’t a good defender he has the potential to be solid because his size and what not but he’s just not a good defender at this moment and that’s a fact. He is though a better playmaker then sexton. And I think the main thing that separates the two is that Collin has had a lot of bad press about how his teammates don’t like him his teammates don’t think he’s that good or his teammates think he’s a selfish player that doesn’t really bode well for the future. Also shai has been in a winning environment compared to Collin 16-19 this year before his injury obviously isn’t great but not horrible and he and cp did pretty good the year before that. I think those things are what separates them the most.
"SGA is the more natural passer. Doesn't have to try. Collin sexton had extreme tunnel vision at times.   SGA is also the better defender. SGA is the better the natural scorer. Sexton forces it.   When you watch the game, you see the difference. Stats aren't everything."
SGA is worth the max 100% tho its not like a Collin Sexton thing where its questionable if he really is a max guy
"Here's what Givony actually said:  &gt; The Cavs are one of the most active teams in the league on the trade-talk front, **rumored to be making overtures to acquire a second pick in the top 10** while pondering the viability of offering a rich contract extension for leading scorer Collin Sexton. It appears unlikely they'll be moving out of the No. 3 slot, with Mobley looking like the overwhelming favorite to be picked, provided Sexton isn't moved.  So it's a 2nd top 10 pick on top of their 3rd pick"
"I’m just happy to be here, you know?  We have a direction forward and something to root for.  Player development is so much fun too, to see someone go from ok to good or good to great.  I wonder to what extent our capability to grow is tied to the Collin Sexton “youngbull” mentality.  He works his ass off man and I wonder how much that influences the whole team."
"&gt;my point is these teams should rebuild through the draft or continue to develop those players   They would be rebuilding through the draft in hopes of getting a player as talented as Simmons. Why do that when you can accordingly trade for him when he’s still young on a long term deal?   &gt;not trade for ben simmons and his giant contract.   You’re eventually going to have to pay players no matter what and all these guys I named are on starter level, high starter level contracts and some like Sexton, hunter, reddish may all see new deals nearing 20+ despite not being nearly as good as Simmons. Money isn’t a problem.    &gt;if the pistons traded cade cunningham for simmons it would probably make them better, would they ever do that tho?   Ok but we’re not talking about #1 pick Cade Cunningham, we’re talking about rotational guys like Fred VanVleet, Derrick white, Harrison Barnes, Collin Sexton etc."
2019: Collin Sexton
Aaron Gordon.  Collin Sexton.
"I absolutely think Morey is willing to bet on one of Beal, Lillard, or LaVine becoming available before the deadline, and that he thinks the team can stay in the top 6 in the east without Simmons.   At that point if none of those guys was available, he would have to ask himself - is a package built around Derrick White, or Malik Beasley, or Collin Sexton, or another non all-star level guard really worth giving up his best trade chip? I'm not sure any of those players really make it more likely that the Sixers make it past the first round than if they go in with the roster as is."
"Their 18/19 top 5 minutes getters were Cedi Osman, Collin Sexton, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, and Rodney Hood  Only Hood was even close to being a returning starter"
"Anyone off-ball and can shoot for the back court, front court anyone who doesn’t distribute much. Gotta go with devin booker(and Collin sexton but that would be too homeristic for September 2021)."
"&gt; Arguably even better than what happened irl  I don't think ""arguably"" is the right word, to say the least. That Cavs team with Paul George instead of IT and Jae Crowder is unquestionably better. Maybe still not good enough to beat the KD Warriors but it would have been more of a contest. Current Cavs would be worse without Collin Sexton, though, since LeBron probably would have left in 2018 anyway."
Collin sexton.
Collin Sexton
"Not a player, but the cavaliers FO as a whole. At some points i dont even know if they’re trying to tank or be competitive. Their worst moments were definitely the 2000s. Gave up young prospects for old washed up veterans for 7 years and got pissed when Lebron left. Were also so incompetent that they decided to just trade kyrie without even trying to work things out, then decided that an injured IT would be a good enough partner to run the season and didnt chase any other stars.   Literally the only good moves they made that i can remember from the top of my head this past decade was: (1) trade wiggins for kevin love, and (2) not sign collin sexton for the max. Everythings else was just bad or inconsequential."
Collin Sexton is gonna average 28
Trade Collin Sexton for Lebron James? Yup
"Collin Sexton.   The man put up 24/3/4 on 48/37/82 shooting, and has shown continued progression each year of his career, but r/nba still just makes jokes about how he's an empty stats, inefficient scorer."
"Garland and Sexton play different positions, but some of the rumors are based on the idea that Sexland would be a very short backcourt. The Cavs have signed every 7 footer in the league, which suggests they are prepared to cover that deficiency.   Most of the rumors are just the typical ""good emerging player on bad team should be traded to contending team for a bag of chips because that's how it is."" You know, just the typical wishful rumors that create reasons why the Cavs ""have to"" trade Collin when we don't."
"The knock is that he's a good player on a bad team and based on the eye test he looks like the kind of player (short, combo guard, high-usage, high-volume scorer) that Reddit NBA hates.  Nothing about Collin's game looks smooth or easy and it isn't always clear that he knows how to play team basketball or find the rhythm of the game.  There are a lot of reasons to like him though.  * His ability to rapidly improve his game is remarkable (see: rookie season 1st half vs. 2nd half). * He is a very efficient scorer which Reddit NBA is obsessed with but ignores with Collin. * His supporting cast has been absolutely terrible. Some posters have pointed out that he's getting doubled as much as superstar level players. * He is an incredibly intense player and a great culture fit to any team. * He's knocked for his lack of playmaking, which is fair, but a lot of people don't realize that he isn't a point guard. He's a shooting guard. * He's a short shooting guard, which matters. But it's also not 1995 and we no longer expect all of our two-guards to be 6'6"" or taller.  Collin will never get any love until he puts up the same numbers on a team that's winning basketball games. That's fair. But it's also fair to say that a lot of the criticism is coming from a place of bias based on what Sexton looks like and not what the numbers tell you about his impact."
Collin Sexton is Donovan Mitchell Lite tho
Cj. A variety of good role players like Beasley bev mcdaniels and co. Collin sexton. Fred VanVleet. Malcolm brogdon.  And Houston is likely a bottom 5 seed this year. Why would they trade their pick unprotected ?
Didn’t Collin sexton and Alabama finish the game with 3 players one time?
"Things to take away:  \- Collin Sexton had a few nice drive &amp; dishes, look for him to improve his playmaking abilities this season. He's always been a tank but he looks even... tankier in this video? Not sure if it's just the tank top maybe Cavs fans can chip in.   \- Scottie Barnes' 1v1 defense is insane considering he was able to shut down THJ &amp; Mitchell on two isolation plays. Obviously the NBA is going to be much faster, but this is a good sign for Scottie/Raptors fans.   \- Andre Drummond is absolute garbage lmao"
Exclude Evan Mobley and Collin Sexton and *maybe* you have an argument.
"You know the Cavs have like three point guards and Collin Sexton isn't one of them, right?"
I don't think you can play hack-a-shaq with *two* opposing players - your entire team would foul out before the end of the game. Although this would put a premium on acquiring Collin Sexton (the guy who almost won a game in college playing 3-on-5).
"Collin Sexton with league average height (6'6""). People would look past his flaws and recognize him as the up &amp; coming SG he js."
Collin Sexton is three kids in a trench coat.
Garland can do more off the dribble while also averaging 2 more assists and while having the ball less than Collin. If they switch roles Garlands numbers would dramatically increase. Its just his second season but Garland really has higher potential than Sexton as of rn.  Sexton also seems to not be too popular in the locker room because he dribbles the ball way too much.
"Kidd / Marbury was kind of like if you traded... maybe Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram last year (before Simmons's perception tanked)? Or Collin Sexton with a much higher profile on a marginally better team.   Kidd had gotten way farther in fixing his garbage jumper by then than Simmons has, and he'd been The Man on some good teams, but he was still an extremely unusual star player who hadn't gone deep into the playoffs yet (and the domestic violence case was very much on the Suns' brass's minds). Marbury had put up big numbers and was definitely a star in terms of his public profile, and he was meaningfully younger, but his teams hadn't done anything yet.   If you think about Simmons for Sexton, you can see the outlines of the version the team getting Marbury wins—Simmons is just too weird to build a team around and we've already seen him at his best, Sexton thrives on a good team—and you can see what actually happened if you're able to imagine Ben Simmons hitting threes sometimes and having a full personality transplant."
Just another PF stone for the Cleveland Infinity Gauntlet.  Collin Sexton wouldn't be too terrible for the Sixers assuming that's what Cleveland would want to trade away.
"Westbrook plays intermittently hard but is terrible.  Collin Sexton gives effort and is a very poor defender  Kenneth Faried played hard a d was terrible at PF.  Having said that, if a player plays hard, is adequate physically (not JJ Redick or Kemba), and has any defensive IQ, they’ll be fine. A little more is needed from a C - either athleticism (Embiid/AD), foot speed(Bam), length (Gilbert) or size (Brook), or IQ (Draymond)"
Collin Sexton
Man already forgot Collin sexton jacking up like ten 3s in a row in kyrie/kds face
"It was only last season, but I’d say Collin Sexton going nuclear in the first game of the Nets big three. I think a lot of people also don’t know that the Cavs also beat them two nights later, without KD. It was a very short, fun stretch in the middle of another depressing season"
PLAYERS:     A) Devin Booker   B) Anthony Edwards (2nd half of the year)   C) Donovan Mitchell    B) Collin Sexton
Why isn't Collin Sexton the Sex?
I'm not sold on Collin Sexton. Think he's more bark than bite
"Probably Jarrett Allen. But only because his contract.  Not his fault Cavs gave it to him though.   Other players are prob Collin Sexton. He’s a good scorer, but that’s about it.   Maybe D’Angelo Russell. His game hasn’t really translated to wins."
Cleveland is the sleeper pick here. A trade around Collin Sexton is the only thing I can think of right now that is decent value.
"Cleveland Receives: Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxsey  Philadelphia Receives: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, 2 FRP (Protections)"
"Dreymond, CP3, Jimmy Butler, Steven Adams, Collin Sexton"
Collin Sexton and Kevin love
"I'll start,  Philly:  Malik Beasley   Wolves 1st 2024  Collin Sexton  Ricky Rubio  Cavaliers:  Jaden McDaniels  Patrick Beverley   Philly 1st 2022  Wolves 1st 2022  Minnesota  Ben Simmons"
"Yea obviously, those offers aren't going anywhere. Neither are the Collin Sexton or DeAngelo Russell offers."
I want collin sexton tbh
Steph isn't even top 10 this year in FTA despite being scoring champ tho and this is with alot of big names like Harden and KD not counting cause of injury  He averages less FTA than Collin Sexton
Collin Sexton.
Darius Garland and Collin Sexton
"It seems that *nothing* our FO does is public information. The fact that *nobody* called this trade before it happened should make people stop and think about the ""Cavs are trying to get rid of Collin Sexton"" stuff."
&gt; Collin Sexton is the hardest worker I’ve ever been around  High praise coming from a guy who played with both Kobe and Lebron

That Cavs should trade their #1 scorer and Top 20 scorer in the League Collin Sexton to the Knicks for Obi Toppin (who the Cavs passed on the previous year in the draft) and some middling mid round picks.
Is Collin sexton just monta Ellis with better hair??? Find out after this word from 1 (800) flowers
Collin Sexton
"1) it’s been actually proven through this summer that he’s 6-2+, this is not opinionated, it’s fact. 2)collin sexton is not as willing of a passer as a prototypical passer and turns it over while not having the assist numbers to show well. Look at bbref and you’ll see his slotted position. His main value is scoring and is like AI in the sense that they’re undersized rim attackers."
Collin sexton  Darius garland  Evan Mobley  Jarrett Allen   Okoro or Nance Jr(for the bench)  They can have Love.
"He’s 6’1. And he shares starter time with Collin Sexton... who’s 6’1. That makes both below average even for the point, let alone the 2. Cleveland doesn’t have an actual shooting guard, at least one worth playing.  If you’re going to say something wrong with condescension, why not instead just go “nuh uh”?"
Collin Sexton
"Okay, let me clarify what my argument is because you're really not understanding. There are two main things I'm trying to look at.  First, advanced stats are a useful method for determining the value that players add on the court. They do a better job of combining the impact of both volume and efficiency in a way that basic counting stats like a pts/reb/ast cannot capture. That being said, no single advanced statistic is perfect. For example, PER and WS/48 minutes reward efficiency too much. I'm not saying that any person with a higher PER is a better player than anyone else with a lower PER. I am saying that by looking a several different advanced stats, you can get a better sense of a players impact than you can get by looking at just counting stats.  People who are EASILY top 20 players will usually show up in the top 20 of at least one of these advanced stats. Volume scorers like MVP Iverson will usually perform better in things like WS and VORP. High efficiency guys like MVP Dirk usually get rewarded by PER and BPM. They might show up overperforming in different stats depending on the tradeoff between efficiency and volume, but people who are EASILY top 20 players usually show up in the top 20 of at least one category. The fact that 2004 Lebron doesn't show up in ANY category is an indicator that other players in the league had a better on court impact. Hell, he ranked 3rd in win shares on his own team!  Second, I'm trying to give you additional examples of players that put up big counting stats on bad teams with low efficiency. Lebron's 2004 season was very comparable to Collin Sexton or De'Aaron Fox last season. They were all on bad teams and they all had to carry a larger load than should be expected of them. Why is Lebron's 2004 season better than either of them? You've just been ignoring that part.   By Lebron's second season, he was an MVP contender. He finished top 5 in MVP voting every year from 2006 to 2017. So now if we look back and say Sam Cassell &gt; Lebron James it sounds stupid as hell bc we know what Lebron James is now. Your entire argument has been ""We know Lebron James is better than all these people"". And yes, we know that is true bc of the past 18 years. But in 2004, Sam Cassell, in the best season of his entire career, was better than a rookie Lebron."
"Yeah... and that's also why I didn't give you one specific advanced stat. But you would think that someone who is EASILY a top 20 player would show up somewhere in the top 20 of at least one advanced statistic. A couple of his teammates (who are playing in the exact same context) do show up in the top 20 of advanced stats. Boozer is #16 in PER, #18 in WS, and #16 in ORTG. Big Z is #20 in PER.  Why is 2004 Lebron significantly better than Collin Sexton or De'Aaron Fox this year? They're all on losing teams. They are all putting up good numbers. We would agree that Collin Sexton and De'Aaron Fox are not top 20 players. Why is 2004 Lebron EASILY a top 20 player? Those guys are also putting up volume numbers their teams need them to produce. And they're actually doing it at a better efficiency (even if we adjust for league averages)."
"Lmao, I was 10 at the time and I can’t remember how good players were back then.   What I can tell you is that 2003-2004 Lebron wasn’t within the top 20 of any cumulative advanced stat like PER, WS, WS/48, OBPM, DBPM, BPM, or VORP.   My point was that his counting stats like 21/5/5 can’t give you enough information to determine that he had a good season that any team would want to have. If it were, then every team would also want someone like Collin Sexton on their roster. He is a high volume stat accumulator very similar to Lebron’s rookie year."
"They would give an arm and a leg for it bc he was 18 and it was crazy impressive to show that much potential… but I think this overstates his performance.   Lebron rookie year was 21/5/5 on 49% TS 18.3 PER and 0.78 WS/48.   This year, Collin Sexton was 24/4/3 on 57% TS 18.0 PER and 0.80 WS/48.   League average TS% is 57% today and was 51.6% in 2004. Teams averaged 112 points per game last year and averaged 93 ppg in 2004."
Fake data that came from the nba itself? 💀  This is copium dude.  Collin sexton and Darius Garland are the only shot creators on their team. Cole Anthony is the only playmaker on his team.
Now that I'm looking closer at your data I'm actually certain it's wrong. Steph Curry is not double teamed less than Collin Sexton.  So how about you stop handing out fake data?
Collin Sexton
1. Jamal Murray (assuming health) 2. Ben Simmons 3. Mike Conley 4. Kyle Lowry 5. LaMelo Ball (Hot take?: Will be #2 end of the season) 6. Malcolm Brogdon 7. Fred VanVleet 8. Collin Sexton 9. Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.
Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley  Lonzo  Ben Simmons  Brogdon  Vanvleet  Lamelo  Collin Sexton  D'Lo Russell  &amp;#x200B;  Bruh I dunno.
"Darius Garland - 6'3""  Collin Sexton - 6'1""  Lauri Markkanen - 7'  Evan Mobley - 7'  Jarrett Allen - 6'11""  **Average height: 6'6ish**"
"It’s not like Sexton hasn’t been passing well though. He’s been doing his job as a passer and has been playing good defense. DG hasn’t been the most consistent to start the season and him and Rubio on the floor together has been redundant. Imo our best lineups have either had SexLand or Rubio/Sexton bc Sexton will play offball and is very good at it. Garland’s also getting 4 TOs a game and hasn’t been nearly as valuable to Cleveland as Collin has yet in his career. He’s still just flashes of potential and the idea of what he can be.   Also, Sexton isn’t really an iso scorer, he either plays off ball or PnR. He fits perfectly with our team so far this year and he hasn’t even been hitting his shots every game like normal"
"I'm just spitballing some names off the top of my head.  Collin sexton was dangled in trade talks last season maybe they could have gotten him  This westbrook experiment might still work too, I'm not calling it a failure or anything.  Just giving my take on their possible reasoning for trying to construct their team this way  And no nobody drives and kicks like lebron, but he's got so many miles on his legs I don't think he really wants to or even has the ability to play that way for extended minutes anymore"
"We got our own culture too, the guys work really hard.  I feel really grateful Collin Sexton was our first major rookie because he busts his ass and showed everyone how much you can improve with hard work."
Collin Sexton shoots a better percentage from 3 and is more efficient overall but it’s more that DG has a more traditional game for a guard and so it’s the potential he has as at point despite him really not tapping into it consistently yet

Most of the Cavs sub is pretty respectable but there’s still that portion that’s under the impression that Collin Sexton is still the same player he was as a rookie.  The worst stuff I find are the Cavs fans that I never see on our sub but they’re all over r/NBA
Collin Sexton carried the offense and Mobley is a one man wrecking crew on defense. This is so stunning. The cavs defense has been record breakingly bad at times the last three years and now are absolutely stifiling.
Collin Sexton +17 yet 85% of Cavs fans think he's a sixth man
&gt; Collin sexton  No thank you
Collin sexton. I really think that’s better for the Wiz longterm. Get out of paying Beal 50m per year on his next deal.
"Fox is the fastest, Ja has the quickest first step, Ant is the most explosive. I’d also like to nominate Collin Sexton who could be even faster than all of them. Not to take anything away from Green tho hes still a kid working into his body"
Collin Sexton will be as good as Devin Booker. Theyve had very similar career trajectories except Sexton has actually been the more efficient player
The only reason people care about the Cavs is because it's LeBron's hometown team.  They have everything your average lottery team has but in a less exciting way.  They have a couple dynamic guards that could drop 30 any given night... but they're Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  They have a fancy rotation they go to for the nerds to get excited... but it's just Lauri Markkanen starting at SF.  They have a meme player that people like who's actually a solid NBA pro... but it's just Cedi Osman.  They snatched a franchise changing player via the greatest draft class in recent memory... but it's a bigman.
"when it comes to the Cavs It’s not really misunderstanding the team as a whole in my experience, it’s just certain players. For instance, the fanbase of every other team seems to enjoy Collin Sexton a ball hog even though he passes constantly. He just doesn’t always necessarily do it at the correct time and when he does most of the time the team can’t hit the shot. Another example are fanbases saying we were stupid for paying Allen and drafting Mobley. Saying they can’t fit together when it’s obvious they fit together just fine, there’s still a little friction but that’s to be expected with rookies."
Hahaha I basically posted the same thing.  Did you know there’s no way Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen could ever play together?  Did you know Collin Sexton is a ball hog?
People talk about the Cavs and they don’t watch the Cavs.  They don’t actually know what the Cavs struggle with.  They just rehash things they’ve already heard.  They don’t know who Evan Mobley is.  They just know he is slim and 7ft.  And then they talk about Evan Mobley.  They did the same thing with Collin Sexton for years.
"Looking at his stats, he averaged 23.9 ppg, 4 apg, 2 spg over 11 games. He was also the dunk contest champion. I’d say prime Kemba or Collin Sexton would be a good comp."
"I like Collin Sexton, but Young Bull is a bad nickname. He’s eventually not going to be young and he’s a Cavalier, not a Bull."
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
"ja is so good at changing speed  De’Aaron Fox or Collin Sexton try to torch everyone here, Ja lulls them to sleep and then explodes by them"

Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton getting into an on court argument made it to the top last year. 2 relative no names for casuals on the worst team in the league. You think this one that actually got physical is only a big deal because of hate?
Ricky Rubio and Collin sexton are guaranteed to hit all their shots against the hornets
Collin Sexton has entered the chat
Team of Current Players:  D'Angelo Russell  Collin Sexton  Malik Beasley  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Montrezl Harrell
"Honestly, I think Simmons for Kevin Love and Collin Sexton would be great for the Sixers. Sexton/Maxey/Green/Harris/Embiid with Curry and Love off the bench."
It's not worth maxing him unless you already have a guy of that talent. And the Cavs don't   I'd rather just have cap space and tank than Collin Sexton on a max.
"I’ve watched a lot of Sexton basketball and I don’t understand why everyone is so quick to want to trade him.  I’ve heard “ball hog” thrown around quite a bit and that unfair. Sure he isn’t a skilled passer, but he’s a hyper efficient scorer who deserves to shoot the ball.   He’s so good at getting to his spot, which is such an underrated skill. Once he gets into the 7-15 foot area in the paint it’s over. He’s so crafty with floaters and fade aways, and he’s athletic enough to finish among centers too.   The idea of trading him makes me sick. We don’t have any other talented scorers. Garland is fine, but he isn’t a killer like Sexton. If we trade Collin, I guarantee we’ll be in for a lot more sub-100 scoring nights.  All in all, Collin is a super efficient scorer and I’d hate to lose him."
 it usually just isn’t something that can be easily taught or learned. as a cavs fan i keep hoping that collin sexton could be a PG one day but it seems every year he comes back average in terms of playmaking. it varies but garlands feel for the game day one was so much better than even current collins.
I can certainly see where you’re coming from but a “properly rated” Mitchell is still definitely levels better than Collin Sexton.
Please bring sexton of the bench. Dude is great at getting buckets but he stops the ball on offense and is frustrating to watch. I wouldn’t mind watching him tear up other teams second units but I honestly worry about Mobley’s development playing alongside Collin. He holds and dominates the ball and not in a good way
This is perhaps one of the single worst comments I've ever seen in /NBA. Donovan Mitchell is 10 times the player Collin Sexton is.
"Collin Sexton, years 2 and 3: 22/3.5/3 on 47/37/83  Donovan Mitchell, years 2 and 3: 24/4/4 on 44/36/83  Keep in mind, Mitchell is also a year older in each of those seasons."
"Collin Sexton, as much as he might be a head case and not in the Cavs future plans, deserves better. He’s clearly a starter, why would they keep him just to be a bench scorer and not just trade him?"
Collin Sexton.
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ≤25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
They need to take the deal with Collin sexton and pray it works out. They have Thybulle and Embiid to cover for him on defense so it *might* work

"Respectfully disagree. We know at a minimum he’s worth a former all-star (CJ) or a promising young guard (Collin Sexton, maybe Ty Halliburton depending on which reports you believe).  Alot of the teams trading for him cited his long contract as a plus to the trade, since he couldn’t just leave that market in a year."
"Collin Sexton, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Denzel Valentine, Jonathan Kuminga because lol"
"Collin Sexton is insanely underrated. Most people haven’t watched him play and just go off his draft report but his development has been great. Last year his 24 pts a game at 57%TS and over 40% from 3 put him in a scoring class with the likes of only Luka &amp; Tatum for a 22 year old. He’s going to be really good in 2-3 years, his best trait is he gets better every season"
"4 good but not great players don’t add up to a good team. Maybe Garland can take a big leap, but they need a better first option otherwise. Collin Sexton just isn’t fit to be the best player in a team’s offense"
If your best player is Collin Sexton you aren't a good team
"I don't think Sexton is an asshole, but he pretty clearly rubbed some veterans the wrong way as a rookie and I think the scout's assessment of him as a player is pretty accurate. I like Collin Sexton for his entertainment value and his drive, but I don't actually think he would be more than a bench scorer on a championship level team. He simply doesn't do anything other than score. That's the single most important skill, but it can't be your *only* skill if you want to be a team's centerpiece.  Similarly, this scout is right about Okoro too. Could be a fantastic defender, but unlikely to do anything else. On the other hand, this dude is on drugs if he thinks getting rid of Drummond was a bad idea."
&gt; I think Collin Sexton is a backup and an a--hole. None of his teammates like him.  Yeesh.
"&gt; There have been a bunch of reports out of Cleveland that Collin can be a bit... headstrong in a basketball sense.  Every ""report"" like this I've seen ultimately sources Joe Vardon's article for the Athletic a couple years ago which was largely based on one infamous clip where Kevin Love appeared to be irritated at Sexton but was actually irritated at legitimately irritating coach Jim Beilein."
"From where?  There [](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/05/04/cavaliers-collin-sexton-having-issues-with-teammates/amp/)have been stories about him having locker room issues going back to his rookie year   https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/05/04/cavaliers-collin-sexton-having-issues-with-teammates/amp/  You’d have to have your head buried in the sand as a Cavs fan not to have noticed, I don’t follow the Cavs at all and I’ve heard the noise"
"I think the BIGGEST problem here is Morey.   I'm sure they've gotten any number of offers that would make the Sixers better.   They would have likely beat the Hawks with ANY other starting point guard in the league (and likely some back-up point guards too).   FVV for Simmons. TAKE IT.   De'Aaron Fox for Simmons? TAKE IT.  Darius Garland or Collin Sexton for Simmons? TAKE IT.   They are ALL an improvement on Simmons. HE IS THAT BAD.  People will say ""But his defense.""  HE IS ONLY GOOD ON DEFENSE BECAUSE HE IS SO GOD DAMNED TALL for his position. If he were the same height as every guy he defended, he'd be above average.   I've seen that guy get embarrassed on defense almost every time I've seen him play. He's Gary Payton reincarnated or something. He's just a dude who has a lot of length compared to other point guards. Have him guard a guy his own size in the post and he's FUCKED.   &amp;#x200B;  But Morey thinks he's going to be able to get assets for him at a time when the rest of the league now knows how FUCKING TRASH this guy is."

"There are a few ways player can fall into this category. You have players who stats don't reflect their actual value, you have players that put up great numbers but only do so because they're on a bad team, and then you have guys that actively hurt their team in their quest for numbers. Drummond has fallen between 1 and 3 throughout his career. It doesn't mean he's a bad player, it's just he's taking on a role offensively that doesn't lead to a good offense.  The middle group is really interesting and I think we are seeing a lot more players in that group. These would be guys like Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton. I know initially that sounds ridiculous and it's not saying they're bad players. Quite the opposite, all are great players and could contribute to contending teams. They're just not going to put up those numbers on good teams. They're great scorers and carried their team's offense, but they were on bad teams. I really think Lavine will be a much better player this year by getting to play off the ball more and not be responsible for playmaking, but his stats will likely take a bit of a dip despite being more impactful in the winning department."

"No, you're wrong for comparing a far less talented squad with a team that has legitimate star power and thinking they would have the same result. No one is saying that the Bulls are going to make the finals or even conference finals but you're legit comparing this year's bulls with last year's cavs led by Collin Sexton.."
"Rodman, Bron, Dumars, Isiah, Kyrie. Tie for 6th Collin Sexton and Laimbeer."
Lebron  Shaq  Giannis  Luka  Collin Sexton
Jaylen without a beard just looks like Collin Sexton.
"Add Buddy Hield to your list. Also, Collin Sexton"
Collin Sexton. He has the potential to either win or lose a conference finals game all on his own. Hope he gets the chance.

Collin Sexton will kill it on the Sixers tho...
"I still think there are better assets that are realistically available to them. This trade makes them better short term but still not legit title contenders. And brogdon and levert aren’t going to gain any value as assets going forward. Those picks are also useless considering the overs are perennially average to above average, and adding simmons jacks up their floor even higher.  It’s a massive bungle if they don’t atleast get something with high upside, like Collin Sexton as an example."
All good. They def need to trade him but this package is not it. Neither levert or brogdon are significant assets for a future trade. I’m suprised we don’t here more smoke about Collin Sexton. He is atleast young with room to grow.

Tell that to Collin Sexton
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"My homer pick is Collin Sexton. I freaking love that guy and if we trade him I’ll be devastated.  My non-homer pick is either Devin Booker or Steph Curry.   Steph is the player that got me into the NBA and inspired me to work harder. I thought basketball was just a boring old sport until I watched him go off in 2012 against the Knicks. I was in Middle School at the time and I was just amazed at his shooting. He singlehandedly inspired me to get in the gym and work on my game. I studied his jumpshot and tried to replicate every little bit of it to look like him.   Too bad we had to become rivals. I despised him after playing against him in 2015 but we’ve come full circle and he’s one of my favorite players in the league.  I like Booker because he’s who I try and play like now. His mid range and post game are so smooth. He doesn’t have a super tight handle, but he kills dudes with subtle jabs, pump fakes and little fade aways. Absolutely love his game."
"Collin Sexton.   He has to prove that he's worth the big money he's likely to be asking the Cavs for. We've got Garland who looks every bit a future All Star point-guard and Okoro who looks like he's better at the 2 than the 3. If the latter is true, then it could become difficult to justify paying Collin, particularly when our pick for 2022 may well end up being in the territory where we could get a wing like AJ Griffin, Patrick Baldwin Jr, Caleb Houstan or Nikola Jovic."
What’s the alternative? Beal or Dame aren’t available and those are the only two guys on Kyrie’s level. I would rather take that risk than go for Collin Sexton
And Collin Sexton is its necromancer
"I'd have to disagree just based on the strength of the Eastern Conference now. I don't think even another leap for Collin Sexton and a mini leap from Darius Garland would be enough to make the play-in. It's no disrespect to them, it's respect to the other Eastern teams and the overall talent of the league top-to-bottom. Almost everyone has promising young players or bonafide stars. The Cavs aren't alone in that, and I tried to account for that as well when projecting them this year."
"Not sure why the Cavs would do this  You can get more for Collin Sexton than Beasley, McDaniels, and a pick that probably wont even be top 10"
"Put some respect on Collin ""Nets pick"" Sexton"
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
"Cavs:  *2016: Kay Felder - Marcus Paige  We didn’t select Felder, but the Hawks traded him to us on draft night.  2017: No draft selections  2018: Collin Sexton - Kevin Knox  2019: Darius Garland - Jarrett Culver   2020: Isaac Okoro - Onyeka Okongwu  Yeah I’ll stick with what we drafted."
And Collin Sexton is umm..
Collin Sexton with a fresh fade.
Considering Collin Sexton is that Nets pick yes
Curry is a fraud. I’m taking Collin sexton over him in a game 7 personally
I wonder how much of the hustle culture stems from Collin Sexton.  He’s worked his butt off for years.
This is without Collin sexton AND our best shooter Cedi Osman 😈
When Collin Sexton outplayed every single one of the big three was bloody amazing
Collin Sexton was injured by his own teammate
everybody gets injured while playing against the knicks this season  we've ended multiple players' seasons and now 2 injuries in one game against the hawks  we might have cost collin sexton money cause he's up for a contract
Who is more overrated? People act like he's the key for Utah. He's inefficient and his defense stinks. I don't know why I'm supposed to think he's better than Collin Sexton.
"Collin Sexton can be pretty polarizing on the Cavs sub, but I feel like it’s almost entirely about his contract situation"
Darius Garland and Collin Sexton: “Are we jokes to you?”
"Quite a few with the scoring proliferation the last few years pre-rule changes.  I mean, Collin Sexton was averaging 24ppg"
"well the best player here that is actuallly interesting is Collin Sexton, because the Cavs shouldn’t match tbh"

"You can add Collin Sexton to the list, although I don't think he'd be first. Averaged 24 pts last year on pretty good efficiency. Out for the season now tho."

Absolutely no one in an NBA front office thinks Collin Sexton is worth 4/100 or 5/100 at this point.  He's more of a 4/64 guy at most right now.
"fuck that's two players seasons we've ended so far   first patrick williams on the bulls and now collin sexton  we're a menace, and not in a good way.  I dont even remember what play it happened on, did we do something dirty or is it just unfortunate luck"
I love Collin Sexton. But he was 22nd in the league in scoring last year. That’s not necessarily worth too money nowadays. Especially when he doesn’t bring much else to the table.
"Collin will be back. Feelings aside, I really like the way the Cavs have been playing sans Sexton. No one wants to say it but Cavs are better without Sexton at times or possibly most times."
"""Collin Sexton needs to come off the bench"".  Look, he's either a good player or a bad player or somewhere in between, but it's not going to make any fucking difference whether he's a starter or just plays starter minutes. He's still going to be good or bad or somewhere in between."
Collin Sexton
"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
"The warriors have guys like Steph, Draymond and Kuminga.  We had JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love, and rookie Collin Sexton."
Collin Sexton and Kevin Love for LeBron.
Collin Sexton.
Collin Sexton Ricky Davis arc incoming. /s
collin sexton would probably have gotten up there (i think he was 5 games into the season) but he's injured.
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
"I think we are set up so much better than when lebron was drafted. We're coming out of a rebuild right now rather than entering one. Lebron had us as a playoff team by our second year, and losing boozer pretty much fucked us as we were already too good to draft a secondary star. This year we have Garland who is really coming along nicely, could be a future all star. Jarrett Allen is a very good player and unlike big Z is young and healthy. Collin Sexton is a nice piece who could be re-signed for a reasonable contract it seems. We do need a SF but there is way more talent on this roster than the one that drafted Lebron."
Darius Galrand alone is better than any player LeBron had in his first stint.   Not to mention Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton
That one game where Collin Sexton obliterated the Nets is up there too
"The Heat were higher on Bogdanovic, they took him with their first pick (3 spots after Cole went). However, given Lebron’s public admiration of Cole and, in lieu of long term development, ultimately flipped Bogdanovic *and* a 2nd rounder for Cole. Bogdanovic has had the better professional career but needed a few years of development. Cole was ready to play and the Heat could afford him.   [Lebron also wanted the Cavs to draft Collin Sexton](https://sports.yahoo.com/cavaliers-draft-collin-sexton-lebron-james-just-happened-prefer-no-8-pick-010721600.html) and, while the Cavs FO definitely had interest in Sexton, it was rumored part of the reason they selected him was to keep Lebron in Cleveland. Ultimately it didn’t work and Lebron went to LA. I won’t argue whether the Cavs could have gotten better value, but again, this seems to be a situation where Lebron’s sphere of influence affects team building."
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
Didn't something like this happen to Collin Sexton in college
"&gt;unstoppable  His entire tenure in Philadelphia, his TS+ ranged from 93-102.   That's about Collin Sexton-level efficiency."
"cavs move the ball so much better  there’s multiple possessions every 4th quarter where collin will pound the ball for 12 seconds straight. he looks to pass more than he used to, but he’s still straight up not good at it. he hardly ever passes anybody open, he uses the pass after 3 different scoring methods. Garland and rubio are both top 10 in the entire league for assists and evan mobley gets more assists than sexton. collin just passes as a last resort so that’s why he’s passes aren’t quality.   sexton’s shooting this year has also not been good enough to play over rubio. he’s at 27 percent and his small size and the hitch in his jumper makes his pull-up so iffy. he’s shooting 54% from 2p% which is significantly higher than his career average, if that can’t be sustained, that’s another element to it   he averaged 6.5 FTA last year and now he’s halved that, he’s not able to get all those easy points due to rule changes and role changes. if he can’t get his free throws back up, his rep as an efficient scorer is in trouble  what playoff team starts a shooting guard that has more turnovers than assists every game?   lastly, this team belongs to Evan Mobley. everything about the roster needs to be about maximizing the fit around Mobley. we do not need a guard who is a below league average shooter, is weak as can be in the PnR, and cannot switch onto anybody on defense without being a total liability. we need switchable guards who shoot the ball and be secondary playmakers (Jute Holliday)  the Nets just drafted Cam Thomas at like pick 28, that’s where you get your guy that was born to get buckets.   cavs defense is improved because while their length is creating so many problems, rubio protects the rim by being one of the premier perimeter defenders in the league. sexton is still bad at defense and he is so bad at working through screens  tl;dr i think rubio is a lot better"
"Talk is just talk. Just look at the numbers in the last month. Absolutely abysmal, you can tell he's frazzled by being outplayed by both Garland and Rubio, and that he is constantly in trade talks.  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4277811/collin-sexton.  Rubio is wiser, craftier, more efficient in the +/- and is shooting 3s at a higher clip....than wait for it....the greatest shooter of all time, Steph Curry. He needs to be starting if the team wants to push for the playoffs this year...instead of HALF-TANK for the lottery as we always do.  And bruh you do know playoff basketball is DIFFERENT than regular season basketball right? Sexton might put up numbers in regular season. But playoff basketball is entirely difference. Its built on defense and its harder to score because of it. Aint no 6'0 backcourt ever going far in the playoffs, when was the last time that EVER happened. Garland/Sexton backcourt is a completely faucet on D. You really think they can go hold up defensively in the PLAYOFFS? Think with your head man, thats how teams win Championships, like how the Bucks traded away tiny shoot-first Bledsoe for DEFENSIVE BIG GUARD Jrue Holiday. Facts do not lie."
"Yeah for sure dude. Ainge saw Fultz shooting and concluded ""yeah looks like Thoracic outlet syndrome. If I draft #3 I could see the sixers misdiagnosing the shoulder injury repeatedly until Fultz gets traded to the magic and he'll tear his ACL."" If he's such a brilliant GM, why didn't he foresee Kyrie being a locker room cancer and give away the pick that would end up being Collin Sexton?   All you redditors and your hindsight could swear you know everything."
"A what if I like to wonder about is what would happen if we never make the Kyrie trade at all. IT sits out the season due to injury, Smart/Rozier become our featured backcourt, we keep the Nets pick that ends up being 8th that year.   Would we have tried to trade up to get Luka? Would we have taken Collin Sexton? SGA? MPJ?"
"Cavs offer Kevin Love, Collin Sexton and a 1st."
It’s basically sextons contract year. He’s putting the game aside for a second and giving Collin a chance to prove and redeem himself a little. Didn’t work but Sexton can’t be pissed if they don’t go to him next time.
And it was between 6’6 Gary Trent jr and 6’1 Collin sexton….  Was literally most beneficial to the raptors to call it a jump ball
"I mean, you also had 6’6 Gary Trent Jr lose a jump ball to 6’1 Collin Sexton. But if you wanna cry refs and lucky shot, sure"
"Y’all crying how it was a jump ball? How does 6’6 Gary Trent Jr lose a jump ball to 6’1 Collin sexton.   It was either a jump ball or Collin keeps possession, he lost control of the ball and got it back….  If anything, the jump ball should’ve been beneficial to toronto because of the height difference….."
"Either Collin Sexton got blocked/fouled, and it shouldn't have been a jump ball because Gary Trent never had the ball, or Collin Sexton didn't get blocked/fouled, in which case it's just a travel."
I cannot stand watching Collin Sexton. Every time I do he does some stupid shit that makes me want to punch the screen.
"Ricky Rubio with the team-high +11 on 0-7 shooting, while Collin Sexton has the team-low -11 on 8-12 shooting, is really the story of this Cavs team, lol"
"lost in this nonsense is the typical Collin Sexton experience - awful decisions on where to go with the ball, turn it over because you have no idea how to pass...and repeat several minutes later"
"Evan Mobley, Jarret Allen, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Dylan Windler, Issac Okoro, and Cedi Osman (For now)."
"Collin Sexton, Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, and Malcom Brogdon. I'm sure other discussions have occurred. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean no discussions have been taking place."
"I’d trade Jarrett Allen, Collin Sexton, and unprotected 2022 1st for Tatum, but Boston would probably just hang up lol"
"I saw someone calling Evan Mobley ""Evan Garnett"" the other day and that really tickled me.  When Matthew Dellavedova was here, Outback Jesus was a pretty good name.  Of course there's Sexland for Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  There's been the name floating around for our trio of 7-footers (Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, Lauri Markkanen) of ""Tower City"" because there's an area in Cleveland called the Tower City Center. Though personally, as a Kent State alum, I'm hoping to get the name ""Tri-Towers"" going because those were the dorms I lived in."
"How does your post reflect what is going on in LAC? Reggie Jackson showed capable playmaking skills in DET, and Bledsoe showed playmaking skills in PHO and other stints. This isn’t like they’re starting Beverly and Collin Sexton in the backcourt…"
Would you take Collin Sexton for Tingus Pingus?
"It’s a good problem to have, but the Cavs need to get to the bottom of why they get a big lead and then just lose it.  They’re doing the right things early, consistently.  Suddenly the other team is right back in it.  One problem is that we used to have guys who could just go get a bucket.  Collin Sexton is struggling with that right now.  I think the lanes are clogged up and I know he’s not shooting well from 3.  Ricky Rubio has a huge impact right now but he’s not really someone you want to depend on long term.  A lot of Cavs fans point at poor rotations and it seems like JB Bickerstaff never calls a timeout when he desperately needs one.  I’m having fun watching this though and if we’re being honest, there’s a world where this Cavs team is utter shit, can’t score and doesn’t play any defense.  I’m excited that’s not what we’re seeing right now."
No way! You’re telling me Kobe wasn’t just a taller Collin Sexton?
"explain how sexton has better game feel than garland please. i'm not a cavs fan but i have watched the vast majority of their career (full games) and I honestly would like to know how anyone could think collin has a better feel for game sense and flow than DG. And this is me acknowledging that sexton has gotten an unfair rap among fans and undoubtedly brings an incredible intensity and motor to the court. I think several of your criticisms of garland are absolutely valid, but in trying to determine their career arcs, I think it's completely understandable why there are reservations as to what role collin can contribute to a contender and as a complement to Mobley (who is clearly a special player)."
"Collin has been sacrificing this year and trying to do what the coaching staff has asked him to do since he got to the Cavs.  The fact that people complain about it is the fact they're too dumb to realize that it's the coaching staff being the problem 99% of the time.  I honestly want Sexton traded not because I think he's not a fit or it'll make the team better, but because he deserves better fans to root for him and a situation that will let him shine."
"&gt;When Garland is out, he actually looks like a capable PG.   Going to have to hard disagree with this. He has gotten better at finding the open guy on the occasional dump off than he used to be. But he isn't able to proactively create for others on a consistent basis like Rubio and Garland. You can also really see his tunnel vision setting back in at times. There have been moments this season where opponents will over commit from the help side as soon as Collin gets the ball because they know he isn't going to make the right pass. But Collin has still tried to force his way through the defense on those same possessions only to be met with a wall of defenders and no where to go.  There have been games this year where Collin scores efficiently within the flow of the offense. Those nights I love to have him on the team and what he brings. Catch the ball and knock down an open shot, catch the ball and take a couple quick dribbles to the hoop while the defense is still trying to rotate. But he still has quarters where he opts to just pound the air out of the ball for entire possessions, goes nowhere and puts up a poor attempt.  I'm not of the thought that we just have to dump one or the other just to do it. But I would also not be excited about giving Sexton a max contract."
Have we ever seen D'Ernest Johnson and Collin Sexton in the same room? They're probably the same person.
"I disagree, I would say until the LA game, he looked good. Then in the LA game, they really took the ball out of his hands completely and forced the offense to run through Garland no matter what. Previous game Collin Sexton got to go ham against the Clippers and looked great. Even though he had 5 turnovers, he was using way more possessions so his 3 turnovers against the Lakers seemed far more egregious.  I think you'll notice a tendency of he tends to look worse when they run the offense only through Garland."
"Didn't see this mentioned yet, but:  &gt; I think Collin Sexton is a backup and an a--hole. None of his teammates like him. I like Darius Garland. I actually like Garland. I think he plays hard. He puts pressure on you because he can shoot, he can pass, and he's a much more willing passer. He's not out there trying to f------ get his stats and go home in the same way that Sexton is. I don't think they can play those two small guards together and get a ton out of them.  &gt; https://www.si.com/nba/2021/10/15/nba-preview-anonymous-scout-takes-lakers-nets-warriors-bucks"
"if your team is down by 20 points every game you're not gonna see the toughest defenses anymore, other teams will rest their starters and you can face their bench for long stretches  and someone has to take shots and end possessions, bad teams will let you take a lot of shots if they dont even care about winning or are tanking on purpose.    being a knicks fan I'm an expert on bad teams, we got kristaps paid  would you want collin sexton 5yrs 150m on the raptors?   raptors could get him for sure if they wanted"
Collin Sexton blows
"James young, jaylen brown, markelle fultz and Collin sexton"

Collin Sexton

Collin Sexton and the 3rd pick for Dame plz.
Luka kinda a jerk. Who sack taps Collin Sexton?
"Collin Sexton for Lebron straight up, who says no   I don’t know if Lebron would ever want to play in Cleveland though"
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
nah i think he's gonna be washed this season i think the warriors should trade him and some picks for collin sexton so they can get off his contract before everyone finds out he's washed
Collin Sexton would disagree
Inspired by his Cavs mentor Collin Sexton
Wtf is cleveland gonna do with cap room? Best case they get someone as good as Collin Sexton and use it to re-sign them
But this is one of those 10%. Collin Sexton would have to go to a team with two star guards like Portland or Warriors to not be starting.
Watching Collin sexton highlights rn
Collin Sexton? Max deal? Is he worth that?
"Garland’s a much better 3 point shooter and passer. Sexton is a great scorer, but to this point he isn’t a volume 3 point shooter and it’s unlikely that he’ll ever be the passer or game manager that you need out of your lead guard.   Garland is the easier fit and probably has the higher upside. Collin is the better player now and is already a legit nba player."
"Just a rumor, there’s no real tension or concern about them coexisting that I know of yet, but [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavaliersnation.com/2021/06/06/report-several-nba-people-prefer-darius-garland-over-collin-sexton/amp/) is an example."
"&gt; but I know their front office has said they would prefer to keep Darius Garland over Collin Sexton given the choice.  This isn't intended as sarcasm or anything, it's just that this really is new to me, could you give me a link? lol"
"We have an identity, based on Young Bull Sexton. We are a grit and grind it out team like Collin is, we'll fight to the last second even in meaningless end of season games when we should be tanking. Period."
"Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle  Thunder receive: Kevin Love, 2023 top-8 protected FRP from Cleveland  76ers receive: Kemba Walker, Collin Sexton"
Is Collin Sexton or Kevin Love an All star? Lmao
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas – New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama – Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France – New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington – Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona – Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan – Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia – Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington – Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky – Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest – L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
Collin sexton for Ben Simmons straight up
"and also I’m not trying to make it seem like Dejounte is some amazing player that is a true championship quality point guard, idk if that’s true, but at the start of the playoffs is was agreed that the Sixers had a cakewalk to the conference finals and I think that if they had pretty much any other starting point guard in the league(outside of a few) over this version of Ben Simmons who did not attempt a field goal in the 4th quarter and averaged like 11 ppg they could beat an 8th seed and 5th seed as the 1st seed. Dejounte on this team would have Philly in the ecf, so would like Malcolm Brogdan, Kyle Lowry, Collin Sexton, either Ball brother, man maybe even healthy Markelle Fultz or half healthy Kemba Walker idk Ben Simmons was just that bad"
"And the Collin Sexton pick essentially led to Kyrie Irving in Boston, *who then signed with the Brooklyn Nets two years later.*  I literally just made that connection in my head."
Can I interest you in a slightly used Collin Sexton and a completely beat to shit Kevin Love
Collin Sexton and Kevin Love?
I'd do a Sexton for Simmons swap idc  Klove and Collin works money wise...just saying.
Collin Sexton.
Lmao. Collin sexton Bama vs Mississippi state vibes
"Nah, you need Collin Sexton."
"I hope you burn in eternal hell for the sins you’ve committed upon this world. Fuck you, Darius Garland, and Collin Sexton your poverty ass team"
"If Collin Sexton, Jerami Grant, or Jonathan Isaac were my franchise player, I'd probably stop watching basketball for a few years."
Collin Sexton and the Cavs?
"Idk if Collin Sexton counts? I never thought he’d be good, but even though he’s fairly good now, I still wouldn’t want him on my team.  Ben Mclemore too....I thought he’d be a great scorer in the league."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"LeBron asked the Cavaliers to do this at the trade deadline in 2018 to get another veteran and refused to do it. They did get Collin Sexton with that pick, who has wound up being a good for them, but a lot of insiders said that the organization refusing to surrender that pick for some band aid veteran on a team that had no shot at beating the Warriors IMO was the straw that broke the camel’s back for LeBron to leave Cleveland again."
"My favorite thing is the assumption that good players on bad teams aren’t actually worth anything so please take this bad trade for them!  “Can you imagine how good Collin Sexton would be next to x player?  Larry Nance Jr would be awesome on our team, we should try to trade garbage for him."
Yes I’m a fraud in several aspects of my life but the Collin Sexton connection is real
Is Collin Sexton getting traded?
"Based on BB-Ref, Collin Sexton had a better efficiency in his first 3 seasons with Cleveland than Dion Waiters did in Cleveland. There is also that *feel* for the game that doesn’t appear on the stats that Collin has, that *Mama Mentality ™*."
"His ceiling is Collin Sexton, the All Star. But legit, I promise you this kid will be a winner. He had that*Mamba* mentality."
"More than anything, it’s about the long term implications of playing Sexton and Garland together. As of right now, we are dollar store Portland with two undersized but talented guards and we’ve seen how well that’s worked for the blazers. The thinking is, you trade Sexton now while his value is high, so you don’t have to pay him. I love Collin but would definitely be down to move him for the right return."
"Sexton can be our best player (right now) and still not be worth a max. All he does is put up points and nothing else. He's a good player that can help a playoff team win, but it's more of a Jordan Clarkson role than being a legit starter. SexLand isn't viable long term so one of them has to go (or at least go to the bench). Since Collin can't run the offense and will most likely demand a max this summer, it would be best to trade him if we can. But since his trade value is almost Drummond-like, the best way to go now is just match any offer sheet in RFA next summer"
"As recently suggested in the Cavs sub… Collin Sexton, Kevin Love and Taurean Prince to the Knicks for RJ Barrett, Immanual Quickley, Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and picks 19, 21, 32, 58 lmao."
Are you gonna be mad or happy when he gets thrown into a deal for Collin Sexton next week before the draft

"We can disagree without being so immature. Collin Sexton isn't the first option we need to hitch our rebuild to. It's tempting to ruin a rebuild and give big money to Sexton, but he isn't the guy."
"And the Kyrie trade, which the pick from the Celtics was the Nets pick which they used to draft Collin Sexton..."
"Nets tried to acquire Collin Sexton for James Garden, Kylie Irving, and Kevin Durant, but Cavs refused."

"Not really sure he has a point. If Collin Sexton knocks the Nets out in the first round, how are they going to play anyone better?"

I think it's also a good time to remind everyone that the Nets pick from the Kyrie trade was used to draft Collin Sexton. Koby Altman just don't miss when involved in blockbuster trades

"we are hella injured, but the games are still pretty good. Collin sexton is very entertaining when he's back though"
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"4 center, 1 guard full court alley oop lineup.  Start Collin Sexton with Love, Drummond, Nance, and McGee and just roll with that."
"Collin Sexton was traded for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry when he was 14, and again for Kyrie Irving when he was 18 before he’d even got to the league. Imagine telling a 14 year old Collin Sexton in his freshman year of high school that he’d be traded for 2 future HOFers, and the NBA ROTY from 2 years ago who just made his first All Star game."
Imagine Collin Sexton just chilling in practice and Prince and Allen just walk into the facility like a regular day
So who's the worst player you guys would take on your team over Kyrie due to how much of a locker room cancer he is?  I'll start bold and say Collin Sexton
"How dare you refer to the young bull, Collin Sexton, as almost nothing."
I’m pretty sure there’s more than 9 point guards in the NBA that are better than Collin Sexton
"he's another example to me of a guys ceiling is what you make it. he's clearly good at basketball but this dudes out here knocking down threes off the dribble and doing super impressive shit. I'm not saying just anyone can do that shit, but I do think being treated like a high pick and being treated like you're expected to be the fuckin man helps push dudes to actually TRY to get there.   i think if Lonnie Walker played on some trash team, he'd look like something in the middle of Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton but he's always been  given a short leash having his minutes fucked with and all this shit. let dudes play, let em grow and get better, and you might be surprised who makes shit happen."
Getting Collin Sexton out of this literally looks more satisfying with each passing day. Including last year and the year before.
Rev up your Collin Sexton &gt; Kyrie Irving hot takes everybody
"Lamelo's numbers aren't concerning at all, low 40s from the field+low 50s true shooting is pretty standard for rookies in a lead ball handling role. Guys like Trae Young, Collin Sexton, De'Aaron Fox all had numbers in that range their rookie year. Learning how to play against NBA level physicality, draw fouls, and finish against hyper athletic shot blockers comes with time, and struggling at those things initially is just par for the course."

Collin Sexton or Julius Randle
Lmao you genuinely can not be saying you’d rather have Collin Sexton over all star starter last season Kemba Walker. Collin sexton is a stat stuffer on a bad team.
hopefully he can develop into a collin sexton level scorer one day

Kevin Martin would be like cj McCollum/Collin sexton and Michael redd would be tj warren/Gordon Hayward
comparing Zach Lavine and Collin Sexton.  especially in an inflated era
if u think 2011 d rose is comparable to Collin Sexton then its obvious that you have not watched 2011 d rose
dude got MVP with Zach lavine and Collin Sexton type numbers. they just didn't wanna give it to Lebron cause he joined Miami
Most of these “progression” is a result of better shooting. Maybe I’m sceptical but I don’t think Jaylen Brown and Collin Sexton are going to be averaging 57% and 55% shooting for the rest of the season
"Y'all are wild rn. MVP frontrunner is clearly the young bull, Collin Sexton."

"It's insane in a such a loaded 2018 draft class with Luka, Ayton, Trae, Jaren Jackson, Collin Sexton, SGA, Michael Porter Jr, etc., the Kings ended up with Marvin Bagley. He looks terrible. He's getting bullied by Draymond when he's playing offense and bullied by Steph and Wiseman when he's playing defense. He has no feel for the game, no touch, doesn't make decisions quickly. He honestly doesn't do anything well. Is this just the injuries or is he just not learning?"
I hope they do not drop at all;  Tobias Harris Collin Sexton Pfizer P Kelly Oubre
Jaylen Brown and Collin Sexton

"How many more random players are people gonna be link to us?People literally make these threads just to dump on the Celtics.   Threads made just to dump on Celtics/Danny Tracker:  Should've traded for:  ~~Paul George~~  ~~Jimmy Butler~~  ~~Anthony Davis~~  ~~Kawhi Leonard~~  ~~James Harden~~  Should've drafted:  ~~Collin Sexton~~  Yes, instead of trading an injured IT &amp; the no.8 pick for Kyrie, we should've kept it. Sub would still dump on us for hoarding assets  Or Imagine if we did trade for Kawhi or AD as basically 1 year rentals &amp; didn't win a thing. Sub would absolutely sh*t on Danny Ainge for trading JB   And absolutely no one on here would praise us for going for it"
On one hand we were gifted this win from the Hawks. The third quarter was bad and I am 100% sure we would have lost if it wasn’t a back to back. The Cavs were not doing that well either but luckily Collin Sexton decided he couldn’t lose in his hometown and dragged us to a win.   I think the problems for the hawk is that the team is young. They shot 50% on free throws as a team. This made a difference and there was some sloppy turnovers at the end. Taking care of the ball and making sure you limit mistakes by limiting flashy plays is critical in B2B games and probably the main takeaway the team will hear from the coach.
"I feel like collin sexton is being madly overrated right now, i tuik hes a good player, but unless he takes HUGE leaps in playmaking/defense theres no way he makes multiple all star teams lol as the other guy said, someone like beal whos much much better than him and dozens of other better players than him didnt make it. Lets calm down"

"Cavs track the shots players took. Back in 2019, Sexton took about a third of 9000 shots in a week of practice. Per [this article](https://theundefeated.com/features/the-new-kid-in-cleveland-collin-sexton/).  He definitely is the type of player to over-practice."
I didn’t know Collin Sexton was like that😂 gg bro
Collin Sexton is shooting 2000% on 12 foot one handed push shots this season
"Cavs fought like hell and deserved this one. Got down big and stayed focused and got back in it. That Collin Sexton 3 was fucking cold blooded.   As for the Hawks, after the first quarter it just seemed like they were completely drained of energy. A few bursts of good play but mostly just played like shit for the rest of the game. Not to mention the basket seemed to have a lid even for the easiest layups and dunks. Tough game to lose but young teams learn from it."
Collin Sexton is an allstar and I will physically fight with anyone who says otherwise.
"Collin Sexton has arrived ladies and gentlemen, he's the real deal."
Collin Sexton has looked incredible this season. Giving me a lot of hope for the future
"Collin Sexton is more of a combo guard, but he is an awful passer"
"Nah, most improved is Collin Sexton or Someone like Jermi Grant.     But..."
"Because there’s a little bit of sport that is exploiting cheese moves. I’m not the best 2K player and I don’t exactly know the in’s and out’s well enough to set up complicated off ball sets. But I can run a Collin Sexton PnR with the occasional kick out to Tyler Herro with some decent 3&amp;D players and win a chip on 2K. Not gonna lie, it’s not the most exciting way to play, but there’s enough variation and enough of a challenge that it takes a bit of problem solving and throws up the odd highlight play that I keep going back.  You’ve got the Harden iso, Steph Curry off ball sets and Lebron’s drive and kick are cheese moves that formed the basis of successful teams offense."
