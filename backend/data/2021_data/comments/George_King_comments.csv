george costanza is a king so...
"I think most would go with Carmelo these days, and some might go with Nique.  I'd say Chris Webber? Maybe. Hard to say. Bob Lanier  George Gervin is certainly up there.  Alex English. Benard King.  Grant Hill.   Nash. Lots of great point guards on that list. Tim Hardaway. Pistol Pete.   Vince Carter.   &amp;#x200B;  Blake and CP3 are still playing, so we'll see."
"Extra devil's advocate, even when he played with LeBron he had some pretty poor performances that just got swept under the rug because of LeBron.   [From someone else's old comment:](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mido6/the_hill_that_you_are_willing_to_die_on/dzo3ptk/)  &gt; I wouldn't ""die on"" the hill for the argument I'm about to make but I think the narrative of Kyrie as some ""clutch playoff assassin"" is overblown and highlights how he just got to benefit greatly from playing next to LeBron. Nobody noticed when he played poorly in the playoffs they just blamed LeBron &gt;  &gt; A) Kyrie shoots 38% from the field the first two games of each of the past two nba finals games they lost averaging about 21/4? Everybody just blamed LeBron. And teams who fall down 2-0 lose series about 93% of the time it does matter despite that 2016 miracle comeback &gt;  &gt; B) Kyrie shoots 39% from the field the first two rounds of the playoffs last year? Nobody notices because LeBron makes sure it doesn't matter &gt;  &gt; C) Kyrie shoots 35% from the field averaging 18 ppg the first 4 games of the 2015 series vs Chicago? LeBron hits a buzzer beater to prevent them from going down 3-1 and bails everybody out &gt;  &gt; D) Kyrie is only a 28% shooter in playoff crunchtime situations. Amongst stars this is a bottom level figure. But nobody remembers they only remember that one massive shot he hit and whenever the Cavs lost close games LeBron got all the scrutiny &gt;  &gt; E) in the 2nd half of game 6 of the 2016 finals kyrie was god awful. 1/7 for 3 points. The Warriors had cut a 24 lead to 8 and in that span this cavs had a whopping 14 points over 12 minutes. The Cavs were BEGGING to give that game away and have a clippers game 6 2015 type collapse &gt;  &gt; But of course LeBron bails everybody out goes King Kong mode that 2nd half and kyrie gets let off the hook again &gt;  &gt; Kyrie has been far from a bad playoff performer but this narrative of him as some playoff assassin is overdone  Kyrie hasn't just struggled as a #1 on his own. He also struggled at times playing next to LeBron. When other stars have performances like those they often lose and the player gets labelled a choker.   Paul George has never really had that safety net."
You could say dwight’s superstardom died the moment he left magic.   KD’s career as Mr Nice Guy died the moment he slivered out of OKC.  Paul George became a meme after leaving Indiana.  Melo’s king of NY status left him after he got traded to OKC and got betrayed by them unfortunately
"I think success determines legacy overall. Individual performance determines your immediate reputation. A good example for me is Lillard will probably go down as a George Gervin, Bernard King, Tracy McGrady type player. But when you talk about him in the last season or 2 people will compare him to Steph.   When people reminisce in 10  years they'll say how lethal he was, but he won't be anywhere near the talks Steph, Lebron and Kd Will be in."
"What happened to good nicknames? Mailman, Glove, Mamba, Junkyard Dog, the King. Now we've got AD, KD, PG... c'mon... Brow, Slim Reaper, Dubious George. Boom. Done."
"Same thing with white folk I imagine. Education, honest and uncomfortable but open alogue, building cross racial ties. The basketball community can be pretty useful here, as it was during the BLM protests.  Increased policing would have to be used as a stop gap measure but .... unfortunately in Oakland for example these are going to be literally the same folks that fucked with Masai Ujiri. During the LA riots and the destruction of Koreatown, police had a role first in beating Rodney King, but also by just retreating to white neighbourhoods and forcing the Asian community to fend for themselves.  All this is why I'd say you need better (read: Not racist and militarized) police, and  probably not less or at least not just less. It's unfortunate all the momentum from the George Floyd protests hasn't done that yet.  As a final note: I don't really enjoy seeing this passed off completely as a Black problem from some quarters, and as White Supremacy or just because of Trump from others. It's everyone's problem to deal with."
"Melo- 6x all NBA, Probably shouldn’t be on the list in retrospect, but I’m not going to change it now.  Dantley-3 seasons of 30 ppg and a known leader of men who helped mentor the Bad Boy pistons into the team they ended up becoming.   King- 4x all NBA One of the greatest scorers in NBA history and was able to bounce back from injury again and again.   Championships are a team thing and with few exceptions, I don’t give individual players a ton of credit for team accomplishments. Kawhi has only ever played on amazing teams. San Antonio, the Raptors, and the Clippers (to a lesser extent). His run with the Raptors was incredible, but he was hardly the only good player on his team. If Marc Gasol doesn’t play as well as he did against Embiid, the Raptors lose that series with the 76ers. If he doesn’t have the dogged determination of Kyle Lowry, they probably don’t beat anyone. In San Antonio, he had 2-3 hall of fame players on his team and a top 10 coach of all time. He has Paul George and a solid bench with the Clippers. We’ll see what happens there.   If he continues to play amazingly, he’ll be on my list. If he fades with age, he might still get on my list."
Even King George VI had a stutter
Just looked it up...didnt realize the last half of the draft was that good wow. When george king appeared in that one game 😩
"Well yeah, he talked about his allegiance to King George in the post game interview"
"You suggested that I don't know what it takes to become a hall of famer, and then listed criteria which are *definitively not* what it takes to become a hall of famer.   * Chris Mullin  * T-Mac  * Dikembe Mutombo  * Dan Issel  * Bob Lanier  * Artis Gilmore  * Allen Iverson  * Bernard King  * Nate Thurmond  * George Gervin  * Pete Maravich  * Reggie Miller  * Dominique Wilkins  * Patrick Ewing  * John Stockton  * Charles Barkley  * Karl Malone  * Elgin Baylor  * Steve Nash  Soon you'll probably also have Chris Paul, Vince Carter, Westbrook, Melo, and maybe PG. Harden if he doesn't win a chip.  &gt;Kat for example, will never win rings.  I wonder how many of these baseless, over-confident claims you'd take a 20:1 bet on.  &gt;Tatum is hands down more surefire than Trae cause he plays winning basketball on both ends of the court.   Now in February, I agree."

"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."

"Who's ready for some hardcore analysis to dispel this myth? For purposes of this exercise, I'm going to define the Knicks ""winning"" as reaching the second round of the playoffs. Seems like a fair benchmark that I'm sure Chris Paul would agree with.  From 1946 to 1953 the Knicks were fire! Six at least second round appearances (which were the conference finals in those days), and three finals losses to those pesky Rochester Royals and two against the Minneapolis Lakers (where there were actually lakes), led by ARGUABLY (as in, you are free to argue it) the best big man in Lakers history, George Mikan!  Were the 1940s and early 50s they glory days of the NBA? Probably not! But I'm sure it was great returning after kicking the Krauts' asses in WW2!  The Knicks then suck through most of the 50s and 60s, likely because they don't have Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, or like the three other guys that mattered or knew how to dribble a basketball at that point in history.  Then in 68-69, those Knickerbockers blow up and start kicking some ass, behind Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, and Dave DeBusschere! Even Phil Jackson was on the bench reading On the Road. Over the next six years, they go to the conference finals every year, and go 2-1 in the finals. The true golden era of Knicks basketball, but how about the rest of the NBA? Kareem got here, the 60s guys were old and broken, but still chugging along, and then everyone did cocaine and no one cared about basketball until Magic and Bird arrived. What are the defining moments of this era? The Lakers winning 33 in a row? Willis Reed or Clyde Frazier (I don't even remember which one!) hobbling out to participate in a final's game? Someone on the Celtics driving a cab? I think the general U.S. populace was either fighting in the jungle or too stoned to give a shit about this era of NBA ball.  Then the Knicks suck or are sporadically (sup Ty) decent over the next 13 years. They're swept in the second round in 78 and 83 and they go 7 with Boston in 84.  So from 1974 to 1988 the highlight of Knicks basketball was one good 47-win season when 1980s Melo (Bernard King) scored a bunch of points. Seriously though, Bernard King BALLED in that Celtics series, averaging 29 on 54.5% from the field. This also happened to coincide with the era of the Showtime Lakers, Celtics, Bad Boy Pistons, and fo-fo-fo 76ers, so actually this great era of ball was in a world when no one cared about the Knicks.  Literally, we still have to endure everyone giving a shit about the Knicks because some guy hobbled out on a bum leg in 1973 and Bernard King gave Bird the business in one series.  88 until 2000 was the second most memorable time in Knicks history, when Ewing came to prominence, Riley came over, they brought in Oak and Mason, and they had a Heisman trophy winner for a point guard. Over the next 12 years, the Knicks make the second round 11 times, the conference finals 4 times, and lose in the finals during an MJ-sabbatical and in the lockout year when the rest of the east was old Reggie Miller and Alonzo Mourning. The NBA in the 90s was great for one reason - Michael fucking Jordan. Sorry if I don't pine for Ewing hitting 12-footers with bad knees and Oak and Mason beating the shit out of Rik Smits and Rony Seikaly en route to a 72-67 win.  And.... the Knicks have sucked since, except for one year when they lost to baby Paul George and Roy Hibbert in the second round. Melo had like 1.5 fun seasons in New York, Amare's knees lasted about 18 games, and Jeremy Lin was good for two weeks.  And the NBA has fucking ruled since basically the 2008 finals, so no, no one gives a shit when the Knicks are good. I hope Julius Randle goes to Phoenix or something."
"There shouldn't be. But where do you think the recipients of these donations fell on the George Floyd argument? Steve King, for example."
"That's all and good from the Wolves Media team, but their owner has historically donated to the GOP.  Per the Ringer (https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/9/24/21453818/nba-owners-political-donations-trump-gop)  ""Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, whose team plays in the city that sparked nationwide protests and started a broad debate about law enforcement funding after Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, has made more than $150,000 in political contributions since 2015—all of it to the GOP, including more than $50,000 this election cycle. In 2017, Taylor donated $2,700 to Steve King, a Republican representative from Iowa who has a long history of racist comments."""

"I think it will be a guy with Joe Harris/Kyle Korver/George Hill that one year on the Bucks type efficiency while being a generational talent with a longer prime. So I feel at some point someone shooting high 40s on high volume will hit the stage and that player will have entered his prime a bit earlier than Curry. It'll probably be a taller player with Curry's talent, enabling him to have an easier time shooting over people while having the same touch. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if it took 20 years for this person to appear since Curry's volume and accuracy is pretty much unmatched atm, even guys like Lillard don't actually come close. I think Curry will be the King of 3s for quite a while"
"You also have the problem of dealing with different eras of basketball - different rule sets, different offensive strategies for scoring points, etc. Zone defense was literally illegal in the sport until the 90s, which would have meant helping off your defender would have been harder without creating a foul. ISO ball in the early 2000s was king, so the best defenders would have been the best at defending in isolation. The defensive 3 second rule was literally invented to nerf George Mikan, so obviously you can't use his career statistics in this discussion.  Then there's the chicken and egg aspect of using analytics to quantify Rudy's game. Since Dennis Lindsey was hired in 2013 (?), the Jazz FO has been open about embracing analytics. That likely means that Rudy has been coached by the Jazz to play in ways that would maximize his defensive analytic scores, so perhaps it's not shocking that many defensive analytics have loved Rudy so much, and that defenders of previous eras who went strictly off of what their intuition told them, rather than what data indicated, would be lacking by those same analytical measures. Of course, it's not like the Jazz have been the only team in the league that have turned to analytics to guide the team, but even so, not every player would be execute the actions Rudy does, even if they knew what the optimal defensive action at every point of a possession would be.  Saying who the best defender of all time is is a tough question that I don't think you can answer with any certainty. But the fact we are having this discussion at all, and that someone would have have reasonable grounds to think that person is Rudy, is itself a massive indicator of Rudy's dominance, even if you disagree with that conclusion."

"Oooookay lets try to look at this objectively.   The Celtics didn't waste the draft picks: they have two young star wings under 25. Granted, they could have packaged those draft picks to get Butler/Kawhi/PG etc but that means Tatum or Brown are not on the team in that case. And specifically with Kawhi and George, two players that were so hellbent on going to LA, there's no guarantee they stay in Boston even if you trade for them.   Brooklyn got Kyrie and Durant because they wanted to team up, and they chose Brooklyn because its New York/its where Kyrie grew up. Yes, they did a good job building their roster after the Billy King disaster. No, they would not have gotten Kyrie and Durant if they were located anywhere other than Brooklyn.   Boston had the most COVID-related absences in the NBA, and it wasn't close.   But yes, roster construction was a mess. I imagine changes could happen, although I'm not sure if things will get blown up like some people are saying. I'd prefer Walker be moved rather than Smart, but Smart will have more trade value"
You complete forget flip flopping Paul George or New King in town Kawhi?
I don't really know what the Clippers can do though if they try to blow it up. They don't have many players with a lot of trade value. Probably just Paul George and Zubac I guess? I also wonder if Kawhi will just leave. He might decide to go sign with the Knicks and be the King of NY.
You’re right. I apologize to all the jackasses out there for including that baby back bitch LeBron James in your ranks. It was wrong and insensitive and I sincerely regret my poorly chosen words. I hope that some day you can forgive me for saying that the overrated former George Jefferson hairline having self proclaimed King was one of you. Thank you for your understanding.
"King George moved to abolish slavery cuz the empire was overextended trying to deal with all the slave revolts.  George Washington was like like ""not on my slithering ass""  But yeah it's a symbol of freedom from tyranny."
"Gotta wait and see what he can cook up. Who saw the whole Paul George thing coming two years ago? You have to admit you have no clue what he wants and it's entirely possible he looks at this aging roster that's probably about to lose Jackson and Batum to free agency, with no picks to trade and he might feel like this is a sinking ship. After all, any team with cap space can offer him exactly as much as the Clippers can, since he's a 10 year vet and they don't have his Bird rights. He might want to go try to be the King of NY next for all we know."
"you can get a perimeter scorer and relegate him to the dunker spot and playing D vs the other team's best perimeter player.   shit almost worked with Jimmy vs Toronto.  And for as ugly as that Hawks series was to lose for us, we almost pulled it off with Maxey, Shake and George Hill handling the rock and trying to run through Embiid with people diving at him in doubles from every direction like he was king kong on the skyscraper.      i think we have to move Ben for his sake and to freshen up the lineup.  But if they somehow get a legit end of game initiator and bring back Ben, it could work.   It almost has worked"
" &gt;2) LeBron literally calls himself the chosen one, the king and all these other things. I’m okay with PG calling himself Playoff P.  Sports writers in Ohio came up with both of those lebron nicknames. Playoff P was invented by Paul George himself. Kind of silly to compare Lebron's nicknames to that.   Playoff P is more akin to Durant wanting to be called The Servant lmao"
George Karl is the real king
" &gt;see him being guarded by a bunch of Pat Connaughton,  McDermott, JJ Reddick kinda dudes.  I really don’t associate those names with guys like Dominique wilkins, Dr J, James Worthy, Michael Cooper....not to mention other players who guarded Bird like Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, George Gervin, Bernard King and other assorted all-stars from that era"
"He could win a game,but when team USA played king of the court a couple of years back KD was unstoppable and he was going up against Harden, Booker and Paul George. I don’t think Pierce could stop him from just shooting over him , but on the other end KD’s length and athleticism could borrow Pierce who was never particularly fleet footed."
"Direct rankings are hard. I prefer tier systems that allow for a bit more fluidity. Otherwise there’s a lot of victim of the moment stuff going on where we just knee-jerk react to the latest stat line. “Oh shit, harden dropped 60. Smh you guys have curry above him.” “Giannis just had 35/20 on crazy efficiency. Imagine putting the washed king above him smh.” Etc  In that same vein, the past 3-4 years I’ve had a tier 1 with only 6 players - up until this offseason where it bumped up to 7.   No particular order: Giannis, lebron, KD, Steph, kawhi, harden, Jokic.  All of these guys have an MVP (except kawhi, who has two finals MVPs), all have rings except for Harden and Jokic. Think they have all proven they can be the best player on a championship level team (even if the latter two haven’t won, they are able to compete at that level IMO). The hardware in this tier is crazy with the MVPs, finals MVPs, scoring titles, assist champions, DPOYs, all nba/all defense teams etc. Some people may object to putting Jokic in this tier, but I think his MVP cements it, personally.  So after the top 7, I’d have a second tier if guys who are incredibly good but haven’t quite reached that top level yet.   again no particular order: embiid, luka, dame, AD and maybe Paul George? He’s right on the edge Imo. I could easily see dropping him down to like the next tier with guys like jimmy butler, gobert, etc.  I think it’s hard to just do a straight numerical ranking when guys are certain levels are just so interchangeable with one another night to night. There are definite tier breaks where there’s a clear line of demarcation, though."
"When is the last time you’ve seen someone talk about Alonzo Mourning, George Gervin, Bernard King, Chris Mullin, or Clyde Drexler?  Are you gonna say these guys are better than Drexler?  If so, not only are you wrong, but in 30 years there will be people who think borderline all-stars are better than Kawhi and Westbrook becabuse Kawhi and Westbrook will only be names to them."
"Oh... a lot.   People don't remember guys.   I mean, you go back to the 80s... there were so many studs. Adrian Dantley. Mark Aguirre. Fat Lever. Derrick Harper. Alex English. Jack Sikma. Sindey Moncrief. Ricky Pierce. Dale Ellis. Alvin Robertson. Tom Chambers. Mark Price. Hersey Hawking. Rick Smits. Rod Stickland.  Terry Porter.   Lots of great players. People forget. The Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, and Bulls just destroyed so many teams. Between 1980, and 1998, only two teams won a title other than those four: Rockets and Sixers.   The Bucks has some really good squads in the 80s I remember.   &amp;#x200B;  So, looking at that, I'd say guys like Dame Lillard will likely be a name that people will be like ""Oh yeah, that guy was great.""    Paul George and Jimmy Butler, unless they win a title.   Same goes for Mitchell and Gobert. Randle. Beal. Wall. Kemba. Isiaih Thomas  If it's possible to forget an MVP, then I think Joker might fade from the memory with time unless he wins a title. I mean, I don't know a lot of young folks who pull out Dave Cowens comparisons ever, and that dude won an MVP, two rings, and ROY.  I feel like Blake has enough crazy highlights that people will remember him. Melo is like Nique or Gervin... or Bernard King. He was just such a prolific scorer. I doubt he'll be easily forgotten.   Hard to say though.   It seems like, the further we go along with time, the more accessible the history of the game is, so the more permanent players are.   People know Stockton, Malone Barkley, and Miller, even though they didn't win title. Maybe fewer know Run TMC.    But in the 90s, I don't most young fans at that time would have been able to tell you Dave Cowens was. For a lot of people, the NBA really started with Bird and Magic, and all you really need to know about the NBA before that time was Wilt, Russell, and Kareem."
"George Gervin, Bernard King, Adrian Dantley, Jack Sikma, Shawn Kemp, Jermaine O’Neal"
"It's Michael Jordan, but a few guys who deserve mentions and might not get them from the crowd here:  * George Gervin  * David Thompson  * Bernard King"
"Yao, Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Joe Dumars, Bob McAdoo, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Bernard King, Chris Mullin, Paul George, Pau Gasol, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili   These are just a few, it's going to get really competitive near the bottom"
Paul George is the king. Booker might be the prince
"King George is beside himself in downtown London, begging (through the printing press) Washington's family for the address to Mt. Vernon"
I can't speak on Bernard King or James Worthy but nothing I've seen from Carmelo or Jimmy shows signs that they could've played the role Pippen did. Paul George? Maybe but he's not nearly as good at playmaking as Scottie Pippen was.
"The Pacers are the king of this category.  94, 95, 98, 13 were all 7 game losses  93, 04, 14 were 6 game losses  That first iteration with Miller took the Jordan Bulls to 7. The second with George and tip-top Hibbert did it to the Heatles. They could've won either of those Finals.  They made it in 2000, of course, but they had no chance with Shaq in that series."
Paul George is the king of hitting big shots and still losing
The Fraudulent States of AmeriFraud:  - Revolutionary War: King George was injured + carried by France (doesn't count)  - WWI: carried by the Allies (doesn't count)  - WWII: Hitler choked and sustained a severe self inflicted injury (doesn't count)  - Vietnam War: USA loses to some G League rice farmers 🤡🤡🤡  - Iraq: USA purposely injured Saddam Hussein (doesn't count)
"I think we lost 8 of our 4 games or something and nobody gives a shit, it's all about Hart vs. Giles. The larger pieces look fine inasmuch as they even played, so we're not worried about them, just interested in seeing the unknown names perform. Even the guys we already waived were impressive, like George King was playing like a human-size Trae Young. We won't have anybody on our roster as weak as Oturu or Fi this year."

This dude has been aggressive.  Him and George King are playing like guys who know they need to impress to make the roster.
Also at the end of the day who cares what he hypothetically would have thought? Malcolm X isn't the King of black people who decides who's being a good black person or not. I doubt people would be speculating what George Washington or whoever thinks about Gordon Hayward.
King George III has as much claim to the 13 colonies as the US has to them.

King George: yes
That’s exactly what King George said 250 years ago
"Let’s goo no order  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Barkley, Bird, Scottie, Elgin, Pierce, Melo, Dominique, Rick Barry, Worthy, Grant Hill, Paul George, Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Havlicek, Alex English, Dantley, Bernard King, David Thomson, Billy Cunningham, Paul Arizin, Shawn Marion, Chris Mullin, Jamaal Wilkes, Mark Aguire, Luka, Derozan, Jimmy Butler, Iguadola  That’s 30 better than him"
"I don't think many would sing the praises of Don Nelson or George Karl. Yet they both have far more wins than Doc. George is near 1200, and Nelson has over 1300, he's the all-time leader.  Doc has wildly underachieved with the squads he's had. He isn't the king of the ""up 3-1 series loss"" for nothing."
