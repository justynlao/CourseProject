"Basketball GM is the greatest look into the future of basketball. In my sim for example Gary Trent won MVP twice, Lebron played until 2028 and was still averaging 20 PPG, De'Anthony Melton made a few all star games and Deni Avdija won 8 rings while averaging 10 PPG in his prime."
De'Anthony Melton
There was an article that scientifically proved it was De'Anthony Melton
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
De'Anthony Melton and it aint close
"Monte Morris, Jalen Brunson, Tyus Jones or De'Anthony Melton  George Hill still has a good case even at his age."

[De'Anthony Melton! ](https://twitter.com/owenlhjphillips/status/1384919999144398848)
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
"Usage not high. Defense always drops onto him on pick and rolls, hence all the open midrange shots cp3 and book get.  Ayton's hands are definitely not the best but his previous point guards were terrible. His rookie year, the pg's that were unable to even throw a pass into the post he had were:   Tyler Johnson   De'Anthony Melton   Isaiah Canaan   Elie Okobo   Jawun Evans  Check out the rest of the roster [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHO/2019.html)  Suns did get Rubio last year, so that was an upgrade. But going from all of that trash previously to cp3 that throws advanced passes is a huge jump for him. With time and getting used to CP3 I think he will get better. He has gotten better at everything he has worked out little by little."
De'Anthony Melton. I dont care if hes having one of the biggest outlier seasons of all time in terms of year over year three point percentage. He's a keeper forever!!!
"I will maintain to the day I die that anyone who had Booker as an empty stats guy in 2019 is a joke and should not be listened to about anything NBA.   He put up 27/5/7 on 62% True Shooting with a rotating cast of starters, featuring such stars as: TJ Warren, De'Anthony Melton, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Elie Okobo, Isaiah Cannon, Tyler Johnson, and Kelly Oubre; each of those guys all started more than 10 games that season. Outside of Booker the only other consistent starters were a Rookie Ayton and Rookie Mikal. Warren and Oubre are probably the only two on that list who had any business being on an NBA team.  Booker saw the most double and triple teams out of anyone in the league and was cooking them with ease. Scoring that much, that efficiently is made so much harder when you have no other players on your team."
"Yeah, you guys legit found something in the bubble and Jones was smart to add to it and keep that same style going with not just CP3 but Jae Crowder as well. He's had his mistakes (giving away T.J. Warren, trading De'Anthony Melton for Jevon Carter, passing on Haliburton for Jalen Smith) but none of them are that egregious and some (Warren giveaway), have helped lead to CP3 being in Phoenix which is more important."
He needs to hook up with De'Anthony Melton and his trainer and figured out what the fuck he did to go from sub 30 last season to 40+% from three this year.
"unless you're the 2018-2019 Phoenix Suns, whose depth at the PG position consisted of Elie Okobo, Isaiah Canaan, and a rookie De'Anthony Melton.  Rubio was solid for the Suns last season. They improved by 15 games in a shortened season in which their 2nd best player was hit with a 25 game suspension. Take this narrative and throw it directly into the garbage."
"From the Grizz, De'anthony Melton has about as high of a ceiling as you'd like to see from a young player. He isn't played often and still makes dumb mistakes, but he's capable of going off for 15 in a quarter at any given moment."
De'Anthony Melton can't win with these cats.
"De'Anthony ""Michael Jordan"" Melton"
I just woke up from a coma.  Is De'Anthony Melton the greatest player in the NBA?
here comes de'anthony melton!!!
DE'ANTHONY MELTON  YOU HEAR ME!?
"Considering he's been a shooting guard his whole career and plays with Ja Morant, Tyus Jones and De'Anthony Melton, no, we do not consider Dillon Brooks  a point guard."
Congrats Grizzlies!  Jazz about to get swept by former Houston Rockets Dillon Brooks and De'Anthony Melton.
"De'Anthony Melton is just constantly doing it things on the floor that I don't anticipate.   I'm not sure he has the creativity to become a superstar, but again, he keeps surprising me so why not?"
De'Anthony Melton  https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/mvg2r3/oc\_the\_best\_player\_you\_havent\_heard\_of\_yet/
May as well add De'Anthony Melton and Frank Ntilikina if u putting Herro on here
"For those confused about why the Grizzlies would do this, remember the scene in Moneyball when Brad Pitt told the A's coach to start Chris Pratt off the bench, but the coach kept starting this other 1B he thought was better so Brad Pitt traded that guy to another team? That's basically what this is here. Grayson Allen is a solid bench guy and could be great for the Bucks, but for some reason Coach Jenkins loved him so much, that he kept starting him and giving him more minutes over better players like De'Anthony Melton and Desmond Bane. I still think the Grizzlies could have received more for Allen, but I do think this will force them to play better lineups and improve the team in the end."
"""Mr Do Something"" for De'Anthony Melton. That's what our local commentator, Brevin Knight, calls him  He just comes in and does shit man. Blocks, steals, fast break assists and dunks, 3pt shots, etc."
De'Anthony Melton
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
De'Anthony Melton is legit
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"Dude if I told you to use a calculator and then you put in the wrong equation, yeah, you're gonna get the wrong answer.  I explained how I think advanced stats should be used in a reasonable way. Your method of using them indicates that Cameron Payne and De'Anthony Melton are ""better"" than Jamal Murray, because the way you use them is misleading. Just because you look at them in that way doesn't mean we all have to."
"Because the way you're ranking based on these stats is misleading. The next ranked point guard in EPM is Kyle Lowry. The next ranked point guard in LEBRON is Jamal Murray. So saying he's only 18th as if that means he's in bad company is wrong, because I think you'd hesitate to say that Lowry and Murray are below-average point guards in the league.   A number of backup PGs are higher than them, because those stats show how well someone performs in their role - for example, De'Anthony Melton is ranked higher in LEBRON than Jamal Murray. Does that mean the nuggets should trade them and start Melton? No, it just means Melton is probably a good backup PG. We shouldn't use them as bona fide rankings, it's more important to see what percentile the player is in and whether or bot the number is positive. Lonzo's in the 89th percentile for EPM and is a positive in all three major advanced stat - that's solid evidence that he's a valuable player."
"Ah yes, De'Anthony Melton over Lavine, Bam, SGA, Morant, LeBron, Beal, Middleton.  As it should be."
"MVP: Ja Morant  ROTY: Ziaire Williams  DPOY: Dillon Brooks  6MOY: Desmond Bane/De'Anthony Melton  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.  Champion: Memphis Grizzlies (82-0, 16-0)"
"Love those type of players, Alex Caruso, Bruce Brown, De'Anthony Melton etc."
"Debating between Steven Adams, Desmond Bane ans De'Anthony Melton.  A defensive big for Ja and JJJ, a shooting guard/wing, or a utility guard that can rebound, steal, defend and shoot 3's."
Alex Caruso is budget De'Anthony Melton who is a lot older and gets paid a tiny bit more. https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1=meltode01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;p1yrto=2021&amp;player_id2=carusal01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021&amp;p2yrto=2021
"De'Anthony Melton   Dante Exum if he ever gets healthy (that's a big if, honestly)   Nerlans Noel: I don't think he'll ever reach the success of Chandler, but I think he'll be a starter 6 years from now; many people have already written him off."

I think you also have to give De'Anthony Melton some credit. He played some really great d on Curry tonight. Seemed like he wore him down towards the end.
"Grizz have been an absolute wrecking crew against some of the top teams in the East lately. Last night and tonight were without JJJ and Winslow obviously, but also without De'Anthony Melton and Brandon Clarke, two of the Grizzlies' top pieces of the second unit. Some really impressive stretch finally to 3+ games above .500 for the first time since they were 9-6  Also Grayson Allen went absolutely bonkers tonight on top of Dillon Brooks looking fantastic and uncharacteristically unselfish"
Yeah the latter part is the problem dumping away a first to get Iman Shumpert's expiring to go under the tax when those guys couldve helped him. JaMychal in particular Capela killed them that Warriors series they need another option at the 5 MDA wasnt willing to play PJ Tucker the minutes needed there.   That and his cheapness also cost him De'Anthony Melton.
De'Anthony Melton is so goodx4
"I'd still take JJJ at 4, or even Ayton tbh  Also I feel like it'd be better for the hornets to have Mitchell Robinson not De'Anthony Melton"
"Some fair points. I have never played 2k though. And it's not about signing a better player with Barnes money, although that is certainly possible. It's about flexibility. Let's say SAC wants to trade for Vucevic. Which package do you think Orlando would prefer:   A) Barnes, 1st (lotto protected SAC), a 4MM TPE, and no cap space   B) Three 1st's (2 BOS, 1 lotto protected SAC), Nesmith, a 20MM TPE, and 15MM in cap space.   Keep in mind they're in the position SAC is with little to no chance to win during the remainder of Barnes' contract. It won't happen every time, but I'd say a quality GM will do as well with 15MM in cap space as getting Barnes on 2/40, and we're left with a bunch of assets and flexibility to improve. This is looking at using the cap in just one way, too. What if someone wants to pay you to clear room? TJ Warren and #32 were traded for cash considerations (in real life, not 2k). In my opinion TJ Warren is a better basketball player, on a better contract, than Barnes. De'Anthony Melton and two 2nd's were traded to dump Josh Jackson's salary. Melton recently re-signed for 4/35. I'd rather have Melton at 4/35 than Barnes at 2/40. These opportunities pop up all the time, but you have to be in a position to take them. Let people match on the Crabbe's. Not every move is via RFA. Jerami just went for 3/60 and is better than Barnes. Christian Wood 3/41 via cheap S&amp;T. Jae Crowder 3/30. Sure, I'd rather have Jae + 10 million in cap than Barnes in many situations.      PHI: bottomed out and drafted Embiid, Simmons, used assets and cap flexibility (poorly) in deal for Tobias      LAL: had the cap flexibility to sign LeBron, used cap flexibility and assets from bottoming out to trade for AD      LAC: had the cap flexibility to sign Kawhi, cap/asset flexibility to trade for PG13 (including two MIA 1st's)      BKN: cap flexibility to sign Kyrie/KD, capitalized on Harden deal with assets      UTA: drafted Gobert, Mitchell (via trade), utilized cap space &amp; assets to trade for Conley      These are probably 5 of the top 6 or 7 title contenders this year, and every single one used significant cap flexibility to get where they are. If SAC is actually offered these type of assets for Barnes, who provides no surplus value and limits flexibility, yes I believe keeping him is ridiculous. As it relates to this hypothetical offer, keeping him over two 1st's, Nesmith, a 16MM TPE, and going from ~20MM to ~40MM in cap space would be egregious. Just this past off-season you could've traded one of those BOS 1st's and absorbed Oubre into your TPE. Do that after you spend your 40MM in cap and you've gone from Barnes +20MM in cap to Oubre, however you spent your 40MM in cap, Nesmith, 1st. Someone please tell me how SAC goes from where they are now, to championship contenders, while turning down deals like this. At what point will they get more for Harrison Barnes?"

"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."

"Ja is not a shoot-first type of player. He's always looking to set up others and will choose his spots to take shots.   Brooks has a rare skin condition where the basketball burns his hands if he holds it more than 10 milliseconds. Unfortunately he also has a phobia of teammates so he can only find solace in jacking up shots as often as possible.   Anyways, great game from Morant. Huge shout out to De'Anthony Melton."
"great game from Ja..   slightly concerning tho.. in his last 32 games he's shot 28/122 from three, 23% less than ideal i would say  did russ's hands shrink, the ball slips out of his hand so much now   if De'Anthony Melton is just a 36%ish shooter now, he could easily start for teams"
"Nope, not even the week that he averaged 52/6/6 on 62/48/91 shooting splits.  He got snubbed because the team went 0-3 that week (33pt loss, 3pt loss, 5pt loss).  Suns fans were livid, because those losses had absolutely nothing to do with his play.  He had De'Anthony Melton, Dragan Bender, and 2 Rookies (Ayton &amp; Bridges) starting alongside him.  To give an idea, here are our shooting splits in those games if Booker's stats were removed...  * **at Jazz**: 59pts on 19/34 from the field, 5/8 from 3, 16/17 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 33pts on 12/42 from the field, 2/15 from 3, 7/11 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Donovan Mitchell, who scored 10pts on 4/14 shooting* * **vs Wizards**: 50pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/9 from 3, 9/10 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 71pts on 24/57 from the field, 11/29 from 3, 12/16 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Bradley Beal, who scored 28 on 11/22 shooting* * **vs Grizz**: 48pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/6 from 3, 7/8 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 67pts on 24/52 from the field, 9/22 from 3, 10/15 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Justin Holiday, who scored 14pts on 5/9 shooting*"
