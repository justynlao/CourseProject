"In the month of December 2019, OG Anunoby played starters' minutes in every game and attempted 3.8 threes per game. His numbers for the month were 21.7%. He still finished the season shooting 39%. Three point shooting is the noisiest stat."

2017 draft class extensions:  Jonathan Isaac: 20 mil (even after the major injury)  Fultz: 17 mil  Derrick White: 18 mil  OG Anunoby: 18 mil  Kennard: 16 mil  Kuzma: 13 mil  I'd say the market for Lauri is easily over 18 mil - offensively he's better than all these guys and still hasn't realized his potential yet. Bulls will likely just match any offer thrown at him.
"Although he’s missed the last couple games, buy on OG Anunoby. He was my pick preseason for MIP and he’s coming around"
"Thibs decided to pick Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick over John Collins and OG Anunoby when the Wolves already had KAT and Gorgui Dieng (who was being paid $16 million a year, a contract he also handed out) at center."
"Thanks raptors bro, I for one hope the raptors acquire Beal if they don't have to give up og anunoby. That would be great for the raptors and certainly put them back in the picture"
"I tried using the Raptor metric and I got OG  Anunoby, Aron Baynes, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet  Maybe I’m doing something wrong."
I actually feel like OG Anunoby And the Raptors played the best defense on LeBron last year. I think OG defends him the best imo.
OG Anunoby
"&gt; Ibaka, who Harrell is being compared to will not see his minutes and role decrease in the playoffs because he's a better player that doesn't have playoff weaknesses... do you not understand this?  Ibaka *did* see his minutes and role decrease last playoffs. Or were you unaware that the Celtics played him off the floor in Toronto's 2nd round loss to them? If Ibaka doesn't see his minutes and role decrease this year it'll be because the Clippers have no other options, not because he's a better player. If Trez sees his minutes and role decrease it's because AD and LeBron will be playing more minutes at the center/PF position. Do *you* not understand this?  &gt; Ibaka (again the person being compared to) is not going to be used like Dwight or Javale in the playoffs.  Again, that's because on the Clippers they have no other choice but to play him. It's the same reason they had Trez in there so much last year against guys like Jokic. The Clippers' roster is much thinner and more poorly constructed than the Lakers, so they don't have the option of just sitting their centers the way the Lakers did last year (and still can).  You really seem to be unaware of something that's both obvious and crucial here: Montrezl Harrell plays for *the Lakers* now, not the Clippers. He doesn't need to fill the role on the Lakers that the Clippers needed him to fill, he just needs to fill the role that the Lakers need him to fill. So if Trez isn't guarding the rim or is getting attacked on switches and gets played off the floor, oh well, same thing happened to Dwight and Javale. They can just sit him and plug in guys who are better suited to whatever the matchup is, same as last year.  But if *Ibaka* is having trouble with Jokic or AD or is getting abused on switches, the Clippers have to stick with him because they don't have any other choice. This IMO is part of the problem with just being super happy about the Batum signing. They swapped Green and Trez for Batum and Ibaka, and in the postseason it's not like Batum can credibly guard bigs. That's where the Clippers will miss Green. So all they have is Ibaka as a guy who can protect the rim and switch out to the perimeter. And he was absolutely cooked by the Celtics going small last year and got played off the floor. If Ibaka and Zubac get played off this year, the Clippers don't have an OG Anunoby or Paskal Siakam to pick up that frontcourt slack, cause Batum, Morris and Kawhi can't do it.  If the Clippers end up playing the Lakers this year and the Lakers have their LeBron/AD 4/5 lineup out there, if Ibaka can't guard AD (and I don't think he can), then I don't know what they're gonna do. But if Trez is in the game and is having trouble with Ibaka or whomever, then OK, the Lakers have many other options. See the difference?"
"OG Anunoby - wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a perennial all defense team member. He's really opened up his game this season- lot's of cuts, drives, and is just starting to make perimeter shots."
OG anunoby with Matt Thomas shooting and offense
OG Anunoby has been top 4 in consistency for this season of the Raptors basketball.  It can’t be understated how important he is for the team defensively but also when he’s engaged offensively.
The only OG legend is OG Anunoby.
He probly won't but Kings should've traded him for at least a future 2nd round pick. Guys they could've drafted besides Giles:  Terrence Ferguson Jarrett Allen OG Anunoby Kuzma Derrick White Josh Hart Thomas Bryant Dillon Brooks
"I feel like OG Anunoby gets fouled on a lot of his takes at the rim.  Obviously he's not some prolific scorer that should get the benefit of the doubt from the refs, but it just sucks to see him lose confidence/aggressiveness after getting hacked."
"I feel like popping champaign every time OG Anunoby gets free throws. Siakam'd never been top fortunate with calls either.  On the other hand, Aron Baynes gets the absolute friendliest whistle on screens and charges I've ever seen"
OG Anunoby?
OG Anunoby c:
OG anunoby is one of the best wing defenders in the league. *especially* on ball.
I read it as Giannis or OG anunoby and was really confused about where the other posts were lol
What’s better than having OG Anunoby? Having two OG Anunobys.
OG Anunoby Sr
"Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby, I guess? We have a different two best players on any given night."
"That's not OG Anunoby, lol. No one can tell those two apart. Also that's a terrible angle. You can't see anything."

"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"This post confirms that Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Malachi Flynn will all win MVP's"

"I'm 6'4"" without shoes.

"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
How much did you love torching the Indiana Hoosiers?  Your thoughts on OG Anunoby?
"Seriously, it feels like OG Anunoby hate posts are all I ever see on this board"
"&gt;Green was expecting a screen from OG and to switch on the screen (which is why Looney was so deep), instead OG slipped the screen and cut to the basket, which meant instead of sticking with their men they were already committed to the switch and Dray had to catch up. It was a good play call from the Raps and got OG some space, but it had nothing to do with Dray being ""fixated on preventing a three attempt"" or him ""being too slow"".  So what you are saying is that Green was not ready for a simple cut to the basket.  That's the first thing you defend against in this situation, unless your opponent needs a three.  So what, exactly, could cause Green -- theoretically a smart, professional defender -- to completely neglect the most dangerous play, that junior high schoolers are literally taught to guard?  What, exactly, could cause Green to be on completely the wrong side of Anunoby -- again, basic fundamental defense, staying between your man and the basket?  The threat of a three, that Green was preoccupied by.  Exactly like I said.  &gt; or him ""being too slow""   I said nothing about his speed."
"&gt;even if OG does get the ball, it would have been a contested shot.  Only if it was a very bad pass.  Any mediocre pass leads Anunoby straight into a layup or dunk with Green one to two yards behind him.  A good high school player can make that pass 9 times out of 10.  If Bazemore was positioned between Lowry and the basket, it'd be a much more difficult proposition... but he's not, he guarding against a pass to the top of the key.  He didn't seem to get Green's message about where the play was designed to go.  &gt;The play wasn't designed for OG (likely FVV) and that's probably why Lowry missed it.  Who knows, but the point is, Green surely didn't think ""I'll let my man run to the rim uncontested, they'll never pass him the ball.""  He got beat, and got lucky.  &gt;Also, part of the reason why he was late on the switch was because he was holding FVV after the backscreen, delaying his cut long enough for Looney to recover  That did happen -- but which would you rather surrender, a VanVleet jumper from twenty-odd feet over Looney, or an Anunoby uncontested dunk?  There's no way the strategy was ""Let #3 run to the rim alone."""
"&gt;Did you not see Green tell Looney to stick to the perimeter and switch?  Well, no, as a matter of fact.  I see Green waving around, but neither you, nor I, know what exactly he was saying.  &gt;If Lowry followed your advice that's an easy turnover. OG has no room to catch anything there.  Anunoby has **the entire lane plus.**  [Acres of space.](https://imgur.com/Tr4uOcs)  You've less than zero idea what you are talking about."
"Norm Powell and OG Anunoby have plenty of questionable decision making in this game. Lowry was a no-show until the 4th Q too. When Boucher fouled out, Nurse should have put anyone but Norm back."
"Spurs have lots of cap space in the FA as it stands. Plenty to max a RFA, and they're very much looking out to the future. Not saying it'll be Collins, but he'll be one of the bigger RFAs (since the better guys in that draft class all signed extensions already (e.g. Tatum, Mitchell, Adebayo, even lower-level/non-max guys like OG Anunoby), so it's conceivable they do it."
"If Im Atlanta I would do OG Anunoby for John Collins.   I dont think Toronto would though. I wouldnt either Collins isnt a 5, I dont want to be paying Collins a max to have JC at the 4 and Siakam at the 3."
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."

OG Anunoby?
Leaf is absolutely hot garbage. His rookie year he was an unathletic 4 who could occasionally hit a 3 ball. Then our team decided to have him bulk up and become a center which somehow made him even slower. In addition his 3 point shot went to absolute shit and he had a horrible stint in the bubble where he got blocked like every other fucking attempt. He was a good team mate but I weep for the fact that we couldve had john collins or og anunoby instead. Leaf was a huuuuuuuge bust.

And not one has been a buzzer beater so even after we cheer we’re still nervous asf about a team pulling a OG Anunoby on us lmao
"What is this post lmao  &gt; OG Anunoby signed a deal in the offseason worth close to $80 million and many Raptor fans called it a ""steal"" despite Anunoby averaging 10 PPG last year.  We just rounding up the contract amount and quoting stats out of context now?  &gt; NGL, between FVV, Siakam and OG taking up most of Toronto's cap space they might have the worst situation in the league right now.  Raptors literally have full cap flexibility and own all their future picks, which is more than what a lot of teams can say."
Kyle Lowry is nowhere near any top 5 perimeter defender list anymore can’t move his feet at all now at 34. OG Anunoby would be one ex of a better choice
Biggest surprise this year has been Mikal Bridges I’ve loved the way he’s played so far  Biggest disappointment has been OG Anunoby for me. He really impressed me in the playoffs last year and I thought he was gonna be a MIP candidate
Like Jerami Grant and OG Anunoby
"&gt;Who the FUCK is he supposed to box out? Baynes is the only one under the rim and theres already 3 Pels there lol  Huh...? Block out OG Anunoby. The shooter who is literally right in front of him. Not sure how detailed you need this explained, but shooters are allowed to rebound their own misses so defenders often put in the tiny amount of effort it takes to block them out.  What a bizarre question. Lol"
"I think OG Anunoby or Duncan Robinson are the best answers. If you want a better defensive team then go with OG, if you want a team you literally cannot double LeBron then Duncan."
Here's an idea for a nickname. OG Anunoby should be Mr. Scarfs
Yeah raptors fans have always been the most delusional fanbase. They're still convinced that OG Anunoby is gonna be a future superstar lol
MS = ?  PP = Paul Piece  AN = ?  OA = OG Anunoby  AB = Avery Bradley
"Marcus Smart, Paul Pierce, Abdel Nader, OG Anunoby, Anthony Bennett?"
okay but what if the best perimeter player that day is OG Anunoby  how does one jail a jailer
If you wouldn’t trade OG Anunoby for Bradley Beal you are on some serious meth
"And yet the Lakers still dropped two to a team whose best defensive player was an undersized Bam Adebayo playing through an injury. Meanwhile, the hypothetical 2020 Raptors would have had 2 DPOYs, Siakam who's always elite on defense even when his shot doesn't go, plus a top 5 3&amp;D player in a healthy OG Anunoby, and that's just on the defense. If you still think that's comparable to a team that had to play Kelly Olynyk for 30+ minutes I don't know what to tell you."
"Anunoby every day: ""I haven't been pen but I'm always an OG"""
In the regular season off ball defense is more valuable.  In the playoffs in specific match ups individual defenders like an OG Anunoby become more important than the Robert Covington type
"add in the details part too. the 2nd pick is protected and likely just 2nds but this is pretty realistic imo   The details: In an Eastern Conference race that is wide open, the 76ers could desperately use another dynamic two-way player. Bringing Lowry, a North Philadelphia native, back home could be the difference-making move that results in the 76ers' return to the NBA Finals for the first time in 20 years.  Yes, Lowry, a pending free agent, is going to turn 35 the day of the NBA trade deadline. And yes, giving up multiple first-round picks and a young player in Maxey would be difficult.  But it's a move Philadelphia should make. The 76ers add a proven playoff performer who would give coach Doc Rivers flexibility in how he deploys Ben Simmons. With Lowry's Bird rights, the Sixers could either extend him before the season ends or re-sign him this summer.  For other contenders, like the LA Clippers, the difficulty in trading for Lowry comes with both making the cap math work (Lowry makes $30.5 million this season) and giving Toronto something it needs in return. This trade accomplishes both.  Maxey and the picks will help Toronto add to its core of Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby moving forward. Green, Scott and Ferguson all have expiring deals that can be rerouted to Cleveland so the Raptors can add Drummond, shoring up their center position without taking on long-term money.  The Cavaliers would recoup the second-round pick they gave up to acquire Drummond last season.  -- Tim Bontemps"
OG Wan Anunoby &gt;
Jamal Murray? That’s a funny way to spell OG Anunoby
"Ben Simmons, Dort, Giannis, Myles Turner, Gobert  Jrue Holiday, Royce O'Neale &amp; OG Anunoby should be on the 2nd team"
"OG Anunoby could make all-nba if the stars align, he's already an all-defense wing and he's shown some capability on offense."
Overrated: OG Anunoby  Underrated: Pascal Siakam  A year ago my answers to these questions would have been reversed.
OG Anunoby vibes
"They constantly call Lowry, anunoby, siakam and Powell by their first names. Even their go to catchphrases for OG and Norm when they do something crazy are stormin' Norman and OG-OH-MY!!"
OG Anunoby
Id like to think OG Anunoby deserves to be here somewhere but maybe that's a homer take
He'd get more than 20M for sure.  Wiggins is clearly better than somebody like OG Anunoby and OG is getting almost 20 million.  Wiggins would probably get something like 25+
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"Its pretty shitty timing with your recent skid but yeah obviously you would be heavily favoured in that series, but the matchup actually isn't ideal for you.  Our weakness is true centers that can take advantage of our lack of size inside. That's why we struggled against the Wolves of all teams, we just have nobody who can physically match up with KAT. Giannis on the other hand is someone that Siakam or OG could reasonably check, and Brook Lopez is completely unplayable in that series as he wouldn't be able to guard Siakam Anunoby or Boucher, and he's just not the offensive player he used to be where he would burn us on the other end (Boucher was able to block his shot several times when we played). Middleton has also struggled against the Raptors historically, and Jrue Holiday won't have slow footed defenders to attack in the pick and roll, as he's going to see Anunoby Siakam or Boucher on the 1/5 pick and roll.  Again, on paper you *should* still win, but that was true about your last two playoff outings so we will see. I think I'd be more confident in the Bucks once I see how they bounce back from this recent skid"
Kyle Lowry  Joe Harris  OG Anunoby  Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
"They also think every young player on their team is an allstar or mvp. Og Anunoby is Kawhi, pascal is Kawhi, Malachi Flynn is fred VanVleet 2.0 Chris Boucher is a future allstar. They’re horrible at evaluating their guys"

"While Lamelo and Haliburton are clear favorites, I think PatWill is slept on in terms of his contributions as a two-way player. He might not be a primary ballhandler like those guys, but instead he might have a similar career trajectory to OG Anunoby or Jerami Grant in terms of positionless role player turning into potential star. He's the youngest player in NBA right now looking like a grown man. I think he's going to be that player who emerges in his 3rd or 4th season - just like Bam, Sabonis, and other stars have once they get more opportunity."
"I don't think it's been mentioned in this thread yet. But the Bucks traded the pick that was Norman Powell, plus the pick that became OG Anunoby, to us for Grievis Vasquez."
"He can and does quite regularly. Here’s a good article from last season  &gt; Anunoby's isolation stats are eye-popping. He ranks in the 94th percentile in isolation defense, according to NBA Advanced Stats, surrendering 0.61 pointer per possession in isolation. Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions. He played 24% of his time defending small forwards, another 24% of his time on shooting guards, 22% of his time on power forwards, and 16 and 13 percent of his time defending point guards and centers, respectively.  [source](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba)  I’ve seen Nurse assign him as a primary defender on both Damian Lillard and Bam Adebayo and made them both struggle. Dude is as versatile a defender as they come, one of the few players who can truly guard 1-5."
"Giannis next All-Star game ""With my first pick, I'll take my african brother, OG Anunoby"""
"Good point. I think Dort got the recognition he did because he did in the Playoffs against arguably the best offensive player of the current era in James Harden.  Jaylen seems to get more attention for his leap on offense than his stellar defense (he shut down Siakam in the ECSF).  When I watch OG, he reminds me of Jaylen, but like a year back in development. He's got superb defense, and a strong work ethic. So long as Toronto continues to give him opportunity, I foresee Anunoby becoming the same kind of 2-way stud that Brown is."
OG. ANUNOBY. I FUCKING LOVE THIS MAN.
OG Anunoby should be in the MVP conversation
"The raptors. We have OG Anunoby, who's British, and happens to be one of the best defenders in the league"
Durant. But if it was a non star OG Anunoby
"I believe if Andrew Wiggins, Tyler Herro, OG Anunoby, Terry Rozier were given the same situation that Grant has been given in Detroit, they would do similar. Those 4 are not even sniffing all-nba talent. Jerami Grant is not that fucking efficient lmao he shoots 44% from the field and 39% from 3. It’s ok."
If og anunoby never hit the shot that saved toronto from getting swept by boston then the celtics would have rolled the heat
"You lost me at ""great GM"" with Olshey.  He's incredibly high variance, his moves are either great or utter trash fires.  He's out of consideration given how badly the 2016 FA class went for the Blazers, I'm sorry but there's just no way that a guy who gave $200M to Moe Harkless, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner is in the conversation given the competition out there.  Also, his draft record is spotty at best, trading 3 picks to move up &amp; take Zach Collins ahead of Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, OG Anunoby and more disqualifies him."
Not that’s OG Anunoby
The Bucks traded the picks that became OG Anunoby and Norman Powell to Toronto for a year of Greives Vasquez in 2015
OG Anunoby
"Great response, you’ve changed my mind. Give Siakam and VanVleet statues too. OG Anunoby? Statue. Terrence Davis. Statue it up. Fuck it."
"Best defensive team since the ‘04 Pistons and one of the best playoff defences of all time. Absolutely stacked with with very good-elite tier defenders 1-9, and that’s playing without OG Anunoby who is a fringe all defensive wing himself.   I understand we would have lost if KD played, but the way I look at it the Warriors without KD were still a finals level team. They managed to finish off the Rockets, swept the WCF and took us to a hard fought 6 games.   Also big shout out to Steph. Guy dropped 30 ppg on 60 TS% while facing a ridiculous amount of attention. I know the series gets over shadowed by injuries but there was some really fun basketball being played."
I guess we're all forgetting about og anunoby??????????
"OG Anunoby held Sabonis to 1-10 shooting recently before they both got hurt the subsequent game, he's also done well on Bam and Jokic.  He's also a monster defender on the perimeter that straight deters star level players from taking FGA, leads the league in steals per game and is getting better year by year as a weakside rim protector.  Absolutely belongs in the conversation for 1st team all-D."
"OG Anunoby can guard 1-5, he's put the clamps on Sabonis and Bam this year and did well on Jokic last year."
Dude seriously felt the need to ask when we have Ogugua Anunoby Jr. on our team.  come back og we need you
"OG anunoby is up there as well, both as an individual lockdown defender and in terms of defensive versatility."
Didn't OG Anunoby say AI was his favourite player too? I swear he did. If not I mixed up Kawhi and OG in my head lol.
"OG anunoby would be my pick. Last year in both the RS and the bubble lebron really didn’t even try to attack OG much at all and when he did he didn’t have much success.   I’d take OG as the best young lebron defender. To be frank, as good as jeremi is on defense OG is simply better and that’s not a sight on jeremi."
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
"A lot of Raptor fans being hella defensive over this sorry lol. You made a solid point, Grant is definately more guard oriented and is a more natural scorer than Siakam.    TBH though, the Raptor I'd compare him most to is like OG Anunoby, but like an idealized 3 years older version of him. If OG puts up Jerami Grant numbers in 3 years i'd be stoked"
My preseason “hot take” of him becoming an all star even in the west this year looking decent. Just don’t ask about how my Wendell Carter or OG Anunoby preseason most improved hot take ie also coming along
"The difference in this circumstance is that Boucher was on offense against Patrick Williams much of the game, and we would switch him often onto Lavine as often as possible. He guarded Thad Young on defense much of the game as well. Vucevic ended up getting guarded by OG Anunoby, whether in a defensive switch or as a second defender, and even in that case, Boucher took two shooting fouls against Vooch."
"&gt;If you knew anything about basketball you would have known it would not come out until today.  Announcing these suspensions hours before Toronto is scheduled to play -- with barely enough players -- is not normal procedure.  In fact, nothing is normal procedure this season, with teams playing far more frequently than in a typical season.  &gt; Again, just look at the size of OG and how string he is, if he wanted to hurt your boi child and be ""dangerous"" they guy would be dropped headfirst and in a comma today.   I covered this repeatedly yesterday.  Read.  ""It could've been worse"" is not a defense.  Everything could always be worse.  And Anunoby is not a large NBA player, your man-crush on him notwithstanding.  He's median size in the NBA.  Finally, had he done what you propose, he would've been suspended for a season or two, and he may be smart enough to realize that.  &gt; You are more upset that Montrez and Schoder and all of the Lakers.   I am not upset, I am just trying to educate the knuckleheads here.    This actually may work out perfectly for the Lakers, who can now try out McLemore in Horton-Tucker's minutes without causing any unnecessary strife."
Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for Norm Powell and the pick that became OG Anunoby
"&gt;Again, you clearly know nothing about OG is you are calling him dangerous.  I know he picked up Schroder and dropped him in a dangerous way, for no sensible reason.  That's dangerous.  What else is there?  Nothing.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;  I also don’t think you know a whole lot about the game of basketball.   So you are claiming that was a basketball play by Anunoby?  Really!?  I stand by my claim that you are, in fact, an idiot, your mother's opinion notwithstanding."
"&gt;You betta trust me on this one. If OG wanted to hurt that child, child would be in hospital.  No, I won't be trusting such an idiot, thanks.  As asked many times previously, what possible motivations exist for picking up a player and dropping him on his back?  Other than trying to injure him.  There are none -- your sad little mythologizing of Anunoby aside."
love to see og anunoby try to flip adams
"Jusuf Nurkic, Donovan Mitchell, and OG Anunoby  So, uh, Faustian fleece lmao"
"Yeah everyone else in there was a coach,Bembry was on the other side of the backboard clearly not in the play, and Vanvleet went directly to Trent and pulled him away. He's being restrained by his own coaches not security.  If they suspend Raptors players our fans will rejoice btw. We are tanking and this just helps the tank.  Flairless Lakers fans are something else man. No, none of the rules apply to Toronto and OG Anunoby will be awarded a medal of honor for his action/s."
"&gt;Ya i think OG should have got a tech too  It really wasn't a hard play to call.  Obvious Flagrant-2 on Anunoby, and then offsetting single technicals on Harrell and Trent for the aftermath.  Common foul on Schroder for the live ball play.  A Flagrant-1 is ""unnecessary"" contact, and this was clearly that.  It upgrades to a Flagrant-2 if the contact is ""excessive"", again, absolutely no doubt on that point.  That the officials somehow screwed that up into offsetting double techs on Harrell and Anunoby, and nothing for Trent, is typical of NBA officials.  Apparently Trent has compromising pictures of this crew, because he also got away with drilling Caruso with an intentional elbow later.  &gt; Unless fred and co are out there ... escalating   That is literally what Van Vleet would be doing, were he not restrained by a security guard -- see the image linked above.  [A couple steps off the bench](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25850702/nba-suspends-nikola-jokic-denver-nuggets-one-game-leaving-bench-altercation-utah-jazz) got Jokic suspended.  [So to CJ McCollum.](https://www.nba.com/news/trail-blazers-mccollum-suspended-one-game)"
one of the best anyone defenders is OG Anunoby. The guy might be the best defender in the league.
"&gt;Look. If OG had intent to injure he would have injured.  The classic ""It could've been worse"" defense.  That's irrelevant.  &gt; His face is totally blank this guy wasn’t angry.   Completely irrelevant.  You cannot pick up and drop an opponent regardless of your emotional state.  &gt; It’s not nefarious   So what, in your fantasy world, was Anunoby trying to do, if not to injure Schroder?  Was he trying to teach him how gravity works?  That was a dirty play, and clear attempt to injure."
"&gt;Lol wait- Schroeder fouls and fully wraps up OG, and holds on for an extended period of time and that’s helping?  Yes, exactly.  Schroder prevents Anunoby from falling and potentially hurting himself.  The exact opposite of what Anunoby does to Schroder.  &gt;Pretty sure Trent wasn’t expecting OG to tip over Schroder like he’s a pot of tea.    Neither was anyone, including the official on the scene -- the official who tries to catch Schroder while Trent stands and watches, doing nothing to help at all.  &gt; It was just a tangle.   That was an intentional attempt to injure by Anunoby, and you have to have opaque homer goggles on to see anything else.  They were not tangled at all, Anunoby just picked up Schroder and dropped him on his back."
Just a friendly (salty) reminder that Thomas Joseph Thibodeau chose to draft center Justin Patton with Karl Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng under contract (then signed Taj Gibson to a 2/$28m contract less than 2 weeks later) over guys like John Collins and **OG Anunoby**.
"&gt;OG was ejected immediately  No, he was not.  Put your thinking cap on and check the play-by-play.  Anunoby was given a technical foul, and only later ejected after they decided to eject Harrell, and they realized a riot would ensue if that was the outcome.  &gt; that sends a stronger message than a flagrant.   No, it does not.  Read the rulebook with your thinking cap on.  A flagrant carries additional penalties -- a fine, and an official record of dirty play, both of which Anunoby definitely deserves."
"&gt;Intentional attempt to injure? Jesus that is a reach.  It is not remotely a reach.  There is no scenario whereby a player picks another off the ground, and drops him on his back, in which he is not trying to hurt that player.  &gt;It was a poor decision, OG shouldn't have done it but it was not ""violent"" it was not an intentional attempt to injure, it was barely dangerous.   So, what, in your little fantasy, was Anunoby doing here?  Trying to teach Schroder about gravity?  That was precisely an intentional attempt to injure another player.  Just because it could have been worse, does it make it anything else.  And yes, it was dangerous.  Curry just missed a bunch of time with a bruised tailbone that could've easily occurred here.  Caruso just missed a bunch of time in concussion protocol after hitting his head on the court, and it was only luck that prevented Schroder from same.  &gt; It was shitty and disrespectful   ...and dirty, and intentional, and dangerous, and has no place in the game.  And had it been done to a Raptor, your tune would be completely opposite."
"&gt;Not defending OG but picking up a man's leg causing him to fall down  That's not what happened.  Schroder did not ""fall down"".  Anunoby picked him completely off the ground, and dropped his ass.  I'm a little tired of Raptors' fans defending Anunoby while saying ""Not defending but...""  That was a dirty play, and it was an intentional attempt to injure.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it."
"&gt;Did I say they were okay? No. But how severe the offending player is punished and viewed depends on the outcome.  Schroder very rarely gets hurt -- he's missed \~30 games in his career -- so it's okay for large players to target him, and throw him around during dead ball situations?  Just because he's less injury-prone than, say, Stephen Curry who missed a handful of games after falling on his ass, Anunoby gets a pass for trying to injure him?  Per the official box score, Scott did not even call a flagrant foul on Anunoby.  Just a technical.  Per the rulebook, that means he decided that Anunoby's actions were ""unsportsmanlike"" but somehow ""necessary"" and ""not excessive"".  Neither was Trent called for a flagrant foul for lining up Caruso and jumping his elbow into his face.  Caruso was in concussion protocol two weeks ago, and probably should be again after that, for safety's sake.  &gt;OG deserved the ejection, nothing more. Had he injured Schroder a suspension would have been warranted.   Apparently it is open season on Lakers, and I have a problem with that, even if neither player was unlucky enough to appear seriously injured immediately afterward.  &gt; The world isn't black and white.   No, it isn't.  But if the Lakers ran around trying to injure Raptors like that, without repercussions, you would be livid."
It was also completely unnecessary. Schroeder fouled to make sure a shot couldn’t get up with textbook form (not too rough) and did everything he could to make sure Anunoby didn’t hit the floor. Schroeder was actually being very considerate and OG decided to trip him. I’d be pissed too.
"That's why I think OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges are guys to follow right now, they kinda fit the ""profile"""

"OG Anunoby.   The basketball index said recently he's the most versatile defender in the NBA based on percentage of time spent guarding each position. That means one possession he's guarding Murray, the next he could be guarding Jokic. And he can do both at an extremely high level.  Also he's shooting 40% on 5 3PT attempts. He's one of the best 3&amp;D players in the league."
"OG Anunoby.  Great lockdown defender, can shoot well, can bully down low, can get out in transition."
Root cause analysis. Trezz wouldn't have done anything until the OG Anunoby decided to throw Schroder to the ground. Hopefully the league looks into OG and takes further action since what he did was intentionally dangerous.
This is disgusting from OG Anunoby. Players like that in this league should never get another contract.
"&gt;What the hell, the commentators fully said there should be techs but not ejections for both OG and Harrell after seeing the replay and once they were both ejected  The Toronto crew literally said that it was a good play by Anunoby, while the replays were being shown.  They repeatedly expressed their shock after the ejections were announced, even though that was a guaranteed ejection, and that was obvious even live.  That's the worst kind of homerism -- defending dangerous, unnecessary play."
I still haven’t. Saw him gently laid on his back by OG Anunoby once tho
"Yo I highly doubt OG was pissed at all or that it was intentional, he doesn’t look pissed, plus he’s the calmest cucumber in the...cucumber stand.  I agree with some comments here saying they were weirdly entangled and it seems OG either didn’t quite realize that it was Schroeder’s leg or that he didn’t realize Schroeder wasn’t balanced.   I know it looks hella sus but come on, it’s OG Anunoby not Pat Bev or the Morris brother."

"Robert Covington. His versatility and impact on D this season are top-tier, and he's shooting 40% from 3.  Edit: OG Anunoby, too. Who has been slightly less effective on D, but more versatile than RoCo, and is also shooting 40%.  https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1378781381896114178"
I feel like OG Anunoby is truly one of the best 3 and D guys since the last season. He's shooting nearly 40% on 6 attempts and can really guard 1 through 5.
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."
OG Anunoby is my homer take.
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
OG Anunoby was the same and he really only was able to stay balanced on for the past couple of years. Before that he fell down every time he drove to the net.
"&gt;OG Anunoby played 0 playoff games, Norman Powell and FVV were bench players  Other than fvv these guys didn't have a huge effect then.  Kawhi, pg, Morris, Harrell, Lou is a great squad too"
"They definitely weren't better talent wise. Every player on that Raptors team is a starter right now. That team had insane depth at every position. OG Anunoby played 0 games, Norman Powell and FVV were bench players.   Jokic has clearly performed better in the playoffs no doubt, but the only team he's faced similar to the 2019 Raptors was the Lakers."
I don't shoot to miss - OG Anunoby
OG Anunoby needs some respect
"Andrea Bargnani FOR Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, 2016 1st Round Pick, 2014 2nd Round Pick, and a 2017 2nd Round Pick  Greivis Vasquez FOR Norman Powell and a pick that turned into OG Anunoby.  Vasquez would go on to play 26 games(no starts) before washing out of the league"
"Cade, OG anunoby and GTJ would be a nasty young core."

"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."
&gt; i guess WeTheNorth OG era is going to be over soon; but look forward to what's coming next  what's coming next is the OG Anunoby era.  he is easily the raptor with the highest upside and potential right now.
"Kyle Lowry yelled, “You will always be a part of this history!"" OG Anunoby gave a look of pleasant surprise. Pascal Siakam belted, “We got a fucking tank squad now.” And before Norman Powell hit the locker room door, ex-teammate Fred Vanvleet hugged him &amp; said, “Thugs cry too. It’s cool, bro.”"
OP forgot og anunoby
"OG anunoby as well is up there. Physically they are actually near identical.  Both 6’7 230 with kawhi having a 7’3 wingspan and OG having a 7’2 wingspan. Both play great defense. Defensively OG is probably the closest comp to kawhi but offensively some of the others listed are closer, especially rui"
"Ahh yes, the shy, quiet, introvert OG Anunoby who tweeted this in college:  [""If your girlfriend says hey to me that's our girlfriend now idc""](https://twitter.com/OAnunoby/status/437686141236428800)"
"OG Anunoby, Jrue, Draymond all deserve to be in the conversation. So much more than just stats/analytics"
OG Anunoby is a legitimately all-NBA level defender lmao
"Yes, I'd have an OG Anunoby over a 2x DPOY. Yes."
What about OG Anunoby??
"He's still great.  in no order OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (yeah he's a wing and a guard at the same time), Simmons, Jae'Sean Tate, Lebron, Dort, Butler, and him would be my top 9, I just chose 9 because I just woke up and I'm sure I forgot somebody good."
I didn’t say Pascal was better than OG tf?? I’m probably one of the biggest Anunoby fans on here aahahaha
“Barely any credit. I could coach that team tbh” about Nash.  1.	⁠Jayson Tatum 2.	⁠Donovan Mitchell 3.	⁠Bam Adebayo 4.	⁠OG Anunoby 5.	⁠De’Aaron Fox 6.	⁠Lonzo Ball 7.	⁠Johnathan Isaac 8.	⁠Jarret Allen 9.	⁠John Collins 10.	⁠Kuzma  On redraft of 2017.

OG Anunoby. I believe he is the best on-ball defender in the league.
1. Mitchell 2. Tatum 3. Bam Bam 4. Fox 5. OG Anunoby 6. John Collins 7. Jarrett Allen 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Lonzo 10. Markkanen   Isaac would've probably been higher if not for health.
Ben Gordon and OG Anunoby are British?!
"They need someone to slow down likes of LeBron, Kawhi, KD... level players.           Probably OG Anunoby, Jaylen Brown level defender."
OG Anunoby?
"OG anunoby is up there. He can and has consistently stayed in front of PG’s like kemba, fox, Trae, jure, ect. Normally Fred takes them for most of the game due to roster construction (raps have a lot of guards and few wings/bigs) but when it really matters it’s OG on the best player 1-4 and sometimes 5."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Bam Adebayo 3. Donovan Mitchell 4. De’Aaron Fox 5. John Collins 6. OG Anunoby 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Jarrett Allen 10. Derrick White
"I’m not saying that at all. I’m honestly baffled that’s the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn’t fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn’t make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn’t inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team’s *results* would vary from the one he’d hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let’s use your Luka example. Let’s say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren’t hitting the shots that the first team was?"
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo 4. John Collins 5. OG Anunoby  6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jarrett Allen 9. Jonathan Issac 10. Kyle Kuzma
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Donovan Mitchell 3. Bam Adebayo  4. OG Anunoby 5. De’Aaron Fox 6. Lonzo Ball 7. Johnathan Isaac 8. Jarret Allen 9. John Collins 10. Kuzma  Honorable mention to Chris Boucher who would probably go somewhere 15-25.

"We kinda got our dream season in 2019. The only thing that could've made it better is if Lowry hit that buzzer-beater 3 at the end of Game 5 of the Finals (bonus: that'd mean no Klay ACL tear).  Now, though? This season is kind of lost due to Tampa/COVID/poor roster construction, so I guess we luck out in the draft lottery and get Cunningham or Mobley.  Siakam continues to improve his passing and his 3-ball comes back to at least 2019 levels. Hoping he can be a 24/7/7 type of player.  FVV becomes even a little bit efficient/consistent and remembers that he's a foot shorter than the people he's driving against.  OG Anunoby gets good enough with his post moves to become a primary scoring option, and Trent Jr. continues to improve into an amazing 3&amp;D wing.  We ~~send Aron Baynes to the Shadow Realm~~ sign a competent center. Maybe even two.  We make one more deep playoff run before Lowry retires (after signing a team-friendly two-year extension).  A finals berth is a tall order with the stacked teams in this league, but I think we could make the ECF with the right pieces ~~before the Nets obliterate us~~. The *dream* scenario is we beat the LeBron Lakers in the finals, ending the Curse of LeBronto once and for all (or the Kawhi Clippers, proving that yes, you should have stayed in Toronto), and Lowry gets Finals MVP averaging 20+ points and 10+ assists."
The only thing OG Anunoby is good for is slacking off and having off the court issues with his possey
... I literally listed the Bucks as a team that made a major fuck up. You can point to a bunch of mistakes those other teams made too. Nuggets traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Traded Beasley despite him going off when he got starter minutes and being an extremely athletic lights out shooter. Blazers traded up for Zach Collins who's mediocre at best when he's actually healthy instead of staying back and being able to draft OG Anunoby and John Collins (both high upside players who were projected as good picks). Jazz are building around Mitchell/Gobert as their core which isn't their fault but also just not good enough to win a championship.
MVP: Kyle Lowry  MIP: Chris Boucher  6MOTY: Chris Boucher  ROTY: Malachi Flynn I guess   DPOY: OG Anunoby
He also traded Greivis Vasquez for Norm Powell and the pick that became OG anunoby.  The signings of cj miles and demarre Carroll were Sus.   We do well with trades. Bad with free agency.
&gt;	No update on OG Anunoby   Get well soon sweet prince ❤️❤️
OG Anunoby ahead of all 3
The Knicks would be deadly with Malcolm Brogdan. OG Anunoby would help as well.
OG Anunoby? Half this sub didn't even know who that was until this season haha
""".5 to go in Game 3. OG with the looooooook... GOT IT! OG ANUNOBY AT THE BUZZER!""  Yeah, we won that series, but... I dunno, all I'm saying is if we finish the Raptors in 5, that conference finals might have had a little different flavor to it."
"uhhh...  Damon Stoudemire/Vince Carter/Tracy McGrady/Chris Bosh/Marcus Camby  I would have DeMar over Damon, but the positions don't really match.  Honourable Mentions: PJ Tucker, Jonas Valanciunas, Roy Hibbert (who we apparently traded to Indiana), OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet (who doesn't count because he wasn't technically drafted, though we did sign him)  This is a relatively young team so there's not a whole lot of talent to choose from, especially at point guard."
Please add OG Anunoby to this comment.  Please. I have so little.
OG Anunoby is better than all of these guys except Bridges
Anunoby puts the OG in POGGERS.
OG Anunoby
"I take back what I said because this is a team that chose fucking TJ Leaf instead of OG Anunoby, John Collins, Kyle Kuzma, Jarrett Allen, and Josh Hart so they're gonna fuck up the lottery pick too I bet"
"OG Anunoby, Malachi Flynn 2 FRPs would be what I would picture as a reasonable offer although idk what LaVine’s contract looks like rn. Depends what direction the Bulls want to go in too."
"Hey Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby feel free to come back ASAP thanks."
OG Anunoby
On ball I’ll take OG Anunoby
LaVine $19 mil   OG Anunoby $3.8   LeBron $39.1  AD: $32.7  Bam Adebayo $5.1
Nobody right now is a true 1-5 defender   Guys like Giannis and Bam aren’t chasing Steph around screens or staying in front of Kyrie consistently   Guys like Ben aren’t guarding Jokic types or true 5s   Draymond is too old for quicker guards   AD is a 2-5 guy  OG Anunoby is honestly perhaps the closest but he’s not guarding a KAT or Jokic without massive amounts of help and doubles
"In my opinion, NBA Draft 2017 has a lot of potential MVPs. 3 players have great chance and potential to become MVP - Tatum, Mitchell and Fox (yes, I'm serious). I also see serious potential for becoming MVP at Bam Adebayo and OG Anunoby. I believe in these guys."
"I don't know dude, pretty sure if you haven't won by 23 your basically never going to win. Its clear based on all the reactions hot takes on this sub reddit that every team should win championships by the time players hit their mid 20s or else.they are busts. Look at the last 5 or 6 championship teams. They where lead by legendary young players like Kyle Kuzma, and Og Anunoby. Guys like matthew dellavedova and nick young. Guys like Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Zion williamson, Devin Booker, are over the hump has beens that missed their chance to compete in this league"
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"

"&gt;it isn’t an opinion. It’s an absolute fact.  Well no, facts are something that can be empirically proven. What you’re providing is absolutely an opinion in every sense of the word.  &gt;3 and D players are the easiest to find in the league  They actually aren’t at all. 3&amp;D players are by far the most coveted type of player there is next to all stars, and they don’t grow on trees whatsoever.   And that’s not even mentioning that reducing Klay to simply a 3&amp;D player is misleading. OG Anunoby is a 3&amp;D player. Klay Thompson is the second best 3 point shooter to ever exist.  So yeah, totally an opinion and not a fact whatsoever. Sorry."
"OG is elite is all I'm saying, and probably should be on all defensive team this year.   https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba"
"It's very easy.  Luka Doncic 8M  James Harden 40.8M  OG Anunoby 3.8M  Giannis Antetokounmpo 27.5M  Nikola Jokic 28.5M  Total 108.6M  If you mean for the whole roster, just swap out Harden with Donovan Mitchell who makes 5.2M and fill the rest in."
"I'm from the UK OG Anunoby is like the only British player in the league and plays for Toronto, so I naturally support the raptors."
OG anunoby got 18 million a year. And Robinson is not nearly as good...
"Most individual defensive stats I see tend to favor rim protection (guys like Gobert, Turner) and perimeter defenders who take a diverse group of assignments (1-5 defenders like OG Anunoby and Ben Simmons). They don’t heavily emphasize stuff like guarding the best player because it’s possible that it doesn’t correlate to high impact defense as much as the other 2 things and also I believe schemes like double teams may muddy the waters a bit."

"Ideally, you'd have D'Lo or even ANT come off the bench. I agree Beasley needs a playmaker next to him. I loved how Beasley played when KAT &amp; D'Lo was out, but the best scenario is somehow trading him for someone like OG Anunoby"
OG Anunoby with 0.5 seconds left
"i think you pay a premium for players that do what he does. if OG anunoby is worth $20m than mikal is as well, he's one of the best 3&amp;D guys in the league."
"He is 4th in total deflections (193), tied with Ben Simmons and behind Fred VanVleet (194), TJ McConnell (217) and Robert Covington (229). Per game, he is 10th with 3.1 per game, behind OG Anunoby (3.2), Smart (3.3), Jrue Holiday (3.3), Larry Nance Jr (3.4), Butler (3.5), TJ McConnell (3.6), Covington (3.6), Ben Simmons (3.6) and Fred VanVleet (3.9)."
He's more like OG Anunoby with crippling levels of hype.

*Immediately scans list for OG Anunoby”  Nice
"He's a ""role-player"" in the same way that OG Anunoby or Ben Simmons are ""role-players""."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
I don't know about biggest (I'm biased) but I'm gonna mention OG Anunoby anyways
OG Anunoby and Stanley Johnson  OG Anunoby and Jeremi Grant
"But I think you have to compare Bridges to last year's OG because he signed his extension early this year. At that time, OG had had some injury troubles his first two season, was still pretty low volume from 3 and had a slightly lower usage than Mikal does this season. I don't think last year's OG is much if any better than this year's Bridges, although he was 2 years younger. I think if Anunoby was negotiating an extension today he'd get more than he did this offseason, because being able to take 6 threes a game and dial up his usage is huge. I think getting Bridges at 20 would be totally fair; he probably does have less upside than OG, but he's also an iron man which is a point in his favor."

"Raptors were fined for misreporting injuries, albeit minor ones.   &gt; “The Raptors were fined $25,000 for the Friday game against the Orlando Magic in which Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam were listed out for rest.  &gt;The Toronto Star’s Doug Smith explained the fine wasn’t simply due to the rest, but because after the Raptors had listed the three as out for rest, head coach Nick Nurse said Anunoby had knee swelling and Lowry was dealing with a chronic foot infection.  &gt;Because of that discrepancy between the injury report and Nurse’s pregame remarks, the team was fined.”"
"OG ""I will go to the zoo and look at the giraffes habitat"" Anunoby"
Every team in the league needs OG Anunoby. Which is why everyone can keep their dirty paws off him because he’s ours
"There are 30 teams in the NBA who are actively looking for these kinds of players and whom they would be a good fit for. It's always far far easier said than done. And alot of these guys who are called 3+D lists are really either  a) The Gary Trent types who are great shooters but who's reputation as some kind of defender is pretty fraudulent.    b) Or the Josh Richardson types who people say ""are floor spacers"" but nobody actually guards, teams are fine letting shoot and provide no actual gravity or real floor spacing ability even if their %s are ok.   The legit 3+D wings like Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby arent that common, and they arent really going to be available."

"OG Anunoby is from the UK, he's only 23 and has all-star potential, so you could root for the Raptors.   I don't think there are other active players from the UK, but maybe someone will correct me.    Edit: Here's a list of all NBA players from the UK. https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/birthplaces.fcgi?country=GB&amp;state=  OG is indeed the only one still playing."
brown started off with basically 0 dribbling ability and scoring creation and got to scoring 25 ppg in 5 years with a very good 3 point shot. people used to make fun of him for looking down on the ground when driving to the rim because his handle was so shit. that's extremely fast development. compare that to someone like OG anunoby who started off at a similar place and still can't do much off the dribble
"If OG had ANY sort of handles, he would tear up this league.   So OG Anunoby and anyone who can dribble"
"He did, I bet on the fucking C's that time and I lost the hugest bet of my life because of OG fucking Anunoby. Guess that's my karma for rooting for the fucking Celtics to win."
"Luol Deng, Ben Gordon, OG Anunoby, and Blazers legend Joel Freeland. ARE THEY NOT PEOPLE TO YOU?!"
"lol you think he should be making what guys like OG Anunoby, Derrick White, Marcus Morris, and Bogdan Bogdonavic make?"
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
We would have selected OG Anunoby. We tried to trade back to get extra value. Then Masai took OG one spot ahead of where we slid back to and we just came away with nothing because we drafted Tyler lydon in a panic move lol.  It was not TC’s finest draft. But he’s been fantastic otherwise.
"lol let's pump our brakes, he's not quite there yet  ... Please ignore my near-identical praise for OG Anunoby. xD"
Laugh but the best at stopping Jokic is Toronto despite their total lack of size because of how they swarm him trap him etc. OG Anunoby holds up well enough for the 1-1.5 seconds he needs to before help comes and the raptors are able to hold him down well.
"&gt;Even before the NBA season began, things were already weird for the Toronto Raptors. They were about to get weirder.   &gt;The pandemic forced the Raptors to become NBA snowbirds as they relocated from Toronto to Tampa, Fla., where there are palm trees outside and “We the North” signage inside, a move that turned out to be the beginning of a season that would make absolutely no sense.   &gt;They have since become the league’s most puzzling anomaly. There are good teams and bad teams every year in the NBA, but there has never really been a team like the Raptors. They’re either a bad team that’s good—or a good team that’s bad.   &gt;This is how much of an outlier they are: The difference between the Raptors’ expected number of wins based on their statistics and their actual number of wins is the largest of any team with a positive net rating in at least three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Stathead data.   &gt;There have been 39 teams in NBA history with losing records and positive point differentials, meaning they outscored their opponents for the season and still lost more games than they won. Most were barely under .500. There is one notable exception. The lowest winning percentage on this list of basketball aberrations would belong to this season’s greatest source of dissonance: the Toronto Raptors in Tampa.   &gt;They appear to be the best, worst NBA team of all time.   &gt;The Raptors are currently sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference with a 22-34 record after being ravaged by the coronavirus and living away from home while most people are stuck working from home.   &gt;If the NBA playoffs started today instead of next month, they wouldn’t even qualify for the league’s first play-in tournament. Not making the playoffs when more teams than ever will make the playoffs would be a huge disappointment, and it might even make sense at this point to bottom out temporarily and increase their lottery odds in a tantalizing draft.   &gt;But what makes the Raptors more interesting than other bad teams with tanking incentives is that it’s still not clear if they’re one of them. They have the mathematical profile of a team that’s actually good.   &gt;A funny thing about the NBA is that a team’s win-loss record is not always the most reliable metric of whether it’s good or bad, since that number is subject to luck, random variation, statistical noise and so many other vagaries of playing sports. A better measure in the short term is a team’s net rating—the point differential per 100 possessions—and the Raptors have outscored their opponents. Their net rating is higher than the teams in seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th place in the East.   &gt;There is even a stat called Pythagorean wins that predicts a team’s expected record from the number of points it scores and allows. It was devised by the pioneering baseball quant Bill James and then applied to basketball by Philadelphia 76ers president Daryl Morey when he was a Stats Inc. researcher as a college student.  &gt;But not even a formula designed by the greatest analytical minds in sports and named after a Greek philosopher’s theorem is powerful enough to crack this NBA team.   &gt;The numbers suggest the Raptors should be 29-27. Instead they are 22-34.   &gt;Those numbers are skewed by their peculiar ability to win big and lose close games. The Raptors have somehow won nearly the same number of games by 20 points or more and 10 points or fewer. They also had six game-winning or game-tying shots in the final seconds of the fourth quarter before April—and missed them all. That helps explain why they would be the first team ever to outscore their opponents and lose more than 60% of their games.   &gt;That’s also part of the confusion. They have the statistical indicators of a good team and the record of a bad team. So which is it?   &gt;The answer is probably both, but it’s a tricky question. One of the more trivial difficulties of playing basketball during a pandemic is that it’s hard to tell what to make of a team. The season is shorter. The games are packed tighter. The arenas are emptier. Add injuries and Covid protocols. Subtract home-court advantage. What do you get?  &gt;“A season unlike any other,” said Jack Armstrong, the Raptors’ television analyst for the last 23 years.   &gt;But when it comes to evaluating any team this season, it’s hard to ignore the massive purple dinosaur in the room.   &gt;The NBA has managed to plow ahead with minimal disruptions and, like the rest of the country, can see light at the end of the tunnel with players getting vaccinated and fans trickling back into arenas. The worst seems to be over. But in a sport where one case and the subsequent contact tracing can wipe out an entire team, this season was inevitably going to favor teams that were spared the wrath of a microscopic pathogen.   &gt;Toronto wasn’t one of them. Raptors players have missed 114 days because of Covid-19 protocols, according to a Fansure study of the league’s injury reports. Only the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics were hit so hard.   &gt;Their exposure started with a Feb. 26 announcement that coach Nick Nurse and five members of his staff would be working remotely while sidelined by the league’s health and safety protocols, followed by Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby being out for more than two weeks each. The Raptors had three games postponed and then lost nine straight from March 3 to March 22—and the Covid-related free fall could have been worse if not for a weeklong break for the All-Star Game.   &gt;At the beginning of March, when their record was 17-17, they could squint at glimmers of hope. By the end of March, when they were dealing with the human toll of being demolished by Covid, losing 13 of 14 games and nearly trading Kyle Lowry, they were staring into the NBA abyss.   &gt;“Pretty much everything that could possibly happen,” Armstrong said, “happened.”   &gt;There are still reasons to believe this might be a good team disguised as a bad one.   &gt;It’s why the more obviously good teams aren’t exactly clamoring to play the 2019 champions if they can sneak into the playoffs. As far as first-round opponents for the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers or Milwaukee Bucks go, this one would have the rough appeal of wrestling a velociraptor.   &gt;And it wouldn’t be entirely surprising if the Raptors do something else that no team with a losing record has done in three decades: win a playoff series."
OG Anunoby   Gary Trent Jr   Fred Vanvleet   Idk what it is about Toronto but everyone loves to overrate their role players. Might be because of their regular season success last year.
OG Anunoby.  He's gotten better at driving but he still seems somewhat stiff and uncomfortable sometimes but regardless of whether he keeps improving I just want our sweet scarfy prince to stay with us forever.
OG Anunoby hopefully is a Raptors lifer
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"PG: Gogan Dragic (offensive creator + shooting)  SG: Bradley Beal (shot making + primary ball handler)  SF: OG Anunoby (defends, shoots, and athletic)  PF: Jerami Grant (effective role player + two way)  C: Bam (same reasons as OP)"
"I’d just do what he did in Houston but scale it up a bit. Everyone should be thicc, switchable, able to hit 3s, and good rebounders.  PG: James Harden  SG: Josh Hart  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Anthony Davis"
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."

He plays like a more compact version of OG Anunoby.
"fox, SGA, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Deandre Ayton"
OG “Khris Middleton” Anunoby
So you're saying he's rookie year OG Anunoby
"Who’s y’all third team? Dejounte Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Capela is mine I think"
Idk how Matisse can make it on 20 minutes a game. Is he a great defender? Yes. But there’s a limited impact you can have compared to a guy like OG Anunoby when you’re playing 20 minutes and OG plays 33.
"Completely undeserved. Put OG Anunoby over him, among others."
"You're really gonna give Alex Caruso and KCP more votes than OG Anunoby, eh?  ok."
OG Anunoby is about to be disrespected
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
OG Anunoby for MIP
OG Anunoby   https://youtu.be/N5nQkb5O7ts
OG Anunoby
Find me someone who hates OG Anunoby. I’ll wait
The disrespect to OG Anunoby.
OG Anunoby to replace the hole left by DeAndre Hunter's injury.
"the actual answer is Curry, but if for some reason the Jazz couldn't get him I think OG Anunoby could be an amazing fit. One of the absolute best 1 on 1 defenders in the league, good shooter, doesn't need the ball in his hands that much. Zion or Ingram make sense for scoring purposes, but OG would be an amazing fit"
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
"Trade Sexton for someone like DeAndre Hunter or OG Anunoby, and then hopefully get one of Cade or Kuminga in the draft.  Garland, Okoro, Cade/Kuminga, OG/Hunter, Allen."
OG Anunoby lmao bro wtf are you smoking. How old are you? Pau was the star and leader during his Memphis years. He was an all-star playing with the lakers. GTFO Pau is getting in the HOF
"A very high end role player, borderline all star tier (Similar to guys like Jaren Jackson, OG Anunoby) etc. but yes, a role player at its core"
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"For more hot takes, further down the draft class there's Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Kyle Kuzma"
An elite 3 &amp; d role player like Mikal bridges or OG anunoby
"Eh, they made the pick for Utah.    Supposedly their plan was to draft OG Anunoby, and they were expecting him to fall to whatever number the Jazz pick was at."
"I still feel damaged from OG Anunoby hitting that winner in g3. It’s mentally damaging to lose to a last second shot, especially when you are up and think you won. It makes you feel like you shattered your ribs thinking about it. Buzzer beaters change series. G7 or G3. If the Celtics went up 3-0 instead of 2-1, they would have had enough momentum to perhaps not lose the first two games against Miami and go to the finals. These game winning buzzer beaters make you think about your entire season could have been so different if a shot was 2 inches different. They sting. I would rather lose by 40. Edit: As a fan, I mean. As a player, obviously you would rather play well and keep it close and lose to a buzzer beater than get blown out."
"Sure : AD, OG Anunoby, Bam  Maybe ? : - not sure about Ben Simmons against centers and really strong players, I like him way more on guards weirdly  \- really disapointed by Giannis as a perimeter defender moving his feet so not sure either,  \- Thad Young/Draymond/PJ Tucker could but not sure they still have the foot speed to do that  \- Kevon Looney : yeah I know weird, but I really think he's a great great switch defender, heck he might be better at it that he is at actually guarding  a big center  \- Kawhi/Butler/Lebron : in a pinch they can guard some centers and some point guards, not all, and not for a long time either at this point, Kawhi and Lebron could in their defensive prime (Butler is purely theoric, actually don't even remember him on a real big)  &amp;#x200B;  I'll admit I'm pretty clueless about Johnatan Isaac, I know when he was drafted many people were thinking he could do it"
OG Anunoby this is your life
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * OG Anunoby  Raptors get:   * Eric Bledsoe  * Anfernee Simons  * 3 Pelicans 1sts  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  Blazers flip CJ, for a SF, a desperate need -- and OG is a top 3 perimeter defender in the league. They contend with Dame/Norm/OG/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans pay up to flip Bledsoe's useless contract for a great shooterwho helps space the floor for Zion.  Raptors pick up assets and a young player to further help them retool"
Mikal Bridges = more speed and handles  Og Anunoby = More strength and Defence
"Lol there was a thread post-game last night that was titled ""OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges?"" like wtf is the point and who cares about that comparison"
Ben or OG Anunoby IMO
"OG Anunoby is up there. Not #1, just wanna mention him"
"Ogugua ""OG"" Anunoby Jr  I hope my guy takes another leap next year."
Thybulle is so overrated. He’s a good defender but he’s already 24 and has 0 offensive game  Just for reference he’s older than Bam Adebayo and OG Anunoby also
"I completely agree, but I’ve seen people on this sub talk about how the Bubble was so forgettable and boring, and I don’t understand that at all.   Did these people forget the insane back and forth between Murray and Mitchell in Round 1? Luka going toe-to-toe with the Clippers and making insanely clutch shots? That nutso 7-game series between Houston and OKC? The OG Anunoby buzzer beater and the rest of that 7-game series against the Celtics? The Nuggets coming back from down 3-1 AGAIN against the Clippers? The Bucks falling apart in one of the more surprising collapses in NBA Playoffs history? Bam’s game-saving block on Tatum in the ECF? Jimmy Butler playing like a superstar on the biggest stage and turning in some of the grittiest performances you’ll ever see in the Finals? Anthony Davis playing maybe the best individual defense I’ve ever seen throughout the Lakers’ entire playoff run?  None of that was particularly memorable to these people? The players were probably more focused in the Bubble, so I agree that it led to some better basketball and more competitive series."
the only clip he's correct about is the first one. The rest is garbage where hes trying to sideways argue OG Anunoby is better when he isnt.
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
"Nah, if we hadn't traded for the pick they'd have taken OG Anunoby. Who would'be still been better for them than Trey Lyles lol."
OG Anunoby is definitely Ravenclaw then
"Yeah I'm reading this description and I think ""yeah, he's a solid 3&amp;D dude... does this guy know that Wiggins is among 30 highest-paid players in the league?"". He's getting paid twice what OG Anunoby just signed.  His value is ok for Warriors in their situation, they have the revenue, they wanna keep the team competitive for the cost of luxury tax, and keeping Wiggins is the only way they can have a high-profile player."
"Jewell ""OG Anunoby"" Lloyd"
fake tough guy tried to come after OG Anunoby this season after OG steadied his fall on Schroder and lightly drops him on the ground.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIoB3vZMKQ
"Khem Birch, Fred VanVleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
OG Anunoby did nothing wrong.
OG Anunoby
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
He's always been such an instigating little bitch gremlin. No wonder OG Anunoby picked him up with that wrestling move that one game
A near max extension though? You’re looking at paying a 3 and D guy 25 million? I’ll compare him to a guy like OG Anunoby who signed for 18 million although that contract is a bit of an underpay.
If Mikal Bridges is getting 20 million then OG Anunoby needs to leave Klutch Sports Lmao. Rich Paul is a terrible negotiator.
Yeah it’s a lot of money but that’s what 3&amp;D wings get paid. OG anunoby is making 18m  and that wasn’t seen as a bad deal so we kind of expected to be right in that same range.
"near-max is a stretch imo, but look at what OG anunoby got. mikal will probably get a bigger contract than he did. elite 3 and D guys aren't cheap."
I think the Raptors make a lot of sense more assets would probably be needed to be added but a starting point of OG Anunoby and the 7th overall pick sounds nice  Don’t know if they would include GTJ along with that tho
yeah I think OG Anunoby without the health problems is fair
OG Anunoby is Awesome!
OG Anunoby ruined Brad Stevens
"Tyrese Haliburton, OG Anunoby, Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Dejounte Murray"
"When fully healthy I see Isaac as on that OG Anunoby or Ben Simmons, tier of hugely impactful defensive wing with great positional versatility and switchability.  The Magic were legit stoppers a minute ago, and it was because Isaac was an insane presence, there were some good articles and content on the subject and what a meaningful anchor of a defense Isaac proved to be.    Unfortunately he’s another case of a promising young player’s career disrupted by injury issues, he’s a better player in every way than Zach Collins though, on both ends, though both are pretty putrid presences on the offensive end.  You mostly squint and highlight the promising good parts, while recognizing the issues."
"OG Anunoby is the best overall defender in the league but the media won't tell you that. He can effectively guard 1-5 no problem. Some guy mentioned Thybulle, OG does every he does while also being extremely efficient on offense."
"Zach Collins over Bam, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby and John Collins. Woof."
"1. OG Anunoby is all defensive   2. Why are Luka, Dame and PG excluded? I don’t get which criteria they fail to meet"
Cultured OG Anunoby
Damn. OG Anunoby aspires every day to be the first NBA player to do this. I guess he has the right coach to help him reach his goal.
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
OG Anunoby on the rise.
"Kawhi &amp; Jimmy Butler are the first 2 names that popped up in my mind. Also, I feel like Lu Dort and OG Anunoby are on their way to doing this."
OG Anunoby is a basketball player in the nba.
Are you under the impression that Kyle Lowry guards 1-5? I...... don't even know what to say to that. Maybe you're confusing him with OG Anunoby?  PJ Tucker guarded 5s for like one season and took a beating doing it and he's 2 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier than Dort lol
"The problem with the Clippers is they don’t have a mobile 5 that can keep their defense from completely falling apart any time there’s a pick and roll. Either you switch and Luka destroys the big, or you hedge and recover and send help all the way over to the rim and leave shooters open on the weak side.  Right now, Zubac and Ibaka are liabilities in the pick and roll. Ibaka is not who he used to be, same thing happened in the Celtics series last season where a hobbled Kemba Walker played him off the floor and forced OG Anunoby to play center.  They need to be pre switching all the pick and rolls and keeping Ibaka and Zubac out of them but they just don’t. They just let it happen. Either Lue is incompetent or he just doesn’t care, and hopes the Mavs hot shooting cools off."
Throw in a Danny Green and OG Anunoby for good measure
"Is there some way we could have Jrue Holiday, and OG Anunoby play defence on each other? at the same time?? to definitively settle this??? If Jrue is guarding OG - while Ogugua is guarding Jrue - can either player TRULY score? Maybe, if anything, it rips a tear in the NBA multiverse. I don't know. We'd have to try."
"They did, just Harkless and Aminu were backup caliber forwards playing 30 minutes a game.  Portland just didn't have the supporting shooting or playmaking in 2018.  He followed that really poor performance up with a run to the WCF despite having a frontcourt of injured and fasting Kanter + Harkless and Aminu.    He's a solid coach.  Not elite, but unless Spo is willing to return to Portland I'm not sure if Portland can lure anyone better.    The issue, more than anything, is Olshey's roster construction and drafting.  We have 2 forwards and one of them is Melo.  We absolutely blew the 2017 draft where we had 3 first rounders and walked away with Zach Collins and Swanigan.  Hindsight is 2020, but there is a world where Portland could have had Donovan Mitchell and Kuzma from that draft, or if we didn't trade up John Collins, OG Anunoby/Jerrett Allen, and Kuzma/White/Hart.  I'm not even convinced we needed to trade up for Zach Collins.  That offseason where we dumped money on Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner was also a disaster."
"He pulled Anunoby down in the bubble last year on a fastbreak. Straight up dirty play, he had no way to play the ball yet somehow iirc the refs deemed it as a common foul.  Legit made OG smash his knee centre of the court, thankfully he made it out safe"
yall shoulda got OG anunoby
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
"Kevin Porter Jr, OG Anunoby, Anthony Edwards,"
OG Anunoby would make the next shot here.  But love the villain stuff tbh
I wonder what your opinion on OG Anunoby flipping Schröder over was?
OG Anunoby esque
gonna air-drop OG Anunoby to the Bucks squad just to freak the Celtics out
"That Raptors team had Kawhi added to a quad consistenting of: elite defenders from 1-5 on the starting lineup, a bench of Serge Ibaka, Fred Van Vleet, OG Anunoby and Norman Powell, and a great coach in Nurse.  Kawhi iso was how the Raps broke through and got points against good defensive schemes but otherwise Kawhi was easily plugged into an offence Lowry and FVV were extremely comfortable already running, on top of Siakam making a huge leap that year and presenting as a viable 2nd option on offence. Kawhi didn’t have to elevate anything like LeBron or Luka would, he was a finishing touch to get an extremely competitive team over the hump.  Tbh hypothetically you could plug a lot of superstars into that roster and expect similar results, but Kawhi being the 2-way monster he is was a big part of shutting Milwaukee down, always fun to wonder how that series would go if it was someone like KD tasked with matching Giannis at halfcourt and corralling him into Gasol/Siakam down low.  That said idk if there’s a diminished return to adding Luka/Harden’s playmaking to that roster vs someone you could give the ball to anytime you needed points + could defend the opposing best player. Kawhi could very possibly have been the exact fit the Raps needed in that situation, besides LBJ who can be trusted to do everything lol"
"The Toronto team had Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet who are both just entering their prime, also OG Anunoby who couldn’t play in our Championship run due to injuries.              The Toronto team was not only a better team than these Clippers, they also had a lot more upcoming talent than these Clippers.               Kawhi left mostly because of his family. If he expected to be on a better team then he was straight up deluisonal."

"I'd say the Warriors were even luckier to even be in the series when Klay got injured. Hell, just having OG Anunoby shifts game 5 to a raptors gentlemen's sweep."
Hard to decide between OG Anunoby at 23rd and Pascal Siakam at 27th. Hoping Flynn (29th) and Harris (59th) develop an argument for this one day as well.
"I’d say it depends what you get for him. If you are getting picks no players then they are probably a lower end playoff/play in team. If you could add a strong defensive wing (like a Marcus smart, OG Anunoby, etc.) they could be one of the best teams in the east.  This also all depends on how Warren looks coming off the injury. He looked like he could turn into a legit all star last year. I guess we’ll see"
"They've done okay with trades. The Kawhi pick for Hill, the LeVert pick for Thad young, and a first for Brogdon, giving up nothing for TJ Warren. But they just get nothing from their actual draft picks. Not even solid role players. Sometimes it's obvious shit too. Like passing on OG Anunoby for TJ Leaf. I'll never get over that."
"I think OG Anunoby has a good shot, or one of Cleveland's SexLand"

Does OG Anunoby not exist all of a sudden lmao?
"I think Brooks is a very good wing defender, but I don't think he's better than Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Matisse Thybulle, Dort, Draymond, or Jimmy Butler.  And it's hard to label defensive positions with all the switching now. Brooks is a wing defender who just defended Steph Curry, a small guard. We've seen OG Anunoby and Draymond guard like every position."
OG Anunoby is afraid of cottage cheese.

"Totally possible. I look at Trent and OG Anunoby and I can’t in good faith say he should get more than OG, but realistically he could get just as much (so 4/72 for 18 million).  But to me I think Norm makes more as he’s more established. Gary’s still gotta prove his role, and would be paid mostly on his potential due to his age. But his physical tools are not great so you wonder how much headroom there is. A lot is riding on his shot making ability continuing to improve  while Norm is the ideal 2 guard. Two way, highly efficient, and capable of scaling up his production efficiently if need be. There’s not much bust potential there.  We totally could have kept Norm yeah. We got cap flexibility by trading him though because of Trents low cap hold, and since he’s restricted we can mess around in free agency and ink him once we are done filling out the roster.  Also he’s so much younger and considering we are potentially adding a high lotto pick, we improve our long term outlook this way."
&gt; if you’re a quiet dude doing a great job you still might get overlooked.  Case in point: OG Anunoby. He’s the defender the hype train thinks Ben Simmons is.
I tried to make a happy birthday OG Anunoby post three days ago twice and it didn't get through but this shit does smh
"His defense looks bad, yes, but he's having to be the 2nd biggest guy on his team because the Spurs have been so guard-heavy. Their power forwards have been Trey Lyles who had to play center, LA who had to play a lot of center, and Rudy Gay who wasn't really a power forward either. His defense was ok the last year in Toronto where he got to consistently play SG/be the second-smallest guy (and they also had OG Anunoby)."
"Dude, those players I mentioned were all players available at our picks.   Can you imagine how much better we would be right now if we had John Collins and OG anunoby?"
"We had tons of assets and got nothing from them  We had 3 firsts in one of the best drafts in recent years and came out with swanigan and Zach Collins. Could've had John Collins, OG anunoby, Jarrett Allen, etc.   Or flipped those assets and future picks for a star"
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
"Which side hates this trade more?   Warriors get:   * OG Anunoby   * 4 overall   Raptors get:   * James Wiseman  * Paschall  * Mulder, Smailagic (money filler, expected to get cut)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st"
Remember that huge buzzer beater OG Anunoby hit in last year’s playoffs? Because barely anybody outside of Toronto or Boston does. But if a guy like Booker makes that shot? *That’s* a story.
Monte Morris / Victor Oladipo / OG Anunoby / Giannis / Ayton would be filthy. Bam sixth man could do serious damage too.   Only position that's below average is PG
OG Anunoby as well
"and Kawhi and OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam. And it faile the 1st two games when Kawhi wasn\t guaring him on perimeter. To suggest that an Euroleague team can do that is just funny"

It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."

LESS GOO OG ANUNOBY
"Siakam is an elite defensive player, like easily a tier or two above Wiggins defensively this year let alone the rest of his career where he was a meh to bad defender. Siakam's best strength at a player is his defense, where he is 94th percentile in defensive versatility, a 1 through 5 defender, elite in isolation (5th in iso points per possession allowed, 3rd in forced TOVs in iso), an elite help &amp; recover defender as shown by being 2nd in the league in contested threes while playing the 4 and out of position at the 5, hustles as well (4th in defensive loose balls recovered) and alongside OG Anunoby is the key to our defensive scheme which relies upon aggressive digging in + helping from the corners on drives then recovering + rotating to the open man repeatedly.  To say Wiggins defense is better than Siakam is just exposing how little you know about Siakam as a player. Its his main calling card and the one thing he has has since coming into the league as a raw athletic big whose draft comparisons were players such as Biyombo, Mbah a Moute and Quincy Acy."
Originally had OG Anunoby too but he withdrew
"I think it’s sad that, really and truly, the Nigerian team wasn’t at their best either. They were missing Monte Morris and OG Anunoby. I don’t know why Jahlil didn’t play. He isn’t that bad, right? Literally every active player for Nigeria beside him played good minutes."

The tenth USA player would be like a Bradley Beal at worst. Tenth world guy might be like an OG Anunoby. Team USA is both top heavy and has depth.
OG Anunoby. Dude is legit and was really coming into his own. He’s one of the strongest guys in the league and he’s figuring out how to play like Kawhi
"Depends on the direction they want to go. If they’re trying to contend now then probably not but if they want to rebuild then they should do it. Siakam is 27, he doesn’t really match up with a rebuilding team. I think a rebuilding team surrounded by Gary Trent jr, OG Anunoby, Jalen Suggs??(4th pick), Wiseman, Bouknight?? (7th pick), Giddey?? (14th pick), and Malachi Flynn is actually pretty formidable. Obviously I don’t know how the picks will turn out but that has potential to be a scary team in the future"

There’s an outside chance at a Dame or a Beal but you’d have to give up more than Ben for that to happen anyways"

"I like THT. Love when 2nd rounders and UDFAs make the most of their opportunity.  My favourite part about being a Raptor fan is just watching late picks and inconspicuous players earn their way up the ladder. It is the culture of the Raptors.  That being said, OG Anunoby is a incredibly unique player.  He can guard all 5 spots. Strong enough to bang with centers. Very quick for his size (albeit, his motions are rather awkward). Kawhi like emotionless disposition. High IQ.  Has improved every element of his game as the years have gone.   To me - he's the most important Raptor. Obviously he's not a superstar type player, but his defensive versatility, intensity, flexibility on top of him basically turning into a 20PPG scorer with efficiency, particularly at his salary (\~17M over the next 4 years) makes him one of the most valuable (albeit, unassuming) young players in the league."
OG Anunoby and they aren't even in the same stratosphere
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"I'm in favor of a hard cap plus a ""Superstar exception"" contract that doesn't count against the cap. However, all Superstar Exceptions are the same cash per year (maybe whatever 40% of the hard cap is) and players on Superstar Exceptions can only be included in a trade if the return includes another player on a Superstar Exception.   Teams can choose to convert a Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract, but only if they have the cap space to take the contract on (e.g., they need 35% of their cap space available to convert their Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract).   You may be wondering why a player would sign a Superstar Exception when they could take 50% of the cap. But I think a team with 50% of the money going to one player is never going to be a contender, especially against a team with one dude not counting against the cap at all, letting them spend literally twice as much to build out the roster. And so no smart team would offer that kind of money, and if they did, they wouldn't win anything.  It would be like having Lebron on 50% of the cap, AD on a Superstar Exception, and absolute scrubs vs Steph on a Superstar Exception and a good roster. Like it would be something like Grant Williams / Ben McLemore / Lebron / AD / Aaron Baynes vs Steph / CJ McCollum / OG Anunoby / Draymond / Christian Wood. Spending huge on two stars may look good, but the rest of the team will be so bad, the better constructed team with just one dude on the Superstar Exception (and no guy on 50% of the cap) gives you a better team."
"OG Anunoby turned 23 on July 17th, he was 22 this past season. He's only two or three years older than some of the top prospects in July's NBA draft. Ergo, I'd max him."
"Portland would have made out way better just keeping the picks and choosing any two of Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White instead."
"I mean there’s a lot that goes into defence. Rotations, on-ball, off-ball, etc. And he’s just not a smart defender who gets exposed in a lot of ways.  He’s certainly not a “great” defender unless you think there are 100+ “great” defenders.  OG Anunoby is a great defender. Jaylen Brown is great. Jrue Holiday is great. Ayton is great. Wiggins is just good."
OG Anunoby vs Denis Schroder in the Euros tomorrow
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
"I love it for the Raptors, Siakam is simply not that guy. He’s not that superstar talent, the guy they can pick at 7th prob has higher upside and they’re going younger anyway. 4th pick, 7th pick, Wiseman, Trent Jr and OG Anunoby are a good start for rebuild. Sign and trade Lowry for more assets too"
Trading up for Zach Collins is what fucked them over when they could have stayed with #15 and #20 and taken both John Collins and OG Anunoby
"I think people say stuff just because it’s parroted so many times that it becomes their version of the truth. Take this in:  [Anunoby's isolation stats are eye-popping. He ranks in the 94th percentile in isolation defense, according to NBA Advanced Stats, surrendering 0.61 pointer per possession in isolation. Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions. He played 24% of his time defending small forwards, another 24% of his time on shooting guards, 22% of his time on power forwards, and 16 and 13 percent of his time defending point guards and centers, respectively](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba)"
"What? 2019 Raptors:  Lowry, FVV, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Siakam, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher…  They were stacked. They won the ship and probably would have ran it back the next year if they kept their horses.  A healthy Nets from this year would beat them but not sure any other team would in 7 games."
"All he is right now is an elite NBA body. We don’t know how his skills will develop, but he’s got the body to be an elite player. It’s all about potential. I liked his BBIQ tho he’s a really decent playmaker and with his frame can be a great defender. He’s very mobile and agile and moves his feet well on defence.   He’s 6-8 220 pounds at 18 years old. That’s literally the only reason he’ll be a high draft pick.   Imo, he can develop to be OG Anunoby, or even Jaylen Brown"
"I’m British - I guess Luol Deng for best NBA player listed as British? Joe Ingles and Steve Nash are both British citizens so they kind of count, and there’s a few other honourable mentions like Ben Gordon, OG Anunoby, John Amaechi and Michael Olowokandi."
OG Anunoby. Pretty sure he's the only Brit in the League.  Luol Deng and Ben Gordon I think are the only others we've had in years
OG Anunoby getting poked in the eye and missing a single game against the Clippers
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
You do realize 9 of their players are now starters across the league and they were missing OG Anunoby the whole playoff run
"I think Kuminga is way better.  Kuminga is an all around small forward. He’s shown very promising shot creation and ball handling ability, he’s miles ahead of Barnes in that regard. He’s not very efficient yet but he’s capable, he just needs reps. He’s like a more coordinated OG Anunoby.  Barnes is a complete non threat scoring wise at the NBA level right now. The tools are there but he’s years away, and he may never be more than a serviceable 3pt shooter at best. I’m not sure he gets away with playing Pg at the next level because of that. He’s going to make his mark as a energy guy and a stopper, maybe as a modern day small ball Joakim Noah. I don’t like the draymond comp, he’s a different caliber of athlete and not quite as high IQ as Draymond.  Im taking Kuminga all day"

I hate to say it bud but your team paid the max for a better passing but non shooting OG Anunoby"

"Am I sure about what? I mean it’s no secret that the Clippers tried to become Toronto 2.0…as for that ‘19 Raps team I think you’re just underestimating how good they were. It had two 3x all defensive first team players in Kawhi/Ibaka, a former defensive player of the year in Gasol, 3&amp;D legend Danny Green, undrafted gem in FVV, 6x all star and floor general Lowry + Siakam, Powell, Boucher and three peat legend Pat McCaw, it’s a shame OG Anunoby was injured. But overall it was an incredibly deep and well rounded team."
"Lol, but why keep picks when you do stuff like pick Dennis Smith Jr when Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, John Collins and OG Anunoby are all still on the board?"
Lowry + OG anunoby.. im taking it
I'm less cranky about the Pacers letting McMillan move on than I am about them leaving John Collins on the board to [draft TJ Leaf](https://www.indycornrows.com/2020/11/24/21612580/what-lessons-can-the-pacers-learn-from-t-j-leaf-nba).   (And don't even mention OG Anunoby where Pacers fans gather.)
I'm just glad they applied the same logic for not drafting OG Anunoby. Could you imagine where we would be without our scarf and cheesecake enthusiast?

you don't see a better offer than OG ANUNOBY and picks???
A poor man's OG Anunoby
I was thinking maybe a team could trade for him and make him a center on offense but if he can’t dunk over a 120 lb man he’s hopeless.  I never thought I would take OG Anunoby over Ben Simmons but here we are.
"The Raptors used small ball this season due to aroma baynes being subpar. Wity the addition of Gillespie and birch, I'm not sure if they will continue it or not. They used it when they beat the bucks in the regular season.

No OG Anunoby?
what was the time on the clock last year for Toronto vs Miami when OG Anunoby made that insane 3pt from a Lowry pass. It was an insane amount of time too I recalled
OG Anunoby
Write up the OG Anunoby Celtics play for Giannis Bud.
"I agree, a lot is made of Gobert's defense but the real problem is on the other end where he can't punish teams for going small against him.  If he had any post moves/better touch around the rim/better passing chops that would change things a lot.  I think Utah needs more versatility in general, not just at the 5.  Some different pieces that allow them to be more multiple, and especially a more reliable wing than Royce O'Neale would be really key (preferably a wing with more size, it's not realistic but think about how well OG Anunoby would fit in there).  Anything that allows them to be better at the point of attack (hard to do when neither Conley or Mitchell are healthy, both Clarkson &amp; Ingles have their limitations) would help a lot.  The Clippers punished the Jazz by kicking to the perimeter, but that's only possible because they were able to get into the lane at will."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."

"I know OG Anunoby is hard to spell, but jeez this guy butchered it."
Terrance Mann got that OG Anunoby energy
"He really doesn’t imo. Very slow, doesn’t have the defensive awareness and instincts that comes with being an nba 5. I swear i feel like im going crazy with how people are looking st brown , he had some big games here and there but was awful for the majority of the season. Maybe it’s just Celtics fans trying to rationalize it, or that the only game they watched of him was his best game of his career. Stevens in the doc rivers school of signing every role player that went off against his team. I rather bank on the chance of drafting an og anunoby, gobert, or something than ending up with Moses brown who can’t sniff a playoff rotation"
"I’m biased but OG Anunoby when he’s healthy is special to watch, always locked in. Also just on the topic of defence a Jack Armstrong “get that garbage outta here” is always a good time on a block."
Ben Simmons is OG Anunoby without the scoring ability.
OG Anunoby  Maybe a little bit of bias
OG Anunoby will emerge as the most valuable asset on the Raptors as he averages 20-6-3 on roughly 50/40/80 shooting and makes an all-defense team.
OG Anunoby
I don’t see why that’s true. OG in 2019 is a better defender than Donte. He’s good for sure but he doesn’t have the size to be as versatile as OG. Anunoby can defend guards as good as Divincenzo (probably better) while also having the size to defend 3’s and 4’s effectively

"1) i purposely left out klay because this post doesn't include all-star players. I can respect Robert Covington, OG anunoby, Mikal Bridges pick. But i believe with the 3&amp;D status, he is up there.  2) I mentioned in the next few years, he could be an all-defensive player. Pels terrible defensive rating is because as a whole, the team doesn't have good defensive players; Zion and BI are not good defensively.   3) i'm not sure about this. I'm not qualified to evaluate half court offense.  4) i believe he can be an all-star, not necessarily next season or the season after that. The point being, he is only 23 and has a lot of room for improvement. His reworked shot mechanics has proven that he has a great work ethic and works hard to develop his game. So it is not unplausible that he can become an all-star caliber player"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"Joe Harris, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, and DeAndre hunter too"
"Yeah that's why I think they try to get an early deal, same way Toronto did with OG Anunoby. He probably gets more I guess. Probably 4/90."
"Yeah, I got you. Maybe that’s what’s getting me. Raptors draft these guys and fans say they’re always the next Kawhi. OG Anunoby was/is supposed to be the next Kawhi. Scottie Barnes is supposed to be the next Kawhi. It seems like a cop out to suggest any NBA prospect with length and an unpolished offensive game is going to be Kawhi Leonard.  Before the draft analysts suggested if all went well for Kuminga he could have a game similar to Jaylen Brown and if they don’t go super well, Al Farouq Aminu. That tracks for me. Nothing in his game says Kawhi Leonard and no one was making that comparison until GSW drafted him."
OG Anunoby ! Love this guy...his time will come.
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous.

"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."

"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
Lmao easily 80% of the league can do that dunk if they want to. They don't do it because it's a super try hard thing to do. Watch Tayshaun Prince or OG Anunoby dunks in the rookie challenge. They all can do it. It's super easy for them but there is no point in trying.
"Scottie has a 7’4 wingspan actually. during an open gym (raptors behind the scenes show) episode we saw the raptors measure his wingspan at 7’4 when Scottie came in for a pre draft workout.  I know most players defend like that in switches, so i can see him defending PG’s in a pinch. But he’s not fast enough to stay in front of them, as of now. Even with space they were blowing by him in summer league. Maybe he works on it, but even if not I don’t see him being that 1 on 1 shutdown defender like ben Simmons or OG anunoby just due to that lesser lateral quickness. At least against PG’s, against 2-4 Scottie absolutley can be a 1 on 1 defender vs them.  I just see him being more impactful as an off ball help defender with his length in the passing lanes, height, and constant taking/communication. But that’s just my opinon"
"At the same time though, Scottie isn’t laterally quick enough to guard nba PG’s like he could in college. As a raptors fan that’s something that stuck out to me in Sumer league. Quick guards were just blowing right past him. He doesn’t have the lateral quickness of someone like OG anunoby or ben Simmons.   He’s still a versatile on ball defender, but I see him more as a 2-4 defender ( and maybe 5’s in the future) then a true 1-5. And honestly, I see him more as a draymond type defensively due to his constant communication/talking.   I would agree he doesn’t have the rim protection of draymond yet, but I just don’t think he’s laterally quick enough to be a ben Simmons type 1 on 1 on ball defender against guards."
"When IT was still with the Cavs, OG Anunoby blocked like 3 of his jumpers in a single quarter. It was like watching someone play against their baby brother. I'd never seen a guy in the NBA get dominated like that."

"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
"People act like the raptors have been a year in, year out, top class defensive team. But people don't remember that during the DeRozan/Casey years, we were an absolute sieve on that end of the floor. Then, in one single season:  * Kawhi came over by trade * We traded away a defensive liability in DeRozan * Siakam developed into an all-star level two way threat * OG Anunoby developed into a two way threat (although he missed the playoffs) * Nick Nurse, who is a great defensive coach, became HC * FVV came into his own just in time for the finals  After Kawhi left, we've been a top defensive team in the league, but it really changed incredibly fast"
"We were severely undersized against them too. This is the one series that OG Anunoby was sorely missed cause the drop off in production after our top 5/6 guys was crazy. Freddy was unplayable. Same with Norm. This series was all about our starters, most notably Kawhi (duh)"
"OG Anunoby, 3 points in 00.5  Two zeros for dramatic effect"
"OG Anunoby!!!! I feel like most raps fans rate him high but mb not other fans, OG has a super high ceiling and I expect him to make a big jump in the coming seasons. Monster on defence already"

Do you have Hunter’s numbers before injury? I doubt they were much higher than OG’s full season numbers. IIRC he was at 17 ppg prior to getting hurt.   The difference defensively is a good amount imo. OG is arguably the most versatile defender in the league.  https://ca.nba.com/news/one-play-good-luck-scoring-on-toronto-raptors-forward-og-anunoby-in-isolation/m2nkr8gpre7911dumbgtnqx12

"Igoudala played, he hit a game winner on us actually. Cousins also played. Looney? Can't believe you seriously just said raptors won bc fucking Looney went down. Curry was also not injured tf? Kyle Lowry was more injured than curry. When Thompson was on the court we won majority of the quarters we played, you forget we were up in the serious when Thompson went down?  KD would've probably changed the game though. We won bc KD went down, without KD we beat that GS squad.  Also OG anunoby was injured for us, who's possibly best iso defender in the league, so absolutely we had good chances of winning it again next year."
"Don't think OP said there was an asterisk. ""Lucky"" is definitely a loaded term that I don't necessarily agree with being used but at least it's not as bad as crying asterisk. I do agree with their point of it resulting in the players themselves becoming overrated as a result of the championship though, like OG Anunoby is a great, premier 3&amp;D guy, which is very hard to come by, but some OG fans will argue he'll be an All Star."
"He hasn’t had a chance to draft very high before this year.   Andrea Bargnani started 25 games and averaged 12 points. He traded him for Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, Quentin Richardson, a first-round pick, two second-round picks.   He traded Greivis Vásquez for Norm Powell and a pick that became OG Anunoby. Vásquez played 26 more games before washing out of the league   Even ignoring the Kawhi trade which was huge, he’s made some excellent moves"
I would put OG Anunoby instead of Lonzo for 6th man
"Warriors revamped their whole development staff. They added Dejan Milojevic who used to coach Jokic and develop him. He’ll help develop Wiseman’s foot work and court awareness for sure. They also signed Jama Mahlalela who was the assistant coach for the Toronto raptors and the raptors are known for having the best development staff in the league. Players like OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam are products of that. This will benefit both kuminga and moody but especially kuminga seeing the previous results. They also signed Kenny Atkinson who is known for being one of the best development coaches in the league. When he was the head coach for the nets he made them have a break out year and developed players like levert, Allen, and DLO. Also, the warriors had developed a lot of good players, it’s just bc they were in a dynasty for a while that they couldn’t use them. For example, both kendrick nunn and Chris Boucher developed under the warriors. Some examples on the current warriors include JTA and Jordan Poole. But they didn’t really have much to work with. Wiseman was their first lottery pick in years and you can’t really develop him much when there’s no summer league or training camp. But the fact is that they finally got good rookies and It’s a whole new coaching staff"
"Over their careers? Ofc lol, OG is a billion times better offensively now than he was when he came into the league.   Last year, Anunoby put up 15.9ppg on 48/40/78."
&gt;OG Anunoby 2.0  Is this supposed to be bad?
"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"

Raptors are usually the go to international team. Plus we have the best British basketball player in Og Anunoby. Really fun org to watch develop and great BTS footage.
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
Draft OG Anunoby and John Collins instead of Zach Collins.    Draft Giannis instead of CJ.
"London, but idk how many British basketball players who have played in the NBA are from London, which ones were actually born and not raised here, also we have like no Point Guards in NBA history so… I tried      Luol Deng (PF)  Steve Hucknall (SG)  Pops Mensah-Bonsu (C)  OG Anunoby (SF)  Steve Nash (fuck it he holds British citizenship as well let us have this one) PG)"
"[Bubble Anunoby ](https://youtu.be/yVRpegiMCqg) Watch if you have some time, its pretty good.  [Just one short highlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mzdpm0/highlight_og_anunoby_puts_up_a_defensive_clinic/)  Theres so much more, honestly he has been great to watch this past season and next season looks great for more OG to watch.  Raptors got him on a good contract too and his offense has been steadily improving as well."
You got OG Anunoby and….that’s it
"The Raps would have won the bubble if Kawhi stayed. Remember, the 2019 Raps only played like 20 games together before going on the playoff run. They were actually figuring things out on the fly in the playoffs. One championship under their belt, coming back with OG Anunoby and a full season, they would have been the favourites to repeat for sure since KD and Klay were out for the whole year. 2019 Raps had the 2nd best defence of all-time in the playoffs after the 08 Pistons who beat the Kobe/Shaq Lakers. Lakers won 2020 fair and square, but the Raps with Kawhi would have beat them."
"After some development we can throw Precious in there too, he has huge defensive upside  Lmao, here’s a potential future lineup  Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa."
Y’all definitely coulda repeated if he stayed. With another year of growth plus players like OG Anunoby and Boucher who had no impact on y’all title run actually becoming rotation pieces I think it’s a pretty good bet that team coulda beat the bubble Lakers
"Scottie Barnes and OG Anunoby. Whelp, that's one frontcourt defense nobody would like to play against."
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
2021/22 is all OG Anunoby
OG Anunoby. He's gotten better every season he's been in the league.

"Raptors GM Bobby Webster had a press conference yesterday to clarify that ""the goal isn't to tear it down to the studs and 'trust the process,' rather Toronto wants to build around its core of Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam""  I'm sure they will listen to the Kings but they are not looking to rebuild and will not trade Siakam at a discount.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/toronto-raptors-bobby-webster-build-around-young-core"
OG Anunoby the best 3&amp;D role player in the league.
OG anunoby breakout szn incoming
"We have drafted extremely well. A lot of our picks haven’t been lottery picks, but those that were we have hit on a lot of the time. We’ve drafted Chris Bosh, Vince Carter (sorta), Tracy McGrady, Damon Stoudamire, DeMar DeRozan, and with picks in the late 20’s have drafted OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam. Not to mentioned we signed FVV as an UDFA. From 1995-2019, we have made 8 very, very good selections through the draft. That’s one every three years.  We’ve literally been a playoff team for the past 8ish years. That’s a third of this team’s existence. I don’t call that underperforming."
My guess is OG Anunoby
Use all 3 players to trade for OG Anunoby and a 2026 2nd round pick.

"Favorite Raptor would OG Anunoby/Fred VanVleet  Favorite player in general would be Kawhi/Luka  As you can tell, I'm awful at picking one favourite."
I would give him a contract similar to what OG Anunoby has
"28 games is a great sample size to start for now imho, and his game would keep up easily  When he came back he obviously wasn't 100 percent as he didn't end up playing in the next series. He also did not get the injury back in the knicks series so obviously that meant he wasn't 100 percent so that statement is false  Mikal averaged 13, great efficency, and great defense OG averaged 16, great efficiency and great defense Hunter averaged 16, great efficiency and great defense  The reason Mikal gets praised is simply because of the finals run, had Lakers not been injured with AD, Suns COULD'VE LOST  I didn't count them out yet Same for the Nuggets series but, idk why i just think they couldn't have gotten past the first or second round if both teams were healthy, none the less, Bridges is just known better here because of the finals run from the Suns  OG played great but team was just discombobulated  or just terrible, and record shows why  Now right now, do you think Bridges and Anunoby could be a number 2. I dont watch there games at all so I have no say in that  But as a Hawks fan, in those 28 games where Hunter played. Bogy, Gallo, Rondo, Dunn were out of those times. He provided all four of those combined out there, at times he looked like the number 2 with Trae there. If not he was the number 2, record did show other wise, mainly because of coach el pee  But if you say that's not a good sample size, imho in this argument, 28 games is good imho, and it should be used. You really think Hunter wouldn't have kept that up? Eh maybe his averages dip to 14-15 but thats still good  Regarding the spacing thing, yes he only shot 33 from three (32.6 is 33) whilst all Anunoby and Bridges shot over 40  It is terrible, but as I said prior, Hunter was the only known shooting threat the Hawks had at that time. Collins shot 40 percent but isn't known as a spot up shooter, Reddish is terrible from three. Huerter was in a terrible slump early on, heck even Trae was terrible from three.  On the 5 game sample in the playoffs, he was huge from three in 37 percent, during his rookie year he evan shot 36 percent He was only getting better and better but injuries kicked in for both him and our squad, that he was the only known shooter. So he had to jack up some shots. Him and Trae to say the least  TL;DR: No-lifer Hawks fan trying his best to support Hunter At least I am honest to myself"
"Maybe it's because of bias that I think Hunter is better than Anunoby  I'd even go crazy to say that Hunter's better than Mikal, it's just mikal is the better fit for the Suns team, and well, they also made the finals so recency bias  Both Hunter and OG played one round/no rounds in the playoffs as well"
Ideally they'd get him on an extension like OG Anunoby got but more likely they'll get him on a 4/90 or something deal.
"Ben Simmons, OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Khem Birch"
"Yeah straight up if Ben was a free agent right now and someone gave him that contract they’d be clowned for it. It’s not that Ben is shit, but as a max player his contribution is kind of shit. Give him OG anunoby money and he’d be one of the more desireable assets in the league even with his short comings"
My first thought was OG Anunoby from 2020 but i forgot how well he improved last season lol
"&gt;Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  This was hilarious when it could be argued that a Simmons for Lowry and a middling player is an even trade."

"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
"DeMar (4-time consecutive all-star if I recall correctly), Jakob (young promising prospect), and a late first round pick was considered a slight underpay for one year of Kawhi Leonard.  Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  Morey set his asking price too high, and the rest of the NBA moved on without pursuing Simmons."
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
Example answer:  PG: Patrick Beverly (6th on Wolves)  SG: Buddy Hield (4th on Kings)   SF: OG Anunoby (3rd on Raptors)  PF: Jonathan Isaac (2nd for Magic)  C: Nikola Jokic (1st on Nuggets)  6TH: Eric Gordon (5th on Rockets)   Bench: Lauri Markennen (7th on Cavs)   Xth/nd would be there rank on there respective team. The player doesn’t have to be that exact number like Kyrie is the bird best player on the nets but you could take him as your first best.

For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
using all defence teams as a metric to judge defence is so bad tho. How about og anunoby? By your logic he’s an exaggerated defender
"&gt; Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type.   Except those guys were all high regarded high school and college players and Alex got on low D1 college offer.  Body type is something, but having high level skill and effort is another."
"""Raptors got their man"" jokes aside, Alex Antetokounmpo is a 6'8"" small forward with a 7'2"" wingspan. Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type. We really are going all out on position-less basketball at this point aren't we?"
I feel like OG Anunoby is twice as good as Thybulle and he’s still only making $17m or $18m a year.
Marcus Smart - 17 mil annually  OG Anunoby - 17 mil annually   I’m sure there are other examples but those are premium defenders who are more productive offensively than Gordon as well. This contract is always going to be an overpay.
 OG Anunoby
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
"He’s clear cut better than AG. Not sure what the argument is for Gordon over OG. Anunoby is better defender, better shooter, more efficient overall."
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
AG was a huge overpay. Compare it to OG Anunoby who’s a better defender and shooter (basically what they’re paying AG for) and Anunoby is only making 17 mil annually compared to AG’s 22-23. His agent is amazing because he isn’t worth close to that.
"You currently have the most underrated player in the NBA, at least by fans.  I saw someone say they wouldn’t trade OG Anunoby for Simmons straight up 💀"
OG Anunoby &gt; Ben Simmons
OG Anunoby is my pick
"Not that it means anything, but if you cross reference the Athletic top 125 with players listed in this thread the order would come out to: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby. Also, havent seen him mentioned yet, but Joe Ingles could be in the mix as well."
OG Anunoby
1.Mikal Bridges   2. OG Anunoby   3 Marcus Smart   4. Robert Covington   5. PJ Tucker
I’ll always remember Greivis Vásquez for being the centerpiece to one of Masai’s best trades ever.   Vásquez to the Milwaukee Bucks for Norm Powell and the pick used on OG Anunoby.   He went on to play 26 games off the bench before washing out of the league
He’s already at OG Anunoby level rn
See under [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_players_born_outside_the_United_States). I count 12 -- only OG Anunoby is active in the NBA at present.
"Best British player definitely was Luol Deng who retired a couple of years ago, was actually an all-star for two years. OG Anunoby was born in England, and though he didn't live here long I'm pretty sure a lot of his family are British and it seems to be something he cares about."

Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"Yup, they give you video clips of literally every shot, rebound, assist, steal, block, etc etc of Siakams career and it’s super easy to look up. I’d routinely watch things like “every OG Anunoby turnaround jumper in the 2020-21 season” or “every Chris Boucher blocked 3”"
"I dont think they are in purgatory but their timeline is kind of weird. The young players they have that are 24 years old or younger are OG Anunoby,Gary Trent Jr,Scottie Barnes,Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn, OG and Gary are already starting level players,Scottie is a project who has star potential and both Flynn and Precious looked good in summer league and could develop well. Imo thats a fringe top 10 young core  Its just that on top of those guys they also have a bunch of win now players who dont really have time to develop like Siakam,Fred,Boucher,Dragic and Birch who would rather win now"

"It's annoying when people like you ask very dumb and obvious questions and expect others to do the legwork for you to give you an answer. But what the heck-  Last season, Ben Simmons came in second in DPOY voting with 287 points.  OG Anunoby did not place with zero points.  Ben Simmons was 1st team All-Defense, tying for the most points with 200.  OG Anunoby did not make the 1st or second team for All-Defense, finishing with a total of 3 points.  Now, as you said, you can say there's a little bit of favoritism with the media since Ben Simmons plays in a bigger market....... except that's not true at all and Toronto's market is bigger than Philly's.  So feel free to carve out whatever take makes some sort of mental gymnastics to argue OG is better than Simmons on defense, I'm sure all the Raptors fans ITT will continue to reinforce the circlejerk instead of the facts as they have been elsewhere."
"&gt;I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto  Guess you forgot that Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanvleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher ever existed."
"Explain to me how it’s rushing a rebuild when these teams would’ve been adding a high ceiling 24 year old player who fits their timelines, has only gotten better, plays THE most position and role in the league? On top of that all these teams are in good Cap situations to the point where a contract like that wouldn’t have hurt them short term or long   Spurs, Grizzlies, and OKC are not going to rush their rebuilds with a max offer to a role-player. NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than I am not arguing with casuals...  &gt;NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than a role-player making a max.   Yes, because these teams sure did have amazing offseasons right? Both these teams missed out on every target they went after outside of Dallas retaining Tim Hardaway Jr for 72mill. If OG Anunoby had went into free agency it would’ve been no different than what happened when Jerami Grant went into free agency last year, and OG literally had a better year this season than the one Jerami did his last year in Denver on top of the fact he’s also 2 years younger. And I GUARANTEE you if any of these teams had the chance to pay grant what he’s making to have them on their team they WOULD. The same exact thing goes for OG.   &gt;I am not arguing with casuals...  So I’m a casual for having a strong opinion and defending it, but you aren’t despite the fact that you’ve done nothing but reply to me half ass comments, throw insults, and essentially have no rebuttal besides saying “no he would’ve have”???   You’re really projecting here bud."
How well do you guys think OG Anunoby will fare in the long run? He was one of those raw wing players with potential.
"MVP: James Harden, Nets will steamroll the NBA and Harden's stats will look better than KD's  DPOY: Joel Embiid, with Simmons gone and the Sixers will still have a great defense, but with one less person to split the votes  MIP: OG Anunoby, idk, i saw someone else say him and it sounded good  ROY: Cade Cunningham, i think there will be a lot of candidates, but there's like only one other offensive option on the Pistons  6MOY: Dennis Schroder, dude will be on a mission to get paid and the C's will rely on him A LOT. I think he will be incredibly productive coming off the bench with Horford in the PnR/PnP"

"I mean, pretty much every player that comes into the NBA needs to improve their jumpshot. Kawhi, and to a lesser extent OG Anunoby, just made it more acceptable for elite defensive prospects to be bad at shooting."
OG Anunoby is a DPOY-level guy who can guard 1-5 and averaged 15ppg on great efficiency last year. How is he so low?
"Nance was fine playing alongside Love (PF) and Allen (C).   Situationally, Harris has defended Fs while Simmons has taken on tougher PFs like Siakam, Giannis and Zion. You've had him on guys like Jaylen Brown, Og Anunoby and Kris Middleton."
"Having Facu Campazzo, Monte Morris, and Austin Rivers as the first line of defense and Jokic as the second line is not going to go far in the playoffs. With Jokic, we really need to surround him with talented defenders to stay afloat against the best. Obviously, he is a powerhouse on offense who gets the team there in the first place. The Nuggets really need a Jrue Holiday and OG Anunoby type at guard, if they want to survive a CP3 pnr."
"The last time they approached the Raptors they were asking for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft.   Which is just absurd. Even a FFV, OG, Barnes trade would be too much for Simmons.  Your idea probably would be a win/win for both sides, but unless the 76ers come to earth a trade ain’t going to happen."
OG Anunoby
"For me, no one on the Raptors is 100% untouchable.  The closest to that is OG Anunoby.  And that's only because of his term controlled $18 mil cap hit."

"Daryl Morey will now only ask for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and 2 first round picks (E: autocorrect)"

"Almost every player in that range has had an All Star appearance or looks like a future All Star (i.e. Murray, Fox).  Wiggins is more suited in that 16M-20M range imo, with guys like Jerami Grant, Caris Levert, OG Anunoby, etc."

"The thing I think people are overlooking is if he was making OG Anunoby money I don't think the sixers are trading him. He's in the same position as draymond Green, but taking up a far larger chunk of the salary makes it a problem.   It's brutal for sixers fans but what Jimmy butler is... Is exactly what you'd want with the money you're paying Simmons. Someone that's 80-90% of what Simmons is on the defensive end + great facilitator and can run your offence in the playoffs. Rather than Simmons who becomes a dunking (or non dunking) traditional 4 every playoffs."
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
If Ben was making OG Anunoby money every team in the league would have been ringing up the Sixers to try and get a deal done. As is nobody should be excited to pay the max for a point guard who only has some of the skills necessary to play the position.
Raptors might be interesting. Fun young core while still being competitive. Plus our head coach Nick Nurse used to coach in the UK. I believe OG Anunoby on our team is from the UK as well

"Its clear that Morey values Simmons more than 3 high level starters, look at the trade proposals that have been leaked  &gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft, and two future first-round picks.  &gt;Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick.  Both of these should indicate the trade value Morey's ranks Simmons.   &gt;The Knicks could have traded Randle, RJ, Mitch and 4 FRPs to the Rockets  If the Knicks were offered that then they would be dumb to pass that up. Harden is perennial MVP candidate and future HOFer in his prime even with the possibility that he would get upset any team would trade for Harden because he changes your team to a contender with just him on the roster.   Harden is not comparable because Simmons is clearly not the level of player he is, and his trade (and outcome of trade) should not be seen as a comparable situation given how the context of the two teams are so different."

"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That’s not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
"Two things I want to ask:  1. Progression. How is progression in the game? Is it linear, similar to 2k or is it based on playtime and training like FM? (If it’s like FM, a G-League system (not actually to simulate but to help with progression) could be cool.  2. How often/easy are the rosters updated? Do you do it every year or edit it throughout like 2k. E.g if OG Anunoby, who is 58 right now, plays really well irl will a new save have him higher in 2 months."
"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."

"OG Anunoby is going to eat the entire leagues ass this season mark my words, deep booty hole licking."
"I think people will look back at the 2019 raptors once it's all said and done and realize how much talent we had.   Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi, Pascal, and Gasol was an amazing starting line up but Danny and Gasol were older and Pascal is still developing to this day.  Ibaka was an amazing bench big for us and was imo in his prime that year.  Fred vanvleet and Norman powell were on small contracts and have both shown improvements in the past 2 years, Norm especially looked amazing last year.  Og Anunoby didn't even play in the playoffs. He's still developing and has a high ceiling.  Chris Boucher went from playing garbage time to seeking a big contract next off season.  Jeremy Lin, and Jodie Meeks had their time in the sun at one point. Patrick McCaw was decent but injury prone.  If you combine each players peak salary year once they've all retired it will be a very high figure."

"You post all the time in the Raptors sub referring to the team as ""we.""  You have two comments ever in the Mavs sub, one of which is saying ""Mavs need OG Anunoby."""
"But is he the best? No. Becuase being a hooper doesn't mean you are better at the actual sport of basketball than someone who isn't a ""hooper"". Meanwhile non hooper Giannis is without a doubt better than Kyrie. Melo is a hoopers hooper, and even at the peak of his powers he was not ever in that upper echelon tier of NBA athletes. Being a hooper doesn't matter when it comes to the NBA, this ain't an LA Fitness run.  OG Anunoby averaged more PPG than Miles Bridges last season with similar offensive responsibility and role including a ramp up in the second half of the season. And you do realize that just like OG, Miles Bridges also primarily played off ball as a spot up shooter, cutting off of primary action and secondary play action? Just like OG. And that it wasn't until the second half of the season that Bridges got a bump in offensive responsibility as a ball handler, which OG also got. Bridges isn't a do it all wing (yet) as he can't do it all. He still shows clear struggles passing on the move especially going to the left and showcases tunnel vision missing clear kickout opportunities on the drive and in the mid post. He also is at best a decent defender who has shown struggles staying off a ball handlers hip which he should be able to with his athleticism and getting around screens which I think has to do with his centre of gravity being kept so low with his wide base, which also partly explains the getting stuck on the hip thing.  You can't build around Miles Bridges until he shows that these **three** games will be his standard going forward. We'll see, but saying OG is a 3nD wing when Miles Bridges was literally a 3nD wing last season as well is saying a lot about your eye test and how good it is."
OG Anunoby takes offence to this claim
"Bridges is a baller, but if OG doesn't often put up big numbers then it's not looking good for Bridges as their season averages OG put up ""bigger"" numbers. 15.9/5.5/2.2/1.5/0.7 on 48/39.8/78.4 with 60.5%TS vs 12.7/6.0/2.2/0.7/0.8 on 50.3/40.0/86.7 with 62.5%TS. And even if you look at the second half of the season where Miles took a big step forward, so did OG. In their last 20 games played, OG was at 18.3/5.3/2.8/1.5/0.8 on 48/40.1/81.6 with 60.3%TS and Miles at 19.8/6.8/2.8/0.8/1.0 on 51.1/43.5/83.9 with 64.4%TS.  The gap offensively especially in terms of that efficiency in that 20 games to close out the season is not bigger than the gap on defense, where OG is one of the best wing defenders and a legit 1-5 defender while Miles is not a slouch but he ain't that guy on D. Being better at ball &gt; being a baller.  And what other team would have a 24 year old 6'7 232lb 7'3 wingspan wing who can and does guard 1-5, elite in isolation, elite as a help defender, literally the most versatile defender in the league two years running + the most versatile defender in the past 10 seasons according to Defensive Versatility, on top of being a 40% shooter from three on volume and put up 16PPG last season + 18PPG towards the end of the season and not value them highly? Every team wishes they had an OG Anunoby even if he never progresses beyond last seasons form. If Masai wouldn't even entertain putting him in the Kawhi trade, then that says a lot."

Jaylen Brown shooting slump go brrr  OG Anunoby shooting slump go BRRRRRRR
We also passed on OG Anunoby not that I have that draft and everyone who was successful taken after Leaf memorized or anything. Lol
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they’re rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
"This person really hates OG Anunoby and the raptors fan base for some reason. I hope this person could figure out his/her life, and stop with all this hate."
I find it so funny that OG Anunoby now has his own haters on reddit lmao
"MIAMI — For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry’s face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      “I knew I was good,” Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. “I knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.”      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee’s tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      “We all were mutually agreed that it was time,” Lowry said of leaving Toronto. “It’s hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      His journey in Toronto started with questions — he was the team’s backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash — crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      “The city of Tampa was great,” Lowry said. “It was just difficult because we didn’t know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.”      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team’s dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team’s president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      “Sometimes franchises have to do what’s best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn’t say power — but I had a little bit of, ‘Listen, it’s not going to be a good look if we don’t collaborate on this together,’” Lowry said. “We all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      “With DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.”      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. “It’s been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,” Ujiri said at a news conference in August. “We knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.”      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      “I’ve never been super athletic,” Lowry said with a laugh. “I can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I’m not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don’t need to be jumping.”      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry’s sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry’s primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan — “Smooth,” Lowry said of DeRozan. “That’s my best friend.”      And of Leonard: “A machine,” Lowry said. “He gets it done.”      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game’s quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      “I partly think it’s to get him going, because he’s got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,” Lowry said, adding that “some people can’t take it” and think Butler’s a jerk.      “Nah, it’s just how he is,” Lowry said. “Everybody has different demands on themselves.”      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      “He’s always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,” Butler said. “It’s incredible. It’s a blessing, and sometimes it’s a curse because you’ve got to be in some really great shape if you’re out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.”      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      “Freddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I’m the guy who was like, ‘Yo, it’s on me,’” he said, adding: “They have to take the criticism, and that’s what’s going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.”"
"Considering how much we hear about OG Anunoby just for doing what RJ did as a 20 year old as a 24 year old, I think we're all okay with the media nonsense as long as it's our team."

I think a lot of players are OG anunoby stoppers
"You know, its nice that the delusional raptors fans who thought theyd be any good cause OG Anunoby would become an all-star are getting their wake up call now, so I don't have to hear their shit for the rest of the season"
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"
"He is literally an elite defender, one of the best wing defenders in the league and legit guards 1-5 as shown by his Defensive Versatility Rating being 92.4 which is the second highest since 2013-14 with the highest being Rondae Hollis Jefferson at 94.2 during his only season as a Raptor. OG Anunoby this past season spent 18.8% of his minutes guarding PGs, 17.5% guarding shooting guards, 19.4% guarding small forwards, 26.3% guarding power forwards and 18.0% guarding centres. He also did the same the season prior, with him guarding the 5 positions at 16%, 24%, 24%, 22% and 13% leading the league in Versatility stat by Krishna Narsu. That came with OG being 94th percentile in isolation defense as well, which made him the 14th best defender in isolation one spot behind Kawhi Leonard which makes him elite. We got non-Raptors media guys from Zach Lowe to Kevin O'Conner to multiple SI writers to the Dunc'd On crew having argued that he is probably the best wing defender in the league. So this OG ain't elite at anything is just bogus.  He is also an elite at catch and shoot jumpers, being one of fifteen players in the league to attempt atleast 5.0 catch and shoot threes while making over 40%. Within those fifteen players, he is 6th in 3P% at 42.4%.  So how is he not elite at anything, when man is an elite wing defender who legit guards every position and is an elite at catch and shoot threes and has shown flashes of expanding his game into posting up other wings, facing up in the mid block, coming off pin downs, pick and roll off the wing or into the corner and breaking his man down into stepbacks as he has flashes this preseason and post all Star break last year. If that ain't intriguing to you, then who do you actually find intriguing?"
1. Romeo Langford.  2. Aaron Nesmith.  3. Robert Williams.  4. Jordan Poole.  5. Terrence Mann.  6. Jordan Nwora.  7. Isaiah Joe.  8. Mikal Bridges.  9. OG Anunoby.  10. Tyrese Haliburton.

OG Anunoby winning most improved player
"Over the last 20 seasons, just 8 players have averaged at least 14 points, 5 rebounds and 2 steals while shooting 40+% from 3 through their first 16 games.  They are: Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Paul George, Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and… OG Anunoby"

Feels like it's cheating to put OG Anunoby in. He averaged 16 points on high efficiency last season; you can't put already established good starters on an all-preseason team.
Currently the most versatile defender in the league is OG Anunoby.  &amp;#x200B;  This is shown in the stats.  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah he could guard 1-5.
OG Anunoby
OG Anunoby
Our starting PG called OG the #1 option (at least while Siakam is out).  https://raptorsrapture.com/2021/10/10/raptors-fred-vanvleet-og-anunoby-top-offensive-option/
"Yeah, but if you look at the numbers their Age 23 seasons were comparable. ""31.8MPG, 16.5/7.2/2.5/2.3/0.8 on 12.8FGA+3.03PA+3.9FTA on 47.9/34.9/80.2 56.7%TS"" vs ""33.3MPG, 15.9/5.5/2.2/1.5/0.7 on 12.1FGA+6.13PA+2.4FTA on 48.0/39.8/78.4 60.5%"". Pretty comparable for two players who at that point in their careers played a similar role on their respective teams that season.  Kawhi having a Finals MVP is in part due to that Spurs team not having as clearly defined a best player as many other championship teams kinda in a similar vein to the 04 Pistons which has it as Billups or Big Ben (I personally lean Ben Wallace). The actual best player on that Spurs team was being primarily debated between Duncan and Parker, not Kawhi. Kawhi got that FMVP primarily for being the main defender on LeBron similarly to Iggy getting FMVP for defending LeBron over Steph.  And, DPOY and also All Defense are highly narrative-driven awards unfortunately as the defensive end has far less reputable advanced and tracking stats than the offensive end. I'd like to point to Zach Lowe who didn't vote for OG on All Defense in for the 2019-2020 season even though he had actually said on his podcast that OG Anunoby is the best wing defender in the league, with the reason being he feels its a year early to vote for OG and that the Raptors had too many good defenders to vote for just one (FVV, Lowry, Siakam) even though we were the second best defensive team in the league behind just the Bucks. Meanwhile the very next season he voted three Sixers in Simmons, Embiid and even 20MPG Thybulle and then blamed OG ""best wing defender in the league"" Anunoby not getting a vote on ""an 'unfair' casualty of Toronto's strange season"". This sort of reasoning has been said by other voters as well. Or Kawhi getting onto all-defence over Siakam or Gasol based on reputation even though Kawhi was clearly taking it easy on defense through the regular season with the Raptors and he was a less impactful defender than Siakam, Gasol and OG who played what was the Thybulle role during the regular season. Now this ain't to cry about Raptors players not getting what they should be owed when it comes to award time, but to point out that not having a DPOY does not mean that OG is not on that level as even voters who have not voted for him in DPOY or All Defense have to make excuses for leaving him off that go beyond his actual ability on that end. OG is absolutely one of the best if not best defenders at the wing in the league, even if he does not have a DPOY or All Defensive team to his name."
"OG is a great player, and *absolutely* the most overrated player in the league.  Like Bill Simmons recently said:  It's the official start of the season when Zach (Lowe) says ""Anunoby, this is the year"".  But most players on the Raptors are a bit overrated."
"OG Anunoby ftw! Let’s go, Raptors!"
I think OG Anunoby is going to be MIP. He’s been balling in preseason and with Siakam out early the Raptors will probably make him first option.
The best team considering fit is probably:  Shai Gilegous Alexander  CJ McCollum  OG Anunoby  Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  6: De'aron Fox  7: Ayton  8: Morant  9: MPJ  10: Sexton  11: Wood  12: Isaac
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.

"To take it one step further, OG Anunoby is from London, Coach Nick Nurse played for Derby and coached Brighton, Manchester, London and Birmingham and President Masai Ujiri was born in Bournemouth and played for Derby.  If you’re from the UK then the Raptors is are close as you’ll get to a home team."
"Yes. OG Anunoby is already one of the best wing defenders in the league, and arguably the best as Zach Lowe aka NBA Reddit God among others have argued. I don't think comparing OG who is arguably the best wing defender in the league right now to Ron Artest who was arguably the best wing defender in the league during his prime is very far-fetched. The jump that would be required to reach that ceiling would be on the offensive end, not on defense where he is already one of the best of not best wing defenders in the league. OG is already there on D.  I also don't think putting his realistic ceiling as prime Ron Artest offensively is far-fetched either. Ron Artest was not some offensive dynamo with crazy handles and was NBA Jam on fire. Ron Artest was a secondary/tertiary level scorer who struggled with efficiency from three and in general, had a rudimentary handle that was kinda shaky but allowed him to take advantage of his size and strength (billed at 6'6 244lb at the draft, 6'7 260lb during his nba career) to score and play off of another scorer for a spot up, cut or secondary action like a side PnR. Being a more efficiency Ron Artest who during his prime was an 18.5PPG scorer on low efficiency isn't exactly high praise. It's not like I'm saying his ceiling is Kawhi Leonard or something. OG is similar, in that he also has a rudimentary, shaky handle that has limited him offensively but has shown flashes last season and so far in pre-season of it developing enough to let him take advantage of his size and strength to score (did you not watch the Celtics Raptors preseason game?) in a similar mannor to Artest while also being a high efficiency player (for his career, 37.5% from three including one season of 39.0% on 3.3 attempts and 39.8% on 6.1%, career 58.7% with the last two seasons being at 60.0% and 60.5%). Clearly he isn't at that point yet (that's why its a ceiling) but last season he was at 15.9PPG for the season and after the All Star break where he got a bump in touches due to Northman Powell being traded bumped that up to 18.3PPG vs his 13.8PPG before the All Star break. That was also with basically no change in efficiency, going from 47.9/39.5/75.5 on 60.7%TS to 48.0/40.1/81.6 on 60.3%TS. Even if he were to just stay at his post All Star averages of 18.3/5.2/2.8/1.5/0.8 on 48.0/40.1/81.6 with 60.3%TS, that lines up with my realistic ceiling of more efficient prime Ron Artest offensively. Remember, for his six season prime, Ron Artest was at 18.5/5.6/3.5/2.0/0.6 on 42.6/35.6/73.0 with a 52.0%TS. Similar slash numbers to Prime Ron Artest but with better higher efficiency."
"the Raps had to play 72 away games so it was a lost season already and then they were ravaged by covid, so their tanking is excused, unlike a certain Tornado Alley-based team. also, i was referring to players such as Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby who are all great players the Raptors drafted outside of the lottery or signed after they went undrafted"
"couldda drafted OG Anunoby, John Collins/Jarret Allen, and Derrick White with their picks"
"GTJ, Barnes, Anunoby, Achiuwa, Flynn, Gillespie &gt; Moody, Wiseman, Poole, Kuminga,   GTJ and OG alone are better than every single one of those warriors players, add Barnes and Achiuwa to the fact that the other two will continue growing, along with other youngins, not hard to imagine why the Raps core is better"
"Scottie is actually 6'7"" in bare feet(per the combine measurements) , but he's the same height as a lot of players who are listed as taller than that. 90% of the league is actually 1 - 2 inches shorter than their listed height. OG Anunoby is listed at 6'7"" and Scottie is roughly an inch taller than him.  In relation to other player's listed heights he's 6'8"" or 6'9"". The league started making teams re-measure their players a couple of seasons back, but often the updated heights still aren't posted on broadcasts or websites (including NBA.com)."
unrelated but OG Anunoby really gonna be MIP
"HERE COMES TYLER LYDON   Seriously the 2017 draft is pretty much my only gripe with TC, couldve taken OG Anunoby at 13 but instead traded down and ended up with Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon who were both huge negatives.  Pretty much all of his other picks I've liked but that draft was horrible"
OG “Big Homie” Anunoby
OG Anunoby!!!!
"What exactly is Simmons' perceived value? For reference, here are 3 offers that other GMs rejected from Morey:  1. OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, 4th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft  2. Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and 2 future first round picks  3. CJ, three first round picks, and three swaps  I'm not entirely sure what dangerous precedent is hanging in the balance here but it seems that other GMs cant see eye to eye with Morey's perception of Simmons' perceived value."

"If OG Anunoby doesn't lock them up, the RCMP will."
I honestly would rather have CJ and roco than og anunoby  I think OG is a good player but he’s far from untouchable
Isn't that about what OG Anunoby got?
"Everyone is playing with injuries. Kawhi's chronic injury was getting worse throughout the playoffs and I remember Lowry playing with an injured hand. I think OG Anunoby also missed games in the finals  Also, Klay only missed 1 game and without KD playing those 11 minutes, that series was ending in 5."
"&gt;he was the 2nd best player on the court for the Hawks last year  It's 17 games after a terrible rookie season then he got hurt, people just decide they think only the 17 games matter since its more recent and the terrible rookie season has no predictive value going forward. It's not how it really works.   &gt;proven he can carry an offense if Trae isn't feeling it.   He cant pass and 3/4 of his shots are assisted. His ""shot generation"" is taking some wide open 17 footers vs drop coverage, attacking close outs and some slashes to the rim. What are we even doing here. It shows how low the bar was for Hunter after a bad rookie season this is considered ""carrying an offense"". OG Anunoby can do all of this stuff and is frankly even somewhat better at it. Hunter's a little more developed in the half court than Mikal Bridges, Mikal is a better shooter and better in transition. He's not a better offensive player than either."
"Anunoby   Bridges   Hunter    OG is just such a versatile defensive stopper that any team would love to have.  Mikal is closer to the prototypical 3&amp;D wing, I just more highly value OG’s ability to guard and lockdown threats, whereas Hunter is very good but not as polished as the other two, who are rock solid in any rotation."
mikal bridges or OG Anunoby are the two best answers in my opinion. Elite 3 &amp; D guys with length and size can be inserted into almost any starting lineup and contribute. I also think a healthy serge ibaka could be a candidate.
"Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby are the right candidates for this -- versatile wings who can play multiple positions, space the floor, and defend all over the place. I don't know which team has a better 2, 3, *and* 4 than either of those guys."
Probably an elite switchable 3&amp;D wing who would fit anywhere. Maybe OG anunoby?
"Playing for a contender right now, I'm looking at:     Guard - CP3 ($4)  Wing - Danny Green ($1)  Wing - OG Anunoby ($2)  Forward - Jerami Grant ($3)  Big - AD ($5)  Defense, switchability, shooters all over the court, and athleticism. Biggest thing this team lacks is playmaking outside of CP3, but AD and Grant all have some ability to move with the ball.  Struggled a lot with AD vs Embiid, and while I think Embiid is the better player, I went with versatility here."
"Reporter: ""Who is that guy?""  FVV: ""Oh....gee, a nobody.""  Reporter: ""OG Anunoby? Did I get that right?""  FVV: ""I do not care. So sure, that's his name."""

"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
Chris Boucher is 28 years old. 2021/22 will be his 5th year in the NBA.  OG Anunoby is 24 years old. 2021/22 will be his 5th year in the NBA.

"PG: Cade Cunningham $2  SG: Donovan Mitchell $4  SF: Caris LeVert $2  PF: OG Anunoby $2  C: Joel Embiid $5  --------------------  You have to give up value somewhere, so I think taking Cade for $2 is a worthwhile bet.   Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."
"Damian Lillard $5   Duncan Robinson $2   Cam Reddish $1   OG Anunoby $2    Anthony Davis $5     Pretty simple- if you are building for a championship window, you need to plan for playoff basketball.  Prioritizing a spread PnR with a stout defense and a dominant offensive engine guard and defensive anchor big.  The Lillard/AD two man game would be unstoppable, with shooters on the wing who can help without too many touches on offense, being pluses on the other end."
"PG: Harden (5) SG: Green (1) SF: Cade (2) PF Anunoby (2) C: Embiid (5)  I think Embiid and Harden are the two best players per the available options plus their fit is immaculate. With Embiid as an injury risk and Harden being 32, Cade serves as a potential superstar in the latter part of the 5-year window and can slowly take responsibility from the Beard during regular season. OG is undervalued and super versatile so he’s a must have in any lineup. Green is a veteran with championship experience, good shooter and a solid defensive so he’d be a complimentary addition to the team."
$2 Cade Cunningham 20-25  $4 Donovan Mitchell 25-30  $2 OG Anunoby 24-29  $3 Jerami Grant 27-32  $4 Bam Adebayo 24-29  I went for youth and versatility.  this list was tough.
PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Danny Green  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Joel Embiid
"James Harden, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Vucevic, Danny Green"
"Trying to stay somewhat realistic, giving him one star teammate and then some solid role players would look like:   PG - Simmons  SG - Fred VanVleet SF - Duncan Robinson  PF - OG Anunoby  C - KAT  Surround him with shooters, solid defensive players, and some extra playmaking so he’s not always the main ball handler. Scoring wise he should be a 4th option, but usage wise he should be around 2nd or 3rd on the team."
"&gt;[Reason Warriors should trade away Wiggins]  &gt;[Reason Warriors should trade for OG Anunoby]  I think you're missing something, bud."
Warriors need to make a consolidation trade. They’re simply not going to have enough minutes once Klay and Wiseman come back.   Ship Wiseman and JTA for OG Anunoby
Maybe. Or maybe a huge trade of like Klay and Wiseman for OG Anunoby or something
Is Desmond Bane someone that could be a solid 2nd option someday?  Looking forward to this Raptors squad once Gary Trent Jr and OG Anunoby are both back.. Scottie Barnes looks great
"Ja Morant  Lou Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby  Myles Turner  Bench - Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Lonzo, LaMelo, Ayton.  Starting lineup emphasizes defense.  Dort, Bridges and OG are all elite defender and can guard 1-4.  Turner is an elite rim protector and capable 3 point shooter.   Offense emphasizes a spread 3 point attack, led by Ja attacking the paint/mismatches and either scoring or passing out.  LaMelo is the secondary play maker off the bench while everyone else are catch and shoot or catch and drive players."

"It does feel like Raptors fans overrate their guys more than any other team. OG Anunoby untouchable, FVV borderline all star etc."

"Not sure you can trust defensive RAPTOR when it’s got Chris Paul at 200, Jakob Poeltl at 222, and OG Anunoby at 227. Last year with a much bigger data set JV ranked 7th of 86 centers in DRPM, and although DRPM is flawed too, he was a 0.0 in on/off def ratg. He’s not a bad defender any more. Not good, but not bad."
OG Anunoby
"If the Raptors traded for Simmons with a package centered around one of og anunoby, Fred vanvleet, or Pascal siakam I would be sad but I would understand.  Masai has taken opportunistic swings before. Everyone scoffed at the kawhi trade too thinking he was damaged goods."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"Could you get those numbers for OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Pascal Siakam? All the numbers are gonna be not very representative I guess but still would be interested in seeing their impacts."
"GB didn't have OG Anunoby, Greece didn't have most of their best players, I don't get why they're beefing it all evens out."
"As a Raptors fan, I'd take Giannis over KD. Our core would be: Fred VanVleet (27), OG Anunoby (24), Pascal Siakam (27), Scottie Barnes (20), Giannis Antetokounmpo (26).  That roster is absolutely disgusting and would peak at the right time to maintain a dynasty. It's impossible contract-wise and Giannis ain't leaving, but a man can dream. Imagine the ***length***."
"Wiggins is good though, not max contract good, but a solid role player that plays good D and can create his own shot. He's in the same category in my mind as OG Anunoby"
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Pascal Siakam  Fred VanVleet  Gary Trent Jr  Precious Achiuwa  Khem Birch  Dalano Banton  Would be the likely list I imagine.
I forgot how insane it is that the Raptors ended up with OG Anunoby and Norman Powell (which became Gary Trent Jr) for just Greivis Vasquez
I think OG anunoby has shown flashes of developing into the next PG/butler type guy  he's not at their level yet obviously but he's 8 years younger and really adding a lot to his offensive game recently to compliment an already solid defensive skillset
*Me*: We were missing OG Anunoby  *Me in the back of my mind*: They were missing Klay Thompson
OG Anunoby
"Look at Gary Trent Jr. He was the 37th pick and plays for the raptors who developed siakim, Fred van vleet, OG anunoby into emerging all stars.   Gary trent Jr is currently ranked 3rd in effective shooting behind curry and Durant. And leads the league in deflections. Currently ranked 3rd for DPOY."
"Daryl Morey is the most overrated and ridiculous GM in the NBA...he had a handful of great offers last season and this off season and he blew it by acting like a cartoon clown  The rumor is they could have had Lowry, Flynn and an unprotected first rounder in 2023 but Daryl Morey insisted that he wanted OG Anunoby, Fred Vanvleet, Garry Trent JR. and the 2021 4th overall pick (Scottie Barnes), Masai Ujiri hung up the phone on him and ended discussions....haha  The 76ers with Lowry would have been an absolute beast, instead their going to waste Embiid's prime years and never win a championship...no one is giving them market value for Ben at this point...and as much as I blamed Ben for this entire thing, I'm starting to think maybe their just a poorly run organization and Bens the scapegoat...."
OG Anunoby.
OG Anunoby
"Sticking with the PG13, Kawhi, and Butler two-way player archetypes I'll guess one of Mikal Bridges, Lu  Dort, or OG Anunoby"

"Mikal Bridges. I feel like he is what people hoped OG Anunoby would be (still love OG). It’s just Mikal’s midrange game, 3 ball, and finishing is so damn good. He’s smaller than OG tho"
" OG Anunoby, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bam Adebayo  that trio defensively"
"OG Anunoby: ""First time?"""
"Only through solidarity will the GMs of the NBA continue to be able to create toxic workplace environments, harass &amp; belittle their employees all while trading future picks for albatross contracts attached to washed stars of yore in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs.   Also if handing out $200M+ worth of contracts to Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard &amp; Moe Harkless and then passing on the likes of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby &amp; John Collins for Zach Collins isn't justifiable cause to fire someone IDK what is..."
"Brogdon + LeVert, which is really just a package for Brogdon given LeVert's injury history, was offered like a week into the offseason. I'm not entirely sure we'll net a better player all around, but it's far from an obvious move to make. I wouldn't jump at the first offer either, no matter who I'm trading. Overall most of the packages were for the Buddy Heild/Malik Beasley types. People keep saying we ""fucked up"" because there was some nice package we just turned down. That's not what happened this summer.  &gt;The 76ers are straight up a better basketball team without Simmons. Adding Brogdon and Levert would have been great additions.  Absolute lies lmao this team is a better offensive fit around Embiid, but we are not a better team. Our defense is below average and a lineup of Maxey/Curry/Brogdon/Tobias/Embiid is not that good in the east anyway.  We could be a better team in October/November/December if we had already traded him for role players, but that doesn't serve our long term goals no matter how you cut it.   &gt;Over the summer Morey was sending clown offers like Simmons for Lillard and Simmons for FVV+4th overall+OG Anunoby.  I think the GM of 15+ years knows what he's doing when he calls other people around the league lol. If you read at all about how trades get made it's rather informal and GM's talk all the time. Daryl, is also known for being the most active GM calling other teams with crazy offers and that hasn't hurt his stock, shunned him from the league, or prevented him from making good deals like he did with Josh Richardson and Al Horford.   There's things to criticize from our side for sure, but I would 100% rather wait for Minnesota to be desperate 30 games into the season than trade Ben literally weeks after he had the worst few games of his career."
"No no, he clearly got his [eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFC8O23fkg) on O-Jew Anunobi, not OG Anunoby."

"The 76ers were asking for Kyle Lowry, Fred Van Vleet, OG Anunoby, and the number four pick from the Raptors this past July. Are you saying Morey is being reasonable here and anything less is pennies on the dollar for Simmons?"

He has the biggest scoring jump (outside of Bridges) and other than Herro, is the only other candidate who has improve his efficiency while doing so. Considering how hugely different the counting stats are, I still give an edge to Miles Bridges, but Ja is second to me, with Herro and Poole right there."
"Our team has had so many bad officiating crews that OG Anunoby is like 5th in the league for most attempted field goals in the paint averaging 2 FT a game lmao.  I want consistency, it seems some crews are using last years rules."

"OG ""watch me do it again"" Anunoby"
"trey lyles is taking half his shots from 3 point range this season as well.   he's also averaging 3 times as many free throws per game as he did last season while playing the same amount of minutes.  In fact he has more FTA than he did all last season already after only 10 games, compared to the 23 he played last year  I have no doubt it's mostly statistical noise with small sample sizes but it does help illustrate the greater point that OG anunoby is not getting a very friendly whistle considering his usage rate, shot profile, shot attempts and time on the court.  OG anunoby takes almost 4 times as many shots as trey lyles, the fact that he has fewer FTA on the season encapsulates the issue perfectly"
"I watched a bunch of OG anunoby and he gets whacked a lot with no whistle, he's constantly getting into the paint and trying to score this season"
well trey lyles is getting 15 minutes per game and OG anunoby is getting 36 minutes per game  seems like a pretty good bet

"The first matchup this year, Boston fans booed OG Anunoby during his intro because of the game winner he hit in the Bubble and honestly I respect them immensely for it."
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."

"Oh no. That was because he was sent to the G League and then he came back this April and played considerably better for the last few weeks of last season.  He just needed to log into more minutes. Developmental Staff was hired just a few months ago and those kinds of things normally need a year or so to start seeing the benefit, developmental coaches can't work that fast.  One of the best signings we got was the main Raptors developmental coach. The Raptors beat writers were super bummed out. He does a great job in addressing offensive talent if it exists(so great for Kuminga especially). He was solely responsible for raising several prominent Raptor players like  Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet"
"&gt;Ya the inter webs are covered with this most recent thing but some basic examples of him having issues with violence and sportsmanship  &gt;  That why you post example of other players hurting people?

Not what the conversation is about. There's an interesting situation that's reminiscent of this whole Jokic-Morris thing though, where OG Anunoby commits a dirty foul on Markieff, who retaliaties in an unreasonable way by trying to hit OG. Not okay then, not okay now. But we know he's dirty. Didn't know OG is.

"atlanta is struggling too, I think toronto is scarier  you don't think much of them because they dont have any high draft picks or standout superstars but I'm telling ya OG anunoby is breaking out this year and he's only 24 years old.   plus barnes looks like an immediate impact player and siakam coming off IR  I have them as higher than just a play-in team"
"toronto is really good man, don't underestimate them  for one thing they already smashed you once this season.   OG anunoby is looking like an all star and him developing offensively is a terrifying development for the rest of the NBA  and why would milwaukee not be tough, they are the defending champions"
"I watched Kansas games night in night out at the time because I like college basketball and because I am a phoenix suns fan and my team was awful at the time so I watched all the ""top"" prospects a lot. I understand it might feel like hindsight but like I said on draft night I knew we waisted the pick when we took him. I remember swearing up a storm with my friends I was watch the draft with that year. I wanted fox, Lonzo or OG Anunoby that year, Particularly OG. As I said at the time OG is what people think josh Jackson is. Before he was injured his sophomore year OG moved up as high as 7th on draft boards and if he hadn't tore his ACL he would have went top 5 instead of falling to 23rd or whatever it was.  and I knew OG was likely not gonna play most if not all his rookie year so we would have gotten a quality player and been able to tank again for luka. Sadly enough we got the 2018 #1 pick and didn't take luka. I'm not some amazing draft expert who is right all the time. Like everyone I get some things right and somethings wrong. But I was 100% right on pretty much everything in that 2017 draft class. It was probably my best draft year and thats unlikely to change anytime soon. I wasn't a believer in Markell though I thought he would be better than he is. I did believe in Tatum though I didn't think he was gonna be quite as good as he is. The only real thing in that class I didn't have the right read on was that I wasn't a Donovan Mitchell believer. Thought he would be a ok rotation guy.   And now that I basically put out all of my best draft takes ever here are some of my wrong takes so you know I am not just doing hindsight stuff. I believed Dragan bender was gonna be a star. I thought Jalen Brown was an awful pick at 3. I thought buddy hield was too old (that one taught me a good lesson). I thought Bamba was better than ayton. That one might still end up being true long term with how bamba has looked to start the year but its extremely unlikely if we are being honest about it. I fell too in love with sexton after the 3 on 5 game and had him over Trae. I wasn't a lemelo ball believer.   As for your point on the break. I believe Jackson is a better athlete then MacLemore and was in college. I am not arguing that he wasn't a monster on the break. He was at his best when he was borderline playing out of control. Which is how the fast break is played. its fast and there is space to make plays because there aren't 10 players at 1 end of the floor. The issue isn't nba schemes its that he can't be out of control and be successful in the nba because guys will take a charge or in the half court he will turn it over. I unfortunately have watch Jackson play in too many nba games than I wish to have seen him play in and his problem (at least when he was with the suns) isn't that he's overthinking. its that he isn't thinking at all. He is always trying to be that borderline out of control guy when the ball is in his hands. he almost wants to create controlled chaos. But he can't do that in the half court because teams are too smart, too athletic, and too disciplined for him to really let him create that kind of problem for them. And while he isn't the worst defender or even really a bad defender at all he can't consistently create enough turnovers to make his fast break skills a consistent asset for him. not to mention as the clip shows, he is a sub par finisher around the rim for nba standards"

We absolutely had the assets for PG. And Butler. And Kawhi.   He's never once been willing to trade CJ because he's too blinded by his love for the dude to see it's a terrible fit  Also fucked up the easiest draft to nail ever in 2017. We should have OG Anunoby and John Collins right now
"I think raptors are a competitive team if OG anunoby continues playing like a top player in the league  you can win or at least compete for a championship with OG/siakam/barnes as your core, thats a good core"
Wonder what would have happened had Vlade not traded 10 to get 15 and 20 and just drafted Donovan Mitchell. Or with 15 and 20 they got OG Anunoby and John Collins.
"OG anunoby is amazingly one of the best players in the NBA right now.   Incredible development from this dude.  he should be an all star this year possibly all NBA.  he's basically playing like paul george two way dominance.   and he's only 24  feels like he came out of nowhere cause he was injured for that whole raptors title run but he's been slowly getting better every year and right now he's just phenomenal.    shooting, playmaking, defense, OG has arrived and he's for real  he should be a MVP candidate with his level of two way play, just doesn't get the PR that other guys get"

**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
"&gt;I think OG Anunoby was definitely robbed of his spot last season.  Thybulle played 20 minutes but 65 games last season. OG played 33 minutes but 43 games.   OG had a DRtg of 109.5 for last season, Thybulle had DRtg of 104.7  OG had 1.5 Steals and 0.7 blocks per game in his 33.3 minutes, Thybulle had 1.6 and 1.1 respectively in his 20minutes.

"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"I was watching the Lebron buzzer beater game the other day and it is remarkable how many good players the Raptors had that year. Derozan, Lowry, Valanciunas, Ibaka, and a young OG anunoby was a very good starting 5 if that’s what they would choose to run. They also had (albeit before any of their primes) Fred Van Vleet, Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, and Jakob Poeltl. One of the deepest rosters I’ve seen, set for the present and the future."
OG Anunoby
And that's a risk that Pat Riley and the Heat org are willing to take. Would you trade OG Anunoby right now for a 36 year old player of Lowry's caliber lol?
"You don't understand basketball. You clearly didn't watch Toronto's championship run.  The disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either. You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Wow the disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either.  You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Fox, LeVert, OG Anunoby, Porter Jr, Ayton"
"Lamelo Ball SGH OG Anunoby Tobias Harris Deandre Ayton  2nd round exit maybe. Could use Jamal Murray instead of Lamelo, or Jeremi Grant/MPJ instead of Tobias, but I think the spacing and switch ability is at its best with those five.   OG is an absolute must include though, you aren’t getting defence that versatile with serviceable offence from any other non-all star player in the league that I can think of"
Lamelo Ball - Duncan Robinson - OG Anunoby - Xavier Tillman - Jarret Allen
"Look at the team though.  Siakam: Good player, all-star caliber. Disappointed on offense. Not really a #1 option.  VanVleet: Another good player, but undersized and clearly given too much scoring responsibility last season. Needs to develop as a scorer outside of the three point line.  Powell: Traded for GTJ, an inferior player with a lot of the same issues as FVV  Lowry: Traded for Dragic, a significantly worse player.  OG Anunoby: I love OG. nothing to say here.  Boucher: Good young scorer, not sure what else to say lol  Birch: Better option at the C position than Baynes  Scottie Barnes: I think the raptors development staff will turn him good, but I don't think he'll make a huge impact this year while his jumper is still developing  Precious Achiuwa: Decent young big? Should get rotation minutes this season  That's the rotation, unless I'm missing anybody. Considering how dense the east is this year, I have very little faith in this team making the 5 seed. Decent depth but Siakam + VanVleet as a 1-2 punch is extremely underwhelming when you pit it against the teams they'll be competing against."
Or turning 26 games of Greivis Vasquez into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell
Trading greivis Vasquez for what would become Norman Powell and OG Anunoby is easily his most underrated move.
OG anunoby
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"Not entirely true. He was traded for the picks that ended up being OG Anunoby and Norman Powell, so at least there's that."
"Im a huge believer in OG. But the Kawhi thing is just an unfair expectation for him.  However, I absolutely would not trade OG for Ben Simmons.   They are on a par defensively, OG is an infinitely better shooter, Simmons, obviously, is the better playmaker.  But what really separates these two players, is something that can’t be taught. It can’t be trained, or worked on with reps in the gym. (Which I’m doubtful Ben Simmons would do anyway.) It’s the attitude. The work ethic. The mentality of a competitor.   And it can be summed up perfectly by OG himself. His quote after hitting the buzzer beater 3 pointer, with 0.4seconds on the clock, to win game 3 in the second round of the playoffs against the Celtics.  “I don’t shoot to miss.” - OG Anunoby"
"He still struggled mightily, to the point where his last game in a Raptors uniform he was being benched for a rookie OG Anunoby. That should never happen to a star player, no matter what the reason is."
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that’s not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"&gt;Siakim regressed, Anunoby seems to have peaked as far as what option he is in the teams order  Siakam improved on every level of his game this season outside of his 3pt shooting, despite playing out of position, catching COVID, playing 72 road games, etc.  OG has also improved, he's become a much better defender that can now guard 1-5, and he's also improved on his offensive game."
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
He makes about the same as OG Anunoby  He’s overpaid
OG Anunoby ain’t going anywhere anytime soon. Raptors are rebuilding and he’s a big piece to that rebuilding core
"Raptors because Og Anunoby is the best British player, we are the only non-US team, and the most fun to watch developmentally."
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
I don't think anyone outside of Raptors fans know how good OG Anunoby is.
"Relax lol. The question is literally ""what is are players X, Y, Z worth on the trade market"". I gave a hypothetical range, OG Anunoby to KCP, I wasn't suggesting either end of the range was likely, nor recommending that the Warriors should pull the trigger at the low end of the range."
&gt; Could they land an OG Anunoby  Fuck no
&gt;OG Anunoby  Not happening
OG Anunoby is better than Wiggins so yeah
"Lottery picks to the best gms.. but you cant fault gms for picking someone outside of the lottery and them not performing.. its more luck based the higher it goes and scouting plays less of a part. Players like jokic and isaiah thomas wouldve been picked much higher in hindsight, players like og anunoby and siakam would e been picked sooner in hindsight as well, are you not gonna fault all the gms that passed up on them as well? Lol"
"**If all teams are healthy.** Here's the thing, not all teams are healthy, and some players are more prone to injury such as AD and Kyrie. To say if all teams are healthy isn't something based in reality. Most if not all teams that make it deep in the playoffs are suffering injuries of some sort. The Bucks had Big Ragu out and Giannis missed games due to a knee injury that was surprisingly not as seriously as it looked to have been. Dragic, Bam and Butler had injuries during the 2020 Finals. 2019 the Raptors had OG Anunoby out the entire playoffs, Siakam had a groin injury, Kawhi had his quad acting up + hurt his knee on the other leg &amp; was basically limping up n down the floor and Lowry had a thumb injury that he played through that requires surgery. There is no such thing as if all teams are healthy."
"Thank you for including Smart. I'd throw Thybulle into that mix, personally, and *maybe* Lowry. Oh, and I've heard excellent things on OG Anunoby too."
Kuminga reminds me of OG Anunoby but with much less effort.
"Remember OG Anunoby? Was a great defender couldn't shoot. Made the team anyway. Remember Giannis Antetokoumpo? Couldnt shoot, made the team anyway. Marcus Smart? Couldnt shoot, made the team anyway. A lot of players who can defend can't shoot early on get on the team and get minutes. Teams NEED defenders."
"Are you familiar with Fred Van Vleet, Pascal Siakim, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher and OG Anunoby?  Their draft and development record is better than almost any team in the NBA.  Nobody is 100 percent but Maisi/Webster are pretty good."
"I personallysee Scottie as a 4/5 instead of a 2/3 which is what anunoby is, then gary trent is officially a 2. So if you have 1) FredLowry 2) Trent 3) OG 4) Siakam 5) Scottie as your mobile 5. It's an ultra small team. No lineup is fixed permanently btw. Totally fluid. And that's the point. Twin tower wings."
If im Warriors I’d want OG Anunoby over Siakam
"&gt; NEW YORK — The Golden State Warriors basically assumed the 76ers’ offer as a joke.  &gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer.  &gt; This comes after a source confirmed The Ringer report that the Sixers asked the San Antonio Spurs for four first-round picks, three first-round pick swaps and a young player in exchange for Simmons.  &gt; According to The Action Network, the Toronto Raptors rejected the Sixers’ asking price of Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the fourth pick in tonight’s draft for a package that included Simmons.   &gt; One league executive said the Sixers are making “totally outlandish offers.”"
"Haven't been following so had to look this up...  &gt; The Philadelphia 76ers reportedly offered Ben Simmons to the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the No. 4 overall draft pick  LMAO wtf.    Masai probably rolled right out of his chair with that kind of ""offer"""
I mean who would trade a Jedi like OG Wun Anunoby?
"""OG Anunoby likey not available for trade."""
OG Anunoby
"Alright here’s a fun, never gonna happen but would be cool hot take: The Bulls, no matter what off-season they have, will not come out of the east this year with the nets, bucks, 6ers, heat, etc built the way they are this year. I love em but it’s just not happening. Knowing and accepting this opens a crazy door.   Bulls receive:  4th OVR (TOR)  7th OVR (GSW)  James Wiseman  Gary Trent (S&amp;T)  Raptors receive:  Zach Lavine Andrew Wiggins 14th OVR (GSW)  Warriors receive: OG Anunoby Nicola Vucevic  This gives the bulls the perfect opportunity to start a super charged rebuild featuring White, Trent jr, PAW and wiseman + the 4th and 7th pick  This gives the Raptors a bonafide chance to compete in the east (this is where I’ll take the most hate), but FVV, Lavine, Wiggins, Siakam coached by Nick Nurse has a chance to compete in the east IMO. 14 is also a nice compensation all considered.   For the warriors it is the perfect last chance at the classic dynasty to compete. OG is the perfect wing in that offence and VUC is the perfect centre. They’d be well over the luxury tax but that team will still make money if competing.   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
"these ""sixers get rejected"" threads are amazing. i've been saying ben was trash for years.  so yesterday they wanted the 4th overal pick, FVV, OG Anunoby, and Lowry right? Which means darryl has lost his mind but the raps thankfully rejected this.  Now they'll take a bunch of picks and a rookie, and they can't even get that!  You love to see it."
"Ben Simmons had a dreadful playoff series.  In Round 1, he averaged 15/10/9 on 64% shooting. One series doesn't define a player.  And are you just rewriting history?  Yes, the Raptors won the 2019 NBA Championship, but OG Anunoby didn't even play a single minute of the 2019 playoffs due to an emergency appendectomy.  Fred Van Vleet came off the bench throughout the 2019 playoffs.  He made 0 starts, and, for the playoffs, he averaged 8.0 points, 1.8 rebs, and 2.6 assists per game.  He had a decent NBA Finals coming off the bench, but neither were ""starters on a championship team""."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"OG Anunoby was compared to Jerami Grant, which was a fair comparable up until this past season with Grant popping off offensively  DSJ's comparison to Bledsoe was accurate, for all the wrong reasons lol.  Dearon Fox was compared to John Wall  Ben Simmons was compared to Draymond Green  Montrez Harrell was compared to Taj Gibson  Kelly Oubre was called a poor man's Paul George lol  Lavine was called a poor man's Westbrook, though they have similar playstyles, Lavine is a much better 3P shooter"
"I can't even begin to imagine how sad I would be if my team had a surefire HoFer ready to be picked, and went for... Marvin Bagley...  I'm still salty that we picked DJ Wilson over OG Anunoby, and Donte over Huerter."
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"OK, OG can shoot (big one), he is coachable, he's not guaranteed unrealized athletic talent (Simmons will never win anything), he actually likes playing basketball, they have about the same PPG, do you want more?  https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Ogugua-Anunoby/Comparison/84076/Ben-Simmons/41364"
"In Morey delusional mind he would have the 4th pick as well,                                                so in lala land his starting 5 would be...  Jalen Suggs, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid."
"**How the phone call went down:**  Morey: *""Good morning Masai, I'd like to offer you an amazing deal. I'll give you Ben Simmons in exchange for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, your first round 4th pick as well as--""*  *Click *   Morey: *""Hello? Hello!?!?""*"
I think he could be an OG Anunoby type player but that's about as high as I'd go on him.
Sounds like the ramblings of a crackhead.   For Simmons I want Van Vleet! AND OG Anunoby! AND a 1st! AND Lowery! Foh
"It makes some sense in the abstract. Ben Simmons is a young all star in good health. Anunoby and Vanvleet are high level starters, with outside all star potential in the next three years. The fourth pick is really good most years. So on paper? It's not too out there.  But the reality of the trade is far from that. OG is among the best and most versatile defenders in the league, Fred is a borderline all star already, and this year's draft is allegedly four stars deep at the top. On top of that, Simmons has tanked his stock due to his own in court play, something I can't remember any precedent for in the past decade.  If Masai took this deal I would honestly stop following the Raptors."
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
Please start watching OG Anunoby
Og Anunoby at 18 million is more valuable is more valuable then Simmons at 36 million imo
The Mitchell one kinda makes sense since they were targeting OG anunoby with that Jazz pick but of course the raptors ended up taking him
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
"I got downvoted for saying OG Anunoby on his contract is more valuable but—- literally every team in the NBA could use OG Anunoby on $18m/year. He’s easy to integrate into a team.  If he was available, there would be teams lining up to get him.   Ben—- you need to reconfigure a team to add him. Not every team can take that on. It’s just a huge contract considering he’s not easy to slot in.   Idk. I think Ben Simmons is still a good basketball player, but I don’t see teams clambering to send out their all star for him."
Raptors because we have the British GOAT OG Anunoby
"And the guy they were targeting with the 21st pick they got in the Mitchell deal was OG Anunoby, who was picked by the raptors right before the nuggets picked. So they almost still got a really good player out of the deal."
"Wiseman, Wiggins, #7, #14  Warriors would have ( Curry, Beal, Thompson, Green, Loony)  Wizards would have something like (Bouknight(7), Murphy(14), Williams(15), Avdija, Hachimura, Wiseman)  ---  Maybe if Raptors want to trade #4 ... but I doubt they want to trade OG ... maybe they can do #4, FVV(salary), GTJ, +Picks to get it done.  Raptors would have something like (Lowry, Beal, Anunoby, Siakam, Baynes)  Wizards would have something like ( FVV/Suggs, GTJ, Avdija, Hachimura, Gafford) ... maybe flip FVV to the Knicks in this case.  ---  Someone like the Nuggets, Pelicans, could get in there though."
OG anunoby looking good these days
Is OG Anunoby playing for Nigeria?
OG Anunoby great 3&amp;D wing who fits perfectly in the Nuggets timeline   And the 2nd I’d go with Cam Reddish 1 because I think he’s going to be a ridiculously good 3&amp;D guy in a year maybe 2 and I said during the draft he would be the best player from his class by the time all their careers are said and done 2. he’s one of my favorite players in the NBA
"I completely blocked out of my memory those DJ Wilson minutes  His nice NCAA tournament run led to him getting drafted too high (went ahead of guys like John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG Anunoby)"
I’m not seeing the Barnes/Anunoby comp. Barnes is closer to Draymond than OG.
"No way are they giving up 4OA + OG Anunoby for 2 years of Bradley Beal. Let's consider asset management: We have 4 more years of OG Anunoby at $18mil/yr and whoever we draft at 4OA will be locked up for 5 years at $7mil/yr.  That's $25 million for at least 4 years of OG + whoever we get at 4. Then we have Lowry, in all likelihood, coming off the books to provide about 20 million in cap space + whatever assets we recuperate in that.  So we're realistically looking at Suggs/Wiseman/Green, OG Anunoby, and a UFA: Oladipo, Porter Jr, Powell, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, etc.  The roster would look like this: Suggs, FVV, GTJ, OG, Siakam, Holmes + whatever assets we get from Lowry.  Just doesn't make sense to give up *both* the 4OA pick and OG. Probably send a guard back."
"It's correct , the best you can get from that is og anunoby , don't be delusional please"
"Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), OG Anunoby and the 4th pick (Jalen Suggs) ought to get this done."
OG Anunoby just turned 24 a few days ago.
OG Anunoby is the same age as Brandon Ingram (1997)
OG Anunoby is gonna be a 20 PPG scorer next season.
"Ayton and bridges will get their extensions, there really isn’t a question there. The only worst possible scenario with the young guys is that bridges turns down an extension to test the market and someone tries to max him or something crazy, but that’s very unlikely. He will get og anunoby money and we will pay it.  CP3 could leave, but it would be surprising considering he requested a trade here last year knowing the situation he was coming into, and then overperformed by everyone’s estimation. Could he take the vet min and go to the lakers? Sure, but I think it’s extremely unlikely.   Sarver has been cheap, but his net worth did increase significantly during the pandemic, he did dump a bunch of money into our practice facility and arena, and he did say during the playoffs that paying to bring back Chris if he opts out is an easy decision.   The ayton and bridges contracts do hurt our long term flexibility, but that’s going to manifest as us not being able to extend guys like cam Johnson or re-sign cam Payne, spend money on good free agents etc. mikal bridges is not walking lol. Nobody is asking this if we don’t make it to the finals, it’s just the extra spotlight on us because of that. Which is funny, because having a run like we did makes it more likely we keep this group together, but because it puts us in the media spotlight there’s more discussion like this."
OG Anunoby will put up 22+ ppg
"Siakam has a AST% of 20.5% with a TOV% of 10.6%. RJ is at 13.8% and 10.5%. Siakam had 48.5 passes per game, 8.7 Potential Assists Per Game, 12.1 AST PTS Created and a 9.2% AST to Pass%. RJ was at 27.4, 5.2, 7.8, 11.0% respectively. Siakam is a better passer than RJ.  The Raptors were not better than the Knicks this season, we had OG Anunoby guarding centres for a lot of the season cause we had no playable centres until we signed Khem Birch and Freddie G at basically the end of the season. The Raptors were not good this season just based off not having a capable player at the most important defensive position."
"The Tyler Lydon pick in 2017. While he was drafted 24th, Denver had eyes on OG Anunoby, and traded back from the 13th spot (which became Donovan Mitchell) to 24, picked up Trey Lyles from Utah as the compensation to move down, then watched OG go 23rd to the Raptors. Lydon was out of the league in 2 years and Lyles was nothing more than an end of bench guy. Yuck."
"There’s a wide gap between not good and fucking max contract lol. THT is fine, but Jesus dude 4/83 puts him with Jalen Brown, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Issac, Malcom Brogdon, Myles Turner, Fred Vanvleet, Jerami Grant, etc.  *could* he be as good as those guys someday? Sure, why not? Should he be getting paid like those guys with his contract? Hell nah."
"Wesley Johnson, I never thought he would be a star but their is no reason he couldn't be OG Anunoby."
"Who is this legit 3 and D guy? You mean like an OG Anunoby type? Or a superstar that can do both 3 and D like PG or Jayden Brown. Because no superstar one available can do both. Meanwhile Wiggs has become an elite perimeter defender (not far off defensive teams) whilst shooting 38% from three and fitting the system extremely well.  So if anything less than an all-star 3 and D player, why would we trade Wiggs?"
"Idk why they would do it, but if I'm the Wizards I'd do nasty things to trade Bertans for OG Anunoby."
You just described OG Anunoby and Raptors signed him for 4/72
He's very similar to OG Anunoby and I expect he'll get a similar contract.
Ayton is in the same league as Giannis for most lovable players. I'd throw in OG Anunoby as my homer vote.
"Draymond is the best. AD and Giannis are just not good enough at navigating screens and stuff like that, and a top tier guard like Harden or Curry would blow by them. OG Anunoby is also a choice, not at Draymonds level but no one has mentioned him yet"
I would take out Bogdanovic and put in OG Anunoby ( whose European btw). OG gives them better defense
"That fact that you said Terance mann hung 40 on his neck absolutely proves me point, that you do not watch the Jazz play. Again, scheme was to let them shoot 3s and guard the paint, which is exactly how Mann scored 40 lol.   *Gobert defended 1,335 shots this year, 184 more than anyone else. The 267 3-point shots he defended are the fourth most among 67 NBA Centers, and also more than Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, OG Anunoby, and Kawhi Leonard. He’s defended the seventh most shots in isolation (78), and the most shots attempted on cuts to the basket (229). It’s safe to say Gobert puts himself out there in terms of guarding every player on every play more than anyone in the league.*  Here's one of the many articles you can find that show what you are saying is just blatantly wrong.  https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/  Homer or not, my point &gt; yours. lol"
"PG. Terry Rozier SG. Jaylen Brown SF. OG Anunoby PF. Ben Simmons C. Myles Turner  PG. Rozier really excelled with the Hornets as a secondary ball handler. Really strong 3pt shooter and while he has a tendency to gamble on defense, should serve as a strong point of attack defender on opposing PGs.  SG. Jaylen is the secondary scorer here. Has shown to be a really strong 3pt shooter and has really developed his ability to handle the ball, but isn’t necessarily the kind of guy who needs to have the ball in his hands to be successful. Sus off-ball defense but certainly in the upper echelon of on-ball defenders.  SF. Love OG, he can slot into any team and be an asset. Really developing his 3pt shot and like Jaylen, in the upper echelon of wing defenders. Jaylen and OG on the wings is going to lock up opposing scorers.  PF. Simmons is really really the primary ball handler and facilitators but I’m slotting him at PF to make spacing work. In certain matchups he’s going to struggle to defend (thinking of teams with a legit PF like Randle or Domantas) but for the most part, teams are running a big wing at the 4. In those cases, Simmons defensive value will still be realized, and again, this is about putting a team of shooters around him.  C. Was thinking KAT but that would be a sus defense. Myles isn’t QUITE the 3pt shooter as KAT but I think he can anchor the defense better. He may struggle against true centers like Embiid, but again those are rarer occurrences. I’m trading off KAT’s better shooting for Myles’ more balanced game and ability to anchor a team defense."
Fave: OG Anunoby  Least fave: probably Terence Davis
"When looking at MIP the player usually has a major increase in min and or role. Both your picks could have both.    For Murray I don’t see him winning because of Pops system.  I just don’t see him putting up the numbers or getting the wins to be MIP.  For Mann he would need to become a good 3 point shooter basically over night.  He will get more opportunities to play but I think his lack of shooting over 82 games will limit him.  I can see a guy like OG Anunoby, NAW, Maxey, or even a guard from Orlando popping and taking MIP."
Trey Lyles and another pick...which they wanted to use on OG Anunoby. He would have been a great fit on the Nuggets and would have made the trade look less bad...but he was taken the pick before the one they got back in the trade.  They outsmarted themselves just a little bit on that one and ate it.
FVV  Marcus Smart  Lu Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby
"Way Overpaid, thats more than pascal siakam or Og Anunoby, even I think jokic(not sure on that)"
"Toronto could work - but not for Siakam, which has been popular. Does embiid/siakam make markedly more sense than embiid/Simmons? Nah, the sixers need shooting and ball handling back in any Simmons trade. With fillers/draft picks The trade could be:   Raptors get: Simmons, Milton  Sixers get: Fred VV, OG Anunoby   FVV is the exact kind of player who would thrive in Philly - culturally and fit, he’s a marksman with underrated playmaking ability. OG would be a trade piece, further reason to flip Tobias Harris, an upgrade over starting Danny green or a combination of the 3   Toronto gets a revamp centered on Simmons, with siakam helping protect the rim, dragic - crafty enough to be an effective PNR partner with Ben, Gary Trent, and Milton/Barnes. This raises Toronto’s ceiling as a whole, while maintaining flexibility with flippable assets."
"The best role players are plus defenders and can shoot the three when fed by the stars. Tucker did that with Harden at an insanely high level for years in Houston. Even at his current age, I am still putting him on my list. Mikal bridges looks to be one of the up and coming 3nD studs. Marcus smart is an elite defender, and honestly I’ll take his questionable shot selection because his defense simply makes up for it. Robert Covington needs to re-find his shot, but he is also the right archetype. Finally, I’m going to cheat a little and say OG Anunoby. Idk how much longer we will consider him a role player, but he is about as good as it gets for 3nD."
"Ben is acting like a baby, but he's shooting himself in the foot if he wants to leave.    The report from yesterday was that the Nuggets responded to rumors of a Simmons/Murray swap by saying, ""I don't know if that's more insulting to us or Jamal"".  I get that fans are sour on Ben league-wide and his performance in the playoffs was poor but Simmons is as good as Murray and, more importantly, isn't going to miss all of next season with an ACL tear.   It's overly simplistic to call Ben a three-time all-star, all-nba, runner-up for DPOY and Jamal none of that, but accolades are given for a reason.   We've reached a place where teams are just dunking on Ben to build up their own players because Simmons has made himself toxic and no GM could bring him on board for reasonably fair value without the fans revolting.    Simmons and Embiid have been very successful when they've shared the floor.  Buddy-Bagley is an idiotic deal for the sixers, as is Lonnie Walker-Luka Samatic.  We've reached crazy-town and while Simmons has been the conductor NBA fandom got their tickets and rode to the last stop.  Ben didn't want to get fouled because he shot 30% from the line in last year's playoffs but that's a huge outlier for him.  He needs to come back to the sixers, I hope they don't let irrationality reign and trade him for OG Anunoby and Dragic."
OG Anunoby when he dribbles.
"Context is important. If you just had to choose one player then it's Simmons every single time. If you could just add either to your team without considering anything else, then again it's Simmons every time. If you factor in contracts and what assets you have to give up, then maybe some teams prefer OG. But in terms if who is a better player, it's Simmons in a landslide and I say that as a huge Anunoby fan."
OG anunoby will be an all star this year - Me
OG Anunoby is a young Kawhi Leonard
Wanna link me something that has as big of a prospect database as draft.net? This post was kinda specifically for draft.net lmao. I wish you could bc it mentioned OG Anunoby as the second coming of Looney.
"Lonzo is not a real point guard and he won't make the Bulls better as much as people think. DeMar will wind up being the main facilitator on that team.  Ja Morant will be better than Westbrook and Wall ever were.  OG Anunoby is the 2nd best one on one defender in the league.  Mikal Bridges is not as good of a 3pt shooter as people think and once he's no longer sharing the court with Chris Paul, this will become very evident. Miles is better.  SGA is the second best guard under 25 and the 2nd best player from the 2018 draft."
"Bulls, so:   Lonzo-Jason Kidd  LaVine-Russell Westbrook  DeMar-Vince Carter  PWill- OG Anunoby  Vucevic- Wang Zhizhi   Actually a pretty great team"
"ben simmons is still really fucking good, i think hes looked at in a way where people expect this high scoring superstart pg but in reality he should be a superpowered draymond who can have the ball in his hands more.  all that being said, id rather have og anunoby than him. i think after this season thats gonna be the general consensus even after people come around on simmons. i genuinely believe that og is already a top 3 defender in the league, and he still has so much more room to grow"
BULLS:  Jason Kidd  Russell Westbrook  Vince Carter  OG Anunoby  and...Mehmet Okur. Unless you were really high on Wang Zhizhi at some point
"I think OG Anunoby will end up being the best player in the 2017 draft class  Nah but fr, Scottie Barnes is going to be an All-NBA 1st team player one year"
OG Anunoby
