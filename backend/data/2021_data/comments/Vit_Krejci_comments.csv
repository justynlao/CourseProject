"I want this guy. Imagine him, Poku, and vit Krejci on the same court.  Chaos reigns."
"OKC - SGA, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Theo, Giddey, Mann, JRE protected  Unprotected - Ty Jerome, Kenrich, Deck, Muscala, Favors, Roby, Vit Krejci, Charlie Brown Jr, Josh Hall  Would expect to lose Kenrich and Ty Jerome in an expansion draft, assuming each expansion franchise can only take one apiece from a team. Maybe Vit but I don’t think he’s signed a deal officially and don’t know if a player’s rights can be taken in an expansion draft or if they have to have an NBA contract."
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon
"I think this is why Presti passed on Sengun. He specifically went for Shai, Poku, Giddey, and even Vit Krejci for a reason."
"The highly regarded, newly signed, Vit Krejci"
Even Vit Krejci
Unleash Vit Krejci
One good pick out of his last 14 prior to this year's draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
"Not sure if it’s an upper bound (creator might know), but I got 9 from Bob Hubbard/Gorham getchell to Vit krejci.  My thought process was find guys who played in the 40s on some of those BAA teams that ended up folding (highest chance of teammates who ended up moving on to other careers rather than going to other basketball teams) and pair them with some rookie on the current Thunder - who are the first team I thought of for “have the least number of vets to connect backwards.”  I’m sure there are plenty of interchangeable guys on both ends. There’s probably a 10+ somewhere"
Found one that’s 9 long. Vit Krejci to Nat Frankel.
