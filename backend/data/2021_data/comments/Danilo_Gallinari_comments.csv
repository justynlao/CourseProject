Defensive Superstar Danilo Gallinari
"Oh right they weren't 2/2 without Russ sorry, he was doing GREAT.  And when did I blame Harden for anything ? I said he couldn't handle OKC by himself so Westbrook had to come back early, what's wrong about that ?Westbrook SUCKED in the playoffs, he was the worst player playing big minutes , doesnt change the fact that he had to come back too early, unless you think it's a complete coincidence that he was ultra explosive, got hurt, and then couldn't even blow by Danilo Gallinari"

"From my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/khpv2o/official_rnba_power_rankings_0_tis_the_season/ggmifdg/) on the pre-season rankings:   &gt; Could we get some explanations for (I don't want to criticize/roast, just seeking some rationale):  &gt; Nets at 15 and Wizards at 27? /u/ BigEarl139  &gt; Could two teams with two all-star level talents and solid supporting casts be as low as they are? Russell Westbrook is one of the biggest floor-raisers in the NBA. Surely they're better than more than three teams. Nets have a team mostly intact from last year and they're adding KD/Kyrie. If either gets injured, then 15 is very natural, but with both they should be at least slightly better, no?  I have to owe /u/BigEarl139 a retroactive apology, because Wizards at 27 is nearly spot-on with how they look this season. Nets at 15 was ambitiously low though, even before Harden's arrival (though if Kyrie missed more games due to being Kyrie, maybe?).   &gt; Thunder at 15? /u/ S9lo  &gt; EDIT: I see you put Wizards at 14, Thunder at 15, and Jazz at 16. Can I have what you're smoking?  &gt; EDIT2: Also, you ranked, in order, Lakers, Clippers, six Eastern teams (Boston, Milwaukee, Miami, Brooklyn, Philly, Toronto), then Denver, Phoenix, Portland, Houston, Dallas. First, is the gap that wide between Clippers and the rest of the West that all six Eastern teams fit? Second, do you really believe Dallas is worse than Phoenix, Portland, and Houston?  &gt; They lost Chris Paul, Steven Adams, and Danilo Gallinari. They're starting SGA/Dort/Bazley/Ariza/Horford with an uninspiring bench. That's not a terrible team (a la process Sixers or some expansion Hornets teams), but it sounds like you're expecting major overperformances from their players.   Wizards at 14, Thunder 15, and Jazz at 16 is still ludicrous. I'm homer-ing here, but the sheer ordering of those teams caused me indignation.  Also, though the Mavs remain worse than Phoenix and Portland on the power rankings, I expect that to change. They should at least pass Portland (Blazers bros, I feel for you and losing Nurkic to injury is super painful). However, I do acknowledge that would be difficult to predict.  &gt; Pacers at 24 and Warriors at 29? /u/ Bird_and_Dog  &gt; No comment.  Still no comment. (The Warriors did start off slow, but 29th in the league slow? That was a stretch for sure. And the Pacers were at least mediocre and a solid playoff last season and lost practically no one. To slot them at 24 was disrespecting their core players, not to mention they're now missing LeVert and Lamb.)"
"Anecdotally, the only 4 NBA players my girlfriend knows are LeBron, Jayson Tatum, ""Marcus Mart"" and Danilo Gallinari, because she thinks he's hot."
"the problem is that this guy is seeing it through perfect tinted glasses.  Its like being mad that Harden went to Brooklyn and brooklyn had to give up picks and players.  &amp;nbsp;  The reality of the situation:     Melo was going to be traded mid-season because he wanted to sign BEFORE the new CBA was negotiated (there was a stoppage that offseason) which was rumored to be worse for players (and it was).    It was one of 2 options:   1- Knicks trade for Melo   2- Nets trade for Melo    &amp;nbsp;  The option of getting melo in the offseason was never there.  &amp;nbsp;  And to top it all off, if we DIDN'T trade for Melo, we would have traded for Deron (who sucked from 2011 and onward).  And if we didn't trade for Melo, we would have had a team led by **Amare, Wilson Chandler, and Danilo Gallinari.  Amare went on to be injured from 2011-2015 while not playing like the TOP PAID PLAYER on the team that whole time.  Danilo was injured for 2 1/2 seasons out of those 4 seasons.  Wilson was injured for 2 out of those 4 seasons**.  And all 3 would have been LOCKED into contracts cause Gallinari and Wilson all had extensions coming up that same 2011 offseason.  &amp;nbsp;  **There was never an option to get melo in Free agency.**   We either...   -Get Deron with those same assets  or   -Let the oft-injured Amare/Wilson/Gallinari lead us from 2011-2015    &amp;nbsp;  Now, while on the Knicks, he didn't want to leave and Phil Jackson just kept having his 2 cronies in the media keep writing hit pieces.  If anything, Melo is the ONLY player to sign in NY twice while he could have had more money elsewhere.  He got traded to NY and CHOSE to re-sign in 2011.  He CHOSE to re-sign in 2014 also.  **Amare chose NY, but the reality is that we were the only team to offer a 5 year contract while everyone else offered 3yr, 2yr, and 1 year contracts**.  Amare worked hard for us and did NOT give up, but the reality is that our 2010-2015 era was doused because of his injuries."
"4 unprotected 1sts, 2 pick swaps, Danilo Gallinari and this guy for PG could end up being like the Garnett/Pierce trade"
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
"That's a weird way to describe Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Dennis Schröder."
"So many trolls out today..  Thunder were projected low bc people thought they'd tank and sell high on vets like Danilo Gallinari/Dennis Schroder.  The roster itself was passable, but their success depended on SGA developing and CP3 staying healthy.  Both of those things happened.  The Rockets lost to the Lakers in the EXACT same fashion as the Blazers- won game one, then got 4-1'd.  The Rockets lost in increasing amounts every game, too.  Dame got injured and didn't even play the end of the series.  We wouldn't have won anyways, but to call Dame overrated for playing 3.5 games of playoff basketball against the eventual championship is ridiculous.   Also, the Suns were 5-2 over their first 7 games last season, tied for 2nd with the Clippers and behind the 5-1 Lakers.  Stop crowning them any seed yet."
Rusell Westbrook? Chris Paul? KCP? Danilo Gallinari? Kelly Oubre? Rudy Gobert?
Danilo Gallinari?
"&gt; although I have a hard time imagining doing worse with 20 million in extra cap, two 1st's, and a prospect  Two firsts in the 20s, a mid-first who looks mediocre at age-21, and the cap space equivalent of Bogdan Bogdanovic or Danilo Gallinari? You can't imagine that outcome being worse than a guy who has a TS of over 62% this year? Most of the guys picked in the 20s don't turn into much."
Danilo Gallinari still exists
"To be fair, the Thunder also lost Steven Adams, Danilo Gallinari, and Schroeder, who are all extremely productive players."
"wilson chandler and danilo Gallinari were around the same age as steph scoring about 15 points a game so around that time they probably had the same or a little less value than steph, im not sure if they trade steph for melo but i do believe the nuggets would prefer steph over receiving 2 small forwards. having said that they did have ty lawson off the bench, either way the trade still goes though imo. but at the end of the day its fun to think about"

"Definitely not a fleece, but I don’t know if LAC does that trade again in hindsight. Looking again at the actual package OKC got and it’s just nuts.   SGA, Danilo Gallinari, and 5 first rounders. Holy shit."
Danilo 'Gallopin' Gallinari
Danilo Gallinari/Trae Young  Took the 30 point streak to a new level today
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and……  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
Why don’t the Celtics simply kill Danilo Gallinari?
"like i said, you're assuming he was ONLY going to sign with NY  the only real assets they gave up were the 2014 1st rounder- which i'm not sure who they even got out of it, and danilo gallinari who's a good role player  you're exaggerating it  they also got chauncey who was still balling  the real miscalculation was amnestying him and the other moves that followed in the years after, not the actual trade for melo"
"No, if you actually watch our games (as painful as that is) you'll see that getting open perimeter shots aren't generally our problem on offense. Danilo Gallinari and Cam Reddish have been shooting bricks the whole month. We are missing our second and fourth best offensive players and it is showing."
"&gt; For some reason, I either am, or am pretending to be, Danilo Gallinari.  This story made my day. One of the reasons why I love dreaming so much. This premise is hysterical."
"The TPE + a 1st should get Evan Fournier imo. That’s a good trade for both sides.  The problem is they can only use ~22m of the TPE this season due to hardcap issues so they can trade for another (unless they send out salary in a separate deal), but someone under it.  Danilo Gallinari is another one if there’s a handshake deal to send Atlanta a player “separately.” Just another scoring wing that can give you rotation minutes."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"Hawks are one most hit teams with injuries, Which is ironic because Hawks keep going against teams with a few injuries with fans making excurse for them not knowing Hawks injury situation is actually worst.  danilo gallinari, and Rondo have been out like 40% of season  bogdan bogdanović has been out half the season, may return by end of month or next.  Dunn has not played yet.  may play by end of month or next.  Clint missed the first 1/4 of games  Deandre hunter has been out a week, and now out at least a month or so.  Hawks are just 1 game behind .500 most of which is due same starters as last year plus Clint. Because of the Hawks sign FA have been out. I believe team will be a lot better once of guys come back and team built chemistry. But the fact Hawks are 6th seed and not even at full heath is a good sign."
"I remember this dude, He used to make Danilo Gallinari look like a good player"
"Clint Capela, John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Danilo Gallinari and then there is Reddish and Dunn but they don't really hamper us. 3 starters (including a DPOY candidate and the league's leading rebounder and a guy like Gallinari who has been on fire is detrimental.  I'll take the downvotes, because I know its Grizzlies fans but the logic is mental. We have injuries and we are sitting players because we are 4th and it was a great time to do so. We were on a winning streak and got ourselves into position to where if we lose we are 4th if we win we were 4th. It was a back to back and people are sucking wind. We are like 13 and 5 since the all star break but the thread seems to think they played the normal Hawks roster and that was close to how we usually look.  But to stop ranting and just answer the question Capela and Collins are more significant than JJJ. Hunter has been out for a while but he is the best defensive player. Gallinari has been doing great and spaces the floor for us. We had a rookie playing center and a rookie backing that position up. A game ago we had 3 of those players."
Danilo Gallinari might be at top 3 with 87% average and has shot over 90% 5 times
"Jrue lives to show up against the best, and so the best talk about him. So you get those sound bytes.   Gobert will back down from elite individual matchups and focus on team defense instead, so the best don't talk about him. And you just get analytics.   Jokic for example has a history of heaping praise on a myriad of his defenders but has always struggled to find anything nice to say about Goberts D.   All that said though, how much do players opinions matter? Are they actually even that good at scouting who defends them the best? I remember KD once saying that Danilo Gallinari was the best in the league at defending him."

He should not be getting as many as Zion. But to only have the SAME amount of FTs generated in the paint as Danilo Gallinari who has missed parts of the season and who isn't even someone that drives to the rim a ton is ridiculous. I also disagree that he doesn't throw his body around - he's quite physical in the paint even more so than Vuccimane
Not true and even if it was at least he can post up Danilo fucking gallinari.  Like no cap I’ve seen this video 3+ times and never does it fail to make me laugh. Kat is softer than charmin no cap.   https://youtu.be/MDrBjBh_Jhc

DANILO GALLINARI GRANDE CAPO DELL'ITALIA🎵
Steve Kerr spent that whole series whipping his dick around doing shit like starting Damian Jones. Warriors were all banged up and slept walked through every first half.....and yet a sweep. Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari could take 2 games vs a healthy Warriors team but Portland couldn’t even get one   Portland benefitted from a favorable draw to make that conference final then just got swept as the Warriors flagrantly disrespected them with an undermanned squad. So yeah all that series did was highlight what a non contender Portland was
"So true. And the players getting the ""hot"" label are always white or lightskin. I mean sure if that's your type go off, but looked at some of these ""hottest nba players"" list bc I needed a comparison for Green and only 5 of 20 were dark skinned.   Instead they included guys like Gordon ""forgettable face"" Hayward, Danilo ""ass chin"" Gallinari or Klay Thompson, Devin Booker and Steph with their baby faces. Sure not ugly, but not really up there."
"I can tell you that being 6'2 in middle school to 1st grade was all fun and games. I could play center and dominate those little kids.  Then when you stop growing at 6'3 and start facing 6'5, then 6'7 guys, way bigger than you, well. No more fun. I'm Italian and the biggest I saw in person was Gallinari and jesus, he's waaay bigger than what it looks on the floor. Danilo is legit 6'11 for like 240lbs or even more.  It was worse than being short in first place. When you think you're big and then see actual big guys, that's freaking demoralizing!"

"You underestimate how many guys we like to leave open. Danilo Gallinari would like to have a word. Saddiq Bey has some highlights to show you.   It's nothing personal to Kyrie, we just fucking suck at defense this year. We let someone score 30 basically every game, and it's not just the stars that do it."
"Danilo Gallinari is a worse defender, and by a wide margin"
"If he waited until to end of the season to sign with the Knicks as a free agent they would would’ve had a lot more to work with. I found this comment by u/tomtheconsigliere that explains the situation better.  “If the Knicks were rational and logical. If Melo was patient, he wouldn't have threatened his team to make a trade during the season and waited. If he would have waited we would have potentially had a team that had:  Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, Knicks 2014 first-round draft pick, Warriors’ 2012 second-round pick, and Warriors’ 2013 second-round pick Then add the following guys (the next season in 2011-12):  Tyson Chandler Jeremy Lin, Landry Fields, Iman Shumpert, and JR Smith Now this team isn't the best but there is a lot of talent and a nice young core. The way you build a team is through the draft. Then you develop that talent and be smart in FA. Instead the Knicks acquired Melo (via Trade) and Amare and traded away those we drafted.”"
"How did the thunder manage Paul George to Clippers in a deal that netted Okc SGA Danilo Gallinari, first-round Clippers picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, first-round Miami Heat picks in 2021 and 2023, and the right to swap first-round picks in 2023 and 2025 but you're making the Harden trade seem good and they traded away the good thing they got LEVERT.

"opposing bigmen are onyeku okong-who, danilo gallinari and john collins, and your max contract center is 9/5/2 with 5TO"
"How are Frank Ntilikina, Danilo Gallinari and Frederic Weis doing rn?"
"They never made it past the first round, but the post-Melo Nuggets were like 10 deep and made the playoffs three years in a row. Their second unit was nearly as good as their starting lineup.  2010-11 (post trade deadline): Nene, Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen, Al Harrington, JR Smith, Ty Lawson, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Kenyon Martin, Arron Afflalo  2011-12: Nene, Birdman, Lawson, Gallinari, Afflalo, Brewer, Harrington, Kenneth Faried, Andre Miller, Javale McGee, Corey Brewer, Kostas Koufos, Mozgov(?), Rudy Fernandez (season ending injury), Wilson Chandler (played in China during lockout, returned and got season ending injury)"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"I think the pendulum will swing in the form of strong guards and forwards realizing they can post up they’re 3pt specialist matchups. Give a guy like Tobias Harris an off-season to work on his post ups. All of a sudden you can’t put Danilo Gallinari on him because despite similar speed, in the post a refined Tobias Harris post game would eat Gallo alive."
All the 6ers had to do was not let the Hawks drop 42 points on their head and make free throws but I’d rather lose to KD than Danilo Gallinari
And shout out to Lou Chicken Wings Williams and Danilo Gallinari for being clutch af in the 4th. Ben Simmons need to be traded right now for a bag of Cheetos that can shoot 70% from the line
"I mean, I'm all for Giannis retaining his jumpshot, but if it means he would keep his old physique, he'd quite literally be another Nick Batum or Danilo Gallinari with better defense. A good player? Definitely, maybe even great. But he would not be the player he is today (2x mvp and dpoy) without all the improvements he's made in his body, and that includes his muscle."
"&gt; The Hawks might have also found a lineup combination that works to match the Sixers’ size in playing Danilo Gallinari at the four and Collins at the three. That lineup brought the Hawks back in the game late in the third quarter. That combination, along with Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic on the floor, played the second-most minutes for the Hawks and was a plus-five. Nate McMillan said he likes how that group is still able to retain shooting on the floor while being physical enough defensively to hold the Sixers. Collins has been the only player defensively this series who has done a solid job of guarding Harris, so it will be interesting to see how that unit is used for the rest of the series; it has worked despite that three-man group never being played together during the regular season."
"Embiid - offensive foul, intentional contact as gallinari is being pulled up by a teammate, attacks gallinari from behind for no reason. That's 3 strikes. Ejection and review by the league should have happened. Danilo shouldn't have received any punishment, he did nothing wrong."
Anyone else think Danilo Gallinari looks like Anthony from Smosh on meth
John Collins should be ejected for pulling Danilo Gallinari into Sixers legend all-time MVP snub Joel the process Embiid with such violent force
"yeah god forbid they give up defensive mastermind Danilo Gallinari for him, so much defensive potential lost without him"
He’s a glorified Danilo Gallinari

"Lol I’m old enough to understand that you don’t understand what whataboutism is.   &gt; Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position **by charging them with hypocrisy** without directly refuting or disproving their argument.  My comment lacked an assertion of hypocrisy and I wasn’t avoiding the point. The objective was to illustrate that this wasn’t an isolated incident.   With respect to your “explanation” not being a justification, that’s a bullshit cop out. Your “explanation” is literally [a copy/paste of the excuse Randle gave to justify his foul on Gallo in his postgame presser](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2021/05/julius-randle-flagrant-danilo-gallinari-hawks-reggie-bullock-knicks-game-4/amp).

"Yup I remember Amare, Raymond Felton, wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari were having great chemistry until Knicks traded half of the time for Melo.

"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
"hey, he could have walked in FA, instead they got some assets. people just love to be upset. they still made playoffs as 6 seed after they traded him, and take with a grain of [salt](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2021/2/21/22294042/the-carmelo-anthony-trade-denver-nuggets-new-york-knicks-masai-ujiri-danilo-gallinari):  One can argue that the Melo trade actually set Denver up for even more success than they experienced with Anthony. Two years after the trade, largely behind the play of Danilo Gallinari, the biggest piece they got in return for Anthony, the Nuggets set a franchise record for regular season season wins with 57. They looked as dangerous as any team in the NBA going into April, but disaster struck when Gallo tore his ACL mere weeks before the playoffs. That ended up being the catalyst for the whole thing falling apart. The inevitable rebuild that truly started with the Melo trade came full force the year following Gallinari’s injury."

"OK, but Denver, for example, did hit in the draft on Melo, and that got them 7.5 years of Melo which then got them 6.5 pretty decent years of Wilson Chandler, 5.5 pretty good years of Danilo Gallinari, 2 1st round picks for Timofey Mozgov, the Jamal Murray pick, and the assets and flexibility to trade for Andre Iguodala. And they still have that mindset."
"- Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Timofey Mozgov  - 2014 1st round pick (ultimately traded for Igoudala)  - 2016 pick swap (Jamal Murray)  That is a great haul even with Igoudala trade getting bombed."

Danilo Gallinari
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."

"I was worried we would have to wait until someone from another team joined the Knicks in the seasons after this but obviously the stars have aligned and the NBA gods want this streak to never end.   IT LIVES!!!  Big shoutout to Langston Galloway and either Bobby Portis or Danilo Gallinari. Little do they know they are contributing to NBA history.   Let this be a lesson to everybody out there, the decisions you make now could help shape the future in some obscure way, shape or form."
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Don't forget Danilo ""Mark Eaton"" Gallinari at the back"
DANILO IL CAPO DANILO oooooooooooooooooooooo DANILO GALLINARI VINCE TUTTE LE PARTITE!
"When I think, “I want to watch a bunch of the best players go at each other’s throats for a title,” I often  think of Bobby Portis vs Danilo Gallinari."
&gt;![danilo gallinari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCg6v23buLU)!&lt;
Danilo Gallinari! Vince tutte le partite!
"At times, but I watched him get blown by by Danilo gallinari last game…"
Tbf I'd pass up a wide-open dunk too if \*checks notes\* defensive stalwart Danilo Gallinari was behind me
"Danilo ""Dr. J"" Gallinari"
Oh! A spectacular move by Danilo Gallinari!
"JC is supposed to be that guy that'll be #2 for us, but the beauty of this hawks team is we have plenty of players (Lou Williams, Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter) in our lineup that can heat up and be the #2 on any night.  The game will really be fought and won in the back court though, jrue and Khris is a nice duo and we gotta be ready to answer them if they start going off"
"&gt;“Danilo Gallinari turns over Tucker, hits the three!  Ha. Came here to say ""have a great retirement, enjoy it and try not to bite any hookers"""
"“Danilo Gallinari turns over Tucker, hits the three!”   Now they’re saying it’s August and I’m retired"
"I mean Damian Lillard, Danilo Gallinari, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, there are some decent players on here."
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
Put some respect Kevin Durant is the PG county Danilo Gallinari
"Danilo ""Kevin Durant"" Gallinari"
Danilo “Steph Curry” Gallinari
If you're getting burned by Danilo Gallinari... I have bad news
"Oh man I remember that. In particular, I remember a hilarious missed free throw by Danilo Gallinari that would have allowed the Thunder to win the game with a buzzer beater rather than tie it or only win with a 3."
He should be making Danilo gallinari money but instead he makes Anthony Davis money
One is the Ginger Jordan aka Red Velvet and the other is Danilo Gallinari
The absolute disrespect to Danilo Gallinari.
"Yeah the point of the original comment was that Embiid is a shitty ballhandler and will get abused for that which is true. There was no meaningful improvement, he still got bullied by Danilo gallinari lmao"
"No fault?  None?  Not even for going 0/12 in the second of half of game 4 and losing that? Not for being the first player in playoff history to have 16 turnovers in a two game stretch in game 6/7?   Seriously if he just has 5 turnovers tonight, and doesnt get his POCKET PICKED BY DANILO GALLINARI, maybe the Sixers win in spite of Ben Simmons scoring just 5 points?  To say Embiid has no blame is just foolish. He was good this series. He was not spectacular. He couldnt stop Trae Young from getting lobs or floaters or 3s. He didnt pass or protect the ball well enough. He didnt score well enough with a pretty much fully healthy roster.  Ben may be chiefly to blame but that's a cheap cop out."
"Everyone has blame, welcome to team sports. Also, what game were you watching? A superstar player, whether he's a big or small, doesn't have 8 TOs in a game 7 and expect to win.    A superstar player doesn't get stripped in 1on1 coverage by Danilo Gallinari in clutch time with less than 2 minutes to go in a tight game."
"This is crazy I just looked up the stats for that game and the Timberwolves held Trae Young, Kevin Heuter, Clint Capela, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdonavic, Lou Williams, Oneyeka Okongu, and John Collins to 10 points combined that game.  It's almost like they are two completely different teams and at that time the Hawks did suck."
"Okay fine, Danilo Gallinari is 6'10"" and shoots 87%"
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
I’ve always liked Danilo Gallinari. He’s a good role player when you need him
Noted defensive megastar Danilo Gallinari!! The Italian Gobert in the paint.
"Oh no defensive savant and rim protector Danilo Gallinari. The dude can barely graze the rim on a dunk, and we're supposed to expect that he's gonna be blocking Ben Simmons? He should have just told us the truth, that's even more embarassing"
Maybe Ben was just scared of Danilo “Athletic Freak of Nature” Gallinari
"Danilo ""Dikembe Mutombo"" Gallinari"
Danilo Gallinari led Hawks*
DPOY with no lateral acceleration Danilo Gallinari
Imagine playing 6 games only to get boddied by Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter
Fucking Danilo Gallinari is more confident than Ben Simmons haha  But what a great defensive play  Sixers have to trade Simmons somewhere
bro just just stripped for the L by DANILO GALLINARI????? lmfaoooooooooooo
embiid lost to kevin huerter and danilo gallinari
"""Who do you think you are? I AM!""  -Danilo Gallinari"
Defensive stalwart Danilo Gallinari coming up with the dagger steal
Defensive savant Danilo Gallinari
"""*I did that.*"" - Danilo Gallinari"
Him and Embiid are gonna have a flop party while Seth Curry and Danilo Gallinari care their teams to a tie game
Man...  Danny Manning didn't get there.  Ron Harper didn't get there.  Loy Vaught didn't get there.  Eric Piatkowski didn't get there.  Darius Miles didn't get there.  Quentin Richardson didn't get there.  Elton Brand didn't get there.  Sam Cassell didn't get there.  Blake Griffin didn't get there.  Chris Paul didn't get there.  DeAndre Jordan didn't get there.  Doc Rivers didn't get there.  Danilo Gallinari didn't get there.  Tobias Harris didn't get there.  But we finally got there. WE FINALLY MADE IT.
"As we all expected at the start of the season, Danilo Gallinari may be the one to step up in the playoffs and be the second option for the Hawks that gets them to the conference finals"
Danilo “Randy Orton” Gallinari.
"Here is the whole trade:  - July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  - June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  - June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  - July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  - July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025.

"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
Esteemed rim protector Danilo gallinari? That makes sense then.
"I mean, the whole idea that Simmons ""just"" needs 4 elite shooters around him or whatever to thrive kinda goes out the window if Danilo Gallinari being three feet *behind* him is sufficient to scare him out of the paint."
"I wish Portland would've swung bigger, man. I'd love to see Kyle Anderson and Danilo Gallinari, or either one, with Dame in Portland."
"As a Miami Heat fan, I would redo the 2008 NBA Draft. We had the 2nd overall pick and we picked Michael Beasley who became arguably the worst draft bust in Heat history.  We could have picked Russell Westbrook! Imagine him in the backcourt with a prime Dwyane Wade? Or we could have picked Danilo Gallinari if we really needed a PF.  Alternatively, we could have picked Devin Booker over Justise Winslow in the 2015 NBA Draft! We had the 10th overall pick."
Murray? The guy who dropped 50 in consecutive playoff games? Yeah I think he's better than a guy who's scared to dunk on Danilo Gallinari
Didn't you guys get taken to 6 by the Danilo Gallinari Clippers that year?
"Danilo Gallinari.  He’s always been injury prone but, when he’s healthy, he greatly improves his team’s offense. He was great in OKC (coming after a good season for LAC) with CP3 when everyone thought they were gonna tank and has been very valuable off the bench in Atlanta."
"Gutted their team. Danilo Gallinari, Raymond Felton, Wilson Chandler, Timofey Mozgov, and a pick for a top 15 player entering his prime and a starting point guard. People have become so used to recycling narratives. Those teams weren't great because of Mozgov and Wilson Chandler, and we have the benefit of hindsight to see who those players became, but people STILL recycle this as if most teams in the NBA wouldn't trade that. Like this is a worse package than what any star level player has gone for in the last 5 years, and the trade package isn't what set the knicks back. It was amar'e."

I dunno as i agree with your metric here lad.  Lots of these are not musical at all.  I think Danilo Gallinari might be the most mellifluous NBA name of all time.  Shaquille O'Neal is up there though
"&gt; ""foreign proven talents""  &gt; darko milicic  Darko's pick was more like prospect than a proven player.  Check EuroLeague, EuroCup and domestic leagues stats of Pau Gasol, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Danilo Gallinari, Andrea Bargnani, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender and Alperen Sengun in their season before they were drafted. You should see that Luka and Pau were players that proven their worth in Europe and Bargnani, Bender and Darko were more like hopes as their stats weren't great enough yet."
"None of those players were even close to being stars in their leagues prior to being drafted. The closest thing to a bust that has won a serious individual title in Europe before being drafted is Danilo Gallinari. Even if we take draft and stash players who won those titles after being drafted, as long as they came to the NBA while still being young, they have been succesfull."
Danilo Gallinari has got to be up there
"It’s funny you mention that. I kinda liked the group around Stoudamire at the beginning of that 2010-2011 season: Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Landry Fields.  And then they gutted the roster to get Carmelo"
"Come on man, in practice he doesn't have a monster rim protector like Danilo Gallinari (career average .4 blocks per game) breathing down his neck."
"&gt;Which is exactly why I said ""who got paid like Dennis wants to get paid.""   So why, exactly, did you list two shooting guards when we were talking about point guards?  Because you've no idea what you are talking about, like I said.  &gt;Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton are the ones you mentioned there that 1) actually played 20 years ago, 2) actually were stars. But guess what? Those aren't the guys Dennis Schroeder plays like.  Schroder is not asking to be paid like a star.  $20M, even $25M, is not presently star money.  Gary Harris and Danilo Gallinari are over $20M, as are a whole bunch of other players.  And yes, other than the fact that Schroder is quicker, those are two players similar to how Schroder played for the Lakers last year.  I did not say that Schroder was the caliber of those players.  Consider learning how to read.  Having a similar style is not the same as being as-good.  &gt;Jason Kidd percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('02): 14%   Gary Payton percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('96): 25%   Dennis Schroeder wants more than 20% of the cap.  Again, consider learning to read.  I never even discussed Schroder's salary, or his requests.  That said, in his 9th season, Kidd signed a massive contract with an average value of $17M per, which was around 30 to 40% of the cap each year.  &gt;If you're just saying ""old school point guards"" to mean someone who plays the traditional point guard role then just say that.  I did, and for the third time, consider a remedial reading comprehension class or discontinue wasting my time with your nonsense.  &gt;So let's go through it, let's take out receipts. Here are the Eastern Conference point guards who started the most games for their teams, and you tell me which one Dennis Schroeder is most like in terms of being a traditional point guard and we'll see if they're getting 5 year deals at an average of one fifth of the annual cap if they aren't high volume low efficiency guys:  Again, learn how to read.  I never said that Schroder's contract demand -- whatever it currently is -- is reasonable.  You are arguing red herrings that you completely invented, in order to cover for your embarrassing lack of knowledge and/or accuracy.  &gt;Also, get the fuck out of here with ""Don Buse"" and ""Mo Cheeks."" Sure, if we want to go back 50 years you can talk about ""old school point guards"" then, but that's not what you said.  Again, learn how to read.  If you cannot figure out what the words ""old school"" mean, look them up.  There are dictionaries online, you don't even have to buy one.  &gt;And if you just want to say ""well he would've been better if he played a long time ago!"" Well shit, Thaddeus Young would've dominated in the 50's and 60's!  Again, learn how to read.  And also, educate yourself on basketball history.  Thaddeus Young would not be an extraordinary player in those decades, and if you knew one-hundredth as much as you think you do, you'd know that, and I wouldn't have to tell you.  &gt;So where are these ""old school point guards... who handles and distributes the ball, and guards ferociously to stop the opponent from doing the same... typically didn't shoot much, nor particularly well... were usually small and exceedingly quick, and they were fairly common until around 20 years ago"" at all  For the final time, learn how to read.  Saying something was common until around 20 years ago does not necessarily mean that it was common exactly 20 years ago.  Do yourself a favor.  Delete your reddit account, and go back to grade school."

"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"

The Hawks are better. Would you trade Clint Capela for Maxi Kleber? Dorian Finney-Smith for Danilo Gallinari? Tim Hardaway Jr. for Bogdan Bogdanovich?
The only D we need is Danilo Gallinari
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
"Although yes he requested each trade, the first two it was kind of a formality. The first time, his team had just traded Paul George for Danilo Gallinari and SGA. They were going full rebuild, they were gonna trade him anyway. The next time, the owner was being a huge tool and also wanted the team to trade away salary to avoid the tax."
&gt;but Danilo Gallinari could be an option with Atlanta possibly needing to unload some salary to make room to retain Collins.  So did the NBA cancel bird rights?
*Gallinari. Ben said he thought he would get blocked from behind by famous rim protector Danilo Gallinari.
Simmons in the inside is still shit. He got scared by Danilo Gallinari and Trae fucking Young
"C'mon man, Ben had all world all time all parallel universes defender Danilo Gallinari somewhere on the same court with him. How could he even think to attempt a shot ?  For the record, I like Gallo, but he had no chance of stopping a dunk had Ben tried to dunk it."
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"This mf sounds like he hates his job... the guy earlier  for Italy v Germany was referencing Danilo gallinari playing for the Sea hawks, mentioned it like 3 times Smh... where do they get these people?"

So they're making the knockouts?    Mo Wagner and Danilo Gallinari aren't carrying them to wins over neither Australia or Nigeria
"That’s an easy accept for Portland.   Prime Carmelo (who was younger and easily at the same level as Dame is right now) went for one 1st, one pick swap, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, and Ray Felton"
MVP: Luka because I'm biased  ROTY: Jalen Green  DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo  6MOY: Danilo Gallinari  MIP: Darius Garland  COY: Rick Carlisle
"Amare Stoudemire, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler in NYK were one hell of a team. Team chemistry was nice and shit. I thought they were indeed pretty successful then they traded half of the team for Melo holy shit  &amp;#x200B;  Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell's Bucks was one of my favorite teams in NBA live 2001 lol"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto

Ben Simmons got outplayed by Kevin Huerter and Danilo Gallinari in game 7 and he’s acting like he’s James Harden.

Give Wall that layup and he tries to do a 360 jelly and gets blocked by renowned rim protector Danilo Gallinari
"I get thinking the Warriors win if they were healthy, but why do some people say swept? The Danilo Gallinari Clippers took the Warriors to 6 that year. Why would the Raptors get swept?"
"*Bunch of All NBA defender players like Trae young, Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams."
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"The second best player on the Mavs comes off the bench for the Hawks last year. Who is better John Collins or Kristaps Porzigis. Bogdan or Tim Hardaway Jr. Josh Richardson, or Danilo Gallinari.  I said Assist% as they had virtually identical rates for the past 2 years and you know that. Its not trolling to say luka's the better playmaker, and Trae isn't top 10 its just the truth."
"I like really like Ben and appreciate his defensive intensity.   It's not a matter of being ""well rounded"" offensively. He straight up refuses to develop on one side of the ball. That's why our 6'10 PG was too scared to dunk with Danilo Gallinari 5 feet behind him."
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
Marcus Camby  Kiki Vandeweghe  Ty Lawson  Danilo Gallinari   Kenneth Faried  Andre Miller  Kenyon Martin  Nick Van Exel  I feel like this franchise is perpetually 2-3 years away from being really good.
"They're just generic F positions. When you're playing multiple wings it's semantics who plays which position.  If he can start next to	Danilo Gallinari he can start next to Larry Nance Jr.  3 or 4 doesn't matter, it's just matchup dependent."
Gotta give credit to noted lockdown defender Danilo gallinari too.
"&gt;  &gt; Sources: Ben Simmons tells team brass he no longer wants to be a Sixer and does not intend to report to training camp &gt;  &gt; Keith Pompey August 31, 2021 &gt;  &gt; Ben Simmons let it be known that he wants out. &gt;  &gt; In a meeting with the 76ers last week in Los Angeles, Simmons told team co-managing partner Josh Harris, president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, general manager Elton Brand and coach Doc Rivers that he no longer wants to remain a Sixer, according to multiple sources. &gt;  &gt; Sources said the three-time All-Star also does not intend to report to training camp. &gt;  &gt; For the second time since December, the Sixers are unsuccessfully trying to trade Simmons, whose trade value has diminished. At the beginning of this past season, they tried to send him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for James Harden. The Rockets ultimately traded Harden to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 11. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers are having a tough time finding a team to meet their lofty trade demands. &gt;  &gt; The organization does not want to trade Simmons for less than what it believes is fair market value. The four told Simmons they wanted him to report to the start of training camp on Sept. 28 and be a part of the team. &gt;  &gt; The source said, however, the Sixers’ inability to get fair market value isn’t Simmons’ fault. &gt;  &gt; Another source said there’s no shortage of teams still interested, but the problem is Morey is demanding a king’s ransom. &gt;  &gt; Simmons is fully aware the Sixers can fine him for holding out and failing to show up to training camp. But a source said money will not play a role in the decision-making for Simmons, who has four years and $147 million remaining on his deal. &gt;  &gt; Plus, fining Simmons could strain the Sixers’ relationship with his super agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Paul has a who’s who of clients — players the Sixers might be interested in pursuing down the road in free agency. &gt;  &gt; When asked specifically whether he thought Simmons would come back at all, a source responded “no,” resolutely. &gt;  &gt; None of this should come as a surprise. &gt;  &gt; As The Inquirer noted on July 26, if Simmons really wants out, he could opt to be disruptive or not show up for training camp. The tactic has worked for many elite professional athletes across sports who want to be traded. &gt;  &gt; On Aug. 9, ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins said Simmons is willing to hold out of training camp as long as it takes to get traded. &gt;  &gt; Time will tell if the 25-year-old reports and/or if the team avoids what is bound to be a circus-like atmosphere by trading him in the weeks leading up to camp. &gt;  &gt; The belief around the league is the Sixers have been holding out for six-time All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard to request a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. But Lillard said, “I’m not leaving [Portland] — not right now at least” on Wednesday during an Instagram Live stream. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers’ best consolation could be circling back to the Blazers for a potential deal involving shooting guard CJ McCollum before the start of training camp. That trade would make sense for both teams. &gt;  &gt; In addition to fulfilling needs, the players have similar salaries. Simmons will make $33 million next season, while McCollum will receive $30.8 million. &gt;  &gt; The problem is both teams might think they should get more in return. &gt;  &gt; McCollum, 29, has averaged 18.9 points while shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers in 528 career games with 431 starts. However, the eight-year veteran out of Lehigh is not an All-Star after years of playing in the tough Western Conference. &gt;  &gt; Even still, he could be the best option and a good pickup right before training camp with all things considered. &gt;  &gt; League sources believe the Sixers will have a tough time getting what they perceive as fair market value under the circumstances. &gt;  &gt; “Think about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‘Let’s see what we have to do to get him,’” said a Western Conference executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Now, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams. There’s so much bad blood between him and the team.” &gt;  &gt; The executive said teams are not willing to give in to the Sixers’ steep asking price knowing they have to move Simmons. &gt;  &gt; “The kid said he’s not going back,” the executive said. “I’m not giving you what you’re demanding. They really messed this up.” &gt;  &gt; A source believes the devaluing of Simmons began with Rivers’ postgame comments following the Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals on June 20. &gt;  &gt; That’s when the coach, who has been one of Simmons’ biggest supporters and defenders, was asked by The Inquirer’s David Murphy if the standout is still capable of being a point guard on a championship-caliber team. &gt;  &gt; “I don’t know the answer to that right now,” Rivers responded on a night when Simmons finished with five points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and was sidelined the final 40 seconds of the 103-96 loss. &gt;  &gt; He attempted just four shots, making two. For the fourth straight game, Simmons did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. He played timid, appearing fearful to go to the foul line. &gt;  &gt; That became apparent with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and the Sixers trailing, 88-86. He drove to the basket past Danilo Gallinari, but passed up an open dunk underneath the basket, dishing the ball to Matisse Thybulle, who was fouled by John Collins. Thybulle made one of two free throws. &gt;  &gt; The day after wavering, Rivers did say that Simmons is salvageable. He said the Sixers would put together the right type of offseason workout plan to help correct Simmons’ shooting deficiencies. But a source said Simmons has not participated in a Sixers offseason workout plan. &gt;  &gt; The source believes it will be tough for Simmons to have a working relationship with the team moving forward. At the same time, the team isn’t trying to let their multifaceted player go for little in return. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers would definitely have a lot of holes to fill by getting rid of Simmons. &gt;  &gt; In addition to being the point guard, Simmons is a two-time NBA All-Defensive player, a third-team All-NBA selection, a small-ball center and reserve power forward. &gt;  &gt; Can one envision Simmons returning to the Sixers for two months just to raise his trade value? And with all the heat he’ll likely receive from Sixers fans, he might benefit from a change of scenery."
"They were projected as a 7th/8th seed at best. I remember for an extended period they didn't have anyone averaging over 15 points a game, yet they were one of the best offenses in the league. They didn't even get one all-star nod despite being one of the top teams.  Ty Lawson/Andre Miller/Julyan Stone  Andre Iguodala/Evan Fournier  Danilo Gallinari/Corey Brewer/Jordan Hamilton  Kenneth Faried/Wilson Chandler/Anthony Randolph  Kosta Koufos/JaVale McGee/Timofey Mozgov  No eye popping stars, but the roster was pretty deep and well coached."
"I did valet service in downtown Denver a while ago. Lo and behold,  here comes Gallinari in a big ass Sequoia or 4runner running a red light. My coworker flips him off and he stops right in front of us I guess he didn't see it and tells us he wants to valet his car. Danilo complained to the restaurant since we tried to charge him and then didn't tip us or say goodbye when he left. He just took the car back with no words. Prick"
Maybe Danilo Gallinari idk it’s hard to find good players without any end of season awards
Hawks Defensive Legend Danilo Gallinari
Forgot to mention he got ripped by DPOY candidate Danilo Gallinari in the clutch of game 7
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
"&gt;What dumb logic is this? Smaller dudes are going to be more prone to injuries than the larger guys...  Tell that to Joel Embiid, Danilo Gallinari, and Chandler Parsons.. I'm not sure smaller has much to do with it. Maybe there's a study out there that will prove which it is"
"KNICKS GET: expiring Carmelo Anthony contract (he was going to sign with them in the offseason anyway since he telegraphed that they were the only team he wanted to go to... but he wanted to play for them immediately and New York catered to his wishes)  NUGGETS GET: Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, Raymond Felton, draft picks (including Jamal Murray)."
"Danilo Gallinari, Gordon Hayward, Austin Croshere, Toni Kukoc, Keith Van Horn, Kiki VanDeWeghe, Tom Chambers off my head. If you lower the height to 6'6 we can add a ton of guys, Thunder Dan Majerle and Manu Ginobli being two off the dome."
"Hey now, reputable defensive ace, Danilo gallinari, was closing in on.  Gallo being well known for his chase down and cross the paint blocks.  You as a Knicks fan know his defensive prowess."
Ben thought there was a cardboard cutout of Danilo Gallinari behind him so he sat it out
Lebron about to team up with Danilo Gallinari and start drinking amaro.
Can you post the one where he complains about when Danilo Gallinari came up in there AND LOOKED LIKE THE SECOND COMING OF MICHAEL JORDAN!!!  Would be much appreciated
"The Hawks are ridiculously deep. They have players like Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and Danilo Gallinari off the bench who would get quality/starter mins and usage on some other teams. I’m not even including everyone’s favorite prospect Cam Reddish."
"Doc Rivers was brought into compete for a title with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. He wasn't brought in to draft well and develop late first rounders and second rounders. Clippers had a legit shot at winning it all from 2012-2017 including 2 division titles, 57, 56, 56, 53 and 51 win seasons.  As an executive, he drafted Reggie Bullock at #25 (great pick), and then traded a late second rounder and Bledsoe for a package including JJ Redick who was instrumental in their 50 win seasons.  In 2014, he traded a dissapointing Dudley and a late first rounder to Milwaukee for a second rounder, Carlos Delfino an expiring was waived for cap space and Miroslav Raduljica.  Later, he selected CJ Wilcox at #28, hard to blame him for a #28 pick not panning out.Traded a late first rounder for Jeff Green, who was only 29 and played a big role on their 2016 team. Drafted Brice Johnson at #25 who didn't pan out, again, late first rounders hardly ever do.  In 2018 he traded a late first rounder for Danilo Gallinari who was coming off an all star esque season and would go on to be their best player the following season.  So in the what 8 years that your stat encompases they were competing for a title and werent focusing on developing late first rounders or second rounders, or going through a quick rebuild and contending again with Kawhi/PG, this isn't that surprising IMO."
Danilo Gallinari
On nights he was on he was Myles Powell’s partner in crime in the latters last year at Seton… his 3pt shooting fluctuated over his college career but I think he can come around to about 37-39% from there. To me he can be a prime Danilo Gallinari type player just with better passing
"Fucking love Gallinari, liked him back in the Nuggets days and I'm so glad we got him!    DANILO! GALLINARI! GRANDE CAPO DEL ITALIA!"
"Getting blocked ... by Danilo Gallinari, dark contender for All-Defensive 1st team."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"In a mock offseason recently, I traded Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson for Danilo Gallinari, 2 unprotected 1st round picks, 2 future 1st round pick swaps, and 2 unprotected 2nd round picks and people hated it."
Don't disrespect Danilo Gallinari like that
"Nothing about Dirk was especially athletic looking, but dude could shoot the ball, and if you can do that, you don't have to be super athletic to put together an incredible career.  As a Hawks fan, Danilo Gallinari is one of the most unathletic people I've seen on a basketball court, but much like Dirk (to a much lesser extent), he can shoot, and that's all we need him to do.  On the rare occasion that he drives to the basket, it looks so uncoordinated.  And I'm not sure he actually ever leaves the floor on his ""jump shot."""
"And well known help side defender, Danilo gallinari."
"Yeah, this is silly that it's being argued. Gee, I wonder where Dennis Schröder or Danilo Gallinari is from"
Don't forget dominant off ball rim protector Danilo gallinari roaming around nearby.
"I just don’t get why Trae Young isn’t in when Curry’s in. Like in the 3rd quarter: Not for defense obviously, but Trae elevates the Hawks offense and it was needed to match the momentum of Curry’s 3rd quarter. Instead, Trae and Collins on the bench as the warriors go up 20. Huerter is initiating the offense and had the ball stolen like twice. Makes no sense. Also, is it me or did Danilo Gallinari regress or is being used wrong? Couldn’t post up nor could he shoot. And Hawks fans: who’s better? Deandre hunter or Cam reddish?"
Fun fact: the clippers gave us multiple picks and Danilo gallinari for PG. That alone is great  But they also gave us SGA
"Danilo ""Steph Curry"" Gallinari"
