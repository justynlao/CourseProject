"Who is he pushing out  West starters Steph Curry/Damien Lillard/Leonard/LeBron/Jokic  Backups Donovan Mitchell/Doncic/PG13/AD/Gobert  For the final two spots he needs to beat all but one of Karl Anthony Towns, SGA, De'Aron Fox, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, Ja Morant  On his own team Wall, Wood, and Gordon are all better than him too"
Andre Drummond - Karl Anthony Towns
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
"Let's put it this way. In an era where every team can shoot 3s well. In an era where center like KARL ANTHONY TOWNS of the TIMBERWOLVES; a 7 foot center that can shoot over 40% from 3s over 7 attempts a game.   Then you have this... creature. His name is Coach Bud. His defense scheme is ""allow teams to take open 3s and pray that they miss"". Do you now understand why the bucks can be dog shits right? If yes good. If not then not good. They need to fire coach Bud asap"
"The center position has a smaller pool of people who can play it and is more prone to fluctuations in the pool of nba bound talent.   That's how Deandre Jordan made an all-nba team three times as just a dunker and a rebounder, even though he's never been as skilled as someone like Jokic or Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns"
Karl-Anthony Towns should be an all star
"Yup. The first one happened on his way to the airport for the game. Caused a leg injury iirc, and KAT said he's[ lucky to be alive](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26077573/timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-lucky-alive-accident) following it."
"does life hate Karl Anthony Towns? what the fuck is going on? it's like one thing after another. what's next, someone drops a piano on him? jesus christ leave him tf alone!"

"Anyone think adding the word ""says"" makes this whole thing suspect?   Why doesn't the title read, ""NBA's Karl-Anthony Towns Was Hit By Drunk Driver In Off-Season, Hospitalized."""
Karl Anthony Towns from the timberwolves
"You literally just added the word hospitalized to try to make this more clickbaity..  Here is the unedited title: ""Karl-Anthony Towns reveals he was hit by drunk driver during offseason""   All he is talking about is just talking about how awesome his girlfriend has been throughout this unimaginable year he has had.  The story of him getting hit by a car is interesting, i guess, but this author doesn't give any details, just quotes TMZ and speculates so TMZ probably have more info."
It certainly does seem to be raining shit on ~~Joe Cooper~~ Karl-Anthony Towns right now

"Covid is crazy.  You hear about these 4,000+ dying per day. Or all those people in Karl Anthony-Towns' family dying.  And I don't doubt those are absolutely true.  Covid is a fucking crisis.  It should be treated seriously.  Yet, at the same time, I know 10+ people who tested positive for Covid and were completely asymptomatic.  They only got tested because they were in contact with someone who tested positive but wouldn't have bothered otherwise.  Felt absolutely no symptoms though.  It's really crazy."
Karl Anthony-Towns is a top Top 25 sounds about right. What’s crazy is he has gone from Ironman to perpetually injured. His first three seasons he played all 82 games. His health is my biggest concern. He also just seems mentally checked out.  I don’t think he loves the game and that’s why he beefed with Jimmy Buckets so much. player in the league.
 **Karl Anthony-Towns is a top friendly player in the league**
"People like to trash the knicks, and understandably so, but there is not nearly enough slander dedicated to just how awful the wolves have managed their organization for years now. I genuinely struggle to point out a bright spot on a team that has Karl Anthony towns—it just feels like death and despair permeates throughout the franchise. Like the jets or something"

"Karl Anthony Towns didnt either, so he isn’t a star?"
"I can’t put Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Karl Anthony Towns or Devin Booker above him. His numbers have been better than all of them this season, and he just came off a impressive playoff run, so it’s probably sustainable"
Idk I think Karl Anthony Towns is pretty bold
"The Timberwolves are struggling to play winning basketball without their star player, Karl Anthony Towns"
"Yeah I don't think it is going to end up a bad class. But there was no Anthony Davis, Karl Towns, Zion Williamson... clear #1 pick. For my own sake I hope Ant can be a Donovan Mitchell type one day, but that remains to be seen."
"These stats on their own don’t say much without [watching the shots so here we go](https://go.nba.com/4ynm)  3 7:18 off the offensive board LaVine does a solid job staying in Lukas hip space. Luka also kind of looks gased already and settles here a little   3 4:18 LaVine is fine but the help defense here really makes the play that combined with it being a tough angle for the skip pass in the corner to James Johnson who isn’t exactly Karl Anthony towns from 3 is part of why there is no pass   3 3:38: stays in his hip probably the best defensive clip yet although again Luka kinda pre determined 7 left on the clock he was taking the step back. Still this is solid work   4 5:00 open spot up off a give and go not much to see here   4 2:22 this is pretty uninspired defense but it’s also near the end of a 17 point game so not really gonna care too much   He did his job billy talked about limiting his hip space in that video, LaVine has always been better on ball than off ball he was guarding Kawhi Leonard last week that didn’t go as well did better here. I do think Luka being just exhausted played a big part of all this"
Why were the Grizzlies even allowed to play the Sixers on Saturday? Did the league really determine that no Grizzly should go into protocol? Karl-Anthony Towns played 34 minutes against the Grizzlies while incubating Covid on Wednesday...   There were no Grizzlies in Covid protocol after playing the Timberwolves on Wednesday. Yet now 5+ (?) Sixers are in Covid protocol after playing the Grizzlies? What am I missing here?
"I found the original statement: https://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/1249782924808867842  That would be really bizarre if the media twisted that statement into 7 family members dying (especially since one was a friend).

"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"&gt; “You look at players, like you talk about being personally affected by this, Karl-Anthony Towns. So now all of a sudden Kyrie is at a birthday party, then he steps on the court — if [the video] is recent — but how can Karl-Anthony Towns look at a guy like Kyrie and when I’ve lost my mom and my dad has been sick and I see you at birthday parties, you don’t care about anybody else other than your family, your circle and what you’re trying to do.  He's hit the mark with this. This is a very poor look for Kyrie, of all the weird shit he's done, nothing comes close to this."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"

Karl-Anthony Towns...?
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
Karl Anthony towns. Pretty sure this is one of the more common ones lol
Karl Anthony towns is a better shooter but ok
"Dolla Dame: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Karl Anthony Towns and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go five on five with another basketball team, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add CJ McCollum to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 pointer, at 35 feet out, you got a 13 1/3chance of making, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Dlo KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!  So Karl Anthony towns, you take your 13 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning this basketball game. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at this game. See Karl, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you on the court."
"If you're not including anybody 6'11, and not Dirk, than it's probably Karl Anthony Towns, and it's not even close. He's like Splash Mountain, but splashier."

To be quite honest if I was Boston I wouldn't do either one.   Harden is a cultural cancer and Karl Anthony Towns can't play any defense
is it Karl Anthony-Towns or Karl-Anthony Towns?
He was the Karl-Anthony Towns of the ABA.
"lol Karl Anthony Towns won ROTY not Okafor, try again fam."
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
But they're not the sole creators of the value. If Karl Anthony Towns went to an Israeli team that team wouldn't be making 30 million extra a year.
Best PF in the game behind Dirk in 08-10. Back end of the top 10. Hard to compare to such a guard dominated league today though.  Maybe would compare to someone like Karl Anthony Towns.

"AD has good mix of great games and below standard games against Gobert, historically speaking. Embiid has had some stinkers against the Jazz, and Karl Anthony Towns has given him the business, but that's bound to happen, these are all great offensive players. It's pretty much Jokic since 2019 that has consistently obliterated Gobert every chance he gets."

"I don't hate them, I just find their perpetual ineptitude and incompetence completely hilarious. And I like Karl-Anthony Towns as a player a lot, actually.

"Even though I don't agree, you could argue Karl Anthony Towns is the poster boy for a ""stat stuffer"". Highly efficient shooter, but has been on a bad team throughout his whole career, besides for one year."
"Super random thought of mine at 12:50 in the morning.  OKC should trade for Karl Anthony Towns.  Theyre always in the dark horse conversation, are in a prime position to bounce back into contention, and have a decent cast to work around.  A borderline all star in SGA, future AllNba defensive team player in Dort, decent bench with some veterans, and an above average coach (possibly talking out of my ass as I havent watched many OKC games).  Towns could be a big step in the right direction towards a chip with the big renaissance. Minny is awful, and if they had even a braincell they would want to convert KATs value into something before he walks for nothing.  What do you all think?"

"Karl Anthony Towns played 37 minutes and scored 30 points last night in the most elite basketball league in the world. No one doubts that he did get covid, and some people experience it as a bad cold, which it seems like was his experience. I'm fairly confident that the ""scary"" part of it had more to do with his family members, and less to do with his own illness, since he only missed 13 games due to covid protocols."

"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."
Just a friendly (salty) reminder that Thomas Joseph Thibodeau chose to draft center Justin Patton with Karl Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng under contract (then signed Taj Gibson to a 2/$28m contract less than 2 weeks later) over guys like John Collins and **OG Anunoby**.

Two games where the best defender on him was Karl-Anthony Towns. So yeah trips to the line will happen.

"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Karl Anthony Towns was 3/9 shooting against Embiid for 11 points on a 47% TS. How is that ""making him his bitch"". For comparison Embiid was 3/6 with a TS% around 60 when being guarded by Towns."
The only silver lining about a death in the family is that it usually brings you closer to your other loved ones. I’ll always respect Karl-Anthony Towns for trudging through what he’s been through no matter how much it hurt him.

"I mean rookies are very rarely considered even average players in comparison to the whole NBA. Especially not Anthony Edwards. I don't see the surprise that Wolves are bad when they made him the first option for a big part of the season.   Edwards has the lowest true shooting percentage in the league among guys with such high usage; lower even the infamous chuckers like Russell Westbrook or Andre Drummond. The fun fact is that he doesn't even stand out that much in a team with Rubio, Okogi, McDaniels, Nowell or McLaughlin.  They're a bad team, although they are closer to average when they have Karl-Anthony Towns fit. Either way they will be among worst defences, but with KAT they are closer to average offensively.   Yeah they're tanking, I guess it was not the plan when they'd got Rubio or D'Angelo, but these guys didn't change nothing and it turned out like always."

"As I was reading "" Karl-Anthony Towns’ dad — is in ..... ""    there was a sense of dread."
Saw the words “Karl Anthony towns” and “passed away” and almost passed out
Probably Karl Anthony-Towns.
"I’m not saying that at all. I’m honestly baffled that’s the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn’t fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn’t make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn’t inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team’s *results* would vary from the one he’d hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let’s use your Luka example. Let’s say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren’t hitting the shots that the first team was?"

[Karl-Anthony Towns has now shared the floor more with Ricky Rubio since the All-Star break (96 minutes) than he has with D'Angelo Russell all season (90 minutes).](https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1372029495813795841)  That's just nuts
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"First of all. They are over hyping the young man which is problematic. A ton of rookies drop off after their first year once they are on the scouting report. Second, the Wolves are bad and should feel bad. Their team needs to be sold an retooled with better management. Not saying blown up like the rockets. That was the best possible move they could have done. And I respect the rockets for making the right decision. The wolves are miss managed. Straight up. Literally 4 top 3 players in 10 years. Not a single playoffs to show for it. That’s problematic. I don’t even think they are trying to win. At least other teams have some sort of direction. I don’t think the wolves even had a year of good chemistry. It’s disappointing. I like Karl Anthony towns. I like Ant. But of this franchise keeps failing. I’m not gonna be quite about it.

Rudy Gobert is not better than Karl Anthony Towns lmao. I refuse to accept that people actually believe that 😭

Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.

They can't even fall ass backwards into a Karl Anthony Towns because they're stupid enough to pick Marvin Bagley instead.  Do you realize how incompetent you have to be to have that level of self sabotage?
"Respectfully there is a world of difference between the Wolves situation vs the Pistons. Minn arguably has 4 different players who could go to Detroit and lead your team in scoring (KAT, DLo, Edwards Beasley) and all of them are aged 25 or younger. They also have one of the largest trade assets in the league , a 25yo All-NBA player Karl Anthony Towns, IF they chose to go that route he's worth more than some teams entire rosters.   They certainly need a few more guys who can play D, but they aren't starving for a franchise player with this pick the way Detroit, Houston, Orlando, Cleveland are. Imo the biggest need for them is a full offseason to get healthy and gel with their new coach."

PG13 in danger of this.   Bradley Beal  Jamal Murray   Karl Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons.   Aldridge.    Donavan Mitchell  Draymond who?   Oladipo   Kemba Walker
"Yea I think he’s just playing fast and loose with the rules to get those he feels are most deserving on all the NBA and Defense teams.  I just noticed this in reading it again as I skimmed through it the first time around:  “For example, Embiid is eligible at forward despite playing 99.9 percent of his minutes as the lone big on the floor. Since he is eligible, I would love to put him on the first team to match my MVP ballot. That’d also slide Gobert up to the second team. But I can’t do it because it would mean removing one of my current forward- or guard-eligible selections for a third-team center. Capela, Adebayo, and Karl-Anthony Towns are all worthy of consideration, but there are a number of players I’d select ahead of them.”  I agree with this take. If you move Embiid to forward than one of the two forwards on the 3rd team, PG or Tatum would get bumped for one of the centers he mentioned. I think PG and Tatum are both more worthy of 3rd team than Capela, Bam or KAT.  You see on the All-Defense team he has Bam as a forward too. He essentially has four centers on the two All-Defense teams, five if you consider Draymond a center. I think this makes sense too as centers typically have the biggest defensive impact."

"One of the most efficient high-volume scorers in league history. Here’s a list of every player with multiple seasons of TS% of .62+, usage of 25+ and 1,000+ MP, and how many times they did it:    Kevin Durant — 7   Steph Curry — 6   Adrian Dantley — 5   LeBron James — 3   Giannis Antetokounmpo — 2   Charles Barkley — 2   Amare Stoudemire — 2   Karl-Anthony Towns — 2    That’s the list. In addition to that, there’s only 11 other guys with 1 such season.    Dantley was an amazing individual scorer. Pretty selfish player though, and a lot guys reportedly didn’t like playing with or coaching him. Probably the standard bearer of empty scorers."

"A list of American bigs who can do those things off of the top of my head (active only): Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns, Zion"
"I didn’t really care about Russ leaving. Most of us never really wanted him in the first place. And I’m not making excuses for Beal either. Where in my comment did I say that current Beal is better than peak Westbrook? The reality is that peak Westbrook doesn’t exist anymore, and current Westbrook is a worse player than current Beal. Westbrook’s MVP from 4 years ago means nothing when comparing the two players today. That would be like saying D’Andre Jordan is a better player than Karl Anthony Towns because he has an All-NBA first team appearance from 5 years ago while KAT doesn’t."
"who are realistic targets for a CJ trade that can put you in title contention territory though  maybe karl anthony towns?    I know people are floating tobias harris but I don't think he pushes your ceiling high enough  also a CJ trade just feels like more of that same shuffling the deck chairs.   if you could add someone like KAT without giving up CJ that might give you enough to make the finals, but you have to give up so many assets for it"
"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."
I don’t think KAT wants to [play](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/karl-anthony-towns-tom-thibodeaus-player-development-a-slap-in-the-face/) for Thibs again lol

"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."

Zion is special and the Pelicans got him when everyone wanted him.  The team isn't configured correctly.  Bledsoe and Adams are terrible fits next to Zion and Ingram is far from the ideal running mate.  Lonzo who was the only piece that fit well with Zion has been in trade rumors constantly this season.    I honestly thought Griffin would do better than this.  The fact that they wanted a second round draft pick over appeasing a 15 year vet who they KNOW has a popular podcast is ludicrous and insane.  They proved me wrong on some fronts.  I thought Brandon Ingram was a complete dud. He is now a high volume above average starter who they maxed.  They did a good job recruiting that doctor from the Suns to work on Zion's landing mechanics.    But they need to build faster for a serious top 4 playoff push by next season or they are squandering a generational talent.  That treasure trove of picks needs to be turned into Karl Anthony Towns.  They could even get Myles Turner or anyone who isn't Adams. Stretch Bledsoe - they guy is done and all impact metrics have him as a solid negative contributor.
Karl Anthony Towns would be a great pairing for Luka.

"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
"Nobody calls him Karl-Anthony tho lol but its Karl, Towns or his whole name if you're not going with ""KAT""."
FYI his first name is actually Karl-Anthony then last name Towns.
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."

"It’s a tough question. When the Jimmy saga was happening in MN I had some doubts, but looking back I feel differently. Despite whatever issues Jimmy had with him or the team, only one person in that situation felt compelled to publicly bitch about it (see the [“call Rachel”](https://youtu.be/KwHoVbwII1M) exchange). KAT was cordial and professional the entire time.  I did notice that narrative shifting further after he played through the whole season (or attempted to, had some weeks off due to injury) after having seven close family members die from COVID too. If there was any truth to whatever started the “soft” rumors a while ago, he’s been forced him to grow into a completely different person since then [(and he said as much himself).](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/12/24/karl-anthony-towns-mother-covid/)  As for a winning mentality—who knows? That can only be answered in the negative because he hasn’t won anything yet. But he also hasn’t had the talent around him to do so (besides 2018, his one decent team so far that happened to meet MVP Harden and CP in the first round).  Time will tell I guess, but I watched every Wolves game this year, and there’s a lot to be excited about in the team we saw—and KAT’s play—in the final 15-20 games of the season. Thinking about this more I also have to reiterate how lucky we are to have picked Ant. I feel like KAT will be able to prove that he can seriously lead over the next couple of years, but if that role ultimately isn’t suited for him, that’s okay—Ant’s shown us he can *definitely* be That Guy."
"If Karl-Anthony Towns is on the market then I think Minnesota would say yes to a JB + salary + possible FRP swap.   Unsure if Boston would *necessarily* go for that kind of trade but if you're asking for his value, I think it's about there."
"I also don't think Jaylen is traded. BUT if he was I'd say his value is roughly the same as:   Bradley Beal. Ben Simmons. Karl Anthony Towns. Sabonis. Ingram.    Add picks + players to either side. Again totally hypothetical, assuming any of those players would ever want out, Boston would want to trade Brown, and any of those players would be a good fit."
"Karl-Anthony Towns- 1st Overall   Anthony Edwards- 1st Overall  D’Angelo Russell- 2nd Overall   Ricky Rubio- 5th overall   I wonder which team had the most 1st overall picks, probably Showtime Lakers or a LeBron team"
"* If Karl Anthony Towns could stay healthy, he’d be the same caliber of All-NBA center as Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert. * Gobert is easily a Top 15 player in the league. * Clint Capela is a borderline All-Star and one of the most underrated players in the league. * I’d sooner have De’Aaron Fox or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander than Ben Simmons."
"First off, If a player makes a big jump in their game, that is noise here. Quite frankly, we know which players are going to be one-and-dones by the end of their junior year in high school. Those players would NEVER TOUCH this agreement; they know they're slumming it for a year before being allowed to enter the NBA, the college knows it, they get a stud for one year and goes on.  The chances of a unheralded high school senior managing to become NBA Draft-worthy in one year is virtually impossible...and even if they take two years, if they add an extra year to get their degree or two, they'll likely get better. (In addition to that, I specifically said ""Euroleague"" as the example, so if there IS a player like I just mentioned? *There's nothing stopping a team from drafting him while he's in college and storing him for the NCAAs*- hell, it could make the player and team MORE popular, like how it did with Larry Bird at Indiana State in the 1978-79 season while the Celtics had his rights.)    Second off, the reason it's ideal is because if players are paid by their colleges, it should count as a contract. If a Euroleague player is under contract to their team and can't jump to the NBA until the contract expires, an NCAA player taking payment would be the same thing. Saying otherwise would be bad for everyone: The NCAA for players having contracts they could break on a whim to join the NBA would be precedent for a contracted European player to defect to the NBA immediately...and before you say that's good for your team, it's also precedent in the NBA. If the Timberwolves say ""fine, we'll make a player under NCAA contract break their deal to sign with us and a Euroleague talent break their deal to sign with us"", it's all fun and games until Karl-Anthony Towns says mid-season ""Minnesota sucks, I'm not going to have a chance to win here, I'm breaking my contract with Minnesota to go sign with the Knicks. Don't bother making a trade, I don't even want you to get anything, I'm just leaving and jumping to them in-season."""

Karl Anthony-Towns is another player that I believe will take the league by storm soon.  For a big man, he has such fluid movement on the perimeter. I remember his first game against the Nets this season or last season, he was taking step back threes and hitting them. He's the third best center in the league behind Embid and Jokic.  Also Jayson Taytum is a bad man, but we already know what he brings to the table. He's a young Melo."
"[Classic](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/7/17326080/brad-stevens-celtics-sixers).  &gt; There’s not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He’s undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I’d take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he’s ahead of high lottery picks. I’d take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range. I’d take Stevens over aging stars like Chris Paul and injured ones like DeMarcus Cousins. &gt;  &gt; Obviously, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant would be selected first. And rising stars like Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Simmons would go ahead of Stevens, too. But are you really taking DeMar DeRozan ahead of Stevens? I don’t think so. &gt;  &gt; It’s tough to know where to draw the line, but there’s no doubt Stevens has proved himself to be one of the most valuable commodities in the NBA."
Hi yes I'd like one Karl-Anthony Towns please.

Karl Anthony towns?
"&gt;	The negative reaction from Knicks fans at Barclays Center had to do in part with their lack of familiarity with Porzingis, who played in Spain. After the Timberwolves did as expected and selected Kentucky big man Karl-Anthony Towns with the first overall pick, the Lakers took Ohio State guard D’Angelo Russell before the Sixers snagged Duke forward Jahlil Okafor.  &gt;Watching Okafor taken with the third choice irritated Knicks fans. The selection of Porzingis felt like pouring salt in the wounds, especially with Duke forward Justise Winslow and guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who played in China last season, still available.  https://nypost.com/2015/06/25/why-knicks-fans-at-draft-were-so-upset-with-porzingis-pick/"
"Karl-Anthony Towns for Brown and Time Lord fax it in.   Love KAT and he has an incredible unique skillset, but it’s a wings league and Ant + Brown would be a ton of fun."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

Anthony “karl anthony towns” Davis. That boy soft as hell
"I'd be confident and assured if you took a poll of 100 casual - diehard NBA fans and asked if they knew who KAT was, you would likely see 90+/100 results indicating they know that is Karl Anthony Towns. Conversely, I would go as far as saying no more than 4 or 5/100 would know who in the hell KAI is"
"KAT stands for Karl-Anthony Towns, KAI stands for Kyrie Andrew Irving, don't see what's wrong with that."
Here's my top 5 protected when taking contracts into consideration.  1. Karl Anthony Towns  2. Anthony Edwards  3. D'Angelo Russell  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Malik Beasley
Karl-Anthony Towns and D’Angelo Russell played exactly 21 minutes together in the first half of the season. Of course we were terrible.   In the 24 games they actually played together (with Edwards) we were 13-11.

"Zach arguement for LaMelo:   I've heard from partisans of both Ball and Edwards suggesting the race is a blowout. Nope. Advanced numbers suggest a blowout -- for Ball. Edwards is 12th among 34 rotation rookies in PER, 26th in value over replacement player, and 29th in win shares. Ball is first, second, and ninth, respectively.  Those numbers penalize Edwards for taking tons of shots on a losing team, and hitting them at a poor rate (41% overall, 32.7% on 3s, 48% on 2s) -- and playing the bad defense we expect from rookies. They say Edwards' impressive traditional numbers are empty calories. There is a sound argument that Haliburton should finish No. 2.  But what would happen to basically any rookie working as a pseudo-No. 1 option for the Minnesota freaking Timberwolves without both Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell? That was Edwards' lot early -- when he missed and missed and missed, and his advanced numbers sunk into the abyss.  But alongside real talent, Edwards has exceeded expectations. In 35 games since March 1, he's averaging 23 points on 45% shooting: a semi-respectable (considering how many pull-ups he takes) 34% on 3s, and 53.3% on 2s. The Wolves are 15-19 in that stretch, and 9-7 in their past 16 games. They are a real team, and Edwards is part of that. You can tell he has earned the respect of opponents, because they often assign their best perimeter defenders to him.  Edwards leads all rookies in minutes, with about 800 more than Ball. He may unseat Ball, the presumptive favorite all season, and that would not be some sort of travesty. But Ball has made positive contributions to a team with real stakes since day one. He has been the better shooter, playmaker, and rebounder. His statistical edge in everything but raw points and minutes is overwhelming. Given some baseline threshold of availability, I don't prioritize minutes quite as much in the ""of year"" awards as in MVP. Ball wins here, but it's close. Haliburton is an easy choice at No. 3."
Yes Gordon Hayward is better than Lamelo Ball and Karl Anthony Towns is an awesome player.  What does this have to do with Lamelo vs Ant ?

"It's hard to compare accolades between NBA and international ball, but if we're looking at stats, Sabonis was a 20 and 12 guy for his career, which is basically in line with Karl Anthony-Towns career averages, and it came against weaker competition than Towns and Dame. I think most people would say Dame is definitely better than Towns. If we put them both on equal footing, I'd say Dame eclipses Sabonis considering that generally speaking, the level of competition is definitely inferrior to the NBA, the 3pt line in FIBA is over a foot and a half shorter than the NBA, and guards aren't as long or athletic as in the NBA, making them not as well equipped to defend Dame. Again this is purely speculation, but I don't think there's anyone who would argue that the Spanish league is anywhere close to the NBA in terms of the talent pool."
"Karl Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton (recently), Terry Rozier, Victor Oladipo."
Some organizations just suck at team building. It's not small market vs big market.  New Orleans: Chris Paul Anthony Davis Zion Williamson  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett Kevin Love Karl Anthony Towns  Sacramento: Boogie Cousins  Etc.
Karl Anthony Towns
the karl anthony towns slander is palpable
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
"http://www.fiba.basketball/basketballworldcup/2019/americas-qualifiers/news/karl-anthony-towns-it-would-be-great-to-help-the-dominican-republic-get-to-the-next-level  You are correct though.   Since he hasn't played for the DR national team in main competition after his 17th birthday, he isn't ""locked"" in or anything yet.   But it sounds like he does want to represent his native country on his mom's side when he chooses to play for a national team.  Things could change of course."

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

College Karl Anthony towns and Devin Booker and along with their 8 other NBA draftees is beating Nerlens Noel and MCW and whoever G league players left they had on their roster.
"I think Luka was a way bigger prospect than Fultz/Towns/Irving.  He just didn't get projected first because everyone knew NBA teams weren't gonna take him first.  But Luka was a better player than anyone on this list.  I'd say the ranking goes:  1. Anthony Davis  2. Luka  3. Zion  4. Karl-Anthony Towns  5. Kyrie Irving  Fultz was similar tier to Kyrie tbh, as was Ben Simmons.  Embiid would have been fourth on this list if it weren't for injury concerns."
More people voted for him to be in the all star and all nba teams then Karl Anthony towns
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
"PG: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving (Efficiency is unmatched at guard, 50-40-90 club guys and champions. Ky was National Team MVP before)  SG: James Harden, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker (Need some D)  SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard (I mean....No explanation needed)  PF: LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Paul George  C: Anthony Davis, Karl Antony Towns (So many goods ones not from U.S)"
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"The Dominican Republic had NBA talent with Horford and Villanueva in their primes at one time, Francisco Garcia and Luis Flores, along w  some tough players with experience in the euroleague and could not win shit. Calipari coached that team. They even had a pre-college Karl Anthony Towns (that's why Calipari was coaching, he wanted KAT for Kentucky)Will be the same w Nigeria"
Karl-Anthony Towns regressing to Karl-Anthony Villages
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
I would bet you 8 trillion dollars Karl Anthony Towns does not know that is a thing that exists
Karl Anthony Towns
Minnesota Timberwolves. Their entire future is a player who has no future there. It's only a matter of time before Karl-Anthony Towns leaves.
"They probably can't compete with a healthy Brooklyn/Milwaukee for now but longterm, as long as Atlanta don't overpay Collins + find a way to dump Gallo, they should be straight . With all their pieces, I see them being able to make a consolidation trade in a few years if they time their window right.  There are some young star players around Trae's age that will be reaching unrestricted free agency or pre-agency within 2-3 years.. off my head thinking about Jaylen Brown, Karl Anthony Towns etc"
I don’t think Booker and Melo should be labeled as Latino players especially when they played for Team USA.  Karl Anthony towns is a grey area since he represent Dominican Republic at 16 years old.  Gasol brothers and Ginoboli are proud to represent their country.
"as a Kentucky fan i’m super excited for this   the Karl Anthony Towns and John Walls of the world would still leave, but you’re telling me i could get 4 years of Tyler Ulis?   oh lawd"
The article lists:  1. Zion Williamson 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Karl Anthony Towns 4. De’Aaron Fox 5. Zach Lavine
&gt;You could even up with a player as good as Karl-Anthony Towns  The point is that at this point it seems like they need a player better than Karl-Anthony Towns to actually get anywhere.
but think of the picks you could get back!   You could even up with a player as good as Karl-Anthony Towns
Oh yeah because KAT has played with the best of [them](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Karl-Anthony-Towns/Teammates/39311?filter_games=&amp;nba_games1=&amp;nba_games2=&amp;nba_games4=&amp;nba_games5=&amp;dleague_games1=&amp;dleague_games2=&amp;dleague_games3=&amp;ncaa_games=&amp;international_games=&amp;aau_games=&amp;national_events=&amp;highschool_games=&amp;player_benched=)
"Karl Anthony Towns , joel Embiid or Chris Paul"
&gt;  Booker might’ve been the last young star we see be patient with losing  [I'd add KAT to the list](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/05/23/karl-anthony-towns-i-hope-to-have-a-career-like-kobe-with-one-team/)
Karl Anthony towns was hyped as the next generational big man and then just underwhelmed
I suspect you could go down pretty far down the list if you had a quality big man scorer with a whole bunch of quality (but not superstar) 3-and-D players.  I think Tatum or even a Karl Anthony-Towns could lead this kind of a team to a chip in the right year.
"It's hard for me to say because my opinion is likely clouded as well. If you were to say Ayton for KAT straight up, my heart immediately says ""Fuck that"", but a part of my brain is like ""Are you serious? That Karl Anthony-fuckin-Towns, you have to do that deal"". I honestly have no idea which is right."
"Technically NBA is an initialism. When it forms a word like NASA, or if you shortened Karl Anthony Towns' name for a broadway musical title that's probably gonna get you sued, that's an acronym. When you say the letters like NBA or 'Hey, Hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?' because you've got some out there theories about LeBron's health maintenance regimen, that's an initialism."
"New York was so bad because people didn’t take it seriously and that’s mostly Trumps fault...the government dropped the ball and flthats why it was so bad here in the states..  Just because it’s fine where you are doesn’t mean everything is okay. Again, I’d like you to say this to someone like Karl Anthony Towns who LOST HIS MOTHER..   Would you be okay with your parents dying from a disease...?"
As annoying as Lakers fans are that would be hilarious and well thought out. We joked with a similar idea in the Hawks sub like 2 years ago with Karl Anthony Towns and pretending to be T wolves fans and shit talking him after bad games to get him to force a trade to the Hawks.

"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"My bad, I was wrong about him being from DR. But he does play for the DR's national team, not the US.  &gt; Towns decision to play for the Dominican Republic made him ineligible to join Team USA. Had he been eligible, he could have qualified for the USA's team in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Even so, he doesn't regret his decision to play for his mother's home country.

"Karl Anthony-Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, and Myles Turner were also picked ahead of Booker. However, I think Booker has proven the last 2 years that he is the best player from that draft class."
"the consensus was that he wouldn't be a #1 option because he didn't really get to play that way at Kentucky (despite handling the ball a lot).  Here's an except of his draft profile from [SI:](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/23/nba-draft-player-rankings-big-board-karl-anthony-towns-jahlil-okafor)  &gt; It’s not clear if Booker has any NBA-level skills other than his shooting. At Kentucky, he was surrounded by so much talent that he functioned more as a role player than go-to scorer. Booker should inherit a similar role in the NBA, but a team looking for big-time shot creator right away may be wary of selecting him too high in this draft. Booker’s lack of defensive disruptiveness may be cause for concern. He posted a lower steal rate than every other Kentucky player who averaged at least 11 minutes per game and blocked only 0.3% of opponents’ two-point attempts, according to kenpom.com."
De'Aaron Fox  Zach Lavine  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Bradley Beal  in that order

"This rely on the jazz defensive scheme. They guard these players 1v1 Vs Golbert and that something a few teams do. And a guy like AD is great enough to cook Golbert .  Since 2018 :   Giannis Antetokounmpo averaged 36.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists.   Joel Embiid averaged 25.8 points, 13.6 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Nikola Jokic averaged 24.7 points, 12.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists.   Anthony Davis averaged 24.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks.   Karl-Anthony Towns averaged 23.4 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Zion Williamson averaged 24.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists."
"Karl Anthony Towns will create a super team, but not in Minnesota  I thinks Boston"

"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"oh we gonna ignore the fact that kg said he needed to put more focus and grow a bettwr work ethic, or how jimmy just shitted on him, kats supposed to be the next anthony davis and hes busy playing games and getting blown out.  KARL ANTHONY TOWNS should be a top3 player in the league based on talent, but he'll never be one. Waste of talent and space."
2021 Finals would have been  Lakers:  PG: Ja Morant  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: DeAndre Ayton  vs  Knicks:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Ben Simmons  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Karl Anthony Towns

"How is Karl Anthony Towns on midrange? Someone was telling me recently he was the best shooting center ever. I was shook, but does shoot almost career .40 from 3."
"That’s tough, I’m a big fan of KAT and ant but I’m just not sure I would take them over Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony towns"
"Okay Imma explain it to you Karl-Anthony Towns the all nba player in his prime is better than Roty runner up Anthony Edwards after his rookie season.  Now to the latter part, I am personally confused as to what you meant by ""works hard enough to be elite"". If its about his skills no worries cuz hes up there already and doesn't need to work very much anymore. If its about his will to win all I can give you is a lets agree to disagree."
Karl Anthony Towns... I'm doubtful he'll ever win a title and who knows if he'll ever make the playoffs again. Only time he's ever made the playoffs was when Jimmy was in town and they clashed because it looks like KAT doesn't take winning as seriously. It's bizarre to me how after 6 years he's not yet on the hot seat for not making the postseason more often even with that much talent surrounding him... I know the West is stacked but come on.
"Starters:   Ben Simmons   Kyrie Irving   Brandon Ingram   Zion Williamson   Anthony Davis     Bench:   Ja Morant   Victor Oladipo   Karl Anthony-Towns     I'd consider swapping KAT and Zion in my starting lineup, let Ben start so Morant can avoid injury and be the spark off the bench. Dipo over John Wall for a bit of length and defense."

"&gt;Adrian Dantley is ranked way lower than his counting stats.   Never mind his counting stats -- which are world-class -- he has the 8th highest TS% of all-time.  Among volume scorers, only Artis Gilmore, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Stephen Curry are higher -- two of whom are obviously active, and may not stay ahead of Dantley.  Seasons of 30+ points per game while shooting 55%+ from the field:   Dantley, 4  Abdul-Jabbar, 3  Karl Malone, 1  No one else.  Ever.  &amp;#x200B;  For added fun, they were each teammates of another at some point."
"At this point probably Simmons, another player who is up there is wiggins due to his contract.  Lavine, SGA and Norman Powell are incredibly efficient scorers (although norm struggled in portland). I have Lavine and SGA in my top 20.  Derozan gets left out quite a lot.  Christian Wood is better than Karl-Anthony Towns  Brogdon is better than Sabonis, as is myles turner."

"Antawn Jamison was pretty good. The main reason he's not in the HoF is he always played on crappy teams (other than the Cavs that one year) and didn't see any post season success. So he's just a guy that put up big numbers in the reg season every year.  There are probably worse players than him in the HoF,  like Joe Dumars. But winning teams makes up for talent in some instances. So you can be worse than Antawn and make it. Some players may also be better than him and miss it.   I would say, at this juncture of his career, that Karl Anthony Towns could take the lead in this statement though. For best non-HoF player. But antawn is a good choice for now."
"The creators of that list did a [""4-years-later"" podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-25-best-players-in-the-nba-in-2025/id1513185617?i=1000501914533) in December 2020 where they discuss the old list and make a new one for 2025.  Spoiler warning: the 2025 list is in the description of the pod. It's also posted below:  &gt;! Here's our list for posterity's sake, along with their ages as of Jan. 1, 2025.!&lt;  1. &gt;!Luka Doncic (25)!&lt; 2. &gt;!Trae Young (26)!&lt; 3. &gt;!Giannis Antetokounmpo (30)!&lt; 4. &gt;!Anthony Davis (31)!&lt; 5. &gt;!Zion Williamson (24)!&lt; 6. &gt;!Jayson Tatum (26)!&lt; 7. &gt;!Jamal Murray (27)!&lt; 8. &gt;!Nikola Jokic (29)!&lt; 9. &gt;!LeBron James (40)!&lt; 10. &gt;!Kawhi Leonard (33)!&lt; 11. &gt;!Cade Cunningham (23)!&lt; 12. &gt;!James Wiseman (23)!&lt; 13. &gt;!Karl-Anthony Towns (29)!&lt; 14. &gt;!Devin Booker (28)!&lt; 15. &gt;!Kevin Durant (36)!&lt; 16. &gt;!Joel Embiid (30)!&lt; 17. &gt;!Ben Simmons (28)!&lt; 18. &gt;!Stephen Curry (36)!&lt; 19. &gt;!Bam Adebayo (27)!&lt; 20. &gt;!Jimmy Butler (35)!&lt; 21. &gt;!Michael Porter Jr. (26)!&lt; 22. &gt;!Donovan Mitchell (28)!&lt; 23. &gt;!Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (26)!&lt; 24. &gt;!Damian Lillard (34)!&lt; 25. &gt;!Jaren Jackson Jr. (25) !&lt;"
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"Bruh Karl Anthony Towns get away with being 6ft11 when he looks 6ft8, same spiel"
"Okay?   So because of that you think he will completely change the way he has played basketball his entire teenage and young adult life and will develop a completely new skill set and will be given the reps to put it all together in NBA games?    Sounds absolutely ridiculous to me. I think it’s more likely they develop his set three point shot so teams have to actually guard him from the three point line and he can provide spacing, teaching him how to utilize his ridiculous athletic gifts so he can dominate defensively, teach him to lead the fast break like draymond does and teach him to maybe get closer to 70% from the line and maybe one day even close to 80% if he can make progress    The raptors do have an amazing development staff but they don’t completely change a player lol.   If Kai Jones was drafted by the raptors do you think they could turn him into a scoring center like Karl Anthony towns?  No of course not because that isn’t how he has ever played basketball at a high level so why do you expect Barnes to completely change his game?"

"I honestly get your points and agree somewhat on a lot of them, but this definitely reads like someone that has had to deal with Karl Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins as their franchise stars lol"
My brother played an AAU game during a tournament against Karl Anthony towns in the 7th grade and he was already around 6ft and draining 3s on them
"Don’t waste your time. Free expression of a nuanced viewpoint isn’t acceptable. You must conform to the majority narrative or get down voted.   If I’m a cop and get a call to a house where there’s a tall ass man inside and the gf wants him to leave and he refuses, and then he assaults one of the officers, then yeah it’s within the law to restrain him until he stops resisting. In terms of the number of tasers used and this and that, no one here knows what is acceptable and what isn’t. Let the prosecutor decide whether the cops acted inappropriately. They will release the footage once they have conducted the investigation.   And Karl Anthony Towns shouldn’t publicly speak about it until he has all the facts"
Feel like Karl Anthony Towns is at least top 25.
Highest paid centers in the league today:  1. Rudy Gobert (3x DPOY)  2. Karl-Anthony Towns (2x All-Star)  3. Nikola Jokic (MVP)  4. Joel Embiid (4x All-Star)  5. Jarrett Allen

Karl anthony towns
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
Depends on if he’s considered a superstar…Karl Anthony Towns
Karl Anthony Towns and Karl Kuzma
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
"I would say Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, and John Wall have had decent careers."
"&gt; Led by Luka Doncic, who won the MVP awards in 2023 and 2025, and co-star Karl-Anthony Towns, the Mavericks won the 2024 and 2025 championships over the Nets and Hawks, respectively. Doncic, now considered the best player in the world by a wide majority of pundits, averages 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists in an entertaining MVP race with Hornets superstar LaMelo Ball. The Mavericks look to secure the first threepeat since the 2000-2002 Lakers.  I'll take it."
Who is Karl-Anthony Towns and why does he shoot like a puny player like Steph Curry?
I don't understand why Karl-Anthony Towns is never even discussed in these things. Did he turn down the Olympics?
Karl Anthony Towns is more along the lines of what I thought they'd go after.
Karl Anthony Towns
"&gt;15 - Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, Kristaps Porzingis, D’Angelo Russell, Myles Turner  So KP is a SF here?"
"People always mess up KAT's name; pretty sure it's Karl-Anthony Towns, in which case he'd be under the 5 letter section"
"Thank You Kanye, Very Cool!  -Karl Anthony Towns"
That’ll be one Karl Anthony Towns please
"&gt;we might as well put Demarcus Cousins and Karl Anthony Towns on the same level as David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon, you realize how stupid that is?  Yeah it's stupid because they shoot better, they are quicker, and they are physically more imposing. Demarcus and KAT should be above the Hakeem and David Robinson."
"&gt;Exactly why MJ can't be the greatest if there are several players better and more talented than him  PLEASE explain to me who these players are? With more talented league in general it means that role players are better, not stars. With that logic we might as well put Demarcus Cousins and Karl Anthony Towns on the same level as David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon, you realize how stupid that is?  I get the feeling here that you actually never watched games from back then? Or if you did, dont really understand the different rules and how they made the game look different? Which doesn't say anything about the actual talent level and ability.  &gt;Otherwise all you have are ""he had what it takes to win"" and ""no one dominated like MJ did"" which are vague and subjective statements.  Now you are being disingenuous. My argument is actual basketball skills, basic stats, pace adjusted stats, advanced stats, impact metrics and accolades. Its *you* that come with the subjective arguments here and excuses for why Lebron couldn't reach the same peak. Dont get it twisted."
"Pelicans wildly outperform expectations and Zion finishes 3rd in MVP voting to Jokic and LeBron.  Klay is nowhere close to being his former self and GS underperforms again, leading to a summer of Curry trade rumors before they finally trade all their young guys and multiple unprotected 1st for Karl Anthony-Towns (Wiggins back in Minnesota lol). Warriors - Nets finals in 2023.   Lillard gets traded to the Nuggets after another disappointing playoffs."
"Karl Anthony Towns missed 22 games  Russel missed 30, and Beasley missed 35 games.  They are an underrated team, also edwards probably gets better"
Tell that to Karl Anthony Towns...
Karl-Anthony-Towns-Jr
"Nobody would go into the paint today because he was so physical. They would chicken out.   His elbows sent people to the hospital, and he was 1997s MVP.  Karl Anthony towns has done ….. what, exactly?  …….  Exactly!"
Just being a stickler for details but his name is Karl-Anthony Towns. Not Karl Anthony-Towns.
"I get the impression Karl Anthony Towns is an idiot, but, like most idiots, is completely unaware of this. Me? At least I know I’m an idiot."
"Karl-Anthony Towns  Arguably the best shooting big of all time already with a very diverse offensive game. If he had GOAT level defense he would be a monster.  Edit: I take it back. I think a GOAT needs to be a ball handler/shot creator. While KAT is solid at both, I think GOAT will always be a wing."
"it's Karl-Anthony Towns, he's only 25. You give up the entire farm for him."
"Kuminga + Wiseman + Moody + 3 FRP for Karl Anthony Towns, please?"
"Tomorrow:  In wake of Karl Anthony Towns' release, word has circulated among league sources since Summer League that incoming Minnesota Timberwolves owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez have communicated they are fond of Kings bench malcontent Marvin Bagley. A name to keep an eye on here."
Brandon Ingram Jonathan Isaac Paul George Karl Anthony Towns
"It's a reference to [the other article on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psml8i/stein_toronto_minnesota_cleveland_san_antonio_and/) which said:  ""The Timberwolves could get there with Karl-Anthony Towns, but Philadelphia doesn’t need a center""  without a hint of irony"

"Every player should grow an Afro. It would cause offensive geniuses to have to devise new formulations on the offensive end. Just imagine James Harden with an Afro closing out on a 3 pt shot. DPOY. Karl Anthony Towns with an Afro? Who needs Rudy Gobert when you have Afro KAT. Players need to take a hint at what Jarret Allen is doing. Mfer got that Fro, then the dough, now he’s coming for Mo"
"The ESPN article does say family members: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30451080/timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-says-season-difficult-amid-court-tragedies but either way, losing 7 people close to you in a span of a year or whatever is nuts"
"Fun fact: Karl-Anthony Towns’ career high is 56, two more than Kevin Durant’s (and the Wolves franchise record)."
ESPN (found on wiki): https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30451080/timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-says-season-difficult-amid-court-tragedies
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"Meanwhile, Karl Anthony Towns is saying that people not taking the vaccine is funny. I’m sorry, but even the NBA players can’t find unity on this subject."
Like Karl Anthony Towns. Wonder how this feels for guys like him.
If lebron and AD had their good friend Karl Anthony towns sit out training camp and get fat/out of shape just so he could force his way to the lakers this sub would quite literally explode.
1. Anthony Bennett (no brainer)  2.Derrick Williams drafted 2nd after Kyrie (bust)  3. Wiggins (without a doubt overrated)  4. Dario Saric (He's Euro BIRD!)  5.

"De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony (take note, OP) Towns.  The underrated starting 5."
"So underrated, people don’t even get his name right!  It’s Karl-Anthony Towns, not Karl Anthony-Towns!"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"&gt;Thanks for making my point dude. And we say no to any deal where it’s a straight CJ for Ben swap, or a straight RoCo for Seth swap. 2 FRPs and 3 SRPs are not enough to make the difference. Remove Seth from this deal and it’s a little fairer - but we still don’t do it.  Alright, so, what do you do if Ben sits? Just let Embiid get injured trying to carry and have no help coming in AT ALL? Let 36m just sit there?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I am not being a homer, but if your only argument is “why let 36m sit on the bench because Buddy and Bagley is the only other offer”, then your thinking is flawed. We’ll trade him to Minny for DLo, McDaniels and picks at that point and keep Seth.     1) Sixers already declined a D'Lo deal according to [this source.](https://section215.com/2021/08/30/philadelphia-76ers-minnesota-simmons/)   2) Wolves want to keep D'Lo according to [this source.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/01/report-timberwolves-talking-about-karl-anthony-towns-anthony-edwards-dangelo-russell-ben-simmons-core/)  Either way, the Sixers are in the bad situation."
"Jon K's athletic article includes this:  &gt;As of right now, the Timberwolves do not have a trade package that offers Morey the win-now assets a team in championship mode wants. They are not going to put Karl-Anthony Towns into any type of multi-team deal to try to get the wheels moving and Anthony Edwards remains untouchable as well. Even if the Wolves did include D’Angelo Russell in an offer — and they have talked all summer about building a team with Towns, Edwards *and* Russell around Simmons — it would not appear to be the magic bullet move that Morey needs to part ways with one of the best defensive players in the league … yet.  He acknowledges that the FO indicates it's keeping DLo, but his article makes it feel less firm than KAT/Ant. Hard to tell if that's speculation or the vibe he's getting from the FO. In a round table, he keeps that tune:  &gt;By my estimation, the Wolves are the team that has the greatest desire to add Simmons right now. Just one problem: They are not parting with Towns or Edwards and very much do not want to move Russell, which means they don’t have a great package of win-now players to offer a team that doesn’t want to rebuild, but wants to contend for a title.  in all, I'm not getting a reading of ""untouchable"" for DLo like our fanbase is saying"
"Jay Williams had his NBA career derailed because of a motorcycle accident before the season.  Vladimir Radmanović was reprimanded by the Lakers for a snowboarding accident during the all-star break.  Karl Anthony Towns was hospitalized last summer in the off season after being hit by a drunk driver.  If you think players can only get hurt on the court, you're fooling yourself."
I was obviously referring to judging a players skill based off of one play but I know you know that.   Please show me stats that Ben is inefficient in the paint area bec according to nba.com he scored more points in the paint per game at a higher percentage than Karl Anthony Towns.
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"I mean pick &amp; roll defense is not everything there is. His athletic limitations tend to show up especially in pick &amp; roll defense as well as close outs, which is why he is below average for a center. Essentially being somewhere in that Karl-Anthony Towns or Nikola Vucevic terratory.  What stops him from dipping to that bottom 10 in centers and to that clearly negative value are things like hands, size and positioning. All of this which makes him able to disturb finishing attempts occasionally despite lacking athletic tools for great rim protection. Added bonus is also that his post defense is quite good, which isn't the greatest tool to have, but it's a positive in any case.  I think cherry picking specific action or series and trying to evaluate defense based on that is quite dangerous. Best example of this that I can think of right now would be when KAT stretched Gobert to a breaking point in some of their match ups. And that's the guy with possibly 5 of the top 7 defensive seasons since 2013."
Ben Simmons literally put Karl Anthony Towns in a chokehold to save his man Embiid.  Give him some respect.
"&gt;i srsly wonder, is he actually opposed to playing with his buddy in minnesota because of the location? do you think that would affect how much kat would want him there or no? or is ben worried about what playing together might do to that friendship?

"is karl-anthony towns someone that counts for you? the problem with saying this for giannis is that we never saw him shoot all that much before. add the fact that he isn’t a great free throw shooter while there are plenty of big men that are  it’s far more likely that he invested effort into the things which made him an mvp, and the fact that he was a late bloomer"

"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
"Karl-Anthony towns. People seem pretty “meh” on him now, he’s still up there with jokic and embiid on offense and his defense isn’t as bad as it seems. If he had better perimeter defenders around him and/or the wolves didn’t insist on playing him in drop where he’s a poor decision maker I think his reputation on that end would improve. Meanwhile he scores better than any other big and is a really good passer , just a step below jokic"

"From an article for the Pioneer Press Twolves beat writer: “There would be no sugarcoating on this evening. It was time to identify the problem, the culprits and the solution. It was time for the 20-year-old Edwards to lead. Minnesota has three lethal offensive weapons in Edwards, D’Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns. Those three, Edwards noted, are to blame. ‘We think we the only ones on the team. We got to be willing to pass the ball,’ Edwards said. ‘There’s no ‘I’ in team. We can’t beat five people with three people. We beat five people with five people. We got to be willing to play with our teammates.’”"

Here is an excerpt:  &gt;The 2020-21 season wasn’t all that enjoyable for Karl-Anthony Towns. He showed up at the gym every day and gave it his best effort, but it was void of love or passion. “I think last year I did it for the fans, I did it for my teammates, did it for the organization,” Towns said. “I didn’t do it at all for myself, as something I look forward to every day.”  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;“I’m happy that I got to a point like this where I can smile again on the court,” Towns said. “Find myself enjoying lacing the shoes up.”  God forbid Towns is starting to show passion and actually enjoying his time on the court after arguably one of the toughest years any human can go through.

"Karl-Anthony ""Mike Vick"" Towns"
"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."

Karl-Anthony “Michael Vick” Towns
"He has a greater impact on winning than Karl Anthony-Towns who makes far more money than he does. Greater defensive win shares, better defensive numbers and doesn't have to touch the ball 100 times to have an impact. Fair enough if YOU or others don't think he's a max player who should make $35M a year BUT he's greatly important to Phoenix's title chances and when you look at centers around the league who aren't as good as he is, of course he's going to want some of that they're making. Not something silly like $17M a year. Lose Ayton, you're losing a chance at a title unless you replace him with like Rudy Gobert. Gobert, btw, a perfect comp to Ayton statistically although Gobert is better defensively (not a slight on Ayton there that's just how good Gobert is)"

But “The Greek Freak’’ has no ties to New York other than bad thoughts about brother, Thanasis, not being treated well while with the Knicks organization.   &gt;   &gt;The Knicks were actually ahead of the curve on acquiring Giannis’ brother. They drafted Thanasis No. 51 in 2014. Surprising even his own agent, Thanasis signed to play for New York’s minor-league affiliate for rather than signing overseas for a far higher salary. However, the Knicks fired their minor-league coaches after the season, reportedly due to unhappiness with Thanasis’ development. The parent club signed Thanasis in 2015 but gave him just a small guarantee. He didn’t make the regular-season roster, New York leaving an open spot. The Knicks signed him to a 10-day contract later in the season.

If kyrie goes to Minnesota we're gonna have a great Netflix murder documentary about the former star Karl Anthony Towns
"Maybe, maybe not.   When Russ shoots away from the rim, people (rightly) give him crap because he's a shitty shooter. In the playoffs, defenses *beg him* to take midrange and three point shots.   I don't know if Simmons is capable of learning to shoot or not. I 💯 agree he should have tried. His failure to take shits, especially in the regular season, is pathetic and makes him not a good team player.   But unless he miraculously turned into a *good* shooter, him taking shots isn't going to fix the fit problem. He can only maximize his talents, such as they are, in that Westbrook or Giannis role of pushing the ball, going to the rim, and being surrounded by shooters. That isn't going to happen in Philly; not should it.   He is a bad fit on the Sixers. I don't understand why the team is allowed to acknowledge that and fans and commentators are allowed to acknowledge that, but Simmons isn't.   He would be a better fit on a team that was built around him and his unique skill set and deficiencies. If he can get himself traded to a team with a shooting center like Karl Anthony Towns or a team that rebuilds around him, he'll have a better chance to maximize the player he can be. It would be stupid for him not to push for that.   If it works out, we'll all forget we were mad at him about forcing a trade, just like we forgave Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving and even Vince fucking Carter. If it doesn't; then we will continue to shit all over him."

Did you just say Tim Duncan was a more skilled scorer than Karl-Anthony Towns?
"Every now and then I see a post or a highlight or something and remember, holy shit, Karl-Anthony Towns exists! I genuinely forget he's in the league every year. I guess playing for the Timberwolves doesn't really help."
"Each of my comments has referenced a very specific paragraph in said article which begs the question: did you read the article?  *The conventional wisdom around the league has been that Simmons would be a natural fit with Karl-Anthony Towns. In any trade for Simmons, the Wolves would also consider Anthony Edwards to be completely untouchable.*"
"Yeah and New Orleans has had 3 of them (Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, and now Zion). It’s by far the easiest. Minnesota (Karl Anthony Towns and Kevin Garnett), Orlando (Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard), etc all agree.  Getting that player is easy. Putting a championship roster around them is hard."
"KAT? As in Karl Anthony Towns?   Since you had time to make this post, go spend 5 minutes on youtube and actually watch bird play instead of trying to compare efficiency stats for guys who played 40 years apart."
"This bit is from the part about ben simmons side pick and rolls:  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout."
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."

"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"So I went and looked at current MVP odds to see who was furthest down the list that I could actually see winning. My answer is Karl Anthony-Towns at 100-1.  My thinking:  1) He’s already established that he can put up the requisite numbers.  2) Because of his heartbreaking real-life tragedies, there’s an easy narrative for him.  3) There’s a non-zero chance the Wolves aren’t terrible. I don’t THINK they’ll be good but the West is in flux at the moment, they’ve got young talent and if they get better injury luck than they’ve had recently, Edwards makes a second year leap and they step up a little on defense, I could see them being surprisingly good.  I’m not predicting this, but if you’re looking for a real Dark Horse who isn’t one of the same 3 guys that are always mentioned whenever this question is asked, that’s my answer."

"&gt;Of the known teams with interest, Sacramento could theoretically provide Simmons with the offensive environment he seeks, with a group of dynamic guards and a fast-paced system. Minnesota could flank Simmons with an All-Star big man, though unlike Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns feasts from the perimeter as an elite shooter.  If Simmons prefers Sac to Minnesota, he is a fucking idiot."
"From a [SI](https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/09/27/karl-anthony-towns-covid-19-daily-cover) article a couple days ago, Towns reportedly lost 50lbs during his bout with COVID."

If you want to see Karl Anthony Towns in a sailor uniform just say so.
You're sure you're not mistaking for Karl-Anthony Towns?
"**Should be locks:**   Paul George  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Trae Young  Karl-Anthony Towns  **I Would Take:**  Chris Paul   Rudy Gobert  Bradley Beal   &amp;#x200B;  Zion, Mitchell, Booker, Lavine all have strong arguments over those 3 at the end. I think Middleton, Bam, and Westbrook are comfortably the bottom 3 for me. They are great players, but I wouldn't actually want any of those guys as my best player if I'm trying to make the playoffs - and with Bam and Westbrook they have definite flaws that can be exploited."
I'll give you a hint: his name rhymes with Karl-Anthony Towns
I really want Karl Anthony Towns to go and punch Kyrie in the face for his stupidity. People lost so many friends and family to Covid. Stop being a contrarian for no reason and get the vaccine. Literally everyone else has got and we’re all Doing fine. All like 150mn in the US (not to mention elsewhere globally).  The vaccine doesn’t hurt you. Get your fucking vaccine so you can keep everyone safe.
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
Zion is the new Karl-Anthony Towns. Complete one-way player
Karl-Anthony Towns might give Wiggins the hardest foul of his career if Wigs is allowed to play.
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts.

Karl-Anthony Towns should file a lawsuit against you for this disrespect lmao.
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"

Agreed. AD is def chicken an egg situation. I can’t think of anyone with really bad posture who is in the nba. Towards the latter part of Kobe’s career his posture became worse and worse. The only active player I know right now who kind of looks like he has bad posture is Cameron Payne. He’s been injured quite a few times already. Usually players with bad posture don’t stay around the league for a long time. Karl Anthony Towns is another player who has pretty bad neck posture possibly from sitting down and gaming a lot. He has he some injuries as well. I don’t expect players with bad posture to be able to stick around for a long time.

"""KARL ANTHONY TOWNS""... before every Wigs shot - Steph, probably."
"That karl anthony towns is a bad defender. He's really pretty decent, especially on the wing. Hes not incredible, but he's not Kanter down there. especially this season he's been solid"
"&gt;For Minnesota, having floor-spacers so guys like Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell have room to operate is important.  That trade makes no sense. Beasley is already a floor spacer. The trade doesn't even save the Wolves any money. Kennard is getting paid a similar amount for an extra year."
"I really need to take full account of my life. Because if Karl Anthony ""how do i put my arms straight up in the air again?"" Towns is playing defense.  We are certainly nearing the end of days.  This is the basketball equivalent of a UFO sighting.  Minnesota actually playing great defense lately.  Never thought I'd see the day."
Karl Anthony towns is the only guy I see having an interesting shot. He needs like 10k over the rest of his career. He’s put up 1000 rebound seasons in the past. He’s only 27 so if he plays into his late 30s he might have a shot if he stays healthy. But it’s very unlikely

"Thought he was injured once in the 6 games since Miami. Ok, so he’s 1-2 against the Wolves in Miami, when he had the better team in all three match ups.   Also, it is personal for Jimmy. As he didn’t go after KAT like that in the previous matchups.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/5/8/22426221/jimmy-butler-karl-anthony-towns-trash-talk-heat-wolves-video  &gt;As the Miami Heat faced the Wolves on Friday night, Butler started talking trash to Towns at the end of the game. It got ugly pretty quick.   &gt;As microphones picked up the conversation, Butler called Towns “a loser.” He said “I already punked you once.” Butler also said Towns was “soft as baby sh*t.” Towns appeared to tell Butler to “call Rachel Nichols” as a response.  There was no indication of trash talking prior to the end of the game, when Miami had it in hand.   Just saying I think Jimmy does care very much about punking KAT."
"Right, like I almost never hear shit about what, I don’t know, De’Aron Fox or Karl Anthony Towns are up to but I’m fully caught up on the THT saga"
"Not one of them played that game, but I know reading comprehension probably isn’t your strong suit. Notice how you’re not even remotely making any kind of coherent argument past “grown men,” despite the fact that it is fucking unarguable the Suns team they put out on the floor when Booker dropped 70 was both extremely young for NBA standards and extremely bad.   No, I cannot respect 20 year old versions of Marquesse Chriss and Dragan Bender over 19 year old Karl Anthony-Towns, but maybe that’s because I actually watched them play and understand what I’m watching"
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"

Of the 98 3-man units in the NBA who have shared the floor for 250+ minutes, that Wolves trio ranks 8th.”"
"KAT is literally Karl-Anthony Towns... Just saying. For some mega popular players maybe it's ok to use their initials, but man I've been following the NBA since I was a kid and I haven't missed a single season, but sometimes I can't for my life figure out who tf they're referring to in a game!"
"Lol the Stein article came out a few months ago that said ""The Timberwolves could get there with Karl-Anthony Towns, but Philadelphia doesn’t need a center and Minnesota has made Towns and promising second-year swingman Anthony Edwards unavailable in trade talks anyway.""  Like Philly not needing a center would hold them back from making that trade lmao"

Karl-Anthony Towns is Karl-Anthony Towns. But a mystery draft pick can be anyone. It can even be Karl-Anthony Towns!
"&gt; the rookie wall is a thing  It's a thing that affects some rookies, and others start slow and get accustomed to the game as the season goes.  For example, Karl Anthony Towns came out of the gate blasting, but as the season went on he got even better"
"&gt; top 25 player  In my perspective, a Top 25-30 player are players who are good enough to be the #1 option of any team so in my eyes a Top 30 player is someone more or less of a shooter. Think Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis etc. I don't think Dray scores enough to warrant him a Top 30 seal but okay.  Dray is in the 31-40 range coz he is a stellar 2nd most important player on the team guy."

"I dont think being all NBA is that big of an accomplishment during those years, there was no other big men worthy of those awards. His contemporaries around that time were Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Karl Anthony-Towns. Not exactly other future first ballot hall of famers. Getting voted to the all star game is the same thing, who cares about the center all star spot, his competition at the time was Rudy Gobert, someones whose entire future legacy will be based around covid.  Statistical leader doesnt mean anything either, Chris Kaman was a 20/10 player not to long ago, stats are easy on non-playoff teams.  Also I never said he was a bad player, only that his accomplishments rang really hollow because NO sucked, and the one time he did do something in the playoffs, it was off the back of Jrue playing at an incredible level."

Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut.

"No, no, no--to compare *what actually happened* requires *no assumptions*. We have statistics and video of players from the past; we have statistics and video of players playing now. That's empirical and requires no hypotheticals, no imaginaries, no what ifs. We can simply evaluate--by direct observation--how the players compare at the game of basketball.  And it also requires no claims about ""humans improving as time moves foreward.""  Now, if I were making claims about who *could* be better at basketball under hypothetical circumstances, this would all be out the window. But I'm not, and I wouldn't. If I were making claims about something like ""greatness"" as separable from actual, observable, empirical performance in games that have actually happened, that would also change things. But again, I'm not.  If we want to compare people's performance across time, the only way that doesn't involve a bunch of what ifs is to compare the actual events that occurred. Watch film on Bob Cousy or Alex English or Tom Chambers or whoever. Then watch players today. If you think players from, say, the 70s or 80s or 90s were *in general and on average* better than non-star players now, make that argument, present evidence, and it can be discussed. I don't think that's a winning stance, myself, but at least it's evaluable, unlike claims that require me to imagine George Mikan with Karl-Anthony Towns' training, nutrition, and coaching history."
